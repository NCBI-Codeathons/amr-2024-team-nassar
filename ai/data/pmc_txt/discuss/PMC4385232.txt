Discussion Comparison with other foam-free cultivation systems and aerobic fermentation with foam fractionation The aim of the current study was to introduce a new approach for a foam-free biosurfactant production process. The results shown in Figure 3 and Table 1 demonstrate a high efficiency for anaerobic cultivations with low glucose concentrations. There are only three other fermentation processes described for the foam-free production of Surfactin. The solid state fermentation analyzed by Ohno et al. is incomparable with aqueous fermentations (Ohno et al. 1995), hence these data are not further discussed in comparison to the current study. However, Chtioui et al. established a rotating disc bioreactor allowing air flow only above the liquid phase. The growth of a Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 biofilm led to the production of Surfactin and Fengycin (Chtioui et al. 2012). Chtioui et al. provided several results about product yields and substrate utilization. On basis of these findings further process parameters were calculated (see Table 2) to achieve a more complete comparison with the results of the current study (Table 2). Coutte et al. introduced a novel membrane bioreactor for the production of biosurfactants (Coutte et al. 2010). The data of the Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 cultivation were also used for the calculation of additional process parameters (Table 2). Therefore, Table 2 compares the data of three different foam-free fermentation processes for the production of Surfactin. To outline the differences between these methods and a traditional aerobic cultivation for the production of Surfactin, these results are additionally collated with a fermentation process applying foam fractionation (Willenbacher et al. 2014).Table 2

Comparison of different foam-free Surfactin production processes regarding their process parameters and collation with a fermentation process applying foam fractionation [2]. The processes of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. each yielded above 0.2 g/L Surfactin. Whereas only 0.087 g/L Surfactin were reached in the current study (with 2.5 g/L glucose in mineral salt medium). However, the fermentations of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. lasted comparatively longer (72 h instead of 55 h). Aerobic fermentations with Bacillus subtilis using foam fractionation take much shorter time (30 h) and yield much higher concentrations in foam (3.995 g/L). Values for YX/S differ only slightly between the foam-free processes (0.120 g/g – 0.189 g/g), but are relatively low compared to cultivations applying foam fractionation (0.268 g/g). The results for volumetric production rates are very similar, too, between the foam-free fermentations (0.002 g/(L∙h) – 0.003 g/(L∙h)). The foam fractionation fermentation reached a much higher value for vol. qSurfactin in comparison (0.018 g/(L∙h)). The product yield in contrast to substrate utilization is given by the parameter YP/S. The values for cultivations of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. are both 0.013 g/g. The current study reached a much higher value of 0.033 g/g for YP/S. However, fermentations employing foam fractionation still yield higher YP/S values (0.052 g/g). The specific production rate qSurfactin is five-times higher in anaerobic fermentations using 2.5 g/L glucose (0.005 g/(g∙h)) in comparison to other foam-free fermentations (0.001 g/(g∙h)). Aerobic processes applying foam fractionation yield rather similar results for qSurfactin (0.006 g(g∙h)). Most surprising are the results for YP/X. Fermentations of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. reached 0.068 g/g and 0.078 g/g, respectively. In contrast, anaerobic fermentations of the current study employing 2.5 g/L glucose yielded 0.278 g/g. These findings surpass even YP/X values of aerobic fermentations employing foam fractionation (0.192 g/g). Interestingly, the results of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. show very similar values for efficiency, product yields and substrate utilization although completely different fermentation approaches were applied. This similarity was revealed only after calculating some additional process parameters from the original data of these publications (Table 2). While rotating disc bioreactors or membrane reactors seem very attractive alternatives to common foam fractionation processes the presented data in Table 2 expose their low yields in comparison to the results of a classic foam fractionation process. The comparison of the results of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. with data of the current study displays a much higher effectiveness of the anaerobic fermentation approach. Although overall less Surfactin was produced, much more Surfactin was produced per CDW. This implies that the bacterial growth is probably lower compared to the rotating discs or membrane bioreactors, but single cells produce more Surfactin under completely anaerobic conditions. These findings explain the much higher values for YP/X, YP/S and qSurfactin. In comparison to an aerobic fermentation process with foam fractionation some process parameters are lower (e.g., vol. qSurfactin and YX/S), but values for YP/S and qSurfactin are at the same level. Most important is the much higher value for YP/X under anaerobic conditions. This implies a much better production of Surfactin per CDW not only in comparison to other foam-free processes, but even in comparison to aerobic foam fractionation processes. The current study demonstrates a new approach to produce Surfactin without any foam formation. Moreover, anaerobic cultivation and foam-free biosurfactant production are combined in one process for the first time. The anaerobic production of Surfactin was shown before, but never analyzed for product yields and substrate utilization. The comparison of different fermentations with various glucose concentrations displayed great efficiency for processes applying low glucose concentrations. Furthermore, the confrontation with other foam-free processes revealed a much higher effectiveness of the anaerobic fermentation process of the current study.
