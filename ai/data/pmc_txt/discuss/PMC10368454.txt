Discussion Our results demonstrate that the kinase BsfK specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of the Ser3 residue in BsfA, while BsfB1 performs dual functions to accelerate the post-translational phosphorylation and to assist BsfB2 in leader peptide removal. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the penultimate residue in the leader peptide is isoleucine rather than the conserved threonine in all other so far investigated lasso peptide precursors. This Ile(-2) residue has a profound effect on the monophosphorylation of Ser3 and leader peptide removal, both of which are decreased in Ile(-2) substitution variants. The presence of a penultimate Ile/Val residue was also observed in putative lasso peptide precursors from Acidobacteriaceae and Sphingomonadales. PadeB2 from Paenibacillus dendritiformis C454, ThcoB2 from Thermobacillus composti KWC4, BaceB2 from Bacillus cereus VD115, PapoB2 from Paenibacillus polymyxa CR1, SyanB2 from Sphingobium yanoikuyae ATCC 51230 and PsmB2 from Bacillus pseudomycoides DSM 12442 are the only B2 proteins reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of phosphorylated lasso peptides (Zhu et al., 2016b,c; Zyubko et al., 2019). Phylogenetically, B2 proteins from Ile/Val(-2) residue containing BGCs fall into clades close to the PadeB2 group but far from other reported B2 proteins (Supplementary Figure S19). Considering that all the Ile/Val(-2) residue containing lasso peptide BGCs unveiled by us also encode a kinase or phosphotransferase, we hypothesize that these B2 proteins and the PadeB2 group stem from a common ancestor. The coorperation of lasso peptide B1 and B2 proteins is well known for leader peptide removal (Zhu et al., 2016a; Hegemann et al., 2018; DiCaprio et al., 2019; Koos and Link, 2019), which was also attested by our in vitro characterization of BsfB1 and BsfB2. In addition, the enhancement of phosphorylation in the presence of BsfB1 is probably owed to the recruitment with BsfK for leader peptide dependent PTM. Since only a few macrolactam synthetases have been characterized in vitro (Duquesne et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015; DiCaprio et al., 2019; Koos and Link, 2019), and there is no evidence for the function and timing of BsfN, further studies on these enzymes are currently underway in our laboratory.
