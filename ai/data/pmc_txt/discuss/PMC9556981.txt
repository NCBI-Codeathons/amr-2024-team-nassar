Discussion Continued multidisciplinary investigation of myxobacteria will help reveal how bacterial predators influence microbial community structure, enable continued discovery of therapeutic specialized metabolites, and inform soil health studies to improve agricultural outcomes. Determining roles of specialized metabolites during predation could improve prioritization of myxobacteria targeted for therapeutic discovery. Investigating the influence of predatory specialization on BGC evolution may inform synthetic biology approaches to refactor and utilize myxobacterial BGCs. Further study of pan-genome plasticity and any association with predation could reveal genetic determinants for predatory performance and prey range. Better understanding of predatory performance of lesser-studied myxobacteria abundant in soil, sediment, and plant rhizosphere may benefit application of myxobacteria as biocontrol agents. Ultimately, the potential advancement of any discussed concept or challenge provides compelling support for continued investigation of myxobacteria as generalist predators.
