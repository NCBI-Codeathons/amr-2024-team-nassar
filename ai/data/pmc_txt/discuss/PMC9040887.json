["DISCUSSION", "Phylogenetic characterization of the HTH_42 superfamily proteins within Streptomyces reveals two distinct subfamilies, YQL and AZL (the latter of which contains the AZL2 clade). Most strikingly, AZL genes, which are most prevalent in environmental microbes such as those from the phylum Actinobacteria (Fig.\u00a0S1B), are highly enriched in BGCs. We found AZL proteins in BGCs that produce a variety of verified and putative genotoxins, with approximately one-fifth of all AZL proteins located in BGCs predicted to produce a DNA alkylating agent. We show that the AZL protein, HedH4, within the HED cluster specifically excises HED-DNA adducts and improves viability of cells grown in the presence of the compound. In a separate study, we recently found that the two paralogs present in TXN and LLD clusters (TxnU2, TxnU4, LldU1, and LldU5) are self-resistance glycosylases for these compounds (56). Thus, together with the previous example from the AZB BGC (28, 31), there is now mounting evidence that AZL family genes have evolved largely as DNA repair self-resistance proteins against a variety of natural products. Consistent with their role in resistance, the AZL genes found inside BGCs frequently localize around a variety of other resistance genes. Moreover, the relatively high copy number and low sequence conservation of AZL proteins are consistent with increased expression or possible horizontal gene transfer events that enable these enzymes to evolve specificity for a particular natural product (57). We also found AZL homologs in BGCs that by homology were not expected to produce DNA alkylators or other genotoxins. The AZL proteins in these clusters could have regulatory or protective roles outside DNA repair. Alternatively, these clusters could have additional uncharacterized enzymes such as cytochrome P450s, sulfate adenyltransferases, or epoxidases that could convert the natural products into DNA alkylators (58).", "The fate of the AP sites generated by AZL enzymes is a key unanswered question regarding glycosylase-mediated self-resistance in antibiotic bacteria. While the DNA adducts of AZB and HED natural products would likely pose significant blocks to replication and transcription, their excision by AZL glycosylases also generates AP sites, which are highly toxic base excision repair intermediates (59, 60). Although the modest protection we observed from HedH4 overexpression in HED-challenged E. coli could be a result of the weak-expression promoter used, it also suggests that either the AP sites generated are poor substrates for the AP endonucleases present in E. coli or that HED-DNA adducts are substrates for an alternative repair pathway. The intercalated HED-DNA adduct likely poses a unique challenge relative to other glycosylase substrates. It is likely that the HedH4-generated HED-guanine moiety remains intercalated at the AP site and requires a specialized AP endonuclease for repair. Indeed, we recently found that the excised guanine adduct of the related, intercalating natural product TXNA is a poor substrate for E. coli EndoIV (56). More pertinent to HED biosynthesis, the producing organism S. griseoruber contains two copies each of ExoIII- and EndoIV-like AP endonucleases that may have evolved to incise HED AP sites, although none are located in the hed BGC. In addition, the bulky HED-DNA adduct lesions are likely substrates for the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which is initiated by UvrA in bacteria and has been shown to play an important role in natural product self-resistance (25, 54, 61\u201363). Indeed, within the HED BGC there is a predicted UvrA-like drug resistance protein (HedH11) that contains a partial UvrA DNA-binding domain and a conserved ABC transporter domain that could initiate NER of HED-guanosine adducts or even HED-guanine/AP-site products generated by HedH4. There are also two additional putative UvrA homologs outside the hed cluster. Additionally, there are three putative transporters within the cluster, HedH7 (ABC2 type), HedH6 (DrrA-like), and HedH1 (EmrB/QacA antiporter), which could serve to physically bind to HED and direct it out of the cell through a transmembrane transport system.", "In contrast to the genotoxin-specific AZL genes, YQL and AZL2 are always found outside clusters and, thus, are likely to provide a more general role in protecting the genome against environmental genotoxins, similar to that shown for E. coli YcaQ (31). YQL proteins and their gene neighborhoods are very highly conserved, suggesting they play a critical role as part of a unified pathway (64). Although that pathway is unknown, the presence of a two-component transcription factor/kinase and ComF DNA helicase within the YQL neighborhood in Streptomyces also hints at a signaling network for DNA uptake (65\u201367). Similarly, E. coli YcaQ is localized in a four-gene operon involved in cell wall biosynthesis and transformation competence (31). Continued exploration of the gene neighborhoods of YQL and AZL beyond Streptomyces will reveal a deeper understanding of the cellular roles played by these enzymes. This will be especially important for YQL, which are prevalent in human pathogens or commensal microbes (28).", "A small subset of HTH_42 proteins contain additional domains often associated with nucleic acid transactions (Fig.\u00a0S1A) (28). These multimodular HTH_42 proteins have been relatively understudied, although they do not appear to be associated with BGCs. Most contain an associated DEAD box helicase domain, including Lhr, a member of the helicase superfamily II (68). Mycobacterium smegmatis and E. coli Lhr have been characterized as ATP-dependent 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 single-stranded DNA translocases with the ability to unwind RNA-DNA hybrids (69, 70). Studies in Mycobacterium tuberculosis have demonstrated a strong transcriptional activation of lhr in cells exposed to MMC (71), suggesting that Lhr functions as an RNA-DNA helicase in response to MMC-DNA cross-links. While the structure of the C-terminal HTH_42 domain of M. smegmatis Lhr is similar to that of AlkZ, it lacks the catalytic Q\u03a6Q motif and adopts a tetrameric structure that occludes the putative DNA binding surface (70). Thus, the function of the Lhr HTH_42 domain and its interplay with the helicase core remains to be determined.", "Resistance genome mining has emerged as a critical bioinformatically driven pipeline to discover novel natural products and gene clusters in several organisms (72, 73). A key benefit of resistance genome mining is the dramatically decreased candidate pool as a result of targeted identification of gene clusters containing a resistance gene. Generally, these methods require a basic understanding of the resistance mechanisms involved. We sought to use this approach for the first time to hunt for BGCs that produce alkylating genotoxins, using prior knowledge of the DNA repair functions of S. sahachiroi AlkZ within the AZB cluster (28, 30, 31). In this study, we examined 435 Streptomyces species for BGCs within which an AlkZ-related gene was located and found 68 uncharacterized clusters that are candidates for targeted elucidation of their products. Characterization of these orphan clusters could provide new analogs or types of DNA alkylating/damaging secondary metabolites, an important step in developing new antitumor or antibiotic treatments. This classification of YQL/AZL proteins in Streptomyces is an important first step in understanding their evolutionary connection to each other and to BGCs of different types and demonstrates that targeted resistance genome mining is a viable approach to discover novel genotoxins and resistance mechanisms from uncharacterized BGCs."]
