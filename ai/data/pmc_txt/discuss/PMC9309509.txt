Results and Discussion Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Proteomining We first used S. coelicolor A3(2) as a benchmark due to its well-documented expression of BGCs that allowed for clear identification of the clusters. The mycelia harvested at 96 h were designated as the nutrient-starved phase which was indicated by the red pigmentation. The mycelia harvested at 48 h were designated as the growth phase. The described clustering algorithm was applied to yield putative PBCs. The devised PBC scoring system rewarded consistent upregulation of cluster members in the same sample group, divided by the difference between the smallest and largest ORF numbers, to encourage the formation of tight clusters. A total of 57 PBCs had a score ≥ 1.5 and among these, 35 had a score ≥ 3 (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Data 1). On examination of the cluster structure, 4 of the 22 PBCs with scores between 1.5 and 3 (PBC No. 45, 115, 141, and 218) were decoupled and subsequently formed sub-clusters that scored ≥ 3. In total, 40 PBCs were identified and are displayed in Figure 1. The function of the PBCs was predicted using STRING (Ver 11.5) with the “neighborhood” criterion disabled to increase orthogonality between our proteomining clustering method and STRING since our method had already determined that the proteins in each PBC were already in proximity in the genome (Table 1).

Function annotation of proteomining clusters were performed by STRING (ver. 11.5). BGCs identified by antiSMASH were highlighted in bold. Clusters with unknown function were omitted. During the nutrient starvation phase, we detected the upregulation of PBC No. 117, 182, 218c, and 232, annotated by antiSMASH as the calcium-dependent antibiotic, actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin, and coelimycin P1 BGCs, respectively. The production of calcium-dependent antibiotic, actinorhodin, and undecylprodigiosin under nutrient starvation conditions has been well-documented even before the whole-genome assembly of S. coelicolor A3(2) in 2003 (Bentley et al., 2002; Hopwood, 2007; Manteca et al., 2010; Bednarz et al., 2019). However, PBC No. 218c, corresponding to the undecylprodigiosin BGC, required decoupling for the PBC to score ≥ 3. To ensure that this cluster was not falsely identified, we obtained the crude methanolic extract of the mycelia at harvested at 96 h and analyzed it by colorimetry and mass spectrometry (Tenconi et al., 2013). The crude extracts exhibited peak absorption at 230 nm and monoisotopic mass of 394.29, consistent with the undecylprodigiosin standard and confirming the activity of the undecylprodigiosin BGC (Supplementary Figure 2). On the other hand, the production of coelimycin P1 (PBC No. 232) was only recently documented, due to its BGC expression being controlled by a complex regulatory system (Bednarz et al., 2019). As such, we believe that the expression of the coelimycin P1 BGC in our study was triggered by the media composition and fermentation conditions used in this study (Gottelt et al., 2010; Bednarz et al., 2019). Aside from the PBCs identified as BGCs, several PBCs with various functions, determined by STRING, were also upregulated during nutrient starvation. Prominently, members of PBC No. 161 collectively possessed NADH-quinone oxidoreductase functions. The upregulation of quinone oxidoreductases was reasonable due to its correlation with cellular stress and was hypothesized to be involved in radical build-up relief and detoxification of quinones (Pey et al., 2019). Other PBCs that were upregulated during nutrient starvation possessed polysaccharide biosynthesis (PBC No. 7), amino acid transport (PBC No. 69), sensory (PBC No. 89), maleate isomerase (PBC No. 102), purine metabolism (PBC No. 229), β-alanine metabolism (PBC No. 233), benzoate degradation (PBC No. 244) and inositol metabolism (PBC No. 248) functions. On the other hand, numerous PBCs (PBC No. 50, 92, 141b, 164, and 165) containing ribosomal proteins were downregulated during nutrient starvation, consistent with past proteomic studies of S. coelicolor A3(2) (Manteca et al., 2006, 2010; Rioseras et al., 2018). This downregulation is likely attributed to nutrient scavenging attempts by recycling ribosomes (Li et al., 2010). Overall, the proteomining clustering method was capable of highlighting active BGCs as well as other active gene clusters. Streptomyces chrestomyceticus BCC24770 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Proteomining Next, we applied our method to S. chrestomyceticus BCC24770, which produced a variety of natural products with bioactivity against various nosocomial pathogens (She et al., 2020, 2021). Since the genome of BCC24770 was not fully assembled, being comprised of 70 contigs, we aimed to use this organism to test our proteomining method. Also, unlike S. coelicolor A3(2) which exhibited red pigmentation due to accumulation of undecylprodigiosin, the fermentation of BCC24770 did not exhibit detectable cues that indicated production of secondary metabolites. As such the production of albofungin (Supplementary Figure 3) was used as the indicator for the nutrient-starved and growth phase, respectively, which were the mycelia harvested from the fermentation in GYM at 48 and 24 h, respectively. The proteomining clustering result yielded 45 PBCs post-decoupling (Figure 2 and Supplementary Data 2). The annotation of detected PBCs was performed by consolidating the function of each ORF in the PBC (Table 2). Like the proteomics analysis of S. coelicolor A3(2), there was an upregulation in NADH-quinone oxidoreductase activity (PBC No. 212) and a significant downregulation in ribosomal proteins and housekeeping proteins (PBC No. 10, 91, 95, 208–210, and 250).

BGCs were identified by antiSMASH and is highlighted in bold. * – Only 1 core biosynthetic cluster was differentially expressed between the two sample groups. Clusters with unknown functions were omitted. The PBCs identified were then compared to the genome mining result of antiSMASH. We independently identified PBC No. 193, the largest PBC, as a type II PKS similar to xantholipin BGC. This type II PKS BGC has been characterized to produce albofungin by She et al. Most of the genes in this BGC were detected only during nutrient starvation, except Alb66 (ORF No. 5370. Function: FAD-binding monooxygenase) which was present in both sample groups but still highly upregulated during nutrient starvation (Supplementary Table 3). Several transcriptional regulator proteins (ORF No. 5327, 5350, and 5361 corresponding to Alb22, Alb45, and Alb57, respectively) were also only detected during nutrient starvation, suggesting their involvement in eliciting albofungin production. Aside from the albofungin BGC, the expression of several smaller orphan BGCs were also detected (Table 2). Two type I PKS (PBC No. 50 and 271), 2 NRPS (PBC No. 183 and 246), and 1 phosphonate BGCs (PBC No. 179) were upregulated at the nutrient-starved phase, while PBC No. 249, a putative NRPS BGC that produced siderophores, was the only downregulated BGC. The smaller size of these PBCs, compared to PBC No. 193 or the PBCs identified from S. coelicolor A3(2), could be due to the smaller size of the BGCs or inherently lower production of the respective compounds at the time of sampling. Notably, PBC No. 183 and 271 were located near the edge of their respective contigs, as such the smaller size of these 2 PBCs was likely due to an incomplete BGC sequence. Future work could focus on integrating metabolomics in the detection of the products of these orphan BGCs. To obtain differing fermentation conditions with potentially different secondary metabolite production profiles, we performed fermentation of BCC24770 in TSBY. The fermentation in TSBY was selected due to a stark difference in albofungin production (192–282-fold decrease), which could lead to a different main product of the fermentation (Supplementary Figure 3). We then took this opportunity to compare the PBCs identified from the proteomining of BCC24770 fermented in different media to the PBCs identified from the nutrient-starved/growth comparison. Surprisingly, the loss of albofungin production in the fermentation of BCC24770 in TSBY did not result in increased production of other secondary metabolites (Supplementary Figure 4 and Supplementary Data 3). In fact, the PBCs obtained when comparing BCC24770 fermentation in different media were very similar to the nutrient-starved/growth. This suggests a significant downregulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis of the fermentation in TSBY since some proteins of the albofungin BGC were still expressed at very low concentrations. Some PBCs were also not detected in the proteomining of BCC24770 fermentation in different media, namely a siderophore producing PBC and a putative phosphonate BGC as well as some ribosomal protein PBCs. This could be attributed to a similar trend of downregulation in the mycelia as the culture reaches the stationary phase such as the recycling of ribosomal proteins (Li et al., 2010). Streptomyces tenebrarius Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Proteomining Finally, we applied our proteomining clustering algorithm to the apramycin producer, S. tenebrarius. Similar to the fermentation of BCC24770, the growth state of S. tenebrarius was monitored by the quantity of apramycin in the supernatant (Supplementary Figure 5). Apramycin production started between the 12th and 18th hour of fermentation with peak apramycin production between the 18th and 24th hour and plateauing by the 48th hour. The time points 24 and 12 h were appointed as the peak secondary metabolite production phase and the non-producing growth phase, respectively. Figure 3 displays all the PBCs detected with scores ≥ 3 (Supplementary Data 4). Interestingly, only 5 PBCs were expressed, all of which were identified by antiSMASH as BGCs.

Edges were drawn between nodes with an ORF difference ≤ 5. Cluster score ≥ 3. Aside from the expression of apramycin BGC, which was monitored throughout the fermentation, the expression of the tobramycin BGC was not unexpected as it has been documented in previous studies of S. tenebrarius (Borodina et al., 2005; Hong and Yan, 2012). Interestingly, we also detected the expression of 1 NRPS/Type I PKS hybrid, 1 NRPS and 1 type I PKS BGC which had not been documented in this species before. The closest match for these BGCs were the caerulomycin A (56% similarity), mannopeptimycin (33%) and spectinabilin (81%) BGCs, respectively. We then sought to isolate one of the products of the active BGCs utilizing the ethyl acetate extraction method employed by Zhu et al. (2012) to isolate caerulomycin A. HPLC-MS analysis detected a compound with a mass of 230.09 by HPLC-MS, corresponding to caerulomycin A (Figure 4). Here, we demonstrated the use of proteomics to guide secondary metabolite isolation. FIGURE 4HPLC-MS identification of caerulomycin A from the crude extract of fermentation supernatant of S. tenebrarius WT and ΔcrmA.

HPLC-MS identification of caerulomycin A from the crude extract of fermentation supernatant of S. tenebrarius WT and ΔcrmA. The extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) was obtained ions with m/z of 230.0924, corresponding to singly protonated caerulomycin A. Since there was no previous report of the production of caerulomycin A in S. tenebrarius, we sought to further confirm the role of the discovered caerulomycin A BGC by gene knockout. We proceeded to knock out ORF 4229–4230 which corresponded to crmA, the core biosynthetic protein for caerulomycin A biosynthesis, to probe how this BGC affects secondary metabolite production of S. tenebrarius. The loss of crmA abolished caerulomycin A production in S. tenebrarius (Figure 4). Surprisingly, knocking out crmA also abolished apramycin production (Supplementary Figure 5). We then took this opportunity to test our proteomining clustering method on strain comparison, by comparing S. tenebrarius ΔcrmA and the WT (Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Data 5). Differential expression analysis yielded the same 5 PBCs as the nutrient-starved/growth phase comparison, indicating overall downregulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis due to the loss of crmA. The mechanism behind this cross-BGC regulation is still unclear. Since crmA is not a regulatory gene but rather a NRPS that contained a ketosynthase, acyltransferase, acyl-carrier, condensation, adenylation and thiolation domains, this made it unlikely that the overall downregulation of the other BGCs was due to cross-BGC regulation. As such, we hypothesize that the loss of the secondary metabolite BGC expression may be attributed to the loss of caerulomycin A or one of its precursors, which might act as the trigger for secondary metabolite production either by triggering programmed cell death (Tenconi et al., 2018) or through quorum sensing (Koberska et al., 2021).
