["3. Discussion", "vanHAXRS genes were experimentally shown to provide GPA resistance in (i) GPA-producing actinobacteria [34], (ii) actinobacterial GPA non-producers [31], (iii) GPA-resistant pathogens [28], and (iv) other soil bacteria [19,54]. In the majority of the known cases, the VanRS two-component regulatory system is utilized to sense extracellular GPAs [29] (or perhaps the GPA-lipid II complex [30]) and activate the expression of functional van genes. Pathogens and GPA-non-producing actinobacteria generally have inducible van-resistant phenotypes, because the constitutive expression of van genes comes at a cost of decreased fitness of the cells [55,56].", "Figure 6Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of 59 GTFs coded within or near experimentally studied GPA BGCs and NovM from clorobiocin BGC [57], used as an outgroup (the tree is not drawn to scale). MEGA 11 was used for the analysis [58]. Evolution was inferred by using the JTT matrix-based model [59]. A discrete \u03b3 distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories). Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap-support values derived from 1000 replications. Five clades were delineated on this tree (A\u2013E); clades correlated with substrate- and regiospecificity of GTFs. Veg36-OLZ52430-AIG79202 seemed to be a clade of few additional irrelevant GTFs coded nearby the corresponding BGCs. Notably, Tei1 (marked with \u201cGlcNAc-AA6 (!)\u201d label) appeared in the clade (A) grouping GTFs attaching either d-glucose or GlcNAc to aglycone AA4, while the enzyme was experimentally shown to attach GlcNAc to aglycone AA6. \u201c(?)\u201d signs indicate presumed regiospecificity (lack of experimental evidence).", "Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of 59 GTFs coded within or near experimentally studied GPA BGCs and NovM from clorobiocin BGC [57], used as an outgroup (the tree is not drawn to scale).

In Am. balhimycina, vanHAX orthologs are the main contributors to GPA resistance [40,60]. However, vanHAX are not situated within the borders of balhimycin BGC (as commonly occurs in the other actinomycetes producing GPAs), and they are not co-localized with vanRS orthologs [40]. Hence, the expression of vanHAX is devoid of vanRS-mediated regulation and is constitutive. It should be noted that Am. balhimycina also possesses additional GPA-resistance mechanisms that are not van-mediated [61].", "Figure 7A scheme illustrating possible scenarios for the co-evolution of GTFs encoded in teicoplanin BGC and Tei3. Please refer to the main text for more detail.", "A scheme illustrating possible scenarios for the co-evolution of GTFs encoded in teicoplanin BGC and Tei3. Please refer to the main text for more detail.", "The most striking outcome of our work was that the SD of Tei3 did not respond to teicoplanin, but recognized A40926: the expression of the hybrid SHK carrying the Tei3 SD fused with the catalytic part from VanSSc changed the constitutive GPA-resistance phenotype of S. coelicolor J3200, making the strain teicoplanin- and vancomycin-sensitive, but A40926-resistant. This prompted us to focus on the chemical differences in the structure of A40926 and teicoplanin (the presence of a GlcNAc residue in teicoplanin, which is absent in A40296) and on the possible evolution of the teicoplanin glycosylation pattern and of the whole tei BGC. Reconstruction of the phylogeny of GTFs coded within the known GPA BGCs allowed us to build possible scenarios explaining the obtained results (Figure 7).", "If our reconstruction of the evolution of Tei1/Tei10* is correct, the ancestor of the teicoplanin BGC coded the biosynthesis of des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin, which structurally resembles A40926 and was recognized by the Tei3 SD. Tei3 SHK initially responded to des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin (modeled with A40926 in the experiment presented in this work) (Figure 7) and it was probably inducible. A further two alternative scenarios are possible. The first implies that the non-inducibility of Tei3 evolved as an adaptation to the appearance of Tei1 because A. teichomyceticus was required to rapidly gain constitutive GPA resistance as Tei3 was unable to sense teicoplanin. The second scenario implies that Tei3 in the des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin producer became non-inducible at the first place, consequently giving the BGC room for further evolution and structural changes of the produced GPA. Considering that, in the first hypothesis, fewer mutations would probably be required to give Tei3 constitutive properties than to remodel its SD, the second scenario is more likely in our opinion. Hence, mutations leading to the non-inducibility of Tei3 might have served as a preadaptation, which allowed teicoplanin to emerge in its current form, carrying the GlcNAc residue at AA6 (Figure 7).", "To conclude, our results proved the non-inducibility of Tei3, showed that its SD is able to respond to A40926, but not to teicoplanin or vancomycin, and demonstrated a novel example of how BGCs, antibiotic structures, and antibiotic resistance genes might have co-evolved. Further investigations will include mutational analysis of Tei3 to elucidate which particular aa changes in its ATPaseD lead to non-inducible properties. Finally, as a byproduct, a S. coelicolor-based chromogenic assay for vancomycin detection was developed capable of sensing vancomycin at the ng range."]
