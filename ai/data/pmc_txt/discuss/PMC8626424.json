["Discussion", "In our experiments, YtkR2 and C10R5 provided the greatest cellular resistance to YTM and CC-1065 toxicity, respectively, consistent with evolution of these proteins within the context of the biosynthetic gene cluster for each natural product. Both enzymes also conferred substantial resistance against DSA, even though DSA differs from YTM and CC-1065 in the substituents present on the S+1 subunit. YtkR2 also provided significant resistance against CC-1065, which was somewhat unexpected because of the presence of the unique S+2 subunit, and suggests that interactions with this subunit do not play an important role in determining substrate specificity. Indeed, the outward face of the S+2 subunit is largely solvent exposed and has the fewest protein contacts of any subunit. In contrast, the S\u22121 subunit unique to YTM makes several direct protein contacts, which we show largely account for the weak YTM-Ade excision activity of C10R5. Interestingly, the S\u22121 binding surface is formed predominantly from helix \u03b1B, which is a critical DNA-binding element within the AlkD family of enzymes57 and whose structural variability among HLR glycosylases enables binding to a diverse array of ligands44,59. Steric accommodation of the S\u22121 subunit is the only determinant of substrate specificity that we were able to identify through our comparative analysis. Within the largely water-filled adduct-binding cleft, most hydrogen bonds are mediated by a network of water molecules, which creates a seemingly malleable hydrogen-bonding interface able to accommodate different substituents on the S0 and S+1 subunits. Similarly, most of the protein residues that directly contact the adducts form a network of CH-\u03c0 interactions that is only selective for aromatic groups, which are present in all of the indole and pyrroloindole subunits in all of the SCPCHD adducts. This mode of substrate recognition seems largely incompatible with a high degree of substrate specificity, which is consistent with our experimental observations.", "Despite selective pressure for YtkR2 and C10R5 to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065, neither homolog evolved to remove YTM-Ade or CC1065-Ade adducts at a substantially increased rate, as observed by the strong correlation between multiple-turnover excision and cellular resistance. Instead, selective pressure seemingly induced both enzymes to develop reduced product affinity. We previously showed that AlkD\u2019s low level of protection against YTM results from product inhibition in which the enzyme remains bound to the newly formed abasic site in the DNA, slowing multiple-turnover excision, as well as impeding subsequent repair steps in the BER pathway18. Both YtkR2 and C10R5 have evolved to circumvent this inhibition, while also minimizing their impediment to later repair steps. Reduced product inhibition may be explained by the fewer DNA-binding residues predicted in these proteins, which are also the only contacts predicted to form \u201cspecific\u201d hydrogen bonds with the adducts. It is interesting to speculate that the evolution of YtkR2 and C10R5 to improve multiple turnover occurred as a means to handle the high concentration of YTM or CC-1065 in the producing strains, whereas the rapid single-turnover activity of AlkD is sufficient to provide resistance to the presumably much lower intracellular quantities of these compounds in Bacillus and other non-producing bacteria.", "Until recently, all DNA glycosylases were believed to recognize and excise substrates using a base-flipping mechanism in which the target adduct is sequestered from the DNA helix and into a nucleobase-binding pocket on the surface of the enzyme. The AlkD/YtkR2/C10R5 enzymes belong to one of two known bacterial DNA glycosylase superfamilies that have evolved a non-base-flipping mechanism as a means to remove structurally diverse duplex-stabilizing adducts18,43,45. Although their SCPCHD substrates form a covalent bond with only one DNA strand, a network of CH-\u03c0 interactions non-covalently tethers the two DNA strands together. This greatly stabilizes the duplex, while also hindering the base-flipping activity necessary for recognition and excision by other repair proteins. An unrelated DNA glycosylase, AlkZ, from Streptomyces sahachiroi was recently found from its association with the biosynthetic gene cluster for azinomycin B, a highly toxic interstrand crosslinking agent, and shown to provide self-resistance through unhooking of the corresponding DNA crosslinks27,60. Enzymes in the AlkZ superfamily have since been shown to remove a variety of alkylated DNA adducts and interstrand crosslinks27,61,62. Despite their different polypeptide folds, AlkZ and AlkD family enzymes adopt a similar C-shaped DNA-binding architecture that enables access to the target N-glycosidic bond while the aberrant nucleotide remains stacked in the DNA. This mode of recognition and excision not only eliminates the problem of flipping a duplex-stabilizing lesion out of the DNA, but also avoids the steric limitations imposed by a nucleobase-binding pocket. Thus, the expanded substrate spectrum of non-base-flipping DNA glycosylases broadens the biological utility of the BER pathway, providing a mechanism for resistance against the genotoxic natural products generated by many bacteria."]
