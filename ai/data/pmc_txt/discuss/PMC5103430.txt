Discussion Up to thirteen ORFs from the PM100117 and PM100118 biosynthesis gene cluster can reliably be predicted to code for enzymes potentially involved in glycosylation reactions. Although bioinformatics analysis of the entire PM100117/18 gene cluster was previously addressed [32], here we provide additional in silico data supporting function assignment to putative DOH biosynthesis and GT enzymes (Additional file 1). The biosynthesis pathways of the PM100117/18 2,6DOHs moieties (Fig. 2) that can be deduced from these functions are congruent with 2,6DOHs biosynthesis reaction schemes previously reported [36]. Only a gene coding for an EryBII-type 3-ketoreductase (3KR, Fig. 2) presumably involved in the formation of a NDP-4-keto-2,6DOH intermediate with an axial hydroxyl group at C3 has not been located within the gene cluster. The absence of functions required for 2,6DOHs biosynthesis has been also described in the sequence analysis of the gene cluster of other glycosylated NPs, such as spinosyn [37], brasilicardin A [38] or mithramycin [39]. However, in the later example, gene mtmC has been shown to code for a ketoreductase/methyltrasnferase bifunctional enzyme [40, 41]. Thus, 3-C-methyltransferase GonCM might be also responsible for the 3-ketoreduction reaction leading to l-axenose. Alternatively, methylation of the NDP-4-keto-2,6-dideoxyl-d-Glucose intermediate by GonCM could be sequential to GonR3 activity (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the involvement of 3-C-methyltransferase GonCM and 3-dehydratase GonD3 in reaction steps of l-axenose and l-rhodinose biosynthesis, respectively, is also supported by genetic engineering experiments (Fig. 3). Likewise, implication of 3,5-epimerase GonE in PM100117/18 biosynthesis has been also confirmed. Nevertheless, putative isomerase activity of this enzyme has not been further verified because of the impossibility to conduct NMR analysis of compounds 8 and 9. It is noteworthy the presence in the PM100117/18 gene cluster of two genes, gonR1 and gonR2, coding for putative 4-ketoreductase enzymes. However, the involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of the three PM100117/18 DOH moieties has not been fully demonstrated by genetic experiments. The inactivation of gonR1 has no apparent effect on PM100117/18 biosynthesis, and its lack could be complemented by the presence of an additional 4-ketoreductase encoded in S. caniferus chromosome, being gonR2 a good candidate. On the other hand, the impossibility of producing a gonR2 deletion mutant suggests the involvement of this gene in important primary processes such as, for example, supply of essential sugars for cell-wall formation. A similar connection of primary and secondary metabolism via DOH biosynthesis genes has been previously reported for the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose required for spinosyn A production in Saccharopolyspora spinosa [42]. Gene deletion experiments have also enabled the identification of GTs responsible for transfer of each 2,6DOH sugar moiety to its corresponding position of the PM100117/18 glycosylation pattern. Putative GT GonG1 is involved in transfer of the first sugar unit, l-axenose, since upon deletion of gonG1 no glycosylated PM100117/18 derivatives were produced (Fig. 4). Following l-axenose transfer, GonG2 is responsible for the introduction of the second sugar moiety, 2-deoxy-l-fucose and l-rhodinose, to PM100117 and PM100118 biosynthesis, respectively. Since two different 2,6DOH moieties can be transferred as second sugar unit, we previously predicted the involvement in this step of two GTs, each dedicated to transfer only one 2,6DOH. Nevertheless, UPLC and MS analysis did not detect production in ΔgonG2 strain of PM100117/18 analogues carrying the second DOH unit (Fig. 4), thus pointing at GonG2 as the only GT responsible for the introduction of both 2,6DOHs at second position of the PM100117/18 glycosylation pattern. Finally, the structure of analogues derived from ΔgonG3 (Fig. 4c), which lack the third sugar moiety, suggests that GonG3 is the GT in charge of transferring l-rhodinose to the naphthoquinone moiety of the PM100117/18 glycosylation profile. Surprisingly, the functional role of the putative GT GonG4 remains elusive. As a primary hypothesis, we speculated a role for GonG4 on transferring 2-deoxy-l-fucose or l-rhodinose as second sugar moiety. However, neither PM100117 nor PM100118 production was detected upon gonG4 over-expression in ΔgonG2 mutant strain (Fig. 5d). Alternatively, GonG4 might be inactive, but sequence alignment with functional glycosyltransferases did not reveal obvious differences supporting that possibility, or require post-translational regulatory signals for its activation. Moreover, it seems plausible also to contemplate that under certain environmental conditions, GonG4 might have a role on transferring 2,6DOH moieties other than l-axenose, 2-deoxy-l-fucose or l-rhodinose, leading to the production of natural PM100117/18 derivatives. This is consistent with the presence in the PM100117/18 gene cluster of two ORFs, gonR1 and gonR2, coding for putative 4-ketoreductase enzymes. Their presence in the cluster allows us to speculate with the biosynthesis of additional 2,6DOHs. For instance, last step of 2-deoxy-l-fucose an l-rhodinose biosynthesis could be branched towards the formation of l-olivose and l-amicetose, respectively, if either GonR1 or GonR2 were able to produce hydroxyl groups in equatorial configuration at C4. However, based on sequence analysis data, it is not possible to forecast the resulting stereo configuration after GonR1 and/or GonR2 activity. Otherwise, we cannot rule out the biosynthesis of other 2,6DOHs by the activity of enzymes encoded in other locations of S. caniferus chromosome. Standing by the chemical structure of PM100117/18 analogues produced by the mutant strains analyzed in this work, we can make interesting conclusions on the substrate flexibility of GonG1, GonG2 and GonG3. When genes coding for these putative GTs are individually deleted, none of the two remaining GTs is flexible to catalyze the transfer of its own natural sugar to the acceptor aglycone. This apparently low promiscuity of the three GTs towards the acceptor substrate contrasts with the flexibility showed by GonG1 to transfer l-rhodinose (compounds 3 and 4) as first sugar moiety to the PM100117/18 polyketide ring (Fig. 3) in the ΔgonCM mutant, in which l-axenose biosynthesis is presumably suppressed. Another interesting observation from the structure of the compounds detected in mutants ΔgonCM and ΔgonG2 is the production of a derivative with a hydroxyl functional group at C18 of the PM100117/18 macrolactone ring (compounds 3 and 11), a feature also observed in the polyketide skeleton of the structurally related antibiotic brasilinolide A [43]. This seems to reinforce the structural and biosynthetic relationships between both compounds. On the other hand, accumulation of the naphthoquinone moiety (compound 6) is exclusively detected in strain ΔgonE, and not in other mutant strains, such as ΔgonG1 or ΔgonG2, in which this chromophore is neither incorporated into the PM100117/18 structure (Figs. 3, 4). Based on our current knowledge on PM100117/18 biosynthesis, no suitable explanation to this observation can be exposed. Moreover, the naphthoquinone chromophore and its derivative compound 7 do not show in vitro cytotoxic activity (Table 1), in spite of the structural and biosynthetic connection of these products to menaquinone, whose antitumor properties have been repeatedly noted [44, 45]. Furthermore, as it was predictable from a previous report [32], removal of large portions from PM100117/18 structure, as displayed in different degrees by compounds 5, 10, 11, 12 and 13, resulted in a remarkable decrease of in vitro cytotoxicity. Only compounds 3 and 4, which preserve chemical structures containing three 2,6DOHs, retain activity levels comparable to those showed by the parental products (Table 1). Given their biological activity, PM100117/18 constitute appealing potential targets of biochemical, genetic and medical research. Findings on PM100117/18 biosynthesis reported in this work will enable the manipulation of the described glycosylation machinery by genetic methods in order to generate additional structural diversity of these compounds.
