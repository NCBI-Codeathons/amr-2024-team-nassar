1. Introduction Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide [1]. It causes the second highest incidence of death after cardiovascular diseases in industrialized countries accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 (as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO); https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer; accessed on 22 April 2021). Cancer includes a large group of pathologies related to the unrestrained proliferation of cells in the body and can also spread into other tissues causing metastases that are often lethal [1]. Although a classification system should be flexible and changeable as new information accumulates, WHO, in collaboration with the Society for Hematopathology and the European Association of Hematopathology, published the classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in 2001 [2]. Seven years later, thanks to new scientific and clinical information accumulation, the classification was updated and published as part of the 4th edition of the WHO monograph series [3]. The combination of several data, including clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features, and the input of 70 internationally recognized clinicians and clinical scientists, over 150 hematopathologists, clinical hematologists, and scientists allowed the final writing of the new WHO “Classification of Tumors of the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues”. According to this classification, more than 150 typologies of hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors exist [4]. Most of the natural products currently on the market derive from terrestrial sources [5,6], including paclitaxel, derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia) and in use for the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancer (https://dtp.cancer.gov/timeline/flash/success_stories/s2_taxol.htm; Accessed on 6 May 2021); vinblastine and vincristine, isolated from the Madagascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus and used for the treatment of a variety of cancers [7]; and doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius generally used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of breast cancer, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, bronchogenic carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, sarcomas, and thyroid carcinoma [8]. In recent years, several researchers have focused their attention on vaccines, gene therapies, and treatments with monoclonal antibodies for the study of the treatment of hematological cancers disease with promising results. In particular, the success of a molecular targeting therapy requires defining the correct “molecular target”, selecting the right active drug against a specific “target”, and selecting a group of patients who benefit from treatment. Unfortunately, some patients are particularly sensitive to these drugs and may develop severe toxicity [9]. Moreover, immunotherapy has been shown to be an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancers, including hematopoietic malignancies. Clinical trials have shown encouraging results, but future trials may need to incorporate new targets with greater safety and efficacy to ensure long-term benefits [10]. Recently, the marine environment has received increasing attention and has been proposed as a valuable source of new bioactive natural products (marine natural products (MNPs)) [11,12]. Oceans cover nearly 70% of the Earth’s surface, more than 36,000 [13] marine natural products have been isolated thus far, and 100s of new compounds are discovered every year [14]. Since 2008, about 1000 marine-derived compounds are newly discovered every year [15]. The marine environment is characterized by huge biodiversity of species (about 240,000 known species according to The World Register of Marine Species; http://www.marinespecies.org/; Accessed on 6 May 2021) which have adapted to live in multiple extreme environments, e.g., temperatures from −1.5 °C in polar waters to 350 °C in hydrothermal waters, various depths with an increase of pressure of one atmosphere for every 10 m, nutrient concentrations from low (oligotrophic) to high (eutrophic), light intensities from very high at the surface to completely dark in the deepest places [14,16]. Adaptation strategies to environmental parameter variation, as well as predator pressure or stress exposure, have resulted in the evolution of chemical diversity as well. Marine organisms are known to produce series of compounds, derived from their primary and secondary metabolism, which first show bioactivities at sea, such as antipredator, allelopathic, antimicrobial, and infochemical activities, but, thanks to in vitro and in vivo screenings, have also been proven to have possible applications for the treatment and prevention of human pathologies, such as cancer [11,12,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25].
