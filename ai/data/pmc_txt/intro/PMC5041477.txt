INTRODUCTION Topoisomerase I (Top1) is a ubiquitous enzyme essential for the relaxation of DNA supercoiling inside cells during the process of replication, transcription and chromosomal recombination (1,2). The mechanism by which Top1 alters the DNA supercoiling involves three major steps: (i) nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the active site tyrosine (Tyr723 for human Top1) on the scissile phosphate resulting in the covalent attachment of Top1 to the 3′ end of the broken strand (i.e. transient Top1–DNA cleavage complex; Top1cc), (ii) DNA relaxation involving controlled free rotation and (iii) religation of the DNA strand and release of the enzyme (1,2). Top1 religation rate is much faster than cleavage rate, thus, the covalent enzyme–DNA complexes (Top1cc) are fleeting catalytic intermediates and normally not detectable. In contrast, the array of conditions that significantly enhance the frequency of trapped Top1cc inside the cells are: Top1 poisons, such as camptothecin (CPT) and its clinically used derivatives (irinotecan and topotecan), as well as several non-CPT Top1 inhibitors including the indenoisoquinolines and the indolocarbazoles (3). Endogenous and carcinogenic DNA lesions can also trap Top1cc (3). Top1cc catalytic intermediates can be converted into irreversible Top1–DNA cleavage complexes by colliding replication fork or transcription machinery (3,4), which trigger DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and cell death (3). Point mutations that confer CPT-resistance are distributed in the different domains of Top1 and are conserved among species (2,5–8). The Asn722Ser mutation in the C-terminal domain of Top1 is widely available among CPT-resistant cancer cell lines and is also conserved in CPT producing plants (7–9). Though Asn722 is next to the catalytic Tyr723 (Figure 1A), still Top1-Asn722Ser mutation was found to be catalytically active in vitro but resistant to CPT (8). Recent studies also highlight the importance of the N-terminal domain (191–206 aa) of Top1 related to in vivo activity, interaction with cofactors and CPT sensitivity (10–12). Precisely, Trp205 residue was suggested to control Top1 dynamics through tryptophan anchoring together with Trp203 and Trp206 on the DNA (13,14); (see the domain structure, Figure 1A), and stabilization of CPT-induced Top1cc (6,15). However, the impact of these point mutations on Top1 nuclear dynamics together with its cofactors and post-translational modifications (PTMs) have not been elucidated in live cells.

Error bars represent mean ± S.E. (n = 70). The nucleolus is often considered as the stress sensing subnuclear compartment and functions as a site of ribosome biogenesis (16). Several DNA processing enzymes including Top1 are predominantly nucleolar protein and are required to relax DNA supercoils generated during rRNA synthesis (17,18). CPT-induced Top1cc has been shown to activate accumulation of antisense RNA polymerase (RNAP) II transcripts, which causes an interim block of RNAP II at the promoter and a transitory increase of R-loops particularly at the highly transcribed regions (clusters of ribosomal genes in the nucleolus) leading to transcription-dependent DSBs and genome instability (19–22). CPT causes delocalization of nucleolar Top1 to the nucleoplasm (23). The complex coordination of Top1 between nucleolus and nucleoplasm was previously attributed to mRNA synthesis (18), while others alternatively proposed that CPT-mediated modification of Top1 with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) may induce translocation of Top1 from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm (24,25). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) interacts with Top1 and shows colocalization in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm throughout the cell cycle (26–28). PARP1 is a ubiquitous chromatin-associated enzyme that catalyses the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent addition of ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) onto itself (90% of PAR is found on PARP1) and several chromatin proteins including Top1 (29,30). Top1cc accumulates PAR polymers in CPT treated cells (31–33), which play vital role in Top1cc repair by directly regulating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins including Tyrosyl–DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) and Ligase III (31–35). PARP1 also helps in releasing Top1 from stalled replication complexes by promoting the restart of replication forks reversed by Top1cc (36–38). In vitro studies suggest that PARP1 favours faster Top1 religation activity in the presence of CPT either through its direct interaction with Top1 or by the formation of PARylated Top1 (39,40). DNA damaging anti-cancer agents constitute the mainstay of treatment for most solid tumours. PARP inhibitors generate considerable interest as anti-tumour agents especially for tumours defective in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (41–43), or in combination with Top1 inhibitors (CPT, irinotecan and topotecan) or with other DNA damaging agents (41,44,45). PARP inhibitors enhance the activity of CPT and its clinical derivatives both in cell culture, in xenograft model and in patients under clinical trials (31–33,44,46). Though Top1 is known to be PARylated for quite a long time (27,39,40), however the molecular mechanism by which PAR polymers regulate Top1 nuclear kinetics and localization has not been elucidated. In the present study, we took the advantage of live-cell imaging and real-time monitoring of enhanced green fluorescence (EGFP) tagged-human Top1 variant combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technology (47) to get new insights into Top1 dynamics such as association and dissociation reactions that are mediated by each of the functional amino acid residues. The FRAP kinetic modelling (48,49) indicates that Trp205 at the N-terminal and Asn722 at the C-terminal domain of Top1 are critical for subnuclear dynamics associated with CPT. Our study provides new evidence suggesting that ADP-ribose polymers are key molecular determinant for the regulation of Top1 mobility between subnuclear compartments and contributes new rationale for the combination of PARP inhibitors with Top1 inhibitors in cancer chemotherapy.
