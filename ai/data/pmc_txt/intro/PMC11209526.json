["1. Introduction", "Sphingolipids are abundant in the membranes of eukaryotes but also exist in some prokaryotes [1]. In eukaryotes, they are involved in processes like membrane trafficking, cell signaling, apoptosis, and others. Furthermore, disturbances in sphingolipid metabolism have been implicated in a variety of human diseases [2]. The sphingolipid core structure consists of a long acyl chain amide, which is linked to a fatty acid by ceramide synthase [3]. The long chain base in animal ceramides is sphingosine, while in plants and fungi, sphingolipid biosynthesis starts by the condensation of the tri-hydroxylated long chain base phytosphingosine with an alpha-hydroxylated very long chain fatty acid [4]. Phosphosphingolipids have a polar headgroup linked to ceramide via a phosphodiester bond. Highly complex structures [5,6] exist in different organisms with different roles due to the attachment of inositol(-phosphates) and different sugar moieties.", "Fumonisins are the major group of \u201csphinganine analog mycotoxins\u201d [7], alongside the AAL toxin produced by Alternaria alternata f.sp. lycopersici. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) in particular is known to efficiently inhibit ceramide synthase in plants [8,9] and animals [10] by competing with sphinganine and acyl-coenzyme A [11,12]. Disturbances of sphingolipid biosynthesis have many effects: FB1 is a potential human carcinogen (group 2B according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer), further implicated in esophageal cancer and neural tube defects in humans, and known to cause animal diseases such as equine leukoencephalomalacia, porcine pulmonary edema and cancer. Also, teratogenic, mutagenic, cytotoxic, nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, and immunotoxic effects have been described [13,14,15].", "The main producers of different fumonisins are plant pathogenic fungi, such as different species of Fusarium, several species of black Aspergilli and also Verticillium and some Alternaria strains [16]. Yet, Alternaria alternata f.sp. lycopersici typically produces the structurally related AAL toxin (see [7] for review). The gene clusters for fumonisin biosynthesis in different fungi have been elucidated [7,17,18,19].", "Whether fumonisin production is a virulence factor of plant pathogenic fungi is a controversial issue. Fumonisin-deficient fum1 mutants of F. verticillioides were still able to cause Fusarium ear rot in maize [20]. An F. verticillioides strain from banana (now F. musae) containing a large deletion of the FUM cluster was not pathogenic to seedlings of maize. Yet, when the FUM cluster was added back by transformation and fumonisin biosynthesis was restored, it gained virulence [21]. Also, inactivation of fum1 in several strains led to reduced stunting of seedlings, indicating that it is a virulence factor in seedlings at least in some sensitive maize cultivars. Maize can have highly variable resistance to FB1 in a seed germination assay [22]. For F. proliferatum, which causes rice spikelet rot disease, it was shown that the disruption of several genes leading to loss of fumonisin production caused reduced virulence [23]. Also, in Verticillium dahliae causing wilting disease in cotton, fumonisin-deficient knockout strains were less virulent [24]. In the case of Alternaria alternata f.sp. lycopersici, which causes stem canker on susceptible tomato cultivars, resistance to the AAL toxin leads to resistance against the fungal pathogen (host selective toxin) [25]. Tomatoes with a homozygous loss of function of Asc1, encoding a ceramide synthase, are susceptible to the toxin and to the fungus [26]. Similarly, in Arabidopsis, inactivation of one of three ceramide synthase genes in this species, LOH2, leads to toxin sensitivity and breakdown of non-host resistance against an AAL-producing Alternaria alternata [27].", "F. graminearum and F. verticillioides can co-occur and compete in infected maize ears. In a recent study [28], no significant difference between wild-type and fum1 mutants in disease severity or amount of fungal DNA in the inoculated maize line was found. Yet, it was demonstrated that wild-type F. verticillioides could suppress the growth of F. graminearum in a co-culture on autoclaved kernels more strongly than a fumonisin-nonproducing strain. The authors hypothesized that fumonisin production in seeds suppresses colonization by other fungi after the seeds have been shed and that the main function of fumonisins thereby is to increase saprophytic fitness.", "Data on fumonisin resistance or susceptibility in different fungi are scarce. It has been reported that FB1 in very high concentrations (200 \u00b5L of up to 40 mM\u2014corresponding to mg amounts per well in the agar) produced large growth inhibition zones with isolates of Botrytis cinerea and (not AAL-toxin-producing) A. alternata from a South African collection, while F. graminearum showed much higher resistance [29]. Conversely, Dawidziuk et al. [30] reported that a Fusarium graminearum isolate from Poland showed strong growth retardation by fumonisin already at the low concentration of 3 mg/L FB1 mixed into the agar medium, while F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum isolates were unaffected by this concentration.", "In principle, very high concentrations of fumonisins and also AAL toxin can be produced in fungal cultures and some mechanism of self-resistance must exist in toxin-producing fungi. Recently it has been reported that in the case of Fusarium verticillioides, self-protection against FB1 is conferred by a FUM cluster-encoded ceramide synthase [31].", "The aim of our study was to test whether Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Alternaria strains producing sphinganine-analog mycotoxins have higher levels of FB1 resistance than related non-producers. Testing by gene disruption revealed that the cluster-encoded ceramide synthases of F. verticillioides are unexpectedly NOT necessary for high-level resistance. This result is explained by our finding that three presumed housekeeping ceramide synthases, when expressed in a sensitive yeast strain, are sufficient to confer high-level FB1 resistance."]
