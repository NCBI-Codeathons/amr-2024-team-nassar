1. Introduction Resistance to Antibiotics and Its Relation to Antibiotic-Producing Bacteria Antibiotics have saved thousands of human lives since their clinical introduction in the fourth decade of last century [1,2]; however, at present, there is a serious problem of antibiotic resistance in many pathogenic bacteria, which is a challenge in the fight against bacterial diseases [3,4,5]. The problem includes resistance to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclins, and macrolides [6,7], and is being also observed against antibiotics introduced more recently in clinical practice such as fluoroquinolones [8] and imipenem [9]. The appearance of antibiotic resistance was partially associated with the widespread and frequently indiscriminate use of antibiotics in medicine. In parallel, the finding of β-lactamases and other antibiotic resistance genes forming part of the antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters (GC) led to the hypothesis that the modern resistance determinants might have originated from those that protect the antibiotic-producing bacteria [10,11,12]. Recent advances in molecular genetics, proteomics, and transcriptomic studies of antibiotic-producing strains indicate that although this hypothesis might be partially true, the evolution of antibiotic resistance genes is very complex and they respond to elaborate horizontal transfer mechanisms [13]. In this article, we focus on the available information about the complex and enigmatic interactions between β-lactam antibiotics, penicillin-binding proteins, β-lactamases, and β-lactamase inhibitors in actinobacteria.
