1. Introduction The genus Actinosynnema belongs to rare actinomycete and is closely related to Nocardia in phylogeny [1,2]. To date, two species including Actinosynnema mirum [1] and Actinosynnema pretiosum [3] with two subspecies were discovered in this genus. Although species in this genus are limited, Actinosynnema-origined natural products exhibit a number of biological and pharmacological activities, such as antitumor (ansamitocin [4,5,6,7], dnacin B1 [8] and actinosynneptides [9]), antibacterial (nocardicins [10]), anti-fungi (validoxylamine A [11]), metalloprotease inhibitor (propioxatin [12]), and siderophore (mirubactin [13]) (Figure 1A). Its promising application in pharmacy promoted the sequencing of the completed genome of four Actinosynnema strains (including two type strains) [14,15,16,17], which not only boosted the titer optimization of bioactive products by systematic metabolic engineering, but also facilitated the discovery of the Actinosynnema-derived antibiotics and dissection of their biosynthetic machineries. Strain DSM 44131T (= A. pretiosum subsp. auranticum ATCC 31309) is an aerobic actinobacterium and its mycelium displays the typical feature of the genus Actinosynnema [3]. The strain is of interest due to its production of potent anti-tumor agents ansamitocin and dnacin B1. The chemical structure of dnacin B1 contains an intricate polycyclic architecture, which features the characteristic of naphthyridinomycin (NDM) class among the tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) alkaloids [18]. The THIQ alkaloids display strong antitumor and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities [19], which are attributed to their ability to alkylate the DNA in the minor groove. The remarkable efficacy of anticancer application has been proved by the marketing of ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) [20]. The THIQ alkaloids fascinate both biological and chemical studies by virtue of their complex chemical structures, complicated biosynthetic and biochemical pathways, and their pharmacological potential. The biosynthesis of THIQ antibiotics has been intensively investigated by classical precursor feeding experiments, as well as genetic and biochemical approaches. The biosynthetic pathway of natural THIQ consists of the unified iterative non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) for Pictet-Spengler (PS) reaction, non-proteinogenic amino acid building blocks, a cryptic fatty acyl chain or a leader peptide for NRPS, a hydroxyethyl moiety from ketose, and a powerful terminal reductase domain embedded in the C-terminal of last NRPS module [21]. In addition, the biosynthetic investigations on THIQ alkaloids had demonstrated that the quinone units of ET-743 [22], saframycin A (SFM-A) [23], safracin B (SAC-B) [24], NDM [25] and quinocarcin (QNC) [26] were originated from tyrosine or phenylalanine. To date, dnacin B1 represented a unique structure within THIQ alkaloids for its amino-substituted quinone moiety. However, the BGC of dnacin B1 and its biosynthetic mechanism are still elusive. In this research, we present the results of the comparative genome mining within four high-homology Actinosynnema strains, leading to the discovery of dnacin B1 BGC from strain DSM 44131T and strain X47. Targeted disruption of a 9.7 kb NRPS encoding DNA region in the chromosome of strain DSM 44131T confirmed that BGC was responsible for dnacin B1 biosynthesis. In addition, we focus on the analysis of the genetic basis for PAPA, which was the precursor of dnacin B1 for the quinone moiety, and the heterologous expression of PAPA was achieved in E. coli. Moreover, the aminotransferases responsible for the amino group transformation in the mature PAPA were systematically explored and evaluated. This research presented the understanding of the biosynthesis mechanism of dnacin B1 and enriched the building blocks of THIQ antibiotics for creating new bioactive compounds.
