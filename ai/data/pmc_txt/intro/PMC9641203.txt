Introduction B. brevis is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and spore-producing bacterium, which produces several antibacterial substances, but not toxins (Cook, 1993; Che et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2015; Jianmei et al., 2015). Its antibacterial products are widely used in biological control of plant diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria (Yang and Yousef, 2018; Saxena et al., 2020). Edeines, which are non-ribosomal antibacterial peptides produced by B. brevis, consist of four unconventional amino acid residues, a glycine, and a polyamine (

) (Hettinger and Craig, 1970; Czerwinski et al., 1983; Johnson et al., 2020). As non-ribosomal antibacterial peptides, edeines are synthesized by the multifunctional enzyme complex system of “sulfur template polymerase mechanism”. The unique molecular structure of edeines contributes to a variety of biological function, including antimicrobial and antitumor activities, which can greatly inhibit the growth of numerous bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and tumor cells (Kurylo-Borowska and Szer, 1973; Cozzarelli, 1977; Czajgucki et al., 2010). Edeines inhibit bacterial growth through a number of different targets, including DNA, RNA, and ribosomes (protein synthesis), at a dose-dependent manner (Chen and Lu, 2020). At low concentration (<15 μg/mL), edeines reversibly constrain the activity of DNA polymerase II and III to inhibit DNA synthesis, however, the synthesis of protein is not affected. Edeines at high concentration (>150 μg/mL) bind to the P site of small ribosomal subunit (30S subunit), which competitively blocks the binding of fMet-tRNA onto ribosomes and simultaneously inhibits the initiation of transcription and protein translation (Szer and Kurylo-Borowska, 1972; Dinos et al., 2004). In addition, edeines can be used as a transcriptional inhibitor to study ribosome function and protein synthesis. Moreover, edeines can also eliminate bacterial resistance caused by plasmid genes and inhibit the division of Bacillus subtilis cells (Shimotohno et al., 2010; Semenchenko et al., 2016).

Regardless of the biological activities of edeines mentioned above, low production level of edeines by edeine-producing bacteria is a major issue limiting their applications in medicine and agriculture. Edeine A and B produced by B. brevis X23 exhibit wide antibacterial spectrum and have been used as biocontrol agents against bacterial wilt in solanaceae crops. The complete genomic sequence of B. brevis X23 allows the identification of edeine biosynthetic gene cluster (ede BGC) (Wu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016). In this study, we identified and explored the biological function of regulatory proteins involved in biosynthesis of edeines, which will provide a theoretical basis for the construction of B. brevis strains with high-yield of edeines through genetic manipulation. A potential transcriptional factor gene edeB on the ede BGC was identified on the basis of bioinformatic analysis of B. brevis X23 genome. Protein EdeB contains a typical helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain, which is conserved in ParB family transcriptional factors. Although ParB homolog proteins have been annotated from many genomes of Bacillus species, their function has not been fully understood yet. In this study, we constructed a B. brevis mutant X23(ΔedeB) by disrupting the edeB gene through Red/ET homologous recombination. Furthermore, a complementary strain and edeB-overexpression strain were constructed using the expression plasmid PAD-Apr-Px-edeB vector. Subsequently, we compared edeine production among those different B. brevis strains to explore the effect of edeB on the yield of edeines. The binding ability between EdeB protein and the promoter region of ede BGC was also evaluated. Our results demonstrated that EdeB significantly improved edeine production in B. brevis X23 through binding to ede BGC.
