INTRODUCTION The genus Streptomyces and several other related genera of Actinobacteria (here referred to as streptomycetes) are filamentous soil and marine bacteria characterized by a remarkably rich specialized metabolism. Specifically, the genomes of streptomycetes contain the highest proportion of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) per Mb among all bacteria (1). BGCs encode the biosynthesis of a wide arsenal of bioactive specialized metabolites, which have applications in various areas, particularly in medicine. For instance, streptomycetes produce two-thirds of the clinically used antibiotics of natural origin. However, the relevant biological roles of specialized metabolites in nature are still under debate. The current concept is that antibiotics are produced as a response to cues from competitors to defend the habitats of the organism, producing them in natural competitive environments (2–5). These cues also involve ribosome-targeting antibiotics, which at subinhibitory concentrations act as elicitors of secondary metabolism (6–8). However, antibiotic-sensing systems common to a group of functionally related but structurally distinct ribosome-targeting antibiotics have not been reported. Streptomycete-derived macrolide, ketolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin antibiotics target the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the 50S ribosomal subunit or structures in proximity to it (adjacent A- and P-sites or ribosomal exit tunnel). As a result, all these natural products interfere with proteosynthesis and inhibit bacterial cell growth (for a review, see reference 9). Therefore, apart from truly biosynthetic genes, BGCs of 50S ribosomal subunit-targeting antibiotics also encode regulation elements for timely and coordinated production and resistance mechanisms for self-protection. The regulation typically employs global and/or pleiotropic regulators which direct BGC expression via activation of a pathway-specific regulator (for a review, see reference 10). For resistance, one protein can be sufficient to protect the producing strain (11, 12). However, several mechanisms for self-resistance are often encoded in the BGCs, particularly in those for the biosynthesis of 50S ribosomal subunit-targeting antibiotics (13–17). Specifically, these BGCs often encode antibiotic resistance proteins of the ABCF family and a protein(s) with another resistance mechanism. ABCF proteins are cytosolic ATPases of the ABC superfamily that confer resistance by ribosome protection (18) and not by efflux, which was the hypothesis for a long time. All characterized ABCFs to date act on the ribosome, and their common feature is the ATP-dependent modulation of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) (reviewed in reference 19). However, the biological function of these proteins is not uniform. Notably, the bacterial ABCFs include not only the antibiotic resistance proteins but also a protein, EttA, involved in translational regulation (20, 21). However, the function of the majority of bacterial ABCFs, which are widely distributed in almost all bacteria, with the highest number per genome (8–11) encoded in actinomycetes remains unknown (22). In this study, we used the lincomycin BGC as a model BGC encoding three resistance proteins: LmrA, LmrB, and LmrC (Fig. 1a) (23). We show that all Lmr proteins confer a certain level of resistance to lincosamides; however, only the LmrA transporter and partially the LmrB 23S rRNA methyltransferase were required for the self-protection from the produced lincomycin. In contrast and more importantly, we revealed that the LmrC ABCF ATPase is dispensable for self-protection, but it is a key component of an antibiotic-induced cascade, which directs the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis through a transcriptional regulator, LmbU (24, 25), and in cooperation with LmrA and LmrB resistance proteins. The regulation-resistance unit characterized here represents the first reported antibiotic-driven activation of a BGC mediated by an ABCF resistance protein. At the same time, the dual resistance-regulatory function of the LmrC ABCF protein reported here is unprecedented. FIG 1Contribution of resistance proteins to the self-protection and lincomycin production. (a) Lincomycin and celesticetin BGCs share 18 biosynthetic genes encoding the common lincosamide scaffold (in gray) and lmrB/ccr1 resistance genes. Other structural genes encode the specific lincomycin and celesticetin biosynthetic steps (in white), and three remaining lincomycin BGC genes encode the transcriptional activator LmbU and resistance proteins LmrA and LmrC. (b) MIC and lincomycin production of the S. lincolnensis ATCC 25466 (WT) and lmrA (A), lmrB (B), and lmrC (C) knockout mutants show that only lmrA and lmrB are important for the self-protection of S. lincolnensis. (c) MICs of S. coelicolor M1154 with an empty vector or with the respective constitutively expressed resistance genes (subscript c). (d) Celesticetin production of the S. caelestis ATCC 15084. The MIC values are given as the means ± the SD of n ≥ 3 independent measurements. The level of significance of the fold change relative to WT (upper graph) or M1154 (lower graph) is shown (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). The “>” sign points to values that exceed 16,384 mg liter−1. The levels of lincosamide production for S. lincolnensis (n = 8) and S. caelestis (n = 10) are given as a percentage of the maximum production achieved by each strain. The overall table of lincosamide susceptibilities of complemented knockout mutants and MIC values for the mycelia of different growth stages are available in Fig. S1.

MICs were determined by the agar dilution method inoculated either with spores (n = 3 to 6) or with mycelium from the seed (42 h) and production (162 h) cultures (n = 2). Resistance genes were cloned under its natural promoter (subscript “n”), and under the constitutive ermEp promoter in plasmid pIJ10257 (subscript “c”), or plasmid pIJ6902 (subscript “c2”).
