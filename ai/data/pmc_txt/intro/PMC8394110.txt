1. Introduction The Bacillus genus comprises spore-forming bacteria found in various niches, such as oil, agricultural crops, fermented foods, and the human gastrointestinal tract [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Bacillus sp. can also be detected in kimchi using culture-dependent and -independent methods [7,8]. Bacillus spp. play important roles in the enhancement of the sensory properties of fermented foods via their amylolytic, lipolytic, and proteolytic activities [9,10,11,12,13]. Bacillus spp. have been used in the preparation of diverse fermented soybean products in northeast Asia for many centuries [14]. Furthermore, some Bacillus strains exhibit antibacterial activity against food pathogenic bacteria [15,16], anticancer effects on human colon cancer cells [17], and probiotic properties in humans and animals [18]. A B. polyfermenticus strain named B28 isolated from kimchi inhibited the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and Î²-catenin by human embryonic kidney 293 cells [19]. However, B. polyfermenticus has not yet been placed in the taxonomy database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information at June 2021 (NCBI; http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy) or in the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature [20]. Recently, several B. polyfermenticus strains have been reclassified: B. polyfermenticus GF423 was renamed B. velezensis variant polyfermenticus GF423 based on genome sequencing [21], and B. polyfermenticus KMU01 was reclassified as B. velezensis KMU01 [15]. Therefore, in this study, we examined the classification of strain B28 based on its whole genome sequence. We also undertook comparative genomic analysis to understand the functionality and safety of strain B28 and to assess its probiotic properties.
