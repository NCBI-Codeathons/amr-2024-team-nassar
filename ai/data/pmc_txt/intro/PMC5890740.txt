Introduction The increasing incidence of MDR pathogens has led to the dire prediction that humanity will soon enter the post-antibiotic era, when today's routine surgical procedures will become high-risk endeavours.1,2 This worrisome scenario is exacerbated by the paucity of new antibiotics reaching the market, and in particular of new chemical classes suitable for systemic administration and not affected by prevailing resistance mechanisms. Indeed, since the beginning of the century most antibacterial drugs introduced into human use or under advanced clinical development represent improved analogues of marketed compounds.3 Of particular concern are infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens, which include Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.4 In particular, infections by MRSA are associated with community and hospital infections, and up to 80% of all MRSA infections in the USA have been ascribed to the MRSA clone USA300, which is also highly resistant to other antibiotics.5 Given the limited options available to treat ESKAPE pathogens, it is important to develop new antibiotics that are not affected by prevailing resistance mechanisms, while at the same time devising strategies that minimize the spread of antibiotic resistance. One class of antibiotics that has been receiving increasing attention is represented by the lantibiotics. These compounds, which belong to the growing family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, are characterized by the presence of (methyl)-lanthionine bridges that confer rigidity and stability on the peptide.6 The prototype lantibiotic is nisin, which has been used for decades as a food preservative. One of the most potent lantibiotics is NAI-107 (Figure 1), a chlorine-containing compound active against MDR Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), VRE and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.7,8 Lantibiotics with similar antibacterial properties have been obtained after incorporation of Br into NAI-107, leading to NAI-108,9 or after semi-synthetic conversion, leading to NAI-857DA and related compounds.10 NAI-857DA and NAI-107/108 share a similar peptide scaffold and identical topology of thioether rings, with the first two N-terminal rings shared with nisin (Figure 1). A rapid bactericidal activity9–11 and a prolonged half-life in plasma12 are consistent with the efficacy of NAI-107 in different experimental models of infection in rodents13 and insects.14 The ratio between the area under the concentration–time curve and the MIC has been proposed as the pharmacodynamic index predictive of efficacy in the mouse.12 Figure 1.Structures of NAI-107 (top, where X = Cl), NAI-108 (top, where X = Br) and NAI-857DA (bottom).

Where appropriate, the properties of NAI-108 and NAI-857DA were also investigated.
