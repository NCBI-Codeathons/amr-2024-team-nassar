1. Introduction Anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) are any polyamide, or even their bio-co-polymer with esters, thioesters, or otherwise modified backbone, that can be made on a contemporary chemical peptide synthesizer [1]. This provides an option of taking advantage of using the remarkable toolkit of quantitative structure–activity relation (QSAR) [2,3] in designing novel anti-microbial-active sister molecules of any newly discovered natural drug-candidate AMP molecule. As for their biosynthesis, peptides of anti-microbial potential can be either ribosomal encoded (RP) single gene products [4] or enzymatically biosynthesized non-ribosomal templated peptides (NRP) [5], (NR-AMPs) [6]. Considering that there are already >100 peptide-based drugs that have been of clinical use (see [7]), an lookout at that field may be advisable. As for history, we refer to the review of Zasloff [8], who outlined those discoveries that can be considered as milestones, like cecropins [9], defensins [10,11], maganins [12], and add the proline-rich AMP (PrAMP family) [13,14] to the still incomplete list. Many derivatives of discovered natural AMPs have been chemically synthesized and or modified, and there are several excellent reviews [15,16,17,18,19] beyond the scope of this paper. The two selected targets here are Leishmania [20], a mammalian pathogen, transmittable by insects like cave-dwelling sand flies [21], and Histomonas meleagridis, the etiological agent of the life-threatening histomonosis (syn. blackhead disease) of poultry species such as turkeys, chickens, and pheasants, first described in 1893 [22,23], and have been studied in detail until the mid of last century [24]. In the actual study we aimed to investigate if any of those biosynthetic NR-AMPs, like fabclavine [25,26], phenazine [27], and others, produced by entomopathogenic–nematode symbiont bacteria (EPB) we have been studying [28,29] were suitable as anti-protozoal drug candidates against the intracellular parasite Leishmania or the extracellular parasite H. meleagridis. The arguments for choosing in vitro EPB liquid cultures as appropriate sources of efficient AMPs for this purpose are that obligate bacterial symbionts of entomopathogenic–nematode species synthesize and release several non-ribosomal hybrid peptides [30] with large target specificities. These mainly serve to provide well-balanced pathobiome conditions for this symbiosis in polyxenic soil and cadaver environments [31]. These peptides are also considered potential sources of potent natural anti-microbial compounds [30]. The motivation for choosing in vitro EPB liquid cultures as a source of efficient AMPs for this purpose is the proven activity on Gram-positive [32,33] and Gram-negative [34] pathogenic bacteria, oomycetes, and different plant pathogens [35,36] in our previous studies. Since we have reasons to believe that some of the autoclaved Xenorhabdus cultures may not be harmful or toxic when added as a food supplement, while some anti-microbial ingredients retain active [6], we consider the potential for probiotic applications, at least on an experimental level. The eukaryotic pathogens studied here include the Leishmania donovanii species, kinetoplastid protozoa [37], and the causative agent of human and canine leishmaniasis [38,39,40]. Leishmania are intracellular parasites that target professional phagocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells) [41] and human infection leads to diverse forms of disease from singular or diffuse cutaneous lesions (cutaneous leishmaniasis), invasive destruction of mucous membranes (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis), or dissemination to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow (visceral leishmaniasis) [42,43]. While mainly relegated to endemic foci in poor rural areas in the third world, the infections have a global impact due to human migration, climate change, and anthropogenic disturbance, causing significant worldwide health and economic burdens [44]. There are currently no approved vaccines available [45], leaving control of leishmaniasis reliant on chemotherapy [46]. The mainstays of therapy are antimonial derivatives [47] of amphotericin B (AmB), a polyene macrolide antibiotic derived from actinomycetes [48], which can be renally toxic and are not widely available in poor rural areas. Increasingly, there are issues with leishmanial infections that are resistant or refractory to antimony and amphotericin therapy. Miltefosine is the first oral agent approved for the treatment of leishmaniasis; however, there have been descriptions of miltefosine resistance [46]. There is an obvious need for the development of newer, less toxic agents to combat these infections. The other chosen pathogen, H. meleagridis, belongs to the Dientamoebidae, order Tritrichomanidida. Infections in turkeys may cause nearly 100% mortality whereas outbreaks in chickens, peafowl, quail, and pheasants are more often marked by morbidity and subsequent recovery. H. meleagridgridis is carried by the eggs of the cecal worm Heterakis gallinarum, enabling them to survive for long periods in the soil as a source of infection [22,23,24]. In the EU and USA, there are currently no drugs available for the treatment of blackhead disease [22,24]. (As for molecular taxonomy and identification, the 5.8S, ITS-1, and ITS-2 rRNA regions were first sequenced [49]. Since then, the complete, annotated Histomonas reference genome sequence became available [50]). Since the introduction of effective drugs into the market in the middle of the previous century, there was no practical need for further research. Following the recent ban of available drugs, research programs with new profiles were set up in various places focusing on different features of the parasite and the disease. Consequently, the poultry industry works without approved prophylactics, therapeutics, or vaccines to combat histomonosis [51]. Recently, numerous chemical and botanical compounds were also tested for their efficacy against H. meleagridis, with varying outcomes. One of the explanations for these half-failures/half-successes may be the complicated in vitro Histomonas culturing technique. In this context, it is of high importance that H. meleagridis relies on live bacteria and Escherichia coli strongly supports the growth of H. meleagridis in a monoxenic culture without influencing its pathogenicity [52]. In the previously mentioned study, a clonal cultures of H. meleagridis was further optimized to obtain a monoxenic culture in a liquid medium [52]. For this, the fecal flora was exchanged for defined bacterial strains by selective destruction of the initial bacteria with various antibiotics, keeping the flagellate alive. E. coli was found to strongly support the growth of the parasite, whereas Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less efficient. Whether the special feature of the parasite’s intricate interplay with bacteria in vitro and in vivo can be considered mutualistic or a predator-prey one is an open question [50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60]. (We are shared about it). The option of the monoxenic culturing technique may open a door to preliminary attempts to protect birds with cultured attenuated histomonads, forecasting the possibility of vaccination [56]. After banning all previously used prophylactic and therapeutic drugs against H. meleagridis in the USA and the European Union, benzimidazoles were tested but found inactive [61]. Similar half-successes were reported about various herbal substances, some of which showed good efficacy in vitro but failed in vivo [62]. Reduced sensitivity of H. meleagridis to nitarsone in vitro and in vivo was also shown [63]. A publication talked about that, identical monoxenic settings for cultures of the same H. meleagridis clonal strain, in its virulent low-passage and attenuated high-passage form, enabled a comparative analysis of parasite characteristics [64], but the conclusions severely contradict a previously cited, unambiguously reliable publication [59]. This debate is out of scope of the present paper. Herein, we compared the spectrum of in vitro anti-microbial/-prozozoal activity of cell-free conditioned culture media (CFCM) from three EPB species, together with testing against Leishmania donovanii, (together with Trypanosoma cruzi, as an expectedly negative control), Histomonas meleagridis, and also against a panel of clinical bacterial and fungal isolates, as positive controls. Considering the roles of the bacterial symbiont in the EPN/EPB symbiosis, we suppose that ani-protozoal compounds must coexist with other anti-microbial compounds in the CFCM of EPBs. Therefore, for reliable bioassays, we should use appropriate controls. Two main aspects should be taken into consideration: (A) To be able to distinguish between the specified antiprotist activity and general cytotoxicity of the future drug-candidate anti-microbial compounds in the CFCM. (B) To be able to identify the special antiprotist compounds. In this paper, we describe the very first steps toward these goals. For (A), one has to consider that the lack of uniformity regarding the choice of cell types for cytotoxicity assays may lead to incomparable and inconclusive data. In vitro assays relying solely on non-phagocytic cell models may not represent a realistic result, as the effect of an anti-leishmanial agent should ideally be presented based on its cytotoxicity profile against reticuloendothelial system cells [65]. In the Leishmania studies, we used the macrophage cell line J774A.1 [66,67,68], as a cytopathogenicity control test organism (see Section 2 Materials and Methods). In the Histomonas studies, we used the permanent chicken liver cells (LMH leghorn male hepatoma) cell line [6,69,70] as a cytopathogenicity control test organism (see Section 2 Materials and Methods). For (B), one has to take into consideration the following points: each NR-AMP-producing EPB cell is in the so-called primary (10) phase, or Phase 1 [71]. In other terms, the phenotypic precondition for antibiotic production (as well as the capability of symbiosis) of the EPB species is the primary phase [30,72,73]. For NR-AMP production, it means that in a liquid culture of the primary (10) cells (of each of the studied EPB species, strain, and isolate), more than one biosynthetic AMP is present simultaneously. Each expresses anti-microbial (maybe antiprotist) activity, so the anti-microbial (antiprotist) activity of a CFCM sample represents a cumulative activity. However, in an optimal test system, one would prefer to determine the anti-microbial activity of each of the single anti-microbial compounds one by one. Since the discovery that the activity (the “switch-on”/“switch-off” states) of those group genes (operons, biosynthetic gene complexes, and BGCs), which are responsible for the primary-secondary phenotypic phase shift in each known EPB strain, not only work under the control of the versatile regulator hexA [74,75], but are also coordinately regulated at a higher level (via hfq-gene controlled sRNS/HexA-mRNA base pairing). More precisely, the Hfq-dependent sRNA, ArcZ, directly base-pairs with the HexA-encoding mRNA [76,77,78]; it is possible to construct double-mutant strains from each EPB species (or isolate) following the genuine strategy called easyPACId (easy promoter-activated compound identification) approach [79]. Each biosynthesizes and releases only one single NR-AMP molecule into the culture media. This discovery may be a starting point of the renaissance of Xenorhabdus anti-microbial peptide research [76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83]. We managed to reconstruct the “easyPACId” hfq deletion mutant strains from EMA and EMC (Boros et al., in preparation) and publish here some information, including data about their anti-microbial potential. In this paper, we give an account of the details of constructing our hfq-del mutants from our EMA and EMC [29] strains and provide their phenotypic descriptions. Our “easyPACId” strains will be available for cooperation with fellow scientists worldwide.
