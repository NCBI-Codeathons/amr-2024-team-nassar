1. Introduction Terpenoids, with complicated and diverse structures, are the largest category of natural products. Up to date, more than 175,000 kinds of terpenoid-like and terpenoid-derived compounds have been collected in TeroKit (http://terokit.qmclab.com/, accessed on 1 November 2021) [1]. Sesterterpenoids are a class of rare terpenoids containing five isoprenyl units and are mainly isolated from metazoan, plants and fungi [1]. Although the amount of sesterterpenoids only accounts for less than 1.5% of the total terpenoids, many of these compounds show broad-spectrum biological activities and promising application prospects [1]. The 14/18-membered sesterterpenoids synthesized by terpene synthase LcTPS2 from Leucosceptrum canum exhibit significant immunosuppressive activity [2]. Asperterpenols A and B isolated from Aspergillus sp. 085242 strongly inhibit acetylcholinesterase [3,4]. Nine new sesterterpenoids synthesized by a silent gene cluster in Aspergillus ustus 094102 were identified by gene mining, among which aspergilol A and B showed cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 [5]. Ophiobolins belong to sesterterpenoids with a 5-8-5 tricyclic skeleton. In total, 112 ophiobolins have been discovered so far [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18], most of which are isolated from fungi of the genus Bipolaris and Aspergillus [6]. Ophiobolins show excellent biological activities, especially cytotoxicity. Ophiobolin A exhibits notable activities against CLL and P388 cell lines [19,20]. Ophiobolin O can inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 and reverse the resistance of MCF-7/ADR to adriamycin [21,22]. The pharmacological mechanism study of 6-epi-ophiobolin G shows that it can be used as a potential estrogen receptor down-regulator to treat breast cancer cells [23]. Though researchers have achieved the total chemical synthesis of (+)-ophiobolin A, (-)-6-epi-ophiobolin N and (+)-6-epi-ophiobolin A, it is severely limited by a high cost and low yield [24,25,26]. The first ophiobolin F (1) synthase AcOS was found from A. clavatus [27]. Following this, an ophiobolin biosynthesis gene cluster (obl) from A. clavatus, Bipolaris maydes producing ophiobolin A and Emericella variecolor (renamed to Aspergillus stellatus) and producing ophiobolin K (2) were reported (Figure S1) [28]. In the obl, chimeric terpene synthase OblAAc/Bm/As catalyzes the formation of backbone 1. P450 monooxygenase OblBBm/As is involved in the oxidative modification of 1 to form ophiobolin C (3); then, 6-epi-ophiobolin C (4) and 6-epi-ophiobolin N (5) were formed by non-enzymatic transformation from 3. Moreover, it has been proposed that FAD-dependent oxidoreductase OblCAc catalyzes the C17-allyl formation of 2 in the side chain of 3 [28]. A. ustus 094102 produces a series of ophiobolins (2 and 6–9) (Figure 1) [7,29]. POC8003 (renamed to oblAu) was verified to be responsible for ophiobolin biosynthesis in A. ustus 094102, which contains au8003 (renamed to oblAAu), au8002 (renamed to oblBAu) and au8001 (renamed to oblRAu) (Figure S1 and Figure 2a) [29]. OblAAu has been identified as ophiobolin F synthase [29], and OblBAu was found as a P450 enzyme that could bind to carbon monoxide [30]. However, no gene was found to exist in oblAu that codes for an enzyme similar to OblC, which may catalyze the formation of a C16=C17 double bond to generate 2. Additionally, the putative transporter OblD that plays an essential role in the synthesis of ophiobolins [28] has not been clarified in oblAu. In this study, we confirm the function of genes in oblAu and find the unclustered OblCAu that catalyzes the formation of C17-allyl groups. Moreover, the transport process of intermediates and products in ophiobolin biosynthesis is displayed.
