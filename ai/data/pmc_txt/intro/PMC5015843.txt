Introduction The outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics of human plague are caused by Yersinia pestis subsp. pestis strains that possess universal hypervirulence for a wide range of mammals and are ubiquitously distributed [1–4]. The representatives of a more ancestral subsp. microtus are endemic within populations of some voles (Microtus spp.) and cause only rare sporadic diseases [1, 5] with no human-to-human transmission [5]. Strains of both subspecies can make a proteinaceous capsule first described by Alexandre Yersin [6]. This antiphagocytic capsule [7] is the main component of plague vaccines [8–11] and is the most important target for laboratory diagnosis of plague [12]. Capsule biogenesis is implemented by a conserved chaperone/usher pathway [13]. Caf1 structural subunit is encoded by a 510-nucleotide caf1 gene. The precursor protein contains 170 amino acids. The typical cleavage site is located between Ala21 and Ala22 residues [14]. Recently it was shown that a single nucleotide substitution found in the bv. caucasica strains Pestoides F [15] and G8786 [16] resulted in Ala48 → Ser48 substitution, while mutations in Y. pestis E1979001 (bv. antiqua) and F1991016 (bv. orientalis) resulted only in truncation down to 147 and 130 amino-acid residues giving, most likely, non-functional peptides. More recently, sequencing of caf1 gene from 41 subsp. microtus strains isolated from voles and their fleas in Georgia and Armenia indicated that all of them had the same Ala48 → Ser48 substitution (caf1 NT2, accession no. EF165977), while the strains isolated from gerbils and susliks of the same region carried the gene with a canonic sequence (caf1 NT1, accession no. EF165976) [17]. In this study, we provide the first evidence that the allele type NT2 (Ser48 Phe117) is unique to the Transcaucasian-highland and Pre-Araks natural plague foci, while a novel NT3 type (Ala48 Val117) is endemic in Dagestan-highland natural plague focus. This is supported by sequencing data on the caf1 genes from 119 strains of Y. pestis belonging to seven out of eight biovars of subsp. microtus [4]. Our computational analysis revealed that the Caf1 isoforms found in Y. pestis endemic strains should not make them significantly different in terms of pathogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated serologic cross-reactivity and cross-protection of the Caf1 isoforms. All the three isoforms could be equally detected by immunochromatography test for plague. When compared to the classic Caf1NT1, endemic Caf1NT2 and Caf1NT3 had lower immunoreactivity in ELISA and lower indices of self- and cross-immunity. However, although a notable reduction in the cross-protection was observed between all isoforms, the polymorphisms in the caf1 gene may not provide for Caf1NT2 or Caf1NT3
Y. pestis strains the possibility to escape from the Caf1NT1-mediated plague immunity in the case of a low-dose flea-borne infection.
