1. Introduction The Streptomyces genus is the most prolific producer of bioactive molecules that include numerous substances useful to human, animal, and plant health [1]. Some of these molecules have a signaling function and play a role in regulatory cascades leading to pathogenesis [2,3], but most of them have an antibiotic function [4]. It has long been known that the biosynthesis of most antibiotics takes place in the period of slow or no growth and that phosphate limitation is a major trigger of antibiotics biosynthesis [5]. Phosphate is not only a crucial element of cellular components such as membranous lipids and nucleic acids, it is also constitutive of the energetic molecules, ATP and polyphosphate (polyP). It is thus indispensable to most anabolic reactions and thus to life. In consequence, high and low extracellular concentration of Pi are correlated with high and low intracellular concentration of ATP and polyP [6]. Several reports indicate that when the concentration of Pi in the growth medium falls below a certain threshold (condition of Pi limitation), the bacteria triggers various adaptive responses to face this situation and restores its energetic balance [6,7]. One of the major responses to phosphate limitation is the induction of the expression of the two component system (TCS) PhoR/PhoP [7] that positively controls the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the scavenging and uptake of phosphate (Pi) and negatively controls the expression of genes involved in the assimilation of nitrogen (N) [8,9]. Furthermore, some molecules signaling severe nutritional/energetic stress are also synthetized in these conditions. These include external signaling molecules such as those involved in quorum sensing (butyrolactone, homoserine lactoneâ€¦) [10] and/or internal signaling molecules such as ppGpp, cyclic di GMP, etc. [11,12]. Numerous reports in the literature indicate that these molecules play a role in the triggering of antibiotic biosynthesis [13,14]. However, the links between a limitation in phosphate and the production of antibiotics remains poorly understood. In this Issue, a novel understanding of such links and novel functions of the antibiotics in the physiology of the producer are proposed. These proposals are based on recent experimental data from our group as well as on careful analysis of the abundant literature of the field.
