1. Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that 80% of the developing world still benefits from the use of traditional medicines derived from medicinal plants [1,2,3]. The total estimated number of plants is approximately 374,000 [4] in comparison to 28,187 medicinal species used by humans [5]. WHO has also recorded the names of over 20,000 species of medicinal plants [6] and described medicinal plants as one of the potential sources of new drugs [7]. More than 100 countries have developed regulations for medicinal plants. There are over 1340 plants with defined antimicrobial activity and over 30,000 antimicrobial compounds have been isolated from plants [8]. Moreover, it has been estimated that 14â€“28% of higher plant species are medicinal and that 74% of bioactive plant-derived compounds were discovered based on ethnomedicinal uses [9]. The extensive, inappropriate, irregular, and indiscriminate uses of antibiotics have resulted in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, making many currently available medications ineffective [10,11,12]. This emerging trend is concerning and considered by the WHO to be perhaps the most urgent issue facing medical science [13]. Therefore, there is an increasing demand to develop new antimicrobial agents that are able to decrease the use of antibiotics and to face resistance development. This has directed researchers to isolate and identify new bioactive chemicals from plants to act against microbial resistance [14,15,16,17], also considering that approximately 50% of current pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals are natural products and their derivatives [18]. Medicinal plants yield an almost unlimited source of bioactive compounds and their use as antimicrobial agents has been exploited in different ways [19,20]. Notwithstanding, the compounds have not yet been thoroughly investigated [21]. Natural antimicrobial agents can act alone or in combination with antibiotics to enhance antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microbes [22,23]. As the antimicrobial action of many medicinal plants is still unexplored, researchers are increasingly targeting the search for fast-growing new and effective treatments. [24,25]. The information required to evaluate the efficacy of potentially important medicinal plants and to prove their antimicrobial worth needs to be efficient and well-validated. Therefore, to obtain a more comprehensive perspective of the potential use of medicinal plant extracts as alternative solutions to combat drug resistance, the most relevant studies regarding the validation of the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants, the underlying mechanisms of action, the mechanisms of bacterial resistance, the plant-derived chemical compounds that may be responsible for such activity, the challenges and future perspectives of medicinal plant antimicrobial activity were critically analyzed in this review.
