Introduction Research on glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) – drugs of “last resort” for treating severe infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens – has experienced a “renaissance” over the last decade (Marcone et al., 2018). Clinically important GPAs include two natural products (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and three second generation antibiotics (telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin), which are semisynthetic derivatives of natural products endowed with an increased antimicrobial potency and superior pharmacokinetic properties. The urgent need for new potent antibiotics has driven much recent interest in GPAs. For example, chemical synthesis recently resulted in the generation of a plethora of vancomycin derivatives with novel modifications that show superior antimicrobial activities (Okano et al., 2017; Wu and Boger, 2019), while teicoplanin has been conjugated with nanoparticles resulting in increased activity against biofilm-forming pathogens (Armenia et al., 2018). In contrast, genetic manipulation of GPA producers to yield novel potent derivatives is in its infancy. Recent work (Haslinger et al., 2015; Peschke et al., 2017; Schoppet et al., 2019) has revealed new details of the specificity and timing of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, including chlorination and cross-linking steps, suggesting that the use of combinatorial biosynthesis to generate GPAs with completely novel oligopeptide scaffolds should be possible. In parallel, heterologous expression of enzymes involved in later stages of GPA biosynthesis (glycosylation, sulfation, acylation etc.) in known producers or in vitro has already generated novel GPA derivatives that could not be prepared easily by chemical synthesis (Banik and Brady, 2008; Banik et al., 2010; Yim et al., 2014). In the meantime, genome sequencing has revealed the organization of GPA biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in industrially valuable actinobacteria (D’Argenio et al., 2016), including long known GPA-producers (Vongsangnak et al., 2012; Truman et al., 2014; Kusserow and Gulder, 2017; Nazari et al., 2017; Adamek et al., 2018) as well as in novel producing strains (Thaker et al., 2013; Stegmann et al., 2014). Although the global regulation of GPA biosynthesis is still largely unexplored, the pathway-specific regulation controlling the expression of BGCs is being elucidated in model systems (Bibb, 2013). The roles of cluster-situated regulatory genes have been investigated in Amycolatopsis balhimycina (Shawky et al., 2007), Nonomuraea gerenzanensis (Lo Grasso et al., 2015; Alduina et al., 2018), and Actinoplanes teichomyceticus (Horbal et al., 2014b; Yushchuk et al., 2019), producing balhimycin, A40926 (the natural precursor of dalbavancin), and teicoplanin, respectively. Overexpression of the teicoplanin cluster-situated regulatory genes (tei15*, coding for a StrR-like transcriptional regulator, and tei16*, coding for a LuxR-type regulator) in A. teichomyceticus markedly increased teicoplanin production in the wild type strain, representing one of the most successful examples of using molecular tools for improving antibiotic production (Horbal et al., 2012, 2014b). In this work, we investigated the potential of molecular tools to improve the production of A40926, the dalbavancin precursor. The BGC for A40926, named dbv, contains two genes encoding transcriptional regulators: dbv3 and dbv4 (Lo Grasso et al., 2015). dbv3 encodes a LuxR-type regulator, which, however, is non-orthologous to the tei cluster encoded LuxR-regulator – Tei16* (Yushchuk et al., 2019). dbv4 codes for a StrR-like transcriptional regulator with close homologues in every GPA BGC (Yushchuk et al., 2019). The A40926-producing strain, recently re-classified as N. gerenzanensis (Dalmastri et al., 2016), belongs to a still poorly investigated genus of actinobacteria that was only recently identified as an untapped source of novel antibiotics and other bioactive metabolites (Sungthong and Nakaew, 2015). More recently, fully sequenced genomes of N. gerenzanensis (D’Argenio et al., 2016) and of the kistamicin producer Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 55076, previously classified as Actinomadura parvosata subsp. kistnae S382–8 (Kusserow and Gulder, 2017; Nazari et al., 2017), have confirmed the hidden potential of these uncommon actinomycetes as prolific producers of specialized metabolites. In this paper, we report that another member of this genus, Nonomuraea coxensis DSM 45129, which was isolated in Bangladesh in 2007 (Ara et al., 2007), has the genetic potential to produce A40926 or a very similar GPA; its BGC contains two regulatory genes, nocRI and nocRII, which are close homologs of dbv3 and dbv4, respectively. Thus, we first developed the molecular tools to manipulate both N. gerenzanensis and N. coxensis, we then selected the strongest heterologous promoter to drive gene expression in Nonomuraea spp., and finally we overexpressed both native and heterologous cluster-specific regulatory genes in N. gerenzanensis, assessing the best performers at flask and bioreactor scale in industrial media. The overexpression of the positive pathway-specific regulators significantly increased the level of A40926 production in N. gerenzanensis, paving the way for knowledge-based strain improvement for the production of this valuable GPA.
