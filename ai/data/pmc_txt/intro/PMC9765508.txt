INTRODUCTION To cope with changing environments, most bacteria produce nucleotide signaling molecules, such as the alarmone guanosine tetra/pentaphosphate [(p)ppGpp] (1) to survive various stresses (2, 3). (p)ppGpp concentrations can range from micromolar to low millimolar levels in cells (4, 5) to directly regulate many central cellular processes, including transcription, translation, DNA replication, and purine metabolism (6–11). Apart from (p)ppGpp, nucleotides such as pGpp (12) and AppppA (13) can also function as alarmones, while (p)ppApp has been recently reported as a toxin (14). Cellular (p)ppGpp concentration is dictated by its turnover via dedicated alarmone synthetases and hydrolases (15, 16), highlighting their fundamental importance in alarmone signaling. Alarmone synthetases and hydrolases belong to the RelA/SpoT homologs (RSHs) superfamily (16), which is further classified into multidomain “long” RSHs or single-domain homologs known as small alarmone synthetases (SASs), or small alarmone hydrolases (SAHs) (10, 15). Long RSHs include the synthetase RelA (1) and the bifunctional synthetase and hydrolase Rel (17) and SpoT (18), which produce (p)ppGpp and in some cases pGpp (19). Examples of SASs include SasA (RelP), SasB (RelQ), and RelV (20–23), which produce (p)ppGpp and in some cases pGpp (24) or (p)ppApp (25). In addition, SAS homologs have been reported to be growth-inhibiting toxins in contact-dependent inhibition or phage defense, by producing (p)ppApp to a toxic high concentration (14, 26) or by pyrophosphorylating tRNA to inactivate its essential function in protein translation (27). In contrast to long RSHs or SASs, SAHs contain only the alarmone hydrolase domain. SAHs are classified into seven different subgroups (16): paSpo, pbcSpo, pbcSpo2, Mesh1, Mesh1-L, rickSpo, and divSpo. SAHs were first identified in metazoans as Mesh1 (28) and more recently in bacteria (26, 29–31). Mesh1 has been reported to hydrolyze ppGpp (28, 30) and the metabolic cofactor NADPH (32, 33). Mesh1 can regulate development, nutritional stress response, ferroptosis, sleep behavior, endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis, and cell viability in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and human cells (33–37). In contrast, much less is understood about SAHs in bacteria. Recent reports showed that SAHs can function as self-resistance antitoxins against SAS toxins such as Tas1 (14) and FaRel and FaRel2 (26) by hydrolyzing alarmones such as (p)ppApp (29) or by depyrophosphorylation of pyrophosphorylated tRNA (27). However, the physiological roles of bacterial SAHs beyond antagonizing toxins remain uncharacterized. Xanthomonas campestris is a pathogenic plant bacterium with a broad host range (38–40). Xanthomonas carries two multidomain RSH enzymes that are responsible for (p)ppGpp production and hydrolysis (Fig. 1A, Table 1). Intriguingly, the majority of Xanthomonas species also carry a putative SAH (Fig. 1A, Table 1) belonging to the Mesh1-L subgroup (16), although no toxic alarmone synthetases coexist in the genome. Therefore, we characterized this orphan SAH from the model pathogen X. campestris pv. campestris
in vitro under laboratory conditions and in its native environments. We found that the XccSAH was highly promiscuous and hydrolyzed multiple alarmones and the cofactor NADPH. In contrast to the multidomain RSHs, which are required for X. campestris pv. campestris pathogenesis, as we reported previously (41), XccSAH is not required for leaf infection but contributes to various aspects of X. campestris pv. campestris physiology, including modulation of (pp)pGpp levels during starvation, survival against competing Pseudomonas species, as well as metabolism of cellular NADH and growth under defined conditions. Our results provide an example of how SAHs can play multiple biological roles in bacteria beyond functioning as antitoxins, suggesting a unifying theme of SAHs as multifunctional physiology regulators in both bacteria and metazoans.
