1. Introduction Filamentous fungi are prolific producers of secondary metabolites. These metabolites are a wide group of diverse organic molecules that contribute to fundamental biological processes in fungi, including defense, communication with other microorganisms, and virulence in pathogenic interactions [1,2]. Many fungal secondary metabolites are bioactive molecules with medical and/or commercial interests [1,3]. Therefore, their study is an exciting topic of scientific and applied interest. Penicillium is one of the most important fungal genera in the field of secondary metabolites. The most emblematic example is Penicillium chrysogenum (reclassified as Penicillium rubens), the industrial producer of penicillin [4,5]. Beyond P. chrysogenum, several studies have highlighted the potential of other members of the genus Penicillium as potential producers of a vast and diverse array of secondary metabolites of interest [6,7,8,9]. Among these fungi, Penicillium roqueforti emerges as one of the most interesting species. During the last years, much progress has been made in the secondary metabolism of this fungus. In this review, we summarize and update the main aspects of the secondary metabolism of P. roqueforti focusing on the metabolites produced by this fungus, their biosynthesis, and regulatory mechanisms.
