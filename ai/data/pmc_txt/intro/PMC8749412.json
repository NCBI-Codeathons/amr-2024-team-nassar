["INTRODUCTION", "Bioactive natural products and secondary metabolites are a major source of novel antibiotics. Most of the natural drugs identified in the last 40\u2009years originate from soil and marine bacteria, such as actinomycetes in particular (1). Antibacterial products are ancient, and the origins of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding polyketide molecules, such as erythromycin, may date back to 800 million years ago (2). Logically, antimicrobial resistance may, therefore, be just as ancient.", "Bacteria carrying BGCs encoding antimicrobial agents require protective mechanisms against these compounds (3), to ensure that their production leads to the destruction of other susceptible microorganisms without causing suicide of the producing bacterium. Over time, a copy of the self-resistance determinant integrates into the BGC, leading to coregulated expression, often through incorporation into the same operon. It has been suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of entire groups of genes plays a role in the evolution of BGCs and resistance. Over time, bacteria acquire resistance elements reflecting their current and past encounters with antibiotic producers (4). It has become clear that the environment is the source of an almost unlimited diversity of antibiotic resistance elements that are both extremely specific (e.g., inactivating enzymes) and broad (e.g., efflux systems), enabling the bacterium to counteract most antibiotics. Modification of the antibiotic target is one of the ways in which bacteria protect themselves from the lethal effects of their own antibiotics. Saccharopolyspora erythraea, which produces erythromycin, also produces an enzyme that attaches a methyl group to a specific site on the 23S rRNA, reducing the affinity of ribosomes for this antibiotic (5). Another mechanism of resistance involves modification of the antibiotic. Some aminoglycoside (AG)-producing actinomycete strains also produce enzymes that inactivate this class of antibiotics by adding phosphate, acetate, or adenylate groups (6). Brevibacillus brevis uses an N-acetyltransferase to modify the antimicrobial peptide edeine (EDE) (7).", "The entomopathogenic bacteria from the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus were formerly assigned to the Enterobacteriaceae but have recently been reclassified as members of the Morganellaceae (8). These two genera form tight sister groups, and their members have specific and persistent mutualistic relationships with the infective juveniles (IJs) of soil nematodes (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae, respectively). These entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) cooperate with Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus symbionts to kill a broad range of soil-dwelling insect larval hosts (9). It has been suggested that the ancestors of the symbiotic bacteria of EPNs arose due to ecological events about 375 million years ago and that they provided EPNs with the opportunity to colonize new nematode hosts (10). Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are both obligate symbionts of EPNs. Indeed, EPN-symbiotic bacteria have never been found living freely in soil, although metagenomics studies have recently detected their presence in a minority microbiota associated with the production of insect larvae (11). However, Photorhabdus has been isolated in a dozen cases of soft tissue abscesses and disseminated bacteremia in humans in the United States and Australia (12, 13). It has become evident that as long suspected, Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are excellent sources of novel antimicrobial metabolites (14). EPN-symbiotic bacteria have a complex secondary metabolism characterized by the production of large amounts of specialized secondary metabolites, such as polyketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) (15). Many bioactive metabolites from diverse chemical classes with nematicidal, antifungal, or antibacterial activity have been reported (16). It has been suggested that the antimicrobial compounds produced by EPN-symbiotic bacteria kill foreign bacterial competitors, to protect the cadavers of the insects in which they multiply from invasion by other microbes (14). Two novel lead compounds from EPN-symbiotic bacteria are currently in pipelines for the development of novel classes of antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections (17). The first of these classes is the odilorhabdins (ODLs), NRP secondary metabolites from Xenorhabdus (18). The second corresponds to darobactin A, a natural product discovered by screening Photorhabdus symbionts directly targeting an integral outer membrane protein (19). ODLs, the first-in-class antibiotics, were discovered, as part of a program aiming to renew the therapeutic antibacterial arsenal, by screening a collection of Xenorhabdus species for antimicrobial activity (18, 20). NOSO-95A, -B, and -C, natural ODLs, were isolated from Xenorhabdus nematophila K102 (18). They are 10-mer linear cationic peptides containing six proteinogenic and four to six nonproteinogenic amino acids (Fig.\u00a01A), with promising broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (21). Efforts to develop this new antimicrobial class have been pursued: NOSO-502 is the first candidate from the ODL family to undergo preclinical development for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections (22, 23). The members of the ODL family have bactericidal action through the specific inhibition of bacterial translation resulting from their interaction with the 30S ribosomal subunit at a site not exploited by other clinically useful antibiotics. They bind to the ribosome in the vicinity of the decoding center (DC), interacting simultaneously with the nucleotides of the 16S rRNA and the anticodon loop of the incoming A-site aminoacyl-tRNA. At low concentrations, ODLs cause the misincorporation of amino acids by decreasing decoding fidelity, whereas at high concentrations, they interfere with the progression of the ribosome along the mRNA. The ability of ODLs to cause miscoding is probably responsible for their bactericidal activity (18, 24). As expected, given that ODLs contain nonproteinogenic amino acids synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), the putative BGC contains four large NRPS-encoding genes (odl1, odl2, odl3, and odl4) (18). Only a few mutant bacteria resistant to ODLs have been reported to date. For example, the His56Tyr variant of the ribosomal protein S10 confers a high degree of resistance to ODLs and has been identified in Escherichia coli (18). The S10 gene is located close to the 16S rRNA gene. A similar resistance profile was observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae strains bearing mutations affecting the CrrAB two-component system (TCS) (22, 25). CrrB mutations cause NOSO-502 resistance by upregulating the KexD efflux pump. This system is also known to decrease colistin sensitivity (25).", "FIG\u00a01NOSO-95C structure (A), recombineering construction of the X. nematophila odl-BGC locus (B), and complementation in Xenorhabdus mutants (C and D).

We investigated the mechanism of self-resistance by cloning the odl-BGC. We also assessed the possible involvement of genes flanking this cluster in resistance. A Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT)-encoding gene, oatA, was identified as responsible for resistance. In vitro acetylation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses were performed to identify the target of the enzyme. Multiacetylated forms of NOSO-95C lost their antibacterial activity and were unable to inhibit translation in an in vitro translation assay, revealing the molecular mechanism of self-resistance. A molecular study of the distribution of oatA revealed that this self-resistance gene was cis-linked to the odilorhabdin BGC and found only in X. nematophila and a single phylogenetic clade of Photorhabdus formerly classified as the species Photorhabdus luminescens."]
