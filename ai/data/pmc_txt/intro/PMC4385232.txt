Introduction Biosurfactants become increasingly attractive based on their biodegradability and production on the basis of renewable resources (Banat et al. 2010). Surfactin is one of the most popular biosurfactants and was already discovered in 1968 by Arima et al. (1968). The lipopeptide consists of a seven amino acid peptide ring comprising a β-hydroxy fatty acid. Surfactin is produced by Bacillus subtilis, a gram positive bacterium known for its application in several industrial processes, for instance the production of detergent enzymes and others (Schallmey et al. 2004). The molecule exhibits various different characteristics, which might lead to several applications. For instance, Surfactin was shown to improve plant self-resistance mechanism against soil bacteria (Ongena et al. 2007) or vigorously affects mycoplasma cells (Vollenbroich et al. 1997). Therefore, next to an application in detergents, washing agents or food products, a usage in agriculture or pharmaceutical products is also imaginable. Naturally, amphiphile molecules produced by bacteria in cultivation processes accumulate at gas–liquid interfaces and lead to massive foam formation. The main challenge in cultivating microorganisms producing biosurfactants is to overcome this severe foam production. In the majority of cases foaming is handled by the addition of antifoam agents. Unfortunately, this strategy harbors several disadvantages, as antifoam agents are expensive and very hard to remove in downstream processes. The second most common method to cope with foam formation is to disrupt the foam by shear stress or pressure using foam breakers. However, this method is often insufficient and increases the overall costs for the production of biosurfactants. Another, more elegant, way to manage foaming in biosurfactant production processes is to apply foam fractionation, which was already shown by Cooper et al. 1981 (Cooper et al. 1981). This technique inverts the disadvantage into an advantage by using the accumulation of biosurfactants in the foam for in situ product enrichment and recovery. The Surfactin producer Bacillus subtilis is especially suited for the employment of foam fractionation, yielding high values in product recovery and enrichment (Willenbacher et al. 2014). Although this is a possible way to handle foam and to improve product yields, a realization in industrial scale is probably unrealistic in the near future. Another artful approach is to avoid foaming at all instead of dealing with it. Several attempts have been made to establish foam-free fermentation processes. Ohno et al. for instance employed a solid state fermentation of recombinant Bacillus subtilis MI113 (pC112), using soybean curd residue as solid substrate (Ohno et al. 1995), which led to a yield of 2.0 g/kg (Surfactin per wet weight). Another attempt to produce Surfactin in a foam-free fashion implemented a membrane bioreactor (Coutte et al. 2010). A culture of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 obtained a maximal Surfactin concentration of 0.242 g/L. However, a significant amount of Surfactin was adsorbed at the membranes and oxygen transfer was reduced significantly. In contrast, Chtioui et al. focused on a rotating disc bioreactor for the production of Surfactin, allowing Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 to grow free and immobilized in a biofilm at the same time (Chtioui et al. 2012). Aeration was realized above the fluid level, when the overgrown discs arose from the liquid. Maximal Surfactin concentrations of 0.212 g/L were obtained, but oxygen supply was limited and Fengycin concentrations surpassed Surfactin concentrations by far. While all these studies implemented innovative ideas to circumvent foaming, those processes are either difficult to scale up or lack high specificity. Bacillus subtilis was for a long time believed to be a strict aerobic bacterium. Since 1995 research on the anaerobic growth behavior of Bacillus subtilis increased dramatically (Hoffmann et al. 1995; Nakano et al. 1997). By using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, Bacillus subtilis is able to perform anaerobic respiration via a nitrate reductase encoded by operon narGHJI (Ramos et al. 1995). In this manner nitrate is reduced to nitrite, which thereafter is transformed to ammonium via a nitrite reductase encoded by nasDEF (Nakano et al. 1998). The production of biosurfactants under anaerobic conditions was already shown in 1985. The study presents the production of an undefined biosurfactant by Bacillus licheniformis in glucose mineral salt medium (Javaheri et al. 1985). The cultivation was performed in shake flasks, in the course of which the decreasing surface tension (from 70 mN/m to 28 mN/m) was measured. Although the characterization of the biosurfactant was only performed by thin layer chromatography and no high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied, Javaheri et al. laid the foundation of anaerobic biosurfactant production. Subsequently, Davis et al. investigated the impact of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen conditions on Surfactin production of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 (Davis et al. 1999). Interestingly, maximal product yields were obtained under nitrate-limited and oxygen-depleted conditions (YP/X = 0.075), which gives a further impulse to examine anaerobic Surfactin production. The proof of concept was provided by Zhang et al., who produced Surfactin with Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 strictly anaerobic for the first time (Zhang et al. 2007). The investigation focused on a connected shake flask system, introducing a nitrogen flow to induce vigorous foaming. The foam was channeled through several flasks with distilled water to collect the produced biosurfactant. While these studies demonstrate that anaerobic production of Surfactin is possible, none of them propose a solution to overcome foaming. The aim of the current study is to combine the relatively new research field of anaerobic biosurfactant production with a foam-free bioprocess strategy (Figure 1 B). Therefore the anaerobic growth behavior of Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T was investigated in a 2.5 L benchtop bioreactor without any gas flow through the liquid phase. Four different glucose concentrations were tested and evaluated regarding their influence on Surfactin production. The processes were analyzed focusing on maximal Surfactin concentrations (cSurfactin), growth rates (μmax), product and substrate yields (YP/X, YX/S, YP/S), specific production rates (qSurfactin) and specific volumetric production rates (vol. qSurfactin).Figure 1
