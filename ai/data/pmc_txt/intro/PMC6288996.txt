Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by multiple invasive and symmetrical joint inflammation and organic dysfunction (1). Abnormal interactions among inflammatory cells, such as Th17 cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), fibroblasts and osteoclasts, in inflamed tissues significantly contribute to the occurrence and evolution of autoimmune arthritis, mainly through molecular docking or the release of active products (2). Among CD4+ T cell subpopulations, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a limited valuable subpopulation in RA treatment, and the balance of Th17 cells and Tregs is an important factor associated with the development of inflammation (1, 3). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) comprise a group of highly heterogeneous cells derived from immature myeloid progenitors that are typically divided into two subpopulations: polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSCs) and monocytic (MO-MDSCs) MDSCs (4â€“6). Although numerous reports have demonstrated the potent immunosuppression effects of MDSCs under abnormal conditions, the roles of MDSCs and their subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis remain unclear. As research about MDSCs in arthritis progresses, differences in the roles and actions of MDSC subpopulations have stimulated growing interest among researchers. In this review, we summarize the current research findings of MDSC subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis and evaluate the prospects of their application.
