Introduction The increase in availability of bacterial whole-genome sequencing provides large amounts of data for evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis. However, there is great variation in the quality, annotation and phylogenetic skew of the data available in large universal databases, meaning that evolutionary and phylogenetic studies can be challenging. To address this variation, curated, high-level, taxa-specific, non-redundant sub-databases need to be assembled to aid detailed analysis. Given that there is a direct correlation between phylogenetic distance and the discovery of novel function [1–3], it is imperative that any derived databases must be phylogenetically representative and non-redundant to enable insight into the evolution of genes, proteins and pathways within a given group of taxa [1]. The phylum 
Actinobacteria
 is a major taxon amongst the Bacteria, which includes phenotypically and morphologically diverse organisms found on every continent and in virtually every ecological niche [4]. They are particularly common in soils, yet within their ranks are potential human and animal pathogens such as 
Corynebacterium
, 
Mycobacterium
, 
Nocardia
 and 
Tropheryma
, inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract (
Bifidobacterium
 and 
Scardovia
), as well as plant commensals and pathogens such as 
Frankia
, 
Leifsonia
 and 
Clavibacter
 [4, 5]. Perhaps the most notable trait of the phylum is the renowned ability to produce bioactive natural products such as antibiotics, anti-cancer agents and immuno-suppressive agents, with genera such as 
Amycolatopsis
, 
Micromonospora
 and 
Streptomyces
 being particularly prominent [6]. As a result, computational ‘mining’ of actinobacterial genomes has become an important part of the drug-discovery pipeline, with increasing numbers of online resources and software devoted to identification of natural-product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [7–9]. It is important to move beyond approaches that rely on similarity searches of known BGCs and to expand searches to identify hidden chemical diversity within the genomes [6, 7, 10–13]. A recent study of 830 actinobacterial genomes found >11 000 BGCs comprising 4122 chemical families, indicating that there is a vast diversity of strains and chemistry to exploit [14], yet within each of these strains there will be hidden diversity in the form of cryptic BGCs. To exploit this undiscovered diversity as the technology develops and databases expand, new biosynthetic logic will emerge, yet we know little of how natural selection shapes the evolution of BGCs and how biosynthetic precursors are supplied to gene products of BGCs from primary metabolism and to identify targets for metabolic engineering of industrially relevant strains. Such logic will expedite industrial strain improvement processes, enabling titre increases and development of novel molecules, as well as the engineering of strains to use more sustainable feedstocks. To aid this process, we have created an actinobacterial metabolism database including functional annotations for enzymes from 612 species to enable phylum-wide interrogation of gene expansion events that may indicate adaptive evolution, help shape metabolic robustness for antibiotic production [15] or enable the identification of targets for metabolic engineering. Actinobacterial Database for Evolutionary Studies (ActDES) provides a curated list of high-quality, phylum-specific genomes and data to help users navigate the redundancy and inconsistency in sequence databases in a simplified format that enables researchers with little taxonomic knowledge to develop testable evolutionary hypotheses. To demonstrate the utility of ActDES, we have detailed its construction and used it to investigate the glucose permease/glucokinase system phylogeny across the
