1. Introduction Natural products, also known as specialized metabolites (SM) [1], are the richest source of bioactive compounds used in medicine, livestock, and agriculture [2]. Among microorganisms, bacteria belonging to the Streptomyces genus stand out for producing the highest percentage of SM, and about 68% of the most important bioactive SM [3]. Since the first Streptomyces genomes were sequenced [4,5], it became clear that these bacteria have the capacity to encode far more biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) for SM than was initially expected. Over the last twenty years, several bioinformatics tools have been developed to search for BGCs including the Antibiotic and Secondary Metabolites Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) [6,7,8]. This tool has greatly facilitated identifying a huge number of BGCs in Streptomyces, which highlighted the potential of their genomes to encode a vast number of bioactive compounds to be discovered. Most of the BGCs identified so far encode polyketide and/or peptide derived compounds [9]. However, novel classes of BGCs encoding other SMs remain difficult to be identified although some approaches have been developed [10,11]. BGC-associated genes typically include those encoding biosynthetic enzymes, self-resistance systems, and transport-related proteins. In addition, most BGCs contain genes for “Cluster-Situated Regulators” (CSR) [12] that together with a complex network of global regulatory genes, regulate the expression of other genes within BGCs [13,14,15]. The so-called “Streptomyces Antibiotic Regulatory Proteins” (SARPs) [16] are the CSR most frequently found in Streptomyces BGCs, which are usually functioning as pathway-specific activators [13]. An approach to uncover novel classes of BGCs could be the use of SARP encoding genes as a genome mining hook, since this type of genes are often located at BGCs [13]. Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956 is the producer of the known antitumor compound mithramycin. Its genome has been sequenced [17] and mined for BGCs using antiSMASH analysis [6,8]. This has allowed identifying 31 BGCs, some of which have been already characterized. These include the previously characterized BGC for the antitumor mithramycin (mtm) [18]; four silent BGCs encoding desferrioxamine (desa), carotenoids (crta), germicidins (gcs), and antimycins (anta) [19]; and two cryptic BGCs, which encode the biosynthesis of argimycins P (arp) [17] and largimycins (lrg) [20]. The aim of this work was to test searching SARP encoding genes as a strategy to identify new BGCs that are not detected using antiSMASH. We report the identification of SARP genes in S. argillaceus genome to uncover the previously unidentified ahb BGC, its activation by overexpressing three CSR genes, and the identification and chemical characterization of their encoded compounds, the ahbamycins (AHBs), which constitute a new group of metabolites derived from 3,4-AHBA known for having antibiotic and antitumor activity. Following this strategy, we have additionally generated a new hybrid compound produced from the metabolic crosstalk between the AHB and the argimycin P (ARP) pathways.
