Introduction The bacterial strain FS14 was isolated from an Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz plant infected by the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, which is a causative agent of the root-rot disease [1]. The isolated red-pigmented bacteria were found to secret thermostable DNase and protease in our previous study [1]. With the combined use of morphological, biochemical and genetic characterization via 16S rDNA sequencing, the isolate was classified into the genus Serratia and designated as strain FS14. As the strain was found along with phytopathogens in diseased plants, we hypothesized that it has antagonistic potential against the pathogens. Serratia is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. They are ubiquitous organisms with diverse habitats including water, soil, plants, small mammals, and humans. The typical species of the genus is Serratia marcescens, well known as an opportunistic human pathogen involved in hospital acquired infections [2]. Serratia species with similar sites of isolation to strain FS14 include the endophytic S. proteamaculans found to promote plant growth via the production of specific compounds such as lipo-chitin oligosaccharides [3] and S. plymuthica which is considered a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria [4] and an antagonistic bacteria against phytopathogens since they produce a wide range of antimicrobial compounds [5]. Antagonistic bacteria exploit diverse strategies to outperform their competitors. The most characterized antimicrobial compound in Serratia is the red pigmented prodiginine, of which five types have been identified so far (prodigiosin, undecylprodigiosin, cycloprodigiosin, cyclononylprodigiosin, and butyl-meta-cyclo-heptylprodiginine) [6]. Prodigiosin is commonly produced by environmental isolates of S. marcescens, but not the clinical isolates [7]. In addition to its antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal properties, prodiginine was recently reported to exhibit immunosuppressive and anticancer traits [8]. Another central strategy employed is manifested via the protein secretion systems, through which Gram-negative bacteria secrete effectors to their exterior [9]. In particular, the Type VI secretion system (T6SS), the most recently described of the six, has highly versatile functions, which include eukaryotic and bacterial cell targeting, gene regulation, conjugation and cellular adhesion [10]. Recent studies demonstrated that T6SSs in S. marcescens and other bacteria, e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia thailandensis [11, 12], can target other bacterial competitors resulting in either growth inhibition or death. Compared with Escherichia and Salmonella, which are also members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, there are relatively fewer—only 13—genomes of Serratia sequenced and reported to NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/): S. marcescens WW4 isolated from a paper machine [13], S. marcescens Db11 pathogen of drosophila, S. marcescens FGI 94 associated with leaf-cutter ant fungus garden [14], S. proteamaculans 568 with a detailed genome analysis on chitinase production [3], S. liquefaciens ATCC27592, S. fonticola RB-25 isolated from a waste landfill [15], three plant associated S. plymuthica strains AS13 [16], AS12, AS9, S13 [17] and 4Rx13 that exhibit plant-growth-promoting activities and Serratia symbiotica Cinara cedri uid82363 which coexists with B. aphidicola in aphid. In this study, we present the first comprehensive comparative-genomic analysis of the genus Serratia, which helps to identify the antimicrobial compounds they secrete and other antagonistic genomic elements they harbor, e.g. Type VI secretion system, antibiotic-resistant genes and chitinases. In addition, we explore the antagonistic potential of strain FS14 against common fungal and bacterial phytopathogens.
