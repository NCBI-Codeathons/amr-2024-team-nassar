1. Introduction Iron is an essential element for most microorganisms [1,2]. Despite the abundance of iron in the earth’s crust, it is not readily bioavailable in aerobic environments due to its low solubility. Therefore most bacteria produce low molecular weight iron scavenging secondary metabolites to obtain iron from their environment [3,4], which are defined as siderophores [5]. These small, high-affinity iron-chelating secondary metabolites can be categorized into the four chemical classes catecholate, phenolate, hydroxamate and carboxylate types of siderophores on the basis of the structural moieties involved in iron chelation, whereby hybrids thereof are also commonly described [4,6]. Siderophores are typically synthetized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) modular multienzymes [7], whereas a smaller fraction of siderophores is produced by pathways that are independent of NRPSs and polyketide synthases (PKSs) such as desferrioxamine [8,9] or quinolobactin [10]. Myxobacteria not only display exceptional biological characteristics such as a complex chemical communication systems, multicellular development stages and the capability to move in coordinated manner to prey on other microorganisms [11] but are also producers of chemically exceptional and bioactive secondary metabolites [12]. Two different chemical types of siderophores are known to date from myxobacteria: the hydroxamate-type nannochelins [13] and the catecholate-type hyalachelins [14] and myxochelins [15,16], of which the latter have been investigated thoroughly in the last three decades [17,18,19]. The myxochelins are produced by numerous myxobacterial strains including Stigmatella aurantica sg a15 [20], Sorangium cellulosum So ce56 [21], Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622 [22,23] and Angiococcus disciformis An d30 [15] to maintain their iron homeostasis since it is indispensable for microbial viability [20]. These myxobacterial siderophores have been occasionally described or associated with other bacteria such as the actinomycetes Nonomuraea sp. TP-A0861 [24] and Steptomyces albicus m-9-20 [25] or the Chloroflexi bacterium Herpetosiphon aurantiacus [26]. Recently a number of new myxochelin derivatives have been isolated from different myxobacterial strains in which the common 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid has been replaced by a nicotinic acid moiety [17] or a 4,5-dihydroimidazole moiety [27]. Due to the relative simple structure of the myxochelins, chemical synthetic efforts led not only to the diversification of the aromatic scaffold [17,28] but also to the generation of hexadentate siderophores termed myxochelin C–F [16]. In addition, more myxochelin derivatives have been generated biotechnologically by precursor-directed biosynthesis [29]. However, to the best of our knowledge, except for myxochelin C, none of the described naturally produced myxochelins feature a modification of the primary alcohol or amino group. We hereby report the isolation, full structure elucidation and propose a biosynthetic pathway leading to the uniquely modified myxochelin congener myxochelin-B-succinate (1) from the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 along the re-isolated congeners myxochelins B (2) and A (3) (Figure 1). The genetic origin of 1–3 was identified by in silico analysis and the biosynthetic conversion from 2 to 1 was further probed by in vitro reactions with the highly reactive intracellular metabolite succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) in order to reveal the non-enzymatic succinylation leading to the formation of 1.
