1. Introduction Among the greatest discoveries of humankind in the 20th century was the discovery of antibiotics. Antibacterial triumph changed contemporary biomedicine and seeks to define, mold, and grow both its potential and its boundaries. Regrettably, the possibility for resistance to any therapeutic agent to evolve limits its ability to be effective [1,2]. The next series of antibiotics must be developed, since resistance compromises efficacy (therapeutic effect). A pathogen’s enhanced resistance to the prescribed standard therapy to which it was previously vulnerable is referred to as tolerance to an antibacterial agent (in this case, an antibiotic) [3,4,5]. The history of using antimicrobial agents to combat infections is rich, dating back to ancient civilizations where various natural extracts were employed for their healing properties. Some of these extracts, originating from plants and molds, exhibited antibacterial properties, even before the term “antibiotics” was coined [6]. The introduction of the term “antibiotics” was the result of pioneering work by American microbiologist Selman Waksman and his team, who successfully isolated chemical substances from microorganisms capable of inhibiting the growth of other microbes [7]. While the concept of using microorganisms to combat infections has ancient roots, it was Alexander Fleming’s serendipitous discovery of penicillin in 1928 that marked the inception of modern antibiotic therapy [8]. Fleming’s discovery bridged the gap between ancient knowledge, such as the Egyptians’ use of moldy bread to treat infection, and the era of antibiotics [8]. The post-World War II period, often referred to as the “golden era” of antibiotic discovery, witnessed the identification of numerous antibiotic classes that continue to be used today [9]. The advent of penicillin rapidly propagated the belief that infections could be effectively controlled with antibiotics, despite earlier use of sulfonamides as the first antimicrobials, which faced limitations due to emerging resistance mechanisms that persist to this day [10]. Interestingly, the penicillin discovery team identified penicillinase, a bacterium capable of degrading penicillin, even before widespread access to the antibiotic [11,12]. Subsequent decades brought forth remarkable progress, marked by the development of antibiotics like streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, erythromycin, vancomycin, cephalosporins, and others. This expansion of the antibiotic arsenal made previously fatal diseases treatable, cementing the antibiotic age [13,14]. The post-World War II era also saw the emergence of semi-synthetic antibiotics like amoxicillin and quinolones, notable for their enhanced stability and broader antibacterial spectra. Antibiotics such as vancomycin played pivotal roles in combating drug-resistant bacterial strains, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Innovations continued with the development of macrolides, third-generation cephalosporins, daptomycin, and linezolid, addressing Gram-negative resistance and enhancing antibiotic pharmacokinetics [15,16]. However, despite these advancements, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains have proliferated in recent decades [17,18], leading to a reassessment of antibiotic usage, increased awareness of antibiotic resistance, and the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs, alongside the exploration of novel strategies like phage therapy, combination therapies, and precision-medicine approaches to combat drug-resistant bacteria [19,20]. The global scenario regarding antibiotic resistance remains a pressing issue for public health, with a consistent upward trend in resistance prevalence over the past few decades. This phenomenon extends its reach to a broad spectrum of bacteria, rendering many antibiotics less effective or entirely impotent against infections. Consequently, once easily treatable common infections have become more formidable adversaries, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, elevated healthcare expenses, and heightened mortality rates. One of the paramount challenges associated with antibiotic resistance is the sluggish pace of new antibiotic development. Several pharmaceutical companies have withdrawn from antibiotic research and development, due to the low profitability of these drugs. Crafting a novel antibiotic is a protracted and costly endeavor, which has led to diminished enthusiasm for innovation in this vital medical domain. The unwarranted and incorrect use of antibiotics continues to be a substantial contributor to resistance development. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed when unnecessary, both in healthcare settings and for common community illnesses. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics in agriculture and animal husbandry exacerbates resistance dissemination, particularly through practices such as using antibiotics as growth promoters in livestock, potentially transmitting resistance to humans through the food chain. Efforts to combat antibiotic resistance have gained momentum through global initiatives and organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO). These entities work diligently to heighten awareness about antibiotic resistance, champion responsible antibiotic use, and advocate for innovative antibiotic research. The One Health approach, acknowledging the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, has gained traction as a comprehensive strategy for addressing antibiotic resistance. This approach recognizes that the application of antibiotics in any one sector can have repercussions on resistance in other sectors. Notably, regional variations exist in antibiotic resistance rates and trends, contingent on dissimilar healthcare practices, antibiotic usage patterns, and regulatory frameworks. In summary, antibiotic resistance remains a formidable global public health concern. While significant strides have been made in raising awareness and promoting responsible antibiotic use, the inexorable ascent of antibiotic resistance and the dearth of new antibiotic development underscore the imperative need for continuous efforts to combat this critical issue. The collaborative endeavors of healthcare professionals, researchers, policymakers, and the public remain pivotal to mitigating the impact of antibiotic resistance on global health. The primary objectives and aims of this comprehensive review article are to address the global challenge of antibiotic resistance, explore innovative strategies against drug-resistant microorganisms, examine economic challenges in antibiotic development, and propose strategies to re-engage pharmaceutical firms. It emphasizes the importance of international collaborations and government-led initiatives in combating antibiotic resistance.
