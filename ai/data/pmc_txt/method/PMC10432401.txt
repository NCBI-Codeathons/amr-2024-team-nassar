Materials and methods Origin and characteristics of the analyzed metagenomes For this study, we analyzed publicly available metagenomic DNA sequences of freshwater and wastewater bacterial communities downloaded from SRA (sequence read archive; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). The picked sequences exclusively represent DNA fragments generated by the shotgun technique which does not involve amplification of particular targets, that is, the “selection” attribute of the sequencing library had to be “random”. For consistent processing and comparability, only samples that were sequenced on an Illumina instrument in paired-end layout were included. The latter integrate wastewater and freshwater samples from the temperate zone such that, in each category, at least five different countries are represented. The analyzed data consist of 324 distinct samples from the US, UK, New Zealand, China, Canada, Sweden, and Germany (Table 1). Full accession and metainformation is provided in the supplement Table S1. In total, the data comprise about 7 × 109 high quality read pairs. Freshwater samples were subdivided into two categories (unpolluted, polluted) based on the exposure of the respective sampling sites to effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents where sufficient on-site information was available (dataset “q” in Table 1). A further distinction was made between water and sediment samples.Table 1Characteristics of the analyzed data sets.MatrixCountryStudySamplesSitesReadsBasesRead length16SWWTP influentCDPRJNA768945 (a)813e + 076e + 092081e + 04WWTP influentCNPRJNA824545 (p)417e + 072e + 102309e + 04WWTP influentDEPRJNA524094 (d)1422e + 086e + 102615e + 05WWTP influentDEPRJNA942078 (r)1494e + 081e + 112591e + 06WWTP influentNZPRJNA904380 (e)911e + 084e + 102785e + 05WWTP influentUSPRJNA683044 (i)811e + 084e + 102694e + 05WWTP influentUSPRJNA691978 (n)312e + 075e + 092117e + 04WWTP effluentCDPRJNA768945 (a)813e + 076e + 092111e + 04WWTP effluentCNPRJNA824545 (p)418e + 072e + 102414e + 04WWTP effluentDEPRJNA524094 (d)1322e + 086e + 102731e + 05WWTP effluentDEPRJNA892917 (q)912e + 085e + 102631e + 05WWTP effluentNZPRJNA904380 (e)911e + 084e + 102812e + 05WWTP effluentSEPRJEB14051 (g)638e + 071e + 101449e + 04WWTP effluentUKPRJNA529503 (h)811e + 083e + 102412e + 05WWTP effluentUSPRJNA683044 (i)1012e + 085e + 102701e + 05River waterCNPRJNA559231 (b)30277e + 082e + 112718e + 05River waterCNPRJNA798157 (c)332e + 084e + 102572e + 05River waterDEPRJNA892917 (q)1494e + 089e + 102522e + 05River waterNZPRJNA668816 (f)226e + 073e + 104498e + 04River sedimentCNPRJNA559231 (b)32258e + 082e + 112614e + 05River sedimentCNPRJNA798157 (c)332e + 085e + 102438e + 04River sedimentDEPRJNA892917 (q)68182e + 094e + 112579e + 05River sedimentNZPRJNA668816 (f)621e + 086e + 104268e + 04River sedimentUKPRJNA529503 (h)719e + 072e + 102505e + 04River sedimentUSPRJEB23134 (m)1612e + 086e + 102681e + 05River sedimentUSPRJNA795480 (k)16151e + 082e + 102326e + 04Studies are denoted by their SRA identifiers; lower case letters were added for convenient references within this publication.

See Table S1 in the supplementary material for full metainformation on individual samples, including SRA run accession numbers. Bioinformatics Processing of raw sequence data and short read analyses All samples were processed through the same bioinformatics pipeline involving the simultaneous removal of purely technical sequences and the suppression of low quality reads using Trim Galore [34] (requested phred score: 28, minimum read length: 100 bp). Paired-end reads were subsequently merged with pandaseq [35] employing the default configuration to obtain sequences with a typical average length of 262 bp (see Table 1 for variation). Using BLASTN (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the merged sequences were aligned against a collection of the currently known dfrB sequences (Table S2) and against the resfinder [36] database of acquired antibiotic resistance genes available from the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/). Only high quality alignments were retained by requesting a minimum match length of 50 bp and a sequence identity ≥95%. The merged reads were further processed through metaxa2 [37] to analyze the composition of the bacterial community based on 16 S rRNA gene fragments. Reads being tested positive for dfrB were also scanned for the signatures of integrons using the IntegronFinder [38] application provided by the Pasteur Institute, France, as a galaxy-based web service (https://galaxy.pasteur.fr). The same reads were also aligned against the ISfinder [39] database of insertion sequences maintained by the Laboratoire de Microbiologie et Génétique Moléculaires, Toulouse, France, using their web service at https://www-is.biotoul.fr/index.php. Assembly and analysis of the flanking regions of dfrB genes Because of the limited read length, it is difficult to identify the genetic context of dfrB genes exclusively from original short read data. Consequently, gene context analyses call for metagenome assembly which is challenging, not least due to the exceptionally high demand for computer memory (RAM). Even if the assembly succeeds technically, a substantial extension of the sequences of primary interest is not necessarily guaranteed. This is especially so for low-coverage metagenomes of highly diverse microbial communities [40]. Consequently, we implemented an algorithm that specifically targets the assembly of the flanking regions of dfrB-like sequences. Briefly, a collection of the reads giving specific hits for dfrB variants was built by an initial run of BLASTN. Those reads served as “seeds” in a subsequent process of iterative sequence extension. In each iteration, the algorithm searches the remaining pool of yet “unused” reads for candidates allowing for a plausible extension of the seed sequence (in iteration 1) or the outcome of earlier iterations according to sequence similarity in overlapping parts (min. 50 bp overlap). The algorithm relies on BLASTN as the workhorse for sequence alignments and, due to the targeted focus on specific seeds, RAM usage remains very low. The source code of the seed-based assembler was made publicly available at https://github.com/dkneis/close2gene together with basic documentation and a minimum working example. Overall, our seed-based approach turned out to be very close to the one implemented in GenSeed [41], a software which we only detected later. From the assembled contigs, the seeds (i.e., the dfrB) were finally removed and the remaining flanking sequences were fed into BLASTX (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to identify the genetic context of dfrB at protein level. The flanking sequences were also scanned for insertion sequences as outlined for the original short reads. Very short assemblies of <250 bp after removal of the dfrB seed sequence were excluded from downstream analysis. Statistical analysis General methods Statistical data analysis and visualization was performed in R [42] version 4.2.1. Principal component analysis was performed in base R (prcomp) using power-transformed relative abundances as input (power 0.2). Shifts in locations were assessed by means of the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (wilcox.test). The significance of differences in odds ratios was analyzed with Fisher’s exact test (fisher.test). Finally, confidence of relative abundance estimates were obtained from an exact binomial test (binom.test). Whenever multiple, logically connected hypotheses were tested simultaneously, the corresponding p values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate [43]. Correlations between ARGs and 16S rRNA-based species markers Demonstrating statistical associations between ARG abundances and bacterial community composition is difficult when sample sizes are unequal. The intuitive solution is to employ normalization so as to achieve comparable counts of ARGs and taxonomic markers across samples, that is, the counts are divided by the total number of 16 S rRNA gene copies in the respective sample. While such normalization is very common, it is often overlooked that the obtained relative abundances are unsuitable for correlation analysis [44]. Unfortunately, valid alternatives to correlation like, for example, log ratio analyses, are not applicable either because the number of detected ARG copies is zero in a notable fraction of samples. In view of this challenge, we performed correlation analyses on the original count data (i.e., without normalization) using a downsampling approach to account for unequal sample sizes. Specifically, we identified the 10% quantile of 16 S rRNA gene copies across the considered samples (Q10). Samples with fewer than Q10 copies were subsequently discarded. For the remaining samples, we studied the correlation between ARG counts and 16 S rRNA gene counts attributed to a certain bacterial group after random-driven truncation to the common length Q10. The process was repeated 250 times and the median of the correlation coefficient (Spearman’s rho) was finally evaluated.
