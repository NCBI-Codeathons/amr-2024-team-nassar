Materials and Methods Description of Isolates Eighteen E. faecium isolates were selected from the biobank of the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, representing different narasin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 1 to 32 mg/L. The 18 isolates were isolated in different years (sampled in 2004, 2006, or 2013) and from different geographical locations. Five of the isolates were also vancomycin-resistant and vanA-positive. The isolates had been susceptibility tested against a panel of antimicrobial compounds as part of the NORM-VET surveillance program (Table 1).

Detection of the Putative Narasin Resistance Mechanisms DNA was extracted from the 18 isolates using NUCLISENS® easyMAG® (Biomerieux) according to the manufacturer’s description. The putative narasin resistance operon was detected using HotStarTaq polymerase (qiagen) in 25 μl PCR reactions containing 1X HotStarTaq Master mix, 0.2 μM of each primer and 2 μl DNA template using primers specific for the two genes (Supplementary Table 3). PCRs were run at 94°C for 15 min, 35 cycles of (94°C, 20 s; 63°C; 30 s; 72°C, 50 s), and 72°C, 10 min. Conjugation In general, conjugation was performed by filter mating between a donor strain (the 18 wild type isolates selected from the biobank of the Norwegian Veterinary Institute), and the fusidic acid and rifampicin resistant plasmid free recipient strain E. faecium 64/3 (Bender et al., 2015). Cultures of the donors and the recipient were grown overnight in Brain heart infusion (BHI) broth to stationary phase at 37°C, and 150 rpm shaking. The donors were generally grown in the presence of narasin (1 mg/L), with the exception of the two strains with MIC values of narasin at 1 mg/L, these strains were grown in the presence of 0.5 mg/L narasin. The overnight cultures of the donors were washed once with BHI broth to remove narasin from the bacteria. The OD600 of the cultures was adjusted and donor and recipient were mixed at a 1 to 10 ratio and the bacteria were applied on filter membrane (0.22 μm GSWP, Merck) on BHI agar with or without relevant antimicrobials. Filter mating was performed at 37°C for 24 h. The bacteria were dislodged from the filter membranes and suspended in BHI broth, 10-fold serially diluted and plated on BHI agar supplemented with relevant antimicrobials. Two different conjugation experiments were performed. In the first experiment, transfer of narasin resistance was tested using all 18 isolates from the Norwegian Veterinary Institute as donors. Filter mating was done on BHI agar without antimicrobials and the total number of bacteria with recipient background (i.e., recipient and transconjugants) and the number of transconjugants specifically, were quantified on BHI agar containing rifampicin (50 mg/L)/fusidic acid (25 mg/L) and narasin (1 mg/L)/rifampicin (50 mg/L)/fusidic acid (25 mg/L), respectively. Randomly selected colonies on the transconjugant-selective plates were stored and used for further experiments. Detection of narA, narB, and vanA was done by PCR using gene specific primers (Supplementary Table 3). The narA and narB genes were amplified using the PCR programs described under Section “Detection of the Putative Narasin Resistance Mechanisms,” whereas the vanA gene was amplified using the following program: 94°C for 15 min, 35 cycles of (94°C, 20 s; 58°C; 30 s; 72°C, 50 s), and 72°C, 10 min. In the second experiment WT1402, an isolate with co-transferrable narasin and vancomycin resistance, was used as donor to test if polyether ionophores can stimulate occurrence of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants. Filter mating was performed on BHI agar without antimicrobial supplementation or with narasin (0.25–8 mg/L), monensin (5 or 10 mg/L), maduramycin (16 mg/L), or salinomycin (4 mg/L). The total number of bacteria with recipient background and the number of transconjugants alone were analyzed on BHI agar supplemented with rifampicin (50 mg/L)/fusidic acid (25 mg/L) acid, and vancomycin (4 mg/L)/rifampicin (50 mg/L)/fusidic acid (25 mg/L), respectively. Randomly selected colonies found on the transconjugant selective plates were re-streaked on BHI agar supplemented with vancomycin (4 mg/L) to confirm growth of these isolates on 4 mg/L vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant transconjugants were also confirmed by MIC-testing using a broth microdilution assay. Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis The annotated sequences of plasmids containing the putative narasin resistance operon were used to design sequencing primers (Supplementary Table 1). A subset of the 18 isolates representing different MIC values of narasin were chosen for sequencing. These isolates were: WT1145, WT1190, WT2608, WT1402, WT1251, WT1301, and WT1343. Sanger sequencing of the narAB operons was done at GATC biotech (Germany), and the sequences were assembled and compared by multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Ω (Madeira et al., 2019). The assembled sequences have been deposited into GenBank; accession numbers: MN590304-MN590310. Susceptibility Testing A few bacterial colonies were picked from BHI agar plates, suspended in 1 mL of Mueller-Hinton (MH) medium, adjusted to OD 0.1 and then diluted 1000-fold in MH medium. The bacterial suspensions were distributed into the wells of 96-well round bottom plates and antimicrobials were added from twofold dilution series. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h, results were registered every 24 h. Transcriptional Analysis Growth Conditions The expression of the putative narasin genes was analyzed using the transconjugants Tc1402 and Tc2608, and the recipient strain 64/3 as a control. For the transconjugants, one single colony was picked from BHI agar plate supplemented with narasin (1 mg/L), and for 64/3 one single colony was picked from a BHI agar plate without antimicrobial supplementation. The bacteria were suspended in 5 mL of BHI medium with (Tc1402, Tc2608) or without (64/3) narasin (1 mg/L). Following overnight incubation at 37°C, the OD600 of the cultures was adjusted to 0.01 in 5 mL BHI broth without antimicrobial supplementation. The cultures were grown to OD600 = 0.5. At this point narasin was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 1 mg/L and the cultures were continued for 20 min. The experiment was terminated by adding an equal volume of ice-cold methanol to the culture, followed by incubation for 5 min on ice. The bacteria were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 g at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet frozen at −20°C overnight. RNA Extraction Total RNA was isolated using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit from Roche Life Science (cat# 11828665001) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for gram positive bacteria. The quality and purity of RNA were confirmed by analyzing the samples on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and by running 1 μg of total RNA on a 1% agarose gel. Reverse transcriptase reactions were carried out on 1 μg of RNA using the First strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA samples were stored at −20°C until further analysis. Quantitative PCR The qPCR reactions were done with a total volume of 20 μL containing 10 μL of 2X PowerUp SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific), cDNA template (0.005 ng/μL) and a final concentration of 2 μM of forward and reverse primers. The qPCR was performed on AriaMX Real-Time PCR system with the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle for 2 min at 50°C (UDG activation), 1 cycle for 2 min at 95°C (Polymerase activation) and 40 cycles of 15 s denaturation at 95°C and 1 min annealing/extension at 60°C. Relative gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCq method with recA, as a reference gene. Cloning of the Narasin Operon The operon encoding the putative narasin resistance genes was amplified together with 906 nt of the upstream region from isolates WT1190, WT1402, and WT2608 using primers Nar-Reg-For and Nar-Reg-Rev (Supplementary Table 3). The PCR products and the plasmid pREG45 were digested with FastDigest BamHI and FastDigest XhoI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the plasmid and insert were ligated together using rapid DNA ligation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The ligation mixtures were introduced into competent DH5α as described by Chung et al. (1989) and bacteria were plated on LB-agar plates supplemented with spectinomycin (250 mg/L). Single colonies were screened for the presence of the narAB operon by colony PCR using primers: ABC_ATPase_For, ABC_ATPase_Rev, ABCpermease_For, ABCpermease_Rev (Supplementary Table 3) and the integrity of the constructs was confirmed by sanger sequencing at GATC Biotech (Germany), using primers: Nar-seq-rev1, Nar-seq-rev2, Nar-seq-rev3, Nar-seq-rev4, Nar-seq-rev5, Nar-seq-rev6, Nar-seq-for (Supplementary Table 3). The constructs were introduced into the plasmid free E. faecium SE34 (Teng et al., 1998) by electroporation using a previously published protocol (Grady and Hayes, 2003). Briefly, E. faecium SE34 were grown in M17 broth (Oxoid) overnight at 37°C. This culture was diluted 1:100 in 400 ml of M17 broth supplemented with 0.5M sucrose, containing 4% filter-sterilized glycine and grown for 16 h at 37°C. Bacteria were spun down at 4000 g for 10 min, and the cells were washed once with 20 ml of ice-cold electroporation buffer (0.5M sucrose, 10% glycerol). Aliquotes of electrocompetent cells were stored at −80°C. Plasmid DNA was electroporated into 100 μl of electrocompetent cells using an Gene Pulser electroporation system (Bio-Rad). Electroporation conditions were 2.5 kV, 0.2 cm cuvette gap, 25 μF and 200 ohm. Cells were diluted with 800 μl of Todd–Hewitt broth (Oxoid) supplemented with 0.5M sucrose and incubated at 37°C for 4 h before plating on BHI agar plates supplemented with spectinomycin (200 mg/L).
