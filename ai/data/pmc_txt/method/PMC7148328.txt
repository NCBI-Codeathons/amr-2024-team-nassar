Cell stocks of the N. gerenzanensis strains were prepared from cultures in RARE3 medium as already described34 and stored at −80 °C. Liquid cultures were prepared by inoculating 0.2 mL of the frozen stock into 20 mL of RARE3 medium; after 120 h of growth, 1 mL of this culture was inoculated into 50 mL of fresh RARE3 medium in an orbital shaker (500 × g) in 250-mL baffled flasks at 30 °C. To detect glycopeptide production, samples of culture broths at different time points were withdrawn and stored at −80 °C before analysis. Cultivation in glycopeptide production medium was performed as already described2. Biomass was determined by measuring the cell dry weight of mycelial pellet recovered from a 1-mL culture sample after drying the pellet at 65 °C for about 24 h. Alternatively, the relative packed mycelial volume (%PMV) was determined after centrifugation of a 6-mL culture sample for 10 min at 4000 × g. For assessing induction by glycopeptides, the parental strain or the Δdbv4 mutant were cultivated in V40S medium as above and then transferred into (fresh) V40P medium2. After 24 h at 30 °C, the culture was equally divided into three flasks, and either 0.5 µg/mL A40926 or 0.5 µg/mL acA40926 were added, with the third flask used as no-addition control. After further 2 and 5 h, 1-mL samples were collected and centrifuged to recover cells. RNA was extracted and processed as below. Analysis of antibiotic production Antibiotic production of the mutant strains was firstly evaluated using the paper disc diffusion method and Kocuria rhizophila as the assay organism as described previously35. For high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses, 500 µL aliquots of broth cultures were collected at the time points indicated and treated as reported previously6,36. Construction of the Δdbv22 strain PCR targeting37 was applied to replace dbv22 with a cassette containing an apramycin-selectable marker using pIJ773 as template and the PCR primers reported in Table 2. E. coli BW25113/pIJ790 bearing cosmid 1B14 was electrotransformed with the deletion cassette. Intergeneric conjugation was carried out as previously reported6. Exconjugants were analyzed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S5) using primers reported in Table 2. One out of eleven clones analyzed contained the interrupted dbv22 gene and used for further studies. Sequencing of the PCR product confirmed that the apramycin-resistant cassette was correctly inserted in the target gene through homologous double-cross recombination.Table 2Primers used in this study.Gene(s)Forward (5′-3′)Reverse (5′-3′)Predicted size (bp)Used in RT-PCR or qRT-PCRhrdbctgatcaacaaggtcgcccggccgtacctctgcacctcg12916Sagcttgttggtggggtagtgtcaccgctacaccaggaatt470dbv3gaagaggttgcccaggtcacccgaggcgctctacatcac101dbv4cagtaattccggcttggtccaaacaggtcggcatctccc114dbv5gtggacctggcattgatcgctggtcacatcggtgtacgc101dbv6agctgtgcgctgagatcgacggcttcggcagatagtc126dbv7ccagctcgtcggtctcaccccttgacgtggttggac141dbv23gaccgcccacttgttgatcggcagctcaccacctacg110dbv24tcggaggtttgctgaaggagatcgaatccaatgcgg147Used to prepare probes for EMSAupstream 3gaatcgagcaacctcgtcaggcaggaatgggaaaggatct300upstream 4gcatcggtcttatccgaaaccgtcgcatcctcttttcttc226upstream 6tggtcgaggtctccgtgccattcgtgtcgccgtctc150upstream 7tgaaggcgacgatcaacctcctcatccctctcctccag188upstream 23gtccaggtgaacgcttggtccttcagcaaacctccgaac178upstream 24gcaggtcggaagggacatcgtgaccaagcgttcacctgg176 Primers used in this study.

Resistance assay The ability to form colonies of the N. gerenzanensis wild type, Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 strains was assessed by plating serial dilutions of stock cultures (prepared from frozen mycelium) on 0.25X BTT plates38 containing 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 µg/mL A40926 or acA40926. Two replicate plates were used for each antibiotic concentration. After 6 days at 30 °C, the number of colony forming units (CFU) was recorded. Total RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis To perform transcriptional analysis, a 6-mL sample was withdrawn from a 30-mL culture. The mycelium was harvested by centrifugation and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen), followed by treatment with DNase I (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was previously checked using Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis as previously described39. It was converted to cDNA as already described34 and amplified using primers reported in Table 2. As control genes, hrdB, encoding a vegetative sigma factor, or 16S rRNA, were used. Gene expression was analyzed quantitatively by using the 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in 96-well plates. Two microliters of cDNA was added to 20 µL of the PCR mixture. Amplification required activation of AmpErase UNG at 50 °C for 2 min, followed by denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min and then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Overexpression and purification of recombinant protein His-Dbv6 Escherichia coli DH10B and BL21 (Invitrogen) were used in this study. Plasmids pGEM-T (Promega) and pRSETB (Invitrogen) were used for cloning PCR products, and protein expression, respectively. N. gerenzanensis chromosomal DNA was used as template to amplify dbv6 by PCR using the primers 5’-aaaaggatccaatgcgcgttctggtggtgga-3’ and 5’-ttttaagctttcagatgcgatatccctcgc-3’ (underlines indicate the BamHI and HindIII sites, respectively). The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI plus HindIII and ligated into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pRSETB, yielding pRSET-Dbv6, which was introduced into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells by heat shock treatment40. Plasmid pRSET-Dbv6 expresses the entire Dbv6 protein with a His6 tag at its N terminus under the control of the T7 promoter and the lac operator. Fidelity of PCR amplification was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Dbv6 overexpression and purification were performed using the procedures already described for Dbv45. Gel mobility shift assay The gel mobility shift assay was performed according to the method already described41. Briefly, for the binding assay, increasing amount of Dbv6 (2.8 to 14 µg) was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in 20 μL of 12.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM KCl, 0.75 mM DTT, and 5 mM MgCl2. After 15 min of incubation with 100 ng of DNA, complexes and free DNA were resolved on non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels run in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 150 V for approximately 2 h and then stained in a bath containing ethidium bromide. The DNA probes were amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Table 2. BSA and the internal region of hrdB were used in control experiment (Supplementary Fig. 4). Phylogenetic analysis Thirteen response regulators and ten sensory kinases were retrieved from the MiBIG database of characterized actinobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters23; and forty-one response regulators and forty-seven sensory kinases were identified by blast searches of the N. gerenzanensis genome18. Seven characterized TCSs from S. coelicolor (AbsA, Afs, Dra, Glu, Osd, Pho and Van)24,25 were also included. Sequences associated with N. gerenzanensis biosynthetic gene clusters were identified by AntiSMASH 5.042. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses were performed with the MEGA 7 package43.
