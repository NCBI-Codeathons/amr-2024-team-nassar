Materials and Methods Strains and Growth Conditions. All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1. For routine liquid culture growth, single colonies of P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 were used to inoculate lysogeny broth (LB) or 1% tryptone, as specified in the text, and shaken at 37 °C, 200 rpm. Precultures for biofilm experiments were grown in liquid LB for 12–16 h, then diluted 1:100, or 1:50 for ΔrpoN backgrounds, in 2 mL LB and grown for 2.5 h at 37 °C to an OD(500 nm) of 0.4–0.6. These liquid cultures were spotted onto 1% tryptone 1% agar plates and incubated at 25 °C. Biofilm morphology was determined as described previously (78) on morphology assay plates made of 1% tryptone and 1% agar and containing 20 µg/mL Congo red and 30 µg/mL Coomassie blue (79). Images of colonies were taken using a Keyence VHX-1000 digital microscope. All planktonic cultures and biofilms were incubated in the dark. To compare the growth dynamics and activities of reporters for individual strains, experiments were carried out in 96-well plate, black-sided, clear-bottomed plates (Greiner Bio-One). Strains were pregrown in glass culture tubes in liquid LB for 12–16 h, and these precultures were used to inoculate 200 µL of media at a dilution of 1:100 in 96-well plates. Plates were set to incubate at 25 °C with continuous shaking on the medium setting in a Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader. The defined medium used to test individual carbon sources was MOPS minimal medium (50 mM 4 morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.2), 43 mM NaCl, 93 mM NH4Cl, 2.2 mM KH2PO4, 1 µg/mL FeSO4·7H2O, and 1 mM MgSO4·7H2O). Growth was assessed by taking OD readings at 500 nm and fluorescence readings at excitation and emission wavelengths of 569 nm and 599 nm, respectively, every 30 min for up to 40 h. Fluorescent Reporter Strain Construction. All plasmids used in this study are listed in SI Appendix, Table S2. To create reporters of promoter activity for the crcZ and crc genes, the respective 161-bp and 500-bp promoter regions upstream of the start codon were amplified by PCR using primers (SI Appendix, Table S3) that added KpnI and XhoI (Pcrc) or SpeI and XhoI (PcrcZ) digest sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the sequence. Purified PCR products were digested and ligated into the pLD3208 vector at the multiple cloning site, upstream of the mScarlet sequence. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain UQ950 and verified by sequencing. They were then moved into P. aeruginosa wild-type or mutant strains, as indicated in SI Appendix, Table S1, using biparental conjugation with E. coli strain S17-1. Selection for recombinants was carried out as previously described (38). Creation of Deletion Mutant Strains. All plasmids used in this study are listed in SI Appendix, Table S2. Deletion constructs were made and deletion strains were produced via homologous recombination as previously described (38). Briefly, ~1-kb genomic flanks on either side of the gene to be deleted were amplified via PCR (primers listed in SI Appendix, Table S3) and ligated into digested pMQ30 plasmid (80) using Saccharomyces cerevisiae InvSc1 gap-closing repair. Successful ligations were selected with SD-Ura plates, grown, and the plasmid purified by miniprep. The plasmid was transformed into an E. coli mating strain, BW29427, and mated into the recipient P. aeruginosa strain. Plasmid integration into P. aeruginosa resulted in merodiploids, which are resolved by outgrowth in LB. Strains that successfully lost the integrated plasmid via homologous recombination were selected by growth on sucrose. The final clones were confirmed by PCR with primers flanking the excision site. Creation of PCN-overproducing Strain. phzH was amplified using primers LD4528 and LD4529, and the rrnB terminator was amplified from pAKN69 (81) using primers LD4530 and LD4077 such that the two fragments had ~20 bp overlapping sequence similarity. An overlap PCR was performed using primers LD528 and LD4077 and the two fragments (~75 ng each) as template. The resulting fragment (PhzH-coding region with a terminator) was restriction-digest cloned into pAKN69 using SphI and NheI restriction enzymes. Because the coding region of PhzH contains a SphI cut site, this step was completed by first digesting the insert with EcoRI and gel purified the two fragments. The fragment with the beginning of the gene was cut with SphI and the end fragment cut with NheI. Then a three-way ligation was performed to assemble the complete plasmid. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BW29427, verified by sequencing, and introduced into PA14 using biparental conjugation with E. coli BW29427. Single recombinants were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL gentamicin. Biofilm Thin Sectioning. Macrocolony preparation and sectioning was performed as previously described with minor modifications (82). Bacterial subcultures were spotted onto 45 mL/15 mL two-layer 1% tryptone 1% agar in 100 mm × 15 mm square plates and grown for 72 h. The biofilms were overlaid with 25 mL of 1% molten agar, solidified, excised into histocassettes, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 h. After fixing, the samples were washed in a series of ethanol/PBS solutions in which the ethanol concentration was gradually increased to 100%. The samples were then washed with histoclear and subsequently infiltrated with molten paraffin wax. The samples were then placed in paraffin wax in wax molds and solidified overnight. The wax blocks containing the biofilm samples were shaped and the middle of the biofilms sectioned into 10-µm sections. The sections were floated on water and placed onto precharged glass slides. The slides were dried for 48 h, then heat fixed on a 45 °C hot plate for 45 min. After the slides had cooled, they were rehydrated by washing with histoclear followed by a series of ethanol/PBS solutions in which the ethanol concentration was gradually decreased to 0%. Once rehydrated, mounting media and a coverslip were placed on the slide, and the samples were imaged. Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy. Five microliters of a bacterial subculture was spotted onto 45 mL/15 mL two-layer 1% tryptone 1% agar plates and grown for 72 h; then, the top layer and biofilm were transferred to 2 mL 1% tryptone 1% agar 50% D2O and incubated at 25 °C for 5 h. Where indicated, the plates also contained the specified concentration of commercially available phenazines (pyocyanin: Cayman Chemical Company 10009594, PCN: Apexmol 550-89-0). The biofilms were then thin-sectioned as described above. For SRS microscopy, an integrated laser source (picoEMERALD, Applied Physics & Electronics, Inc.) was used to produce both a Stokes beam (1,064 nm, 6 ps, intensity modulated at 8 MHz) and a tunable pump beam (720–990 nm, 5–6 ps) at an 80-MHz repetition rate. The spectral resolution of SRS is FWHM = 6–7 cm−1. These two spatially and temporally overlapped beams with optimized near-IR throughput were coupled into an inverted multiphoton laser-scanning microscope (FV1200MPE, Olympus). Both beams were focused on the biofilm samples through a 25X water objective (XLPlan N, 1.05 N.A. MP, Olympus) and collected with a high N.A. oil condenser lens (1.4 N.A., Olympus) after the sample. By removing the Stokes beam with a high O.D. bandpass filter (890/220 CARS, Chroma Technology), the pump beam is detected with a large area Si photodiode (FDS1010, Thorlabs) reverse-biased by 64 DC voltage. The output current of the photodiode was electronically filtered (KR 2724, KR electronics), terminated with 50 Ω, and demodulated with a lock-in amplifier (HF2LI, Zurich Instruments) to achieve near shot-noise-limited sensitivity. The stimulated Raman loss signal at each pixel was sent to the analog interface box (FV10-ANALOG, Olympus) of the microscope to generate the image. All images were acquired with 80 µs time constant at the lock-in amplifier and 100 µs pixel dwell time (~27 s per frame of 512 × 512 pixels). Measured after the objectives, 40 mW pump power and 120 mW Stokes beam were used to image the carbon-deuterium 2,183 cm−1 and off-resonance 2,004 cm−1 channels. Image analysis was performed using Fiji. For better visualization, all SRS sections were brightened in Fiji to a maximum brightness value of 800. Quantifications reflect the unmodified signal. Oxygen Profiling of Biofilms. A 25-µm-tip oxygen microsensor (Unisense OX-25) was used to measure oxygen concentrations along the depth of biofilms grown for 72 h at 25 °C. Two-point calibration was used to calibrate the oxygen microsensor. The first calibration point was atmospheric oxygen using a calibration chamber (Unisense CAL300) containing water continuously bubbled with air. The second calibration point was a “zero” point using an anoxic solution of 0.1 M sodium ascorbate 0.1 M NaOH. Oxygen measurements were taken throughout the depth of the biofilm using a measurement time of 3 s and a wait time between measurements of 3 s. The step size between measurements was 5 µm and controlled by a micromanipulator (Unisense MM33). Profiles were recorded using a multimeter (Unisense) and the SensorTrace Profiling software (Unisense). Phenazine Detection by HPLC and Spectrophotometry. Ten μL of bacterial subculture was spotted onto 4 mL of 1% tryptone 1% agar in 30-mm circular petri plates and grown for 72 h at 25 °C. The biofilm and agar were placed into 5 mL of 100% methanol and nutated overnight at room temperature to extract the phenazines. To measure the amount of aeruginosins, 600 μL of the methanol extract was added to 600 μL of chloroform, briefly vortexed, and allowed to settle into fractions. After separation, 100 μL of the top aqueous fraction was put into a 96-well plate and read in a plate reader. To quantify aeruginosin levels, the samples were excited at 520 nm and the emission read at 620 nm. The results presented are all normalized relative to the signal of PA14 biofilms. To measure levels of PCA, PCN, and pyocyanin, the methanol extract was filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Costar); then, 200 μL was transferred to HPLC vials for analysis on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. A 50-µL sample was loaded on a Kinetex Biphenyl reverse phase column (Phenomenex 00F-4622-E0). HPLC-based separation was carried out using a gradient of water-0.02% formic acid (solvent A) to methanol-0.02% formic acid (solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min using the following protocol: linear gradient from 40% to 100% solvent B for 30 min followed by 5 min of 100% solvent B. The total method time was 35 min with a 5-min postwash of 100% solvent B. The resulting peaks at 366 nm were identified and quantified relative to samples of purified PCA, PCN, and pyocyanin run in known concentrations. The retention times for pyocyanin, PCN, and PCA are 9.5 min, 26 min, and 31.5 min, respectively. PMS Sensitivity Assay. Precultures of strains of interest were grown for 16 h at 37 °C, 200 rpm, and then subcultured at a dilution of 30 µL into 3 mL LB medium in VWR 13 x 100 mm glass culture tubes. Subcultures were grown for about 2.5 h to an OD (500 nm) of approximately 0.55, then normalized to an OD (500 nm) of 0.5 before serial dilution. Five microliters of each dilution was spotted onto 10-cm square plates containing 60 mL of 1% tryptone 1% agar medium with or without 800 µM PMS (Fisher Scientific, ICN10095510). Biofilms were incubated for 48 h at 25 °C before scanning on an Epson Expression 11000XL photo scanner. The brightness of all images was adjusted in the same way to a value of 150 using Adobe Photoshop for ease of visualization. Colony-Forming Unit Assay. Macrocolony biofilms were grown for 3 d on 1% tryptone 1% agar. Each biofilm was transferred to a 2-mL tube with a sealing O-ring (Benchmark Scientific D1031-T20) containing 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 g of ceramic beads (Fisher Scientific 15-340-159). Samples were homogenized using an Omni Bead Ruptor 12 (Omni 19-050) on high for 90 s at 4 °C. Samples were left on ice for 10 min to allow bubbles to clear. Serial dilutions in PBS were performed until the countable dilution of 10−6. Ten microliters were spotted on 1% tryptone 1.5% agar plates, which were tilted vertically to allow the spot to run down the plate and thereby increase the growth area. After 16 h of growth at 37 °C, single colonies were counted and recorded. Propidium Iodide Staining. Five microliters of a bacterial subculture was spotted onto 45 mL/15 mL two-layer 1% tryptone 1% agar plates were grown for 72 h, then the top layer and biofilm was transferred to 30 mL of 1% tryptone 1% agar 50 µM propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich P4864-10ML) and incubated at 25 °C for 6 h. The biofilms were then thin-sectioned as described above and imaged on a ZEISS Axio Zoom.V16.
