MATERIALS AND METHODS Phylogenetic analysis of different methyltransferase families Unique open reading frames (ORFs) of resistance MTs were used to infer phylogenetic relationships within MT groups proposed to modify G1405 and A1408. Amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (20). Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were calculated using PHYML (21,22), and the consensus tree was calculated from 1000 ML trees by the bootstrap method of Felsenstein (23). Over expression and purification of resistance methyltransferases Construction of expression vectors for Sgm (24) and KgmB (25) was described previously. DNA for other enzymes were ligated into pQE-30 (Qiagen) following either PCR amplification of genomic DNA (grmA) or total gene synthesis (krm and kamB; GeneArt). All MTs were expressed as 6×His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and natively purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Ni2+-NTA Agarose; Qiagen) as previously described for Sgm (19). The identity of each MT protein was confirmed by MS following in-gel trypsin digestion of the excised SDS–PAGE bands (data not shown). Measurement of aminoglycoside MIC values in liquid culture Aminoglycoside minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were measured in triplicate in liquid culture for E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid-encoded resistance methyltransferase proteins as previously described (19). Concentrations of gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, paromomycin, apramycin, hygromycin B and streptomycin were varied in the range of 0 to 1000 μg/ml. MIC values are defined as the minimal concentration of antibiotic that prevents bacterial growth. Bacteria lacking a plasmid or those transformed with an empty vector were used as negative controls. In vitro methylation of ribosomal subunits Small ribosomal subunits were purified as previously described (26). Methylation reaction mixtures contained 10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM SAM, 100 pmol 30S ribosomal subunits and 100 ng of MT proteins. Incubation was carried out at 37°C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by adding phenol–chloroform to extract ribosomal proteins and MT enzyme, and 16S rRNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-ToF) MS analysis of methylated 16S rRNA 16S rRNA was isolated from 30S particles previously in vitro methylated (as described above), or from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing recombinant Sgm protein (i.e. in vivo methylated). A defined 16S rRNA sequence, C1378-G1432, was isolated by hybridization to a complementary deoxyoligonucleotide (27). 16S rRNA (100 pmol) was incubated with deoxyoligonucleotide (1000 pmol) at 95°C for 5 min in 200 μl hybridization buffer (250 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl), followed by slow cooling to 30°C over 3 h. Unhybridized regions of the 16S rRNA were digested with 40 U mung bean nuclease (NEB) and 0.5 μg RNase A (Sigma), for 60 min at 37°C. The resulting DNA–RNA hybrid was recovered by phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The target RNA sequence was excised from a 13% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, after visualization with ethidium bromide, and purified using an RNaid Spin Kit (MP Biochemicals). 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3-HPA; 0.5 M, 1 μl) was added to 2 μl of the purified 55-mer RNA (30–40 pmol), and this digested with 40 U of RNase T1 for 16 h at 37°C. The resulting 3′-cyclic phosphates were hydrolysed by adding 0.25 vol of 0.5 M HCl and incubating samples for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were air dried and redissolved in H2O. In some cases, the RNA fragments were further purified using Zip TipTM C18 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Between 10 and 30 pmol of the RNase T1 digest in 0.7 μl H2O was mixed with 0.7 μl saturated 3-HPA in 50% acetonitrile/0.03 M di-amonium citrate and spotted on MALDI target plates. Mass spectra were recorded in positive ion and either linear or reflectron mode on a Kratos Shimadzu CFR MALDI-ToF MS as previously described (28).
