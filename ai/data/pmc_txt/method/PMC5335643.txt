Materials and Methods Experimental Setup The manure was collected from a medium-sized swine farm in Yangling, Shaanxi, China (i.e., producing swines > 500 head/year), where the diet comprised corn, bran, and soybean meal. The pre-mix feed included tetracycline, macrolide, CuSO4, and ZnSO4. In order to replicate the actual responses of resistance genes at different copper concentrations, the feed given to swine supplemented with trace elements and antibiotics was stopped 2 weeks before collecting the manure. The fresh manure was mixed well, air dried to obtain a water content <30%, crushed, and sieved through a 5-mm mesh. Wheat straw was cut into pieces that measured <1 cm long. The swine manure had an organic nitrogen content of 26 g kg-1, organic carbon content of 380.2 g kg-1, pH of 7.6, and total copper content of 121 mg kg-1. The wheat straw had an organic nitrogen content of 6.5 g kg-1 and an organic carbon content of 496.3 g kg-1. The compost reactors comprised 54 identical 500 mL plastic containers, where 150 g dry weight (DW) of the raw material was placed in each container. The swine manure and wheat straw were mixed (3:1 DW) to prepare the compost mixture. The composting experiment was designed as described by Li et al. (2014) and determined based on the Cu residue levels in swine manure (Xiong et al., 2010). A stock solution of Cu was prepared and the diluted Cu solution was then mixed thoroughly with each sample to spike them with additional Cu concentrations of 200 and 2000 mg Cu kg-1 (DW), i.e., Cu200 and Cu2000, respectively. A similar volume of sterilized distilled water was added to the control (without the addition of CuSO4). Before use in the composting experiment, CuSO4 was stabilized for 6 h in swine manure. The moisture content was adjusted to 55%. To provide the optimal conditions for composting, the temperature was artificially controlled in an incubator in the following four phases: mesophilic phase (20–55°C, 0–5 days), thermophilic phase (55°C, 6–10 days; 55–50°C, 11–13 days; 50°C, 14–16 days), cooling phase (50–40°C, 17–21 days), and maturity (decreased to 20°C, 22–35 days), as described previously (Li et al., 2014). The composts were turned fully and mixed every 2 days during the composting process. Three plastic containers for each treatment were then sampled as triplicates on days 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 35, and these samples were mixed well to form a test subsample. The sample was divided into two parts, where one was used to determine the physical and chemical properties, and the second was freeze-dried using a vacuum freeze dryer (Songyuan, China), milled to 1 mm by an ultra-centrifugal mill (Retsch Z200, Germany), and stored at –80°C. Chemical Analysis The moisture contents of fresh samples were measured by drying at 105°C for 24 h. The pH values were determined based on fresh samples in water suspension at 1:10 (w/w) using a Thermo Orion 3-star pH-meter (San Diego, CA, USA). NH4+ and NO3- were extracted with 2 M KCl and determined by flow injection analysis (Systea, Italy). Cu was sequentially extracted, as described by Tessier et al. (1979), where the extracts were then analyzed using a Model Z-2000 Series Polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). For the data shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and Miaomiao et al. (2009), exchangeable Cu is defined as the bioavailable Cu in swine manure compost. DNA Extraction, qPCR, and Sequencing Analysis DNA was extracted from the freeze-dried compost samples using a Fast DNA Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Five CRGs (copA, cusA, cusO, pcoA, and tcrB), five macrolide resistance genes [erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(T), and erm(X)], and the integrase gene of class 1 integrons (intI1) were determined by standard PCR. In addition, four CRGs (copA, cusA, pcoA, and tcrB), two macrolide resistance genes [erm(A) and erm(B)], and the integrase gene of class 1 integrons (intI1) were detected by standard PCR. These genes were quantified by real-time qPCR, where the conditions and primer sequences are described in the Supporting Information (Supplementary Material S1 and Tables S1a,b). The samples were quantified by qPCR using the Bio-Rad CFX connectTM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The absolute abundances of the CRGs and ARGs were expressed as copies g-1 of dry compost. The relative abundances of the CRGs and ARGs were calculated as: copy number of a CRG or ARG/copy number of 16S rRNA. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform at Novogene (Beijing, China). The raw data were analyzed using QIIME software and the UPARSE pipeline (Caporaso et al., 2010). The UPARSE pipeline was employed for taxonomic assignment based on ≥97% similarity. Taxonomic classification was performed using the RDP classifier (Wang et al., 2007). All the raw sequence data have been deposited in the NCBI SRA database (Accession number: SRP093470). Statistical Analyses All of the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). Significant differences in the relative abundances of CRGs and ARGs (at P < 0.05) between treatments were detected using a one-way ANOVA/LSD test. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was conducted using R (Version 2.15.3). Network analysis based on Spearman’s rank analysis was performed using the relative abundances of CRGs, ARGs, the bacterial community (based on OTU), and intI1 with the Gephi platform. Redundancy analysis was conducted with CANOCO 4.5.
