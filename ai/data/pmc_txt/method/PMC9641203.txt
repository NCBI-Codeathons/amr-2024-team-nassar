. All primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The genomic DNA of B. brevis X23 was extracted using the phenol chloride method according to previous study (Mcorist et al., 2002). DNA sequencing was conducted at Hunan Tsingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Changsha, China). Identification of the regulatory gene edeB on ede BGC The genome of B. brevis strain X23 was sequenced and deposited at NCBI with the accession number NZ_CP023474.1. Regulatory genes around ede BGC in B. brevis X23 genome were reviewed to identify edeB. The conserved domain of identified EdeB protein (Genebank accession: ATF13884.1) was analyzed by the NCBI’s conserved domain database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd/) and Pfam (http://pfam.xfam.org/). The function sites of EdeB were analyzed by PROSITE (https://prosite.expasy.org/).The homologs of EdeB were compared and analyzed using Jalview software. Construction of edeB-deletion, complementation, and overexpression mutants The edeB-knockout vectors were constructed based on Red/ET homologous recombination (Yu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2000; Muyrers et al., 2001; Sharan et al., 2009). Genomic DNA of B. brevis X23 was used as a template to amplify the upstream and downstream homologous arms of edeB with primers edeB-F1/edeB-F2 and edeB-R1/edeB-R2 using PCR assay. Subsequently, the apramycin resistance gene (Aprar) was amplified from plasmid pSET152 with primers Apra-F/Apra-R using PCR. The pBR322-ErmB-ori194 vector skeleton was amplified plasmid pE194 with primers pE194-F/pE194-R. Then, the above four DNA fragments were mixed and electroshocked into E. coli GB-Dir containing the Red/ET recombination system to be connected into a circular plasmid through homologous recombination. Then proper knockout vectors were selected and sequenced through enzyme digestion and the selected plasmid with correct sequence was named as pE194-edeB-ko-HAF-apra-HAR. The knockout vector was transferred into B. brevis X23, and undergone homologous recombination to replace the edeB gene by Aprar. The mutant was further confirmed through PCR assay with primers P1/P2 and P3/P4, and named as B. brevis X23(ΔedeB)-Apra. Finally, the Cre plasmid was transferred into B. brevis X23(ΔedeB)-Apra to generate B. brevis X23(ΔedeB) strain by removing Aprar. Next, the edeB gene was amplified by PCR with primer pairs edeB-Px-F and edeB-Px-R. The amplicons were recovered from agarose gel and purified. The edeB gene fragments and vector PAD-Apr-Px were digested with BamH I and Pst I endonucleases, respectively, and then connected by T4 DNA ligase to obtain the expression plasmid PAD-Apr-Px-edeB. Finally, the expression plasmid was transferred into wild-type B. brevis X23 strain and X23(ΔedeB) by electro-transfer. The edeB-complementary and overexpression strains were obtained through apramycin antibiotic resistance screening, and confirmed by PCR with primers xylR-5-out/pAD123-end. Assessment of bacterial growth The growth of wild-type B. brevis strain and its mutants were evaluated according to the previously published report (Lan et al., 2017). Briefly, the wild-type B. brevis X23 strain or mutants were preconditioned overnight in LB medium, and then transferred to fresh NB liquid medium (initial OD600 of 0.1), cultured at 30°C and 180 r/min. Then, the bacterial solution concentration (OD600) was measured on a spectrophotometer after 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of cultivation in the NB liquid medium. The fermentation experiments were repeated for three times, and each measurement was also conducted for three times in parallel. Evaluation of antibacterial activity B. subitlis 1A751 strain, which is sensitive to edeines, was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of edeines produced by B. brevis. The antibacterial activity of fermentation broth was evaluated according to the previous study (Dang et al., 2013). Briefly, B. brevis was cultivated in liquid NB for 48 h, and centrifugated at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to collect the supernatant, which was then filtrated through a filter (0.22 μm) to obtain sterile filtrate. B. subtilis 1A751 was spread on LB agar plates after dilution to OD600 of 0.1. A total of 100 μL filtrated B. brevis supernatant was added into each hole (diameter of 8 mm) of B. subtilis culture. Sterile LB medium was used as blank control (CK). After incubation at 30°C for 48 h, the antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the radius of antibacterial circle. The experiments were repeated for three times with three replicates each. RNA isolation and RT-qPCR The relatively transcriptional level of edeA, edeQ, and edeK on ede BGC was determined through RT-qPCR assay. The primers used on qPCR assay are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1
. Total RNA was extracted from B. brevis X23 and mutants after 48h of fermentation according to the instructions of EasyPure ® RNA Kit. Reverse transcription was conducted using the reverse transcription kit (EasyScript®One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix, TransGen). 2X Universal SYBR Green Fast For qPCR Mix kit (Abclone) was used in real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR assay on an ABI-QS5 real-time PCR experiment platform. Three parallel experiments were designed and each sample was repeated three times. The 16S rRNA gene in B. brevis was used as a control, and the comparative cycle threshold method was used for relative quantification (Livak and Schmittgen, 2013). Analysis of the promoter sequence of ede BGC The binding sites of ede BGC promoter were predicted through BPROM (http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=bprom&group=programs&subgroup=gfingf) and BDGP (https://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html). WeBlogo 3.0 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/) was used to create sequence logos for the -10 and -35 regions of the promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) EMSA was conducted to explore whether EdeB directly binds to the promoter region of ede BGC according to the previous method (Hellman and Fried, 2007). Briefly, the edeB gene was amplified from genomic DNA of wild-type B. brevis X23 using primers edeB-F and edeB-R. The vector pET28a was digested by Xba I and Xho I, and then incubated with purified amplicons of edeB. Then, the mixture was electroshocked into Escherichia coli GB05-dir containing the recombinant system through homologous recombination. The extracted plasmid was identified and transformed into competent cells BL21(DE3) to obtain recombinant strain BL21/pET28a-edeB. The EdeB protein was purified from the culture after IPTG induction. The promoter region edePro of ede BGC was amplified by PCR using primer pairs edePro-F/edePro-R with 6-FAM at the 5’end (
Supplementary Table 1
). Subsequently, the labeled DNA fragments were mixed with purified EdeB protein. The binding reaction system (20 uL) consists of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM EDTA, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, indicated amounts of EdeB protein and purified edePro composition. Randomly interrupted salmon sperm DNA was added to the binding reaction system to prevent nonspecific competition. After incubation on ice for 10 minutes, the reactants were run on 8% of TBE polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) with 0.5×TBE running buffer for 1 hour at 30 mA. Evaluation of edeine production through HPLC–MS Edeines produced by wild-type B. brevis X23 and its mutants were quantitatively analyzed by HPLC-MS. Briefly, HPLC-MS was performed on the HPLC system (Agilent 1260) in an ODS column (Shimadzu AQ-C18 HP, 2.1 mm×100 mm×3μm) with the following parameters: solvent A, acetonitrile; solvent B, 0.1% formic acid-water; elution procedures:5% A,10 min, 100% A, 2 min; flow rate was 0.3 mL/min; column temperature 40°C. Mass spectrometry conditions: MRM scanning mode, positive ion, molecular weight scanning range of 100 m/z. 1000 m/z, nebulizer flow rate of 3 L/min, heating gas flow rate of 10 L/min, interface temperature of 200°C, DL temperature of 200°C, heating block temperature of 350°C, and dryer flow rate of 10 L/min. The peak areas of edeine A (m/z 755.444 [M+H]+) and B (m/z 797.465 [M+H]+) were compared by HPLC-MS.
