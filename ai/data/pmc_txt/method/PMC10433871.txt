MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and culture conditions. Staphylococcus aureus DSM 20231 was studied in most of the conducted experiments. Escherichia coli BW25113 (obtained from the Keio Collection, Coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa DSM 19880, and Acinetobacter baumannii DSM 300007 were included in combinatory treatment experiments. S. aureus isolates from bloodstream infections were obtained from the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Aarhus University Hospital. All strains were cultured in a defined minimal M9 (CM-M9) medium unless otherwise stated. This medium contains M9 broth (Sigma-Aldrich cat no. 63011, containing NH4Cl [18.7 mM], Na2HPO4 [42.3 mM], KH2PO4 [22 mM], and NaCl [8.6 mM]), glucose (1%), Casamino acids (1%), CaCl2·2H2O (0.1 mM), MgSO4·7H2O (2 mM), thiamine hydrochloride (1 mM), nicotinamide (0.05 mM), and trace metal solution TMS3 (1 mL/L) (pH 7.4). Polyether ionophores. The chemical structures and selected properties of the polyether ionophores used in the current study can be found in Fig. S1. The compounds were obtained from the following sources: calcimycin, Alomone Labs (cat no. A-600); ionomycin, Alomone Labs (I-700); narasin, Sigma-Aldrich (N1271); salinomycin, Toku-E (S002); monensin, Toku-E (M083); maduramycin, Sigma-Aldrich (34069); and nanchangmycin, Sigma-Aldrich (SML2251). Lasalocid was prepared by isolating its sodium salt from the commercially available veterinary premix AVATEC, followed by acidic extraction with H2SO4 and crystallization from ethanol, but it can also be obtained from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no. 73996). MIC analysis. MIC analysis was performed by a broth microdilution method in 96-well microtiter plates in accordance with CLSI recommendations. Briefly, a culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 140 rpm, 37°C) and adjusted to a final density of 5 × 105 CFU/mL. Compound stocks were prepared in 2-fold serial dilutions in DMSO (final concentration < 5%). Bacteria were treated with compounds overnight (20 to 24h, 37°C), and growth was measured as absorbance at 600 nm using a Tecan NanoQuant Infinite M200 Pro Plate Reader. The absorbance value correlating to a difference visible with the unaided eye was determined to an absorbance of 0.07, and measurements above this value were deemed as growth when determining the MIC. Minimum bactericidal concentration analysis. MBC analysis was performed after MIC analysis of all concentrations without detectable growth. Cells were pelleted in 96-well microtiter plates (15 min, 3,000 rpm), and pellets were resuspended in 0.9% NaCl. Next, 10 μL of the suspension was spotted onto LB agar and allowed to dissolve into the agar. A concentration with visible growth was included as positive control. Agar plates were incubated overnight (16 to 24 h, 37°C) and checked for growth. A bactericidal effect is represented by a 3-log10 reduction in density, corresponding to a 99.9% reduction. Thus, spots with less than 5 colonies indicate a bactericidal effect and were used to determine the MBC. Biofilm assay. A culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) and adjusted to 1 × 107 CFU/mL. The adjusted culture was inoculated with a peg-lid (30 min, 37°C) to adhere biofilm cells onto pegs. The peg-lid was then transferred to fresh medium and allowed to grow overnight (24 h, 37°C) before treatment. Biofilm cells were treated for 24 h (37°C) in CM-M9 with compounds (dissolved in DMSO) in a 2-fold serial dilution prepared in medium-to-lower DMSO concentration. The peg-lid was washed twice in 0.9% NaCl and sonicated for 10 min in fresh medium, and biofilm cells were allowed to recover (72 h, 37°C). The MBIC was determined after 24 h of treatment, and the MBEC was determined after 72 h of recovery, both with absorbance measurement at 600 nm and visual inspection. Persister cell assay. A culture was grown aerated overnight (22 to 25, h, 37°C, 140 rpm) in tryptic soy broth (TSB), diluted 1:1,000 in fresh TSB, and incubated overnight a second time. The culture was adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.0 and washed using a modified CM-M9 medium (without glucose and Casamino acids). In a 96-well microtiter plate, compounds were dispensed in modified CM-M9 at 50× MIC, and the adjusted culture was added, yielding a final density of OD600 = 0.1. The plate was incubated overnight (20 to 24 h, 37°C), and pellets were washed by pelleting (10 min, 14,000 rpm) in a tabletop centrifuge in Eppendorf tubes to remove compounds. The cells were finally 10-fold serially diluted in modified CM-M9, and 10 μL from dilutions 100 to 107 was spotted onto LB agar. On the following day, colonies were counted for CFU/mL enumeration. Time-dependent killing. For early exponential phase, a culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) in CM-M9 medium, adjusted to 1 × 105 CFU/mL and grown to the early exponential phase (3 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) before treatment. For late exponential phase, a culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) in CM-M9 medium and used directly for treatment. In both cases, the cultures were diluted 1:10 with CM-M9 and treated with compounds in a 96-well format at 10× MIC (CM-M9). At six chosen time points (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h), samples were collected for CFU/mL enumeration. Here, the cells were washed (15 min, 3,000 rpm) in 0.9% NaCl in the 96-well plates and 10-fold serially diluted in 0.9% NaCl, and 10 μL from each dilution (100 to 106) was spotted onto LB agar. After incubation (16 to 24 h, 37°C), CFU/mL were enumerated. Resistance development by single-step method. Agar plates were prepared with 1× MBC of the desired compound by addition of compound (dissolved in DMSO) to 50 to 60°C LB agar. Meanwhile, a culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) and concentrated 20× by centrifugation (20 min, 4,000 rpm), yielding a final density of ~109 CFU/mL. Next, 100 μL of the dense culture was plated onto the agar plates containing compound, and plates were incubated for 24 to 72 h (37°C) and checked for growth each day. Resistance development by sequential passaging. An overnight culture (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) with a density of 1 × 108 CFU/mL was diluted 1:40 and treated with five different compound concentrations (0.25×, 0.5×, 1×, 2×, and 4× MIC) in a 96-well microtiter plate (one plate per technical triplicate). The plates were incubated overnight (22 to 24 h, 37°C) and checked for growth. The new MIC value was determined with visual inspection, and 5 μL from the well with highest concentration with detectable growth (0.5× the new MIC value) was passed on and treated with the five compound concentrations (0.25× to 4× MIC) relative to the new MIC, diluting the culture 1:40. This was repeated for 25 days or until resistance had developed. Every day, an untreated growth control and medium blank were included. DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing of S. aureus AUH1-8. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial kit (Qiagen) and quantified by a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) libraries were prepared by multiplexing using the Rapid Barcoding Sequencing kit (SQK-RBK110.96, ONT). Libraries were loaded onto a FLO-MIN106 R9.4.1 flow cell and sequenced on a MinION instrument using MinKNOW 22.12.7 (ONT). Basecalling was performed with Guppy v.6.4.6. Genome reconstruction and typing of S. aureus AUH1-8. Reads were demultiplexed and adaptors trimmed with porechop v.0.2.4. The trimmed reads were assembled into contigs with Flye v.2.9. The contigs were polished with medaka v.1.5.0 and the polished assemblies were annotated with Prokka v.1.14.5. The assemblies were typed and encoded antimicrobial resistance genes were identified using the CLC Microbial Genomics Module v.21.1.1 (Qiagen). Typing was done with the workflow “Type with large MLST scheme 1.2” with the parameters kmer size 21, minimum kmer ratio 0.2, typing threshold 0.99, search novel alleles, minimum required fraction of kmers 0.9, minimum length 50, and minimum length fraction 0.8. AMR genes were identified with the workflow “Find resistance with nucleotide DB 1.2” with the parameters minimum identity 98%, minimum length 60%, and filter overlaps. The genomic data have been submitted to GenBank under BioProject accession no. PRJNA961647. Isolation of genomic DNA and DNA sequencing. The genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from the nanchangmycin-resistant strains to perform DNA sequencing. For isolation of gDNA, the Monarch Genomic DNA purification kit was used (T3010S) together with bead-beating with zirconia/silica beads. The procedure for the Monarch kit was followed with a few adjustments, as follows. Overnight cultures (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) of each resistant strain and wild-type S. aureus DSM 20231 were grown to densities of ~1 × 108 CFU/mL and pelleted (1 min, 14,000 rpm). Pellets were resuspended in Tris-buffer and transferred to bead columns. Samples were bead-beaten (40 sec, 6.0 m/s), beads were pelleted (10 min, 12,300 × g), and supernatant was stored in the freezer overnight. The samples were then treated with enzymes: first lysozyme (20 mg/mL, 1 h, 37°C), then proteinase K (25 μL, 2 h, 56°C, 1,400 rpm) and finally RNase A (3 μL, 10 min, 56°C, 1,400 rpm). The lysed samples were then processed as described in the Monarch protocol for gDNA binding, washing, and elution. The samples were prepared for sequencing using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina) and paired-end sequenced (2 × 300 bp) on a MiSeq sequencer using the MiSeq Reagent kit V3 (Illumina). Geneious was used to trim the sequencing data (using BBduk) and then mapped onto the reported genome of S. aureus DSM 20231 (NZ_CP011526). All data have been deposited in GenBank under BioProject accession no. PRJNA877072 and the following accession numbers: CP104478 (untreated reference), CP104477 (resistant mutant 1), CP104476 (resistant mutant 2), and CP104475 (resistant mutant 3). Design of experiment approach. Using the design of experiment (DOE) approach, we studied the ionophores’ bioactivity in the presence of different cation concentrations. To test the desired concentrations, a modified version of the CM-M9 medium was prepared containing NH4Cl (1 g/L), Na2HPO4 (7.5 g/L), and NaH2PO4 (3 g/L) instead of the M9 broth. The desired concentrations of NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgSO4 could then be added. We wanted to test 17 different cation combinations and thus prepared 17 different media. A culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm) and diluted to a final density of 5 × 105 CFU/mL. The bacteria were treated with three different compound concentrations (0.25×, 1×, and 4× MIC) in the 17 different types of media in 96-well microtiter plates. Plates were incubated overnight (20 to 24 h, 37°C), and growth was measured by absorbance at 600 nm. A plate with blank media was also prepared and these absorbance values were subtracted from the growth values, giving the final growth responses. These values were plotted into the MODDE pro program, which performs statistical analysis showing how each cation affects growth, among other features. Fluorescence with 3,3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide. The ionophores’ effect on membrane potential was studied using the fluorogenic probe 3,3′-dipropyl-thiacarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)). A culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 37°C, 140 rpm), diluted to OD600 = 0.1, and incubated to early exponential phase (3 h, 37°C, 140 rpm). The culture was washed (4,000 rpm, 15 min, 4°C) three times in a sucrose buffer containing K2HPO4 ·3H2O (10 mM), MgSO4 ·7H2O (5 mM), and sucrose (250 mM) (pH 7.0). After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in the buffer supplemented with 0.1 M KCl to a final density of OD600 = 0.3. A culture plate was prepared in a black 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One 96-well μClear, black with clear bottom) in which the diluted culture was loaded with 1% of fluorescent dye DiSC3(5), yielding a final concentration of 1 μM DiSC3(5). The dye was allowed to stabilize for 15 min in the dark before fluorescence was measured (excitation 620 ± 10 nm, emission 685 ± 10 nm, gain 2,600, focal height 7.3 mm, top optic, and linear shaking of 500 rpm, 10s). In another black 96-well plate, compounds were dispensed as a 20× solution. Compounds were tested at 10× MIC, so stock solutions of 200× MIC were prepared in DMSO (final concentration = 5%). After the dye was stabilized inside the bacterial membrane, the culture loaded with dye was transferred to the compound plate, yielding the final concentration of 10× MIC. Fluorescence was measured for a total of 60 min. Controls of DMSO (5%) and buffer were included. Combinatorial treatments. For combinatorial treatments, the experiments were performed as described in the “MIC analysis” section, but with two compounds instead of one. The antibiotics were tested in 2-fold serial dilutions up to 16 μg/mL for polymyxin B and cloxacillin, or up to 32 μg/mL for kanamycin, and the ionophores were added at fixed dosages for each serial dilution. Eight different combinations were made, testing the ionophores in the concentration range of 0.125 to 16 μg/mL. The ionophores and antibiotics were also tested as single treatments as negative and positive controls, respectively. Screening of Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library. The Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library is stored in glycerol in 96-well microtiter plates at −80°C. Material from the frozen stock was transferred with a Deutz 96 Cryo-replicator from the 96-well microtiter plates onto TSB agar plates supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL of either lasalocid or salinomycin, 0.0625 μg/mL calcimycin, or 0.125 μg/mL calcimycin, corresponding to 1/16 MIC of the MRSA JE2 wild-type strain in TSB. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h and visually inspected for lack of growth of individual mutants. MICs of individual mutants were determined in TSB in a 96-well format and determined as the lowest concentration with no visible growth.
