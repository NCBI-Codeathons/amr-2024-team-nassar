MATERIALS AND METHODS Media. ISP2 medium (sporulation agar) consists of 0.4% yeast extract, 0.4% glucose, 1% malt extract, and 2% agar. T1 medium contains 1% glucose, 2% starch, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, and 0.4% CaCO3. JM medium consists of 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% MgCl2 (6H2O), 0.3% Tryptone Soya, and 10% sucrose. In all cases, the pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 prior to autoclaving. Luria-Bertani medium was used for the growth of Escherichia coli strains utilized for propagation of plasmids and for the preparation of ribosomes and cell extracts. Culture conditions of Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504. For the production and isolation of spores, Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 was grown in ISP2 medium for 7 to 10 days at 28°C. The white aerial mycelium, consisting of spores, was stripped from the upper layer of the plate using a spatula and dispersed into 1 ml of sterile water. The spore suspension was filtered through a wad of absorbent cotton, and the spores were concentrated by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min. The spores were resuspended in 100 μl of 20% glycerol and stored at –20°C. Genomic DNA extraction. Streptomyces spores (20 μl) were inoculated in 20 ml of JM medium at 28°C for 18 h with aeration. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and genomic DNA was extracted using the Invisorb spin plant minikit (Invitek). DNA amplification and sequence of rpsL from Streptomyces sp. Oligonucleotide primers GSF1 and GSR1 (Table 1), designed to cover the coding region of the rpsL gene from Streptomyces, were used to amplify by PCR the target gene using genomic DNA as the template. The DNA sequence of the amplicon, covering approximately 95% of the coding region, was analyzed to identify the amino acid variants carried by the antibiotic producer strain.

rpsL gene were obtained using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) and, as the template for the PCR, the plasmid vector pET11a carrying the coding sequence of S12, derived from E. coli MC4100 (rpsL150 [Strr]). The DNA sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to introduce codon variants are indicated in Table 1. E. coli DH5 cells were transformed with the mutagenized plasmids, and Sanger DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of mutated nucleotides. Preparation of E. coli and Streptomyces S30 cell extracts. E. coli MRE600 cells were grown at 37°C in LB medium until they reached mid-log phase, while Streptomyces cells were grown at 28°C in T1 medium for 45 h. Both cell types were disrupted by grinding with precooled alumina in a chilled mortar and processed following a previously described protocol (45). Both S30 extracts were extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 10 mM Mg acetate, 60 mM NH4Cl, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and stored in small aliquots at –80°C. Isolation of ribosomes and ribosomal subunits. The crude extract S30 was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 17 h at 4°C. The supernatant, called S100, was stored at –80°C, while the pellet, consisting of 70S ribosomes, was resuspended and split in two aliquots, one for in vitro assays and one for preparation of 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits. 70S ribosomes were dissociated into subunits at 1 mM Mg2+ concentration by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 17h at 4°C in a swing bucket rotor (SW28), on a 10% to 30% sucrose density gradient (45). In vitro translation assays. Cell-free systems programmed with either poly(U) or 027 model mRNA were used to investigate the effect of dityromycin on the bacterial translational apparatus. Translation activity tests were performed using either S30 extracts or S100 extracts and 70S ribosomes, or crisscrossed combinations of E. coli and Streptomyces sp. S100 extracts and 70S ribosomes (46). Ribosome pulldown assay. The binding of dityromycin to either Streptomyces or E. coli 30S ribosomal subunits was monitored by an ultracentrifugation-based assay. Increasing concentrations of 30S subunits were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with a fixed amount of antibiotic (1 μM) in 90 μl of a solution consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 10 mM Mg acetate, 60 mM NH4Cl, and 0.5 mM DTT. After ultracentrifugation in a S-100 AT-3 rotor at 100,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C, aliquots of 20 μl of the supernatant were removed and tested in poly(U)-dependent in vitro translation assays. Determination of MIC. To verify the incorporation of S12 mutants in E. coli ribosomes, a MIC plate (5 rows × 12 wells) was set up with increasing concentrations of streptomycin, ranging from 0.0 μg/μl to 512.0 μg/μl. Each well of the plate contained 190 μl of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS cell culture. The plate rows contained the following: (i) no-plasmid control, (ii) pET11a expression vector with rpsL150, (iii) mutant V32/T32, (iv) mutant R55/K55, and (v) mutant V78/I78. A MIC plate (4 rows × 12 wells) with the four tester strains and a gradient of dityromycin (from 0.0 μg/μl to 400 μg/μl) was used to estimate the ability of the mutant proteins to counteract the presence of the antibiotic.
