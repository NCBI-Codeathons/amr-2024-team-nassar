Materials and methods Identification and cloning of Pitohui NaV1.4, NaV1.5, and NaVβ2 Genomic DNA from Pum (family Oriolidae) blood and tissue was extracted using DNeasy kits (Qiagen) to create whole-genome sequence libraries for the poisonous Pitohui birds. Tissue samples were collected in 1989 near the village of Bonua, Central Province, Papua New Guinea (10°08′S by 149°10′30″E), stored in ethanol in the field, and frozen since being in the laboratory. Two genome sequence libraries were created using Illumina Nextera kits. One library had a target insert size of 500–640 bp and occupied a full run on the MiSeq genetic analyzer using 300-bp paired-end reads. The second library had a target insert size of 640–709 bp and occupied a full lane of a HiSeq 2500 in rapid run mode using 150-bp paired-end reads. The MiSeq run returned 16,279,946 paired-end reads. The program BBmerge version 4.0 (US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute; https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmerge-guide/) was used to join the forward and reverse reads into a single long read. 7,050,488 of the read pairs (∼43%) were joined, and the remaining reads were retained as paired-end reads or single reads for later analyses. The average size of merged reads was 542.6 bases. All reads were then trimmed using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) for minimum length, removing adapters, and performing basic quality filtering. All unmerged and unpaired reads were combined into a single FastQ file. The HiSeq run returned 150,979,291 paired-end reads. We removed adapters, trimmed for minimum length, and performed basic quality filtering using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). 130,607,604 pairs of reads (86.51%) passed filtering, another 9,199,536 (6.09%) of forward-only reads passed filter, and 3,342,519 (2.21%) of reverse-only reads passed filter. These two read sets (the MiSeq and HiSeq Illumina datasets) composed the data for gene assembly. Corvus brachyrhynchos and Corvus cornix crows (family Corvidae; from Joel McGlothlin, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA) were the closest living relatives of Pitohuis that had a fully annotated genome in the sodium channel gene regions. Crow sequences were used as reference sequences for BLAST searches of Pitohui sequences and for assisting with Pitohui NaV assembly. These sequences included the complete nuclear DNA sequence with all exons, introns, and upstream and downstream untranslated regions. To assemble the SCN4A gene from our Pitohui reads, we used the following pipeline, written as a Bash shell script. First, we used BLATq version 1.0.2 (https://github.com/calacademy-research/BLATq), which uses BLAT (Kent, 2002; https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent), to search all Illumina data (those merged and unmerged, as well as paired and unpaired reads) for any sequences that aligned with the full genome sequences of one of the Corvus NaV1.4 sodium channel genes. We then used the script excerptByIDs version 1.0.2 (https://github.com/calacademy-research/excerptByIDs) to create a new FastQ file consisting of only the Illumina reads with strong BLATq scores. These files were combined into a single set of all BLAT “hits” using the Unix “cat” command. We then used the assembler SPAdes 3.9.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) to perform an initial de novo assembly of reads in the hit file. We improved upon this assembly by using the genome assembly program PRICE version 1.2 (Ruby et al., 2013), which iteratively extends the assembly beginning with the assembled contigs from SPAdes, and extending using the paired-end Illumina read data (the entire HiSeq paired-end data as well as the unmerged MiSeq data). See Data S1 for the assembly Bash shell script and options and parameters. The assembled contigs from PRICE were loaded into Geneious (versions 8.0 through 11.0.2). Within Geneious, we used BLAST to identify which contigs contained the Pitohui sequences. We created a BLAST database consisting of all of the assembled PRICE contigs, and we used each of the Corvus NaV1.4 exons to query the BLAST database of contigs using MegaBLAST. The top hits for each exon suggested which assembled contigs contained the NaV1.4 sequence, and typically several to all of the exons were found on the same contig. Assuming that the exon splice patterns were identical in crow and Pitohui, we aligned each of the crow NaV1.4 exon sequences to the top-hit Pitohui contig, and we annotated the matching exon regions as the Pitohui SCN4A exons. This assembly and annotation pipelines were repeated for primary NaVs NaV1.5 α-subunit (SCN5A) and the NaV β-subunit (SCN2B). Cloning of poison frog NaVs Skeletal muscle was harvested from captive P. terribilis and D. tinctorius (Josh’s Frogs) after euthanasia in accordance with University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (UCSF IACUC) protocol AN136799. Total RNA and total DNA were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 5′ and 3′ end sequences of genes encoding for P. terribilis and D. tinctorius NaV1.4 were determined by DNA gel extraction and sequencing after rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the SMARTer RACE 5′/3′ Kit (Takara Bio) and internal primers designed from P. terribilis and D. tinctorius NaV1.4 S6 segment sequences (Tarvin et al., 2016). From these 5′ end and 3′ end sequences, new primers were designed from both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of each gene and were used to amplify full-length P. terribilis and D. tinctorius NaV1.4 genes by PCR using Phusion HF (New England Biolabs). PCR products were gel extracted and sequenced to determine the full-length P. terribilis and D. tinctorius NaV1.4 gene sequences. Direct cloning of the full-length PCR products of P. terribilis and D. tinctorius NaV1.4 channel genes into pCDNA3.1 proved problematic, resulting in unstable constructs prone to deletion. The codon-optimized genes were synthesized for expression in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293; GenScript) but were also found to be prone to recombination upon insertion into pCDNA3.1. Finally, the gene sequences were redesigned to differ as much as possible from the original genes, synthesized (GenScript), and cloned into pCDNA3.1. This strategy yielded stable constructs. Subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis For electrophysiology experiments, Homo sapiens (Hs) NaV1.4 (GenBank accession no. NM_000334.4), human NaVβ1 (GenBank accession no. NM_001037.5), Pum NaV1.4, Pum NaVβ2, Pum NaV1.5, P. terribilis (Pt) NaV1.4, and D. tinctorius (Dt) NaV1.4 were subcloned into pCDNA3.1 and Rattus norvegicus (Rn) NaV1.4 (GenBank accession no. Y17153.1) was subcloned into pZem228. All mutants were made using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) and validated by complete sequencing of the genes encoding for the proteins of interest. Patch-clamp electrophysiology HEK293 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for HEK293 cells or Kaighn’s modified Ham’s F-12 medium for CHO cells) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% L-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 IU ml−1 penicillin and 100 mg ml−1 streptomycin). HEK293 cells were transfected (in 35-mm-diameter wells) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and plated onto coverslips coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Human and Pitohui NaVs were coexpressed with enhanced GFP (EGFP) and human NaVβ1 or Pitohui NaVβ2. Poison frog NaVs were coexpressed with EGFP. Transfected cells were identified visually by EGFP expression. A total of 2 µg plasmid DNA (20% NaVα, 40% NaVβ, 40% EGFP) was transfected, except for the poison frog NaVs, for which a total of 3 µg plasmid DNA (70% NaVα, 15% EGFP, 15% SV40 T antigen) was used to increase current amplitude. For mock transfections, the NaVα-encoding plasmid was replaced by an empty pcDNA3.1+ plasmid. Experiments designed for studying Rn NaV1.4 constructs were conducted using CHO cells cultured as described previously (Andresen and Du Bois, 2009). Briefly, cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone Laboratories) and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were kept in a 5% CO2 and 96% relative humidity incubator. CHO cells were transfected in a 10-cm plate using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and EGFP expression as a marker of transfection. Na+ currents were recorded by whole-cell patch clamping (Hamill et al., 1981) at room temperature (23 ± 2°C) 48–72 h after transfection. Data collection was performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and pCLAMP 9 software (Molecular Devices). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (TW150F-3; World Precision Instruments) and polished with a microforge (MF-900; Narishige) to obtain 1.2–3.5-MΩ resistances. Whole-cell access resistance was 3–8 MΩ, pipette capacitance was fully compensated, and 65–80% of the voltage error due to the series resistance was compensated. For experiments with HEK293 cells, pipette solution contained the following in mM: 120 Cs methane sulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH). Bath solution contained the following in mM: 155 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For experiments with CHO cells, pipette solution contained the following in mM: 125 CsCl, 40 NaF, 1 EDTA, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH). Bath solution contained the following in mM: 160 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For experiments with human, bird, and frog channels, voltage-dependent activation was assessed by stimulating the cells with a multistep depolarization protocol from −90 to +50 mV using 5-mV increments, a −100-mV holding potential, and a sweep-to-sweep interval duration of 2 s. Voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation was assessed by stimulating the cells with a 500-ms prepulse depolarization from −110 to 0 mV in 5-mV steps, followed by a 20-ms step to 0 mV, and repolarization to the holding potential, −100 mV; sweep-to-sweep interval duration was 4 s. To examine BTX effects, cells were stimulated upon BTX exposure by applying at least 120 step pulses from −120 to 0 mV at 2-Hz frequency in order to facilitate BTX access into the channel pore because BTX is known to preferentially interact with the open state of NaVs (Tanguy and Yeh, 1991). For experiments with rat NaV1.4, voltage-dependent activation was assessed by stimulating the cells with a multistep depolarization protocol from −120 to +50 mV using 5-mV increments and a −120-mV holding potential. Voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation was assessed by stimulating the cells with a 150-ms prepulse depolarization from −140 to 0 mV in 5-mV steps, followed by a 50-ms step to 0 mV, and repolarization to the holding potential, −120 mV. Equilibration of BTX was accomplished with persistent activation of channels by applying a 24-ms step depolarization from −120 to 0 mV at a frequency of 2 Hz over the course of 8 min. Leak currents were subtracted using a P/4 protocol during data acquisition. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit 10.6 (Axon Instruments). Activation curves were obtained by fitting the data with the following single or double Boltzmann equations: I = Imax/{1 + exp[(V1/2 − Vm)/k]} or I = {Imax1/[1+exp({V1/2,1 − Vm}/k1)]} + {Imax2/[1 + exp({V1/2,2 − Vm}/k2)]}, where Imax is the maximal current after normalization to the driving force, V1/2 is the half-activation potential, Vm is the membrane potential, and k is the slope factor. Inactivation curves were obtained by fitting the data with the following single Boltzmann equation: I = Imax/{1 + exp[(Vm − V1/2)/k]}, where Imax is the absolute value of the maximal current at the test pulse, V1/2 is the half-inactivation potential, Vm is the membrane potential, and k is the slope factor. Current density was determined as the ratio between current amplitude and the membrane capacitance. In cells transfected with NaV constructs, green cells having no apparent NaV currents were extremely rare and therefore were not included in current density assessment. All cells with a whole-cell access resistance >8 MΩ or a leak current more negative than −200 pA were excluded. Two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed on defolliculated stages V–VI Xenopus laevis oocytes harvested (under UCSF IACUC protocol AN178461) 1–2 d after microinjection with mRNA. Linearized Pitohui (Pum), Pt, or Dt NaV1.4 cDNA was translated into capped mRNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen). Xenopus oocytes were injected with 0.5–2 ng, 3–6 ng, or 10–30 ng of Pum NaV1.4, Pt NaV1.4, or Dt NaV1.4 mRNA, respectively. Two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed 1–2 d after injection. Data were acquired using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (MDS Analytical Technologies) controlled by pClamp software (Molecular Devices) and digitized at 1 kHz using a Digidata 1332A digitizer (MDS Analytical Technologies). Oocytes were impaled with borosilicate recording microelectrodes (0.3–3.0-MΩ resistance) backfilled with 3 M KCl. Sodium currents were recorded using a bath solution (RS) containing the following in mM: 96 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 2 KCl, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.5 with NaOH) supplemented with antibiotics (50 µg ml−1 gentamicin, 100 IU ml−1 penicillin, and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin) and 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate. For studying the competition between tricaine and BTX, 0.5 mM tricaine was applied by continuous perfusion in the bath solution to assess channel block. BTX was applied from the intracellular side of the membrane by injecting oocytes with 50 nl of 2 mM BTX. After BTX injection, oocytes were stimulated by applying 1,000 step pulses of 60 ms each, from −120 to 0 mV at 2 Hz frequency, in order to facilitate BTX access into the channel pore. To determine STX and TTX dose–response curves, solutions containing test concentrations of each toxin were applied in series by perfusion to oocytes expressing Pum NaV1.4, Pt NaV1.4, or Dt NaV1.4. IC50 values were calculated from the ratio of peak currents in the presence and absence of toxin, based on the following equation: IxI0=(Imax−Imin)(1+xIC50), where Ix is the current amplitude at the toxin concentration x, I0 is the current amplitude in absence of toxin, and Imax and Imin are the maximum and minimum peak current amplitudes, respectively, and IC50 is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration. To determine the effects of Sxph on Pt NaV1.4 STX responses, Rana catesbeiana Sxph was expressed from a pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (Yen et al., 2019). Sxph concentration was determined by measuring A280nm using an extinction coefficient of 96,365 M−1 cm−1 calculated using the ExPASY server (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). For experiments in which Sxph:STX were premixed before being applied to Xenopus oocytes expressing Pt NaV, varied Sxph:STX ratios were made by adding purified Sxph from a 100 µM Sxph stock solution (150 mM NaCl and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to 100 nM STX in (RS) at least 10 min before perfusion. In the order of addition experiments, following recording channel behavior in the absence of the toxins, toxin concentrations to achieve ∼90% block, 100 nM STX or 300 nM TTX, in RS was applied to the channels before Sxph to the desired concentration was then added directly to a 1-ml recording chamber containing the toxin. For all [Sxph]:[STX] ratios, the concentration of the stock Sxph solution added to the chamber was adjusted so that the volume of the added Sxph solution was <1% of the total volume of the recording chamber. All toxin effects were assessed with 60-ms depolarization steps from −120 to 0 mV with a holding potential of −120 mV and a sweep-to-sweep duration of 10 s. Recordings were conducted at room temperature (23 ± 2°C). Leak currents were subtracted using a P/4 protocol during data acquisition. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit 10.6 (Axon Instruments) and a custom software developed in the Igor environment (Wavemetrics). Toxin challenge experiments Frogs for the toxin challenge experiments were obtained from the following sources: Polypedates leucomystax, P. terribilis, and D. tinctorius (Josh’s Frogs); Xenopus (Nasco); and Mantella aurantiaca (Indoor Ecosystems). All experiments were performed in accordance with UCSF IACUC protocol AN136799. Frogs were held at room temperature (23 ± 2°C) and anesthetized with a 0.15% tricaine (MS-222) bath before toxin injections. Once under anesthesia, as judged by immobility and lack of response to foot pinching, frogs were weighed in order to calculate the appropriate amount of toxin to be administered at 20 times the LD50 based on the values calculated for mice as follows: BTX, 2 µg/kg (Albuquerque et al., 1971); STX, 10 µg/kg (Wiberg and Stephenson, 1960); and TTX, 12.5 µg/kg (Lago et al., 2015). BTX, STX, and TTX were delivered using 40 ng, 200 ng, and 250 ng of toxin, respectively, per gram of animal weight. The upper right hind leg was injected with either control, PBS, or toxin-containing solution under an SMZ645 binocular microscope (Nikon) using a 30-gauge PrecisionGlide needle (BD Biosciences). BTX, STX, or TTX dissolved in PBS was injected at the appropriate concentration to deliver 20 times the LD50. The total volume of injection was 100 µl in Xenopus and 10 µl in other frogs due to their smaller size. The choice of intramuscular injection was to avoid internal organ damage. Frogs were allowed to recover in a separate container and monitored constantly for signs of recovery, paralysis, or other adverse symptoms. For Xenopus, the recovery container was filled with deionized water and inclined in a way that the frogs could recover on the dry surface of the container base. Postrecovery activity was then assessed by the ability of the frogs to move from the dry to the water-containing surface because Xenopus are primarily aquatic animals. For all other frogs, postrecovery activity was assessed by monitoring the ability of the animals to put themselves right side up from a supine position in their recovery containers. The monitoring period was up to 24 h after injection; and three animals were tested for each condition. Online supplemental material Fig. S1 shows Pitohui and poison frog NaV1.4 sequences.
