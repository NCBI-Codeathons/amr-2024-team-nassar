Material and methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions All resistance cassettes, bacterial strains and phages used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2. For Streptomyces venezuelae, precultures for growth and infection assays were inoculated from spore stocks in glucose–yeast extract–malt extract (GYM) medium containing 50% tap water, pH 7.3 and cultivated at 30°C and 120 rpm for 18 h. Precultures were subsequently used to inoculate main cultures in the same medium to the indicated OD450. For Escherichia coli, cultures were inoculated from a single clone grown on LB agar plates and cultivated at 170 rpm and 37°C O/N in LB medium for being subsequently used to inoculate main cultures to the indicated OD600. In all cases, antibiotics were added to cultures as indicated. For standard cloning procedures and protein overproduction E. coli DH5α and E. coli BL21 (DE3) were used, respectively. Infection assays with phage λ were conducted in E. coli LE392 and conjugation between Streptomyces spp. and E. coli was done via the conjugative E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002. In order to determine the titer of plaque-forming units during infection assays, spot assays were conducted. To this end, 2 µl of decimal dilution series of culture supernatant in sodium chloride/magnesium sulfate buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2) were spotted on a bacterial lawn propagated on a double-agar overlay with the top layer inoculated to an optical density of OD450 = 0.3 and OD600 = 0.2 for S. venezuelae and E. coli, respectively. Plaque assays with S. venezuelae were done in a comparable manner by adding 103 PFU/ml of phage Alderaan to GYM soft-agar inoculated with mycelium to an OD450 of 0.3. Plaque areas were analysed using ImageJ and the color thresholding tool (Schneider et al. 2012). To this end, images were cropped and the color threshold settings were adjusted to select plaques as accurately as possible. Subsequently, plaque areas were measured using the “analyse particle” option with the following parameters: size (pixel2): 40 to infinity, circularity: 0.1–1.0. Recombinant DNA work and cloning All plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Tables S3 and S4. Standard cloning techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction digestion with indicated restrictions enzymes and Gibson assembly were performed according to standard protocols (Sambrook and Russell 2001, Gibson 2011). DNA sequencing as well as synthesis of oligonucleotides and (codon-optimized) genes was performed by Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). Phage infection curves Growth assays and phage infection curves were performed in the BioLector microcultivation system [Beckman Coulter Life Sciences (formerly m2p-labs), Krefeld, Germany] using a shaking frequency of 1200 rpm and cultivation temperature of 30°C. Biomass was measured as a function of backscattered light intensity with an excitation wavelength of 620 nm (filter module: λEx/λEm: 620 nm/620 nm, gain: 25) from three independent biological replicates. Cultivation of S. venezuelae was performed in 1 ml GYM medium (pH 7.3, 50% tap water) inoculated with an overnight culture to a starting OD450 of 0.15. Infection was conducted by supplementing the indicated initial phage titers to the respective wells. Culture supernatants were collected in specific time intervals to monitor phage amplification over time via double-agar overlay assays. Cocultivation in submerged cultures Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius strains were inoculated from mycelial stocks in 5 ml GYM medium (pH 7.3, 50% tap water) and cultivated at 170 rpm and 30°C for 24 h. Subsequently, these precultures were used to inoculate 20 ml GYM medium (pH 7.3, 50% tap water) to an initial OD450 of 0.2. Cultures were incubated for 2 days at 120 rpm and 30°C to allow production and secretion of apramycin or its biosynthesis intermediates. One day prior to the cocultivation assay, S. venezuelae NRRL B-65442- pIJ10257-kamB was inoculated from spores in 5 ml GYM medium (pH 7.3, 50% tap water) and cultivated at 170 rpm and 30°C for 18 h. For cocultivation, 1 OD unit of S. tenebrarius mycelium was mixed with 1 OD unit of S. venezuelae mycelium in 1 ml GYM medium (pH 7.3, 50% tap water). Cultivation was performed in the BioLector microcultivation system as described in “Phage infection curves” in biological triplicates. Phage infection was performed by addition of 108 PFU/ml Alderaan particles. As comparison, mycelium of S. tenebrarius was either directly transferred to cocultivations or washed twice beforehand to remove produced metabolites. Preparation of culture supernatants (referred to as spent media) In order to collect spent medium of the natural apramycin producer S. tenebrarius and respective biosynthesis mutants, all strains were cultivated as described in “Cocultivation in submerged cultures” using a final cultivation volume of 70 ml GYM medium (pH 7.3, 50% tap water). Culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4°C for 20 min and subsequently sterile filtered before storage at 4°C for subsequent usage in infection assays. Infection assays in spent medium Infection assays of apramycin-resistant S. venezuelae NRRL B-65442-pIJ10257-kamB in spent medium were conducted in the BioLector microcultivation system (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) as described in “Phage infection curves” with the following modifications: 1.25x GYM medium (pH 7.3, 50% tap water) was supplemented with spent medium to a final concentration of 20% (v/v). Purification of biosynthesis intermediates Paromamine and oxyapramycin were generated from ΔaprD4 mutant WDY288 (Lv et al. 2016). Acetylated apramycin and acetylated pseudotetrasaccharide were generated from ΔaprP mutant WDY321 (Zhang et al. 2021). The two mutant strains were cultivated on SPA medium (2% soluble starch, 0.1% beef extract, 0.05% MgSO4, 0.1% KNO3, 0.05% NaCl, 0.05% K2HPO4, 2% agar) at 37°C for spore production. Their seed culture was prepared in 5 ml TSBY medium (3% tryptone soya broth and 0.5% yeast extract) at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm for 2 days. The seed culture of ΔaprD4 and ΔaprP were subcultured into 50 ml SPC fermentation medium (4% glucose, 1% peptone, 0.4% soybean meal, 1% corn meal, 0.4% MgSO4*7H2O, 0.5% NH4Cl, 0.05% FeSO4, 0.03% MnCl2, 0.003% ZnSO4, 0.5% CaCO3) at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm for 7 days. The culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min. Afterwards, the supernatant was adjusted to a pH of 2–3 with saturated oxalate and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min. Next, the supernatant was loaded onto the 732 cation exchange resin (Hebi Juxing Resinco., Ltd, Hebi, China), before being eluted by 3% ammonia hydroxide solution. Finally, the ammonia hydroxide eluate was purged with a nitrogen stream. The filtered eluate was concentrated and subjected to a semipreparative HPLC System equipped with Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD, Alltech 2000ES) and an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (5 µm, 250 mm × 9.4 mm). Gradient elution was performed at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. The gas flow and temperature of ELSD was set to 2.9 l/min and 109°C. Gradient elution was performed at a flow rate of 3 ml/min with solvent A (water containing 10 mM heptafluorobutyric acid) and solvent B (CH3CN): 0–3 min, constant 80% A/20% B; 3–5 min, a linear gradient to 75% A/25% B; 5–9 min, a linear gradient to 70% A/30% B; 9–17 min, a linear gradient to 59% A/41% B; 17–18 min, a linear gradient to 80% A/20% B; and 18–25 min, constant with 80% A/20% B. The eluent containing the target components was collected and subsequently dried through lyophilization. Protein purification via affinity chromatography For heterologous protein overproduction, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing C-terminal Strep-tagged versions of the respective resistance genes on the pAN6 plasmid were precultivated in LB medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin (LB Kan50) at 37°C and 120 rpm. The preculture was used to inoculate the main culture in the same medium to an OD600 of 0.1 and cultivation was continued at 37°C and 120 rpm until gene expression was induced with 100 µM IPTG at an OD600 of 0.6. Cells were harvested after further cultivation at 120 rpm and 18°C for 16 h. Cell harvesting and disruption were performed with the multi shot cell disruptor at 20 000 psi using buffer A (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0) with cOmplete™ Protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for cell resuspension and disruption. After centrifugation at 20 000 × g and 4°C for 30 min, buffer B (100 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) was used for purification. To this end, supernatant containing either the C-terminal Strep-tagged ApmA or the AAC(3)-IVa apramycin acetyltransferase was applied to an equilibrated 2 ml Strep-Tactin-Sepharose column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). After washing with 30 ml buffer B, the protein was eluted with 5 ml buffer B containing 15 mM d-desthiobiotin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). After purification, elution fractions with the highest protein concentrations were pooled and checked by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli 1970) using a 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN gradient gel (BioRad, Munich, Germany). Final protein concentration of the pooled elution fraction was determined with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) before being used for in vitro acetylation. In vitro acetylation of apramycin Purification of the two acetyltransferases AAC(3)-IVa and ApmA was performed as described above. Acetylation of apramycin was done as described in Kever et al. (2022) with the following modifications: assay mixtures were composed of 350 µl 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 50 µl purified enzyme (end concentration: 30 µg/ml), 50 µl apramycin (end concentration: 10 mM) and 50 µl acetyl-CoA trisodium salt (Sigma Aldrich; end concentration: 10 mM). The assay mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions lacking acetyl-CoA trisodium salt as a cofactor served as controls. Direct injection mass spectrometry For checking acetylation efficiency, direct injection mass spectrometry was performed. To this end, samples were diluted 1:100 (v/v) with deionized water and further 1:10 (v/v) with 50% methanol containing 0.1% acetic acid. The individual samples were directly injected into the HESI-source of a QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) using a 500 µl syringe with a constant flow of 5 µl/min. The source parameters were set as follows: spray voltage (+): 3200 V, capillary temperature: 320.00°C, sheath gas: 8.0, aux gas: 2.0, S-Lens RF Level: 50.00. Once the spray stabilized data were acquired for 2 min in positive mode with a full scan resolution of 70 000 and an AGC target of 3e6. Representative spectra data were retrieved from mid run scans for each sample.
