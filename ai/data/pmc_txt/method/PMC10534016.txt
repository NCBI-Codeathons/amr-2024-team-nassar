Materials and methods Microbial culture and preservation The cultivation and plant protection laboratory of the Tea Research Institute of the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences isolated Br. brevis HNCS-1 from tea garden soil and deposited it in China Center for Type Culture Collection (No. M 2022713). The cultivation and plant protection laboratory isolated and preserved Gloeosporium theae-sinensis, Elsinoe leucospira, Phyllosticta theaefolia, Fusarium sp., and Cercospora theae. The fungi were routinely cultivated at 26°C on a PDA medium (6 g potato extract, 20 g dextrose, 20 g agar, 1,000 ml H2O, pH 5.6 ± 0.2) and stored at 4°C on the same medium. Before using them in an experiment, they were activated on a PDA medium for 24 h at 26°C and then transferred by streaking. The HNCS-1 strain was stored in 20% glycerol at −80°C. It was activated by streaking at 37°C for 12 h on LB agar medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl, 15 g agar, 1,000 ml H2O, pH 7.0 ± 0.1). Antibiotics activity of Brevibacillus brevis HNCS-1 Br. brevis HNCS-1 was inoculated into 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of the LB liquid medium and cultivated at 37°C and 200 rpm for 12 h. Then, 10 ml of the seed cultures were transferred to 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing the NB medium (10 g peptone, 3 g beef extract, 5g NaCl, 1,000 ml H2O, and pH 7.2 ± 0.2) and cultivated at 37°C and 180 rpm for 3 days. Br. brevis HNCS-1 fermentation broth was centrifuged at 4°C and 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. On a PDA medium containing a 10% cell-free supernatant of Br. brevis HNCS-1, spore germination was used to determine the bacteriostatic activity against fungi. A fungus cake was made using a 5 mm diameter sterile cork borer and placed in the center of the plate. Plates of P. theaefolia, Fusarium sp., E. leucospira, and C. theae were incubated at 26°C for 12 days, 11 days, 22 days, 22 days, and 7 days, respectively. The experiment was performed thrice. The antagonistic activity of Br. brevis HNCS-1 was evaluated by inhibition rate (IR), which is calculated using the following formula: where A is the diameter of tea fungus disks in the control treatment, B is the diameter of tea fungus disks with Br. brevis HNCS-1, and 5 is the diameter of the disks inoculated with tea fungus. Genome sequencing, annotation, and alignment The entire genome of Br. brevis HNCS-1 was sequenced using the Illumina and Nanopore platforms. Guangdong Magigene Technology Co., Ltd. performed this study in China. Following the standard protocol provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), the sequencing procedure includes sample quality detection, library construction, library quality detection, and library sequencing. SMRT Link v5.1.0 was chosen for the assembly of third-generation data alone, and Unicycle was chosen for the assembly of second-generation and third-generation data. tRNAscan-SE v1.3.1, rRNAmmer v1.2, and Rfam databases briefly predicted Glimmer, tRNAs, and rRNAs, respectively. PHAST identified prophage sequences within the genome assemblies. Island viewer predicted Genomic Islands (GIs). The complete nucleotide sequence was also searched against Non-Redundant (NR) Protein Database, Swiss-Port, Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COGs), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), Pfam, Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database, Pathogen–Host Interactions (PHIs), Virulence Factor Database (VFDB), and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) for functional annotation and further function assignment. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and Diamond were used to compare the gene sequence with the reference database sequences. The finest matching results were selected based on identity, e-value, and score, which were the results of genome annotation. Circular maps of the genome were generated using Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009). Phylogenetic tree and pan-genome analysis Br. brevis HNCS-1 and 17 other Br. brevis genomes were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, with B. subtilis ATCC 13952 serving as an out-group. Except for Br. brevis HNCS-1, all sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Table 1). OrthoFinder software (Emms and Kelly, 2019) was used to generate a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree, which was visualized using Figtree v1.4.4. To evaluate the phylogeny of the Br. brevis strains, average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated using the FastANI software (Jain et al., 2018). The thermal map was then visualized using the TBtools software (Chen et al., 2020). Genome features of Brevibacillus brevis strains used in this study.

To identify the core and strain-specific genes, a pan-genome analysis was performed on 18 Br. brevis isolates using the BPGA v1.3 software, which implemented functional ortholog clustering using the amino acid sequences based on Gene Family (GF) approach (Chaudhari et al., 2016). The collection of genes shared by all 18 strains was referred to as the pan-genome, while the set of shared genes within the test genomes was referred to as their core genomes. For pan-genome genetic contexts, Heap's Law can be represented by the following formula: where y represents the extent of the pan-genome, n represents the number of genomes, and k and γ are fitting parameters. According to this law, γ can be calculated as α = 1–γ, so when α < 1 (0 < γ < 1), the extent of the pan-genome increases unboundedly with the successive addition of new genomes and is considered open. In contrast, if α > 1 (γ < 0), the pan-genome trajectory approaches a plateau and can be considered closed as additional genomes are added (De Jesus et al., 2022). Prediction of genes related to antibacterial activity The NR database was chosen as the protein sequence database for our annotation system based on a balance of quality, comprehensiveness, and our practical needs. Using the complete nucleotide sequence of the Br. brevis HNCS-1 genome, the online tools antiSMASH 6.0 (Blin et al., 2021) were able to identify clusters of secondary metabolite genes. Isolation and antibiotic activity of AMPs One thousand milliliters of Br. brevis HNCS-1 supernatant was frozen at −80°C for 24 h and then concentrated to 20 ml by vacuum freeze drying. The concentrated sample (2 ml) was separated by column chromatography on Sephadex G-75 using an H2O-CH3OH gradient [H2O, H2O-CH3OH = 4:1 (v/v), H2O-CH3OH = 3:2 (v/v), H2O-CH3OH = 2:3 (v/v), H2O-CH3OH = 1:4 (v/v), CH3OH]. The eluent was collected using an EP tube, ranging from 0.7 ml to 1.0 ml per tube. The cell-free eluate's antibacterial activity against G. thea-sinensis was determined using agar diffusion on a PDA medium after it was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter membrane. In total, 1 ml of G. thea-sinensis spore suspension was distributed across the agar surface of the plates. Then, a sterilized cork borer was used to create 5 mm diameter wells with equal spacing in the agar. Overall, 3 days were spent incubating the dishes at 26°C. The experiment was performed thrice. UHPLC-MS/MS method For the separation, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (Exion, SCIEX) was utilized. The process utilized an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 2.7 μm) with acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid in water (B) as gradient elution mobile phases at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The gradient elution protocol was as follows: 5% B from 0–5 min, 5–50% B from 5–20 min, 50–100% B from 20–30 min, and 100% B from 30–35 min. The temperature of the column was set to 35°C. The X500R Q-TOF mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) was used to acquire untargeted mass spectral data. The LC effluent was injected into the mass spectrometer. ESI parameters were as follows: temperature: 500°C; ion source gas 1 and 2: 50 psi; curtain gas: 35 psi; CAD gas: 7 psi. Collision-induced dissociation at 35 ± 15 V in IDA mode was utilized to capture the MS and MS/MS spectra. Maximum candidate ions: 10; threshold for intensity: 600 cps; full scan mass range: 500–1,000 Da; ion discharge voltage: 5,500 V; collision energy: 35 V; collision energy spread: 15 V.
