Materials and methods Bacterial strains, plasmids and promoters All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. The original edeine producer B. brevis X23 was isolated from tobacco rhizosphere soil by our laboratory (Chen et al., 2012). The primer sequences and characteristics of the six promoters used to replace the original ede BGC promoter are shown in Tables S2 and S3. All primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) (Table S5). All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beijing, China). Taq polymerase and DNA marker were purchased from TaKaRa Bio Inc. (Dalian, China). The E. coli and B. brevis strains were cultured at 37°C or 30°C, respectively, in solid or liquid Luria‐Bertani (LB) media (Green and Sambrook, 2012) consisting of 1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 1% NaCl. The pH of the LB media was adjusted to 7.0. For solid media, 1.5% (w/v) agar was supplemented. For E. coli, apramycin (20 µg ml−1) and ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) were added to the media as required. Promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains were selected on LB media containing apramycin (10 µg ml−1) and erythromycin (1.5 µg ml−1). Brevibacillus brevis strain fermentation cultures consisted of Nutrient‐Broth (NB) media (Green and Sambrook, 2012) containing 1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.3% beef extract, 0.5% NaCl and 1% glucose. The pH of the NB media was adjusted to 7.0. Construction of ede disruption and promoter‐substituted mutants of B. brevis X23 Genomic DNA was isolated from B. brevis X23 and B. subtilis 1A751 using an EZ‐10 Spin Column Bacterial Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). The primers used in this study are shown in Table S5. The upstream and downstream homologous regions were amplified from B. brevis X23 using PCR with primers edePC‐F1/edePC‐F2 and Pmwp‐ede‐R1/edePC‐R2 respectively. The apramycin resistance gene (ApraR) was amplified from the pSET152 vector using PCR with primers Apra1(edePC) and Apra2(edePmwp). The Pmwp promoter was amplified from B. brevis X23 using PCR with primers Pmwp‐ede‐1/Pmwp‐ede‐2. The P43 promoter was amplified from B. subtilis 1A751 using PCR. Other promoters, including Pgrac (Phan et al., 2006), Pspc (Yansura and Henner, 1984), PxylA (Kim et al., 1996) and P43 (Ye et al., 1999), were amplified from the different plasmids. The Pshuttle‐09 was synthesized and cloned into plasmid pUC18 by Hunan Tsingke Biocompany, Ltd. (Changsha, China) according to a previous study (Yang et al., 2013). Thereafter, the fused fragments of the corresponding promoter and ApraR were amplified using overlapping extension PCR with primers Apra1(edePC)/Pmwp‐ede‐2 (Yan et al., 2008). The pE194 vector backbone was amplified from the temperature‐sensitive plasmid pBR322‐ErmB‐ori194 using primers pE194‐F/pE194‐R. Every four fragments (i.e. the promoter‐ApraR, pE194 vector backbone and Pede upstream and downstream homologous arms) with 45‐bp overlapping sequences in both terminal regions were co‐transformed into GB05dir, an E. coli strain LLHR‐proficient recombinase (RecET, Redγ and RecA), to construct a promoter‐substitution plasmid according to previous studies (Yu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2000; Muyrers et al., 2001; Sharan et al., 2009) (Figs S2 and S3). Promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains were selected on LB solid media using 20 μg ml−1 apramycin. Selected recombinant vectors were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing, namely pE194‐edePC‐PxylA‐Apra, pE194‐edePC‐Apra‐Pmwp, pE194‐edePC‐Apra‐Pshuttle‐09, pE194‐edePC‐Apra‐Pgrac, pE194‐edePC‐Apra‐Pspc and pE194‐edePC‐Apra‐P43. The six promoter substitution vectors were transferred into B. brevis X23 by electroporation according to the previous methods (Takahashi et al., 1983; Okamoto et al., 1997). After double‐crossover homologous recombination, the original promoter of ede BGC was substituted with each one of the six promoters as illustrated in Fig. 3. Recombinants were selected on LB agar containing 10 µg ml−1 apramycin and confirmed by PCR amplification with the specific primers on the 5’(P1/P2) and 3’(P3/P4) ends of the replacement site. The PCR amplicons were sequenced to verify the inserted promoter sequence. The promoter‐engineered strains were designated as X23(Pede::Pmwp), X23(Pede::PxylA), X23(Pede::Pshuttle‐09), X23(Pede::Pgrac), X23(Pede::Pspc) and X23(Pede::P43) respectively. Assessment of bacterial growth The growth curves of the X23‐WT and six promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains were evaluated according to a previous study (Jung et al., 2012). Briefly, a single colony of each strain was cultured in 1.0 ml of liquid LB media at 30°C overnight and then transferred into 50 ml of fresh liquid fermentation media (NB) to reach an initial optical density (OD600) of 0.1 and measured using a spectrophotometer T6 (Puxi, China) every 12 h for 48 h. The fermentation experiments were repeated three times, and each measurement was performed three times in parallel. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity Bacillus subtilis 168 was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of B. brevis X23 and the six promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains through Kirby‐Bauer disk diffusion according to a previous study (Gui et al., 2019). The B. brevis culture in liquid NB was collected every 12–48 h. After centrifugation at 9000 g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was passed through a filter (0.22 μm) to obtain a sterile filtrate. B. subtilis 168 was spread on LB agar plates after dilution to an OD600 of 0.1. A sterile paper disk with a diameter of 6.0 mm was placed on each plate. Each filtrate (10 μl) was added to the center of the paper disk. Sterile LB liquid media served as a negative control (Gui et al., 2019). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 30°C, and the inhibition zone was measured. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated based on comparing the radius of inhibition zone. The tests were repeated three times, with three parallel tests each time. Evaluation of edeine production through HPLC–MS To determine the concentration of edeine produced by the X23‐WT and promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains, edeines were extracted from bacterial culture and analyzed by HPLC–MS. Edeines were extracted according to the previous study, with some modifications (Westman et al., 2013). A 100‐ml culture of the X23‐WT or promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains was grown in a 500‐mL flask at 30°C with rotation (180 r.p.m.) for 48 h. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 9000 g for 10 min at 4°C (5910R, Eppendorf), combined with 5 ml of WorkBeads 100S (Bioworks) and stirred for 2 h. The resin was then filtered from the supernatant and packed into a 300/15 column. The column was washed with 200 ml of distilled water, and then edeines were eluted with 15 ml of ammonium hydroxide (0.1 M). The eluents were pooled, lyophilized and redissolved into 1 ml of distilled water to obtain the crude edeines extracts for further HPLC analysis. The HPLC system (Agilent 1260) was performed using an ODS column (Agilent XBD‐C18, 2.1 × 100 mm, 5 μm) with gradient elution. The UV spectra were detected on a diode array detector with wavelengths ranging from 200 to 600 nm. HPLC parameters were as follows: solvent A, H2O with 0.1% TFA; solvent B, methanol; gradient at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min−1; 0–18 min, 10% B, 18–20 min, 10–95% B, 20–22 min, 95% B, 22–25 min, 10% B; detection by UV spectroscopy at 278 nm. HPLC–MS analyses were performed using quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (UPLC–QTOF; Agilent 6545) equipped with qualitative analysis software. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode ranging from 200 to 1500 m/z in positive ionization mode with auto MS2+ fragmentation. Edeines A and B were purified according to a previous study (Westman et al., 2013). The purity was determined by HPLC and HPLC–MS–MS. The structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy with a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer at 600 MHz (1H) and 150 MHz (13C). The standard curves of edeines A and B were established by testing 0.5, 1, 50, 100 and 500 μg ml−1 edeine A (EIC 755.4 ± 0.5) and B (EIC 797.4 ± 0.5). The yields of edeines A and B were determined from the peak area (extracted ion chromatogram) by reference to the standard curve. Extraction of total RNA and quantitative real‐time PCR The mRNA level of the first gene (edeP) on the ede operon in X23‐WT and the six promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains was determined by RT‐PCR. Bacterial cells cultivated for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h were collected and rinsed twice with physiological saline. Total RNA was isolated from bacterial culture using the EasyPure® RNA Kit (TransGen Biotech Co., LTD, China) according to the manufacture’s protocol and reverse‐transcribed into cDNA using the EasyScript® One‐Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis kit (TransGen Biotech Co., LTD, China). We conducted qRT‐PCR using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (2× Universal SYBR Green Fast For qPCR Mix, Abclonal, China) and the ABI‐QS5 Real Time PCR detection system. Gene‐specific primers were designed using Primer Premier 6.0 (primer sequences are listed in Table S5). The fluorescence change in SYBR Green I was monitored by the system software every cycle, and the ROX value was simultaneously used for correction. The threshold cycle (CT), melting curves and relative gene expression levels (−ΔCT) were automatically measured. The 16S rRNA gene was used as the internal reference gene. Real‐time PCR assay was repeated three times, and each sample was assessed in triplicate.
