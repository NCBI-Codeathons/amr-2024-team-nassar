Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions S. lividan TK24 was utilized as a host for heterologous expression and cultured in 50 ml of R2YE medium, which is composed of 0.02% potassium sulfate, 10.3% sucrose, 1% magnesium chloride, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.01%disfco casamino acid, and 1% glucose. To extract genomic DNA, Nocardia sp. CS682 was cultured for 5 days at 37°C and 200 rpm in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium [23]. The bacterial strains E. coli XL1 and E. coli ET12567 were cultured at 37°C on either solid or liquid Luria Bertani (LB) medium. The cloning vector utilized in this study was pGEM-T Easy (Promega, USA). Recombinant DNA was constructed with the plasmid vector pIBR25 (Fig. S1A), which was placed under the regulation of an ermE promoter to facilitate the expression of DNA in Streptomyces [24]. In order to transform the recombinant DNA into the protoplasts of S. lividan TK24, the standard protocol utilized in our previous study was followed [25]. Standard commercial sources were utilized to purchase chemicals and reagents for biochemical and molecular biology analyses. Construction of Recombinants and Transformation into Streptomyces lividans TK24 The TIANamp bacterial DNA kit was used to isolate and purify genomic DNA from Nocardia sp. CS682 [21]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the thnA (1,125-bp) from Nocardia sp. CS682 genomic DNA using the following primer pair: 5¢-GGATCCATGGCAATCTTGTGTCGAC-3¢ (forward, BamHI) and 5¢-GAATTCTCATAGGACTACCTCCCCT-3¢ (reverse EcoRI) with high fidelity pfu DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan). PCR analysis was performed on a thermal cycler from Takara, Japan, using the following conditions: a 7 min initial denaturation at 95°C, 30 cycles of denaturation at 92°C for 1 min, annealing at 58°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. The final step involved a 7 min extension at 72°C. To prepare the PCR products for further analysis, they were purified from a 0.7% agarose gel, and then ligated into the pGEM®-T Easy vector from Promega, Wisconsin, USA. The BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing thnA was ligated into pIBR25 to construct pIBR25-thnA (Fig. S1). pIBR25-thnA was transferred into E. coli XL1-Blue and the plasmids were isolated and transformed into the final E. coli ET-12567 construct to obtain demethylated plasmid for transformation in S. lividan TK24 by protoplast transformation. Protoplast Preparation, Transformation in S. lividanp TK24 S. lividan TK24 protoplast preparation was performed as described previously [25]. Briefly, 150 μl of protoplasts were treated for 12 min with 15 μl of 0.1 mM aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and mixed with 20 μl of plasmid DNA for 2 min. After that, a 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG) solution from Merck-Schuchardt, Germany, was added to the mixture (200 μl) and gently mixed. The solution was then briefly centrifuged to remove PEG and the resulting sample was resuspended in protoplast buffer [26]. The transformed protoplasts were spread onto R2YE regeneration plates at 28°C for 16 h. Then, an overlay of 0.3% agar solution containing 15 μg/ml thiostrepton was added, and the plates were screened on R2YE plates with the same concentration of thiostrepton (15 μg/ml). A parallel transformation and screening were also performed using pIBR25 to generate S. lividan pIBR25. Extraction, Isolation, and In Vivo Analysis S. lividan TK24 and other mutants (S. lividan pIBR25-thaA, S. lividan pIBR25) were cultivated in 50 ml of R2YE media supplemented with 15 μg/ml of thiostrepton at a temperature of 28°C for a duration of 5 days and extracted with a double volume of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was then concentrated using a rotary evaporator and the resulting concentrated sample was dissolved in a suitable amount of methanol, filtered, and subsequently examined through reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Mightysil RP-18 GP 250-4.6, Japan), and mass analysis was performed by liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) in the positive ion mode using an Acquity column (UPLC; Waters Corp., USA) coupled with a SYNAPT G2-S column (Waters Corp.). The sample was eluted using a solvent mobile phase gradient of 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and 100% acetonitrile (ACN) over a period of 0 to 12 min at a temperature of 35°C. The volume of the injected sample was 10 microliters. RNA Sample Preparation and Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis To extract total RNA, each 5 ml aliquot of culture that was grown for approximately 72 h was suspended in RNA protect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Germany) for a duration of 5 min. RNA isolation was carried out using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. DNase (Qiagen) was used to treat contaminating DNA in the RNA samples, and the lack of contamination was verified by PCR analysis using the RNA as a template. To assess the purity and concentration of the total RNA, a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1601 PC) was utilized to measure the optical density at 260/280 nm. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with a QuantiTech SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The primers used for thnA (158 bp) were 5'-CCGAGCGCTAGGAAACG-3' (forward) and 5'-ATCCGAGCTGCGCGATA-3' (reverse), and for the control housekeeping gene [rpoB (181 bp)] they were 5'-AGTTCGGCGAGTACGAGTC-3' (forward) and 5'-ACCTTGGCGAGGTCGTAG-3' (reverse). For the RT-PCR analysis, identical amounts of RNA from each sample were utilized. The reaction conditions involved initial cDNA synthesis at 50°C for a duration of 30 min, followed by initial denaturation at 98°C for 10 min and 45 cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 98°C for 30 sec, annealing at 55−68°C for 30 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min. The amplified DNA samples were further subjected to 1–2% agarose gel electrophoresis to verify the amplification product. To verify that the amplified products were not originating from chromosomal DNA that might have contaminated the RNA preparations, negative controls were conducted using Taq DNA polymerase without reverse transcriptase. To determine whether thnA was expressed in S. lividan TK24, we cultured the wild-type, i.e., S. lividan TK24, and thnA overexpressed in S. lividan pIBR25-thnA in HT medium. Samples were taken on the third day, and mRNA was isolated using a standard protocol. RpoB is a housekeeping gene in S. lividan TK24 and was used as a control.
