Methods Workflow Figure 4 shows the workflow of this study. The structures and bioactivities of the isoquinoline alkaloids of M. cordata were collected by literature review [17]. The alkaloids were then applied to target fishing with two pharmacophore and target databases, PharmaDB and HypoDB. The hit pharmacophore models were picked out according to the threshold of a predetermined fit value. The results from PharmaDB screening were compared with those from HypoDB screening. After analysis of the hit targets and their associated pathways and diseases, as well as the interactions between the alkaloids and the targets, an action network of M. cordata was constructed. Literature retrieval was simultaneously carried out to verify the findings.Fig. 4The workflow of this study Fig. 4The workflow of this study The workflow of this study Compound collection The active components of M. cordata were collected from our own database [17] and the literature. All 26 isoquinoline alkaloids of M. cordata and their bioactivities are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the alkaloids were divided into three classes: benzo[c]phenanthridines (Ben, C1–C18), protoberberines (Ber, C19–C23), and protopines (Pro, C24–C26). Based on the replacement of the C-ring, C1–C9 belong to the dihydro-benzo[c]phenanthridines, C10 is a N-demethyl 
subtype, and C11–C16 are quaternary ammonium bases that share an iminium moiety (C=N+). The remaining two bisbenzo[c]phenanthridines (BisBen, C17–C18) are epimers to one another.Table 1Basic information of the isoquinoline alkaloids in M. cordata

Anti-malarial Anti-parasitic Anti-fertility Anti-spasmodic Conformation analysis The structures of all 26 alkaloid candidates were prepared in MOL format, and converted from 2D drawings to 3D models. Their energies were minimized by the software Discovery Studio (DS, v3.5) developed by BIVIA (USA) with the CHARMM force field. A Monte Carlo-based conformational analysis (FAST mode) was performed to generate conformers from the initial conformations. The maximal 255 conformers were allowed with an energy interval of 20 kcal/mol. These alkaloid molecules were rigid, and the number of conformers for each compound was much fewer than 255. Hence, a total of 135 conformers were generated for the 26 isoquinoline alkaloids. Ligand profiling A pharmacophore model represented a series of common features of a set of ligands with a special pharmacological target. The features of a pharmacophore model reflected the target–ligand interaction mode. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening was an alternative to docking. By fitting a compound against a panel of pharmacophore models derived from multiple pharmacological targets, the potential targets of the compound can be outlined. Automated ligand profiling was available in DS 3.5 as the so-called “Ligand Profiler” protocol. The software offered automated pharmacophore-based activity profiling and reporting [22]. In this study, the default parameters of DS 3.5 were used. For each candidate ligand, three or more features were mapped. Pharmacophore databases DS 3.5 was equipped with two available pharmacophore databases, i.e., HypoDB [23] and PharmaDB [24]. HypoDB contained about 2500 pharmacophore models derived from protein–ligand 3D complex structures as well as structural data on small bioactive organic molecules. PharmaDB was created from the sc-PDB, a well-accepted data source in structure-based profiling protocols. The sc-PDB was a collection of 3D structures of binding sites found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The binding sites were extracted from crystal structures in which a complex between a protein cavity and a small molecule ligand could be identified. PharmaDB consisted of about 68,000 pharmacophores derived from 8000 protein–ligand complexes from the sc-PDB dataset. PharmaDB is a new and updated pharmacophore database developed in collaboration with Prof. Didier Rognan [25, 26]. The target and pharmacophore models from PharmaDB and HypoDB were not entirely consistent. PharmaDB had a larger quantity of targets, while the models in the HypoDB were fewer and described as being experimentally validated. Therefore, in this study, PharmaDB was employed in the target fishing, and HypoDB was used to validate the results. Regarding PharmaDB, multiple pharmacophores with shape or excluded volume constraints were generated for each protein target. For the pharmacophores with shape constraints, the suffix “-s” was added to the name. In addition, a numerical suffix referred to the ranking of selectivity evaluated by a default algorithm in DS v3.5. In this study, only the best models with “−1” in their names were employed in the ligand profiling [23]. For each pharmacophore database, a classification tree was available, from which the individual models could be selected. Parameters In the profiling with PharmaDB, all the pharmacophore models with the shape of the binding pocket were selected for the virtual screening with default settings. The RIGID mode was used as the molecular mapping algorithm. No molecular features were allowed to be missed while mapping these ligands to the pharmacophore models to increase selectivity. The minimal inter-feature distance was set at 0.5 Å. Parallel screening technology for one or more compounds against a multitude of pharmacophore models was available as a Pipeline Pilot protocol. The number of parallel processing procedures was set at 4. The whole calculation was carried on a T5500 workstation (DELL inc., USA). Binding mode refinement All the poses of the ligands mapped into the pharmacophore were preserved. A series of target-ligand pairs were selected as emphasis for further examinations. The selection was based upon compatibility with the reported pharmacological activities, as well as traditional usage of M.
cordata. A further refinement was carried out in Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) developed by CCG (Canada) to identify the protein–ligand binding modes. Energy minimization was carried out by conjugated gradient minimization with the MMFF94x force field, until an RMSD of 0.1 kcal mol−1 Ǻ−1 was reached. Network construction An interaction table between alkaloids and targets was presented as the ligand profiling results. For each target, the name and pathway information were collected from the PDB and KEGG. The diseases related to the targets were collected from the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD; http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/) [27] and DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca/) [28] databases. Compound-Target-Pathway networks were generated by Cytoscape 3.0 (Cytoscape Consortium, USA) [29]. In the networks, nodes represented the compounds, targets, and biological pathways. The edges linking the compound-target and target-pathway represented their relationships and were marked with different types of lines. After the network was built, the basic parameters of the network were computed and analyzed.
