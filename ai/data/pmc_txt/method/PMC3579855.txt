Materials and Methods Culture of Insect Cells and CPT and HCPT Preparation IOZCAS-Spex-II cells, a cell line derived from S. exigua mid-gut fat bodies, were provided by the Institute of Zoology of Chinese Academy of Science (Beijing, China), and maintained at 27°C in Grace’s insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Heat-inactivated, Invitrogen, CA, USA) in T25 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Corning, USA). The cultures were sub-cultured every 6 days. CPT (99.17%) and HCPT (99.44%) were purchased from Sichuan Nanbu Chenxin Technology Co., Sichuan, China, and dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Isolation of S. exigua Topo1 Gene Total RNA was isolated from IOZCAS-Spex-II cells with RNeasy® Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). cDNA was synthesized with 1 µL total RNA using the Omniscript® RT Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The degenerate and specific primers listed in Table 2 were designed to target the conserved regions obtained from the multiple alignment analysis of Topo1s from different species with DNAMAN (Lynnon Biosof, USA).

The PCR amplification was conducted in a 25 µL reaction volume containing 200 µM dNTPs, 1×PCR buffer and 1U Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China), with an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 5 min and followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. A final step for 10 min at 72°C was used to fully extend the amplicons. The target PCR product was purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and ligated into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, USA) for sequencing at Sangon Bio-engineering (Shanghai, China). The 5′and 3′ ends were amplified with gene-specific primers listed in Table 1 and the adaptor primers were provided by the kits of 5′-Full RACE Core Set Ver.2.0 and 3′-Full RACE Core Set Ver.2.0 (Takara, Dalian, China). The full-length cDNA was assembled by overlapping all the amplified fragments, and deposited in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with GenBank ID: JN258956. Phylogenetic Analysis of Topo1s The protein sequences of Topo1s retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and KAIKObase were aligned with ClustalX 1.83 by using standard parameters and then rendered with ESPript 2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi). A phylogenic tree was constructed with MEGA version 5.0 program using the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 replicates [41], [42]. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification The Topo1 encoding the residues 337–939 (Topo70) was amplified by PCR with the specific primers and cloned into the vector pGEX-4T-1 at the restriction sites of BamH I and Sal I (Table 2) to generate plasmid pGST-Topo70. E.coil BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pGST-Topo70 or pGEX-4T-1 and grown at 37°C. Exponentially growing bacteria in LB medium including 100 µg/mL ampicillin (OD600 = 0.6) were treated with 0.6 mM isoproyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce target protein expression for 4 hours at 30°C. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, washed with the PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4) twice, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH7.5, 250 mM KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA and 1 mM PMSF) with a final concentration of 250 µg/mL lysozyme on ice for 15 min. The samples were then spun at 15,000×g for 30 min to remove cell debris and insoluble materials. The Topo1 proteins in the collected supernatants were purified with the GSTrap 4B columns (GE Healthcare, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The recombinant Topo1 was eluted to seven fractions with an equal volume of 500 µL. The concentrations of the protein were determined by Bradford methods [43] and the purified Topo1 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant Topo1 was kept in 50% glycerol with aliquots at −80°C. The Activity Unit and Specific Activity of Topo1 Expressed in E.coil The DNA topoisomerase-1 relaxation assay was performed according to the procedures as previously reported with some modifications [44]. One unit (U) of Topo1 activity was defined as the amount of enzyme activity that will relax 0.5 µg pBR322 DNA fully at 26°C in 30 min. The specific activity was expressed in units of enzyme per milligram protein (U mg−1 pro). In the absence of Mg2+ for avoidance from interference of prokaryotic Topo1, protein samples were diluted by two-folds and each dilution was incubated with the reaction buffer (150 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/mL BSA) and 25 ng/µL (final concentration) plasmid DNA in 20 µL volumes under 26°C for 30 min to ensure the maximum relaxation of the DNA. The reaction was terminated by adding proteinase K (250 µg/mL) and 0.5% SDS (final concentration), and then incubated at 50°C for additional 30 min to remove extra proteins from DNA. Subsequently, three different forms of DNA (the supercoiled, relaxed and nicked form) were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. Inhibition of CPT and HCPT on the Activity of Recombinant and Natural Topo1s Both recombinant and natural Topo1s were used for the toxicity analysis. The natural Topo1 was extracted from IOZCAS-Spex-II cells according to the modified method [45]. After removal of the insect medium, insect cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400×g for 5 min and washed with PBS three times. The cell pellet was resuspended in 180 µL lysis buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 15 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF) by vigorously shaking for 5 min on ice. The nuclei was collected by sedimentation of 600×g for 10 min and then stirred in 120 µL resuspension buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgCl2) containing 15 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF. The pelleted nuclei were spun at 600×g for 10 min. The collected nuclei were then pelleted in 50 µL resuspension buffer containing 25 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 10 mM EDTA. 50 µL of 2×nuclear extraction buffer (2M NaCl, 80 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 2mM EDTA) was added to lyse the nuclei for 15 min. Crude extracts were collected by discarding the precipitated nucleic acids in PEG buffer (1M NaCl, 18% PEG, 10% glycerol) by centrifugating at 10,000×g for 30 min. The enzymatic activity of Topo1s was determined according to methods mentioned above. Both 1U of recombinant and natural Topo1s were incubated with various concentrations (from 0.01 to 100 µM) of CPT and HCPT in a total of 20 µL reaction buffer under the same reaction condition. DNA bands were visualized with a digital UV transilluminator and quantified with Quantity one (Gel Doc XR, Bio-Rad, USA). The inhibitory rate (%) of the enzymatic activity by CPT and HCPT was calculated as the percentage of supercoiled over total pBR322 DNA. The EC50 value was calculated by using Probit analysis with DPS (v 9.5, Zhejiang University, China) [46]. Effects of CPT and HCPT Pre-treatment on the Specific Activity of Topo1 in S. exigua Two series of experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of CPT and HCPT treatment on the catalytic activity of S. exigua Topo1. The first series examined changes of Topo1 activity caused by 10 µM CPT and HCPT pre-treatment for different times (0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h). The second series of experiments examined the effects on the Topo1 specific activity with different concentrations (0.10, 0.50, 1.00, 5.00, 10.0, 50.0, 100 µM) of CPT and HCPT treatment for 24 h. In all experiments, IOZCAS-Spex-II cells were pretreated with CPT and HCPT according to the procedure described in our previous studies [16]. The Topo1 was extracted from IOZCAS-Spex-II cells, and the specific activity of the nuclear extract in each sample was determined using the method described above. Real-time PCR Analysis The Topo1 mRNA level in CPT and HCPT treated cells was measured by Real-time PCR. The reactions were carried out in strip tubes with caps (0.2 mL, AXYGEN, USA) in a total volume of 20 µL, including 10 µL SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara, Dalian, China), 0.4 µL forward primer and reverse primer (10 µM), 0.4 µL ROX reference dye II, 2.0 µL reverse transcribed cDNA and 6.8 µL H2O. The procedure was carried out with two steps as follows: 30 sec at 95°C; 40 cycles of 5 sec at 95°C and 30 sec at 60°C. Gene expression was normalized to beta-actin with 2-△△Ct method [47]. Data was analyzed with 7500 software V 2.0.3 (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Western Blot Analysis IOZCAS-Spex-II cells were pretreated with 10 µM CPT and HCPT for 24 h prior to fractionation with the method as described by Fu et al. [48]. Total protein concentration was determined by Bradford methods [43]. The equal amount of samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat milk (25.0 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at the room temperature. The blots were then probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to topoisomerase I produced with the recombinant Topo1 (Topo70) by Immunosoft Ltd. (1∶5000, Zhoushan, China) followed by mouse anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody (1∶10000, R&D Systems, Inc., MN, USA). For loading control, beta-actin was probed with mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Abcam Ltd., Hongkong) and secondary primary, anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (R&D Systems, Inc., MN, USA). The signals were detected with a DAB detection kit (Boster, Wuhan, China). Statistical Analysis All experiments were repeated at least three times and results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA followed by Student’s t-test with a statistically significant value of p<0.05.
