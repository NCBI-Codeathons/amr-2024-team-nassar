2. Methodology 2.1. Materials and Methods 2.1.1. Reagents Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) powder was purchased from Invitrogen (Waltham, MA, USA). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) (1M), sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3), barium chloride dehydrate (BaCl2, 2H2O), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), and mucin were bought from Sigma Aldrich. Additionally, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled insulin stock (Human, recombinant, expressed in yeast, lyophilized powder) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). HEPES (2-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethanesulfonic acid) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) were from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Insulin aspart (NovoRapid®, Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) was purchased from a local pharmacy. Pepsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). 2.1.2. Reagent Preparation 1M of BaCl2, Na2SO4, Na2SO3, and Na2CO3 stock solutions were prepared by calculating the amount of the respective molecular weight of powder and dissolving them in water. All solutions were stored in 1 mL aliquots at −20 °C. 100 mL of bicarbonated DMEM solution was freshly prepared by dissolving 1.35 g of DMEM powder in 95 mL pure Milli-Q water, followed by the addition of 0.37 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate (0.44 mM final concentration). The pH of the solution was then adjusted to the desired level by the addition of either 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH. The final volume was then adjusted to 100 mL. Two mg/mL of FITC-insulin stock solution was prepared by dissolving the FITC-insulin powder into an appropriate volume of pure Milli-Q® water. 2.2. Synthesis of Empty and Insulin-Loaded Ba Salt Particles 2.2.1. Synthesis of Particles by Precipitation Reaction Each type of Ba salt particle (BaSO4, BaSO3, or BaCO3) was prepared by incorporating a volume of cation-providing BaCl2 salt into either a volume of HEPES-buffered solution (pH adjusted to 8.0) or milliQH2O and mixing the resultant solution with a volume of one anion-providing salt, Na2SO4, Na2SO3 or Na2CO3, respectively. The final mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently added to miliQH2O to obtain the final volume of particle suspension. Table 1 shows the various concentrations of reacting salts used to fabricate three different Ba salt particles. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of precipitation reaction. 2.2.2. Insulin Loading into Ba Salt Particles Each type of Ba salt particle was prepared by incorporating a volume of cation- providing BaCl2 salt into either a volume of HEPES-buffered solution (pH adjusted to 8.0) or miliQH2O and mixing the solution with a volume of one anion-providing salt, Na2SO4, Na2SO3, and Na2CO3. Insulin was introduced right before addition of the 2nd salt to the medium. The final mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently added to milliQH2O to obtain the final volume of particle suspension. Table 2 below shows the various concentrations of reacting salts and insulin used for the preparation of insulin-loaded Ba salt particles. Figure 2 shows a simplified diagrammatic depiction of insulin loading into particles. 2.3. Characterization and Morphological Screening of Ba Salt Particles 2.3.1. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) A volume of 250 µL of 1M of BaCl2 was taken in a centrifuge tube, followed by the addition of 100 µL of 1M Na2SO4 or Na2SO3 or Na2CO3 to the respective tubes to prepare BaSO4, BaSO3, or Ba2CO3 particles. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The final volume of the particle solution was made to 50 mL with the addition of milliQH2O. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at RPM 5000. Precipitates were separated from supernatant, stored sequentially at −20 °C overnight, and at −80 °C for 0.5 h and finally placed into a freeze-dryer (Labconco freeze dryer, Kansas City, MO, USA) for 5 h. Samples were read using a Varian FT-IR (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and analyzed with Resolution Pro 640 software. 2.3.2. Elemental Analysis of Particles by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) 5 µL of cation- providing salt was added to 20 µL milliQH2O, followed by the addition of 2 µL of anion-providing salt. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, 1 mL of Milli-Q H2O was added. 2 µL of the solution containing the particles was transferred on a coverslip. The coverslip was then air-dried in elevated temperature (45 °C) inside a dryer for 1 h. The dried sample was marked with a circular line with a marker for easy identification under a microscope. Samples were then subjected to platinum sputtering for 45 s with 30 mA and a factor of 2.3. Visualizations and documentation were done using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) (Hitachi/SU8010, Tokyo, Japan) at 5.0 kv. 2.4. Particle Stability Assessment Ba salt particles were prepared as stated in the particle preparation Section 2.2.1. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, 1 mL of DMEM of different pHs (pH 7.78 to pH 1.78) was added and kept at 37 °C. Samples were prepared in triplicates and measured at 320 nm at different time points over a period of 3 h. 2.5. Insulin Loading Efficiency of Ba Salt Particles 2.5.1. Insulin Loading Efficiency of Ba Salt Particles and Subsequent Release of Insulin from Particles at a Wide Range of pHs FITC-insulin-loaded Ba salt particles were prepared as stated in Section 2.2.2. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, 200 µL of DMEM prepared at different pHs (pH 7.78 to pH 1.78) was added. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the resultant pellet was washed with 50 µL of HEPES, 2X. At the end of washing the supernatant was again discarded and the pellet carrying insulin-bound particles was re-suspended with 200 µL of 10 mM EDTA. 200 μL of supernatant was carefully transferred into a black 96-well plate (PerkinElmer Opti-Plate™-96 F, Waltham, MA, USA) and fluorescence intensity values were recorded using a fluorescence microplate reader (PerkinElmer Victor X5 2030 Multi-label Reader, (Waltham, MA, USA) set with excitation/emission filters at 485 nm/535 nm wavelengths. A standard curve was prepared from absorbance values for known amounts of free FITC-Insulin (0, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 4000 ηg) added to DMEM. % loading at pH 7.78 was calculated from the formula given below.
(1)% loading=FITC−Insulin conc.in pelletconc. of added FITC−Insulin×100
% release at subsequent pHs (7.18–1.78) was calculated by subtracting the amount of FITC-Insulin found in the pellet from the amount of FITC-Insulin added initially and finally, multiplying by 100.

Morphological Assessment of Empty and Insulin-Loaded Particles by FE-SEM The Ba salts particles were similarly prepared as described in the earlier Section 2.3.2 for FE-SEM and EDX analysis (Section 2.3.2). Insulin-loaded particles were prepared separately (as stated in Section 2.2.2). Visualization and documentation were done using FE-SEM (Hitachi/SU8010, Tokyo, Japan) at 2.0 kv. 2.6. Assessment of Adhesion of Ba Salt Particles to Mucin 2.6.1. Spectrophotometric Analysis of Particle Adhesion to Mucin Ba salt particles were prepared as stated in the particle preparation Section 2.2.1. 200 µL of milliQH2O was added followed by the addition of 100 µL of mucin (3 g/L). The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation at RPM13, 200 for 5 min. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube. 250 µL of Bradford agent was directly added to the tube. The mixture was then incubated for 5 min before transferring it to the 96 well microplates. Absorbance was read at 595 nm using victor X5 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). A standard curve was created using a series of different concentrations of mucin solution of 25 to 600 µg, mixed with 250 µL of Bradford agent. An unknown amount of mucin present in supernatant was calculated from the standard curve. % adhesion of particle to mucin was then calculated from added mucin with the two-step formula below:(3)Mucin bound to Particles=mucin present in the pallet      =added mucin−mucin from supernatant

Assessment of Particle Adhesion to Mucin Using FT-IR Samples were prepared in bigger volumes for this experiment. 250 µL of 1M of BaCl2 in a 50 mL tube was mixed with 100 µL of 1M Na2SO4 or Na2SO3 or Na2CO3 to prepare BaSO4, BaSO3, or Ba2CO3 particle. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Sample tubes were then topped up to 25 mL with the addition of milliQH2O, followed by the addition of a solution containing 5 mL of mucin (3g/L). Samples were then centrifuged for 15min at 5000 RPM. Precipitates were then stored at −20 °C overnight, followed by storing at −80 °C for 0.5 h and freeze-drying (Labconco freeze dryer, Kansas City, MO, USA) for 5 h. Varian FT-IR (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Varian Resolution Pro 640 software (Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used to check the spectra of particles alone, particle-mucin complexes, and mucin alone. 2.7. Administration of Insulin-Loaded Particles to Diabetic Animals and Management of Hyperglycemia 2.7.1. Induction of Diabetes in Rats with Streptozotocin (STZ) Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved Animal ethics by Monash Animal Ethics Committee (MUM/2018/13). 8–12 weeks-old male healthy Wister Kyoto rats (WKY) were subjected to intraperitoneal (IP) injection of STZ (65 mg/kg). A fraction of the rats developed hyperglycemia with a persistent high level of peripheral blood glucose (≥13 mM) within a week or two. Glucose levels in the blood (collected via tail vein) were measured using a glucometer (Terumo, Hatagaya, Shibuya-ku, Japan). The rats that didn’t develop diabetes with 1st injection were given a 2nd IP dose of 65 mg/kg STZ. 2.7.2. Effect of Orally Administrated Insulin-Loaded Particles on Hyperglycemia Rats showing a clear sign of diabetes (peripheral blood glucose level of ≥13 mM) were divided into different control and treatment groups. Each group consists of three animals. After taking a baseline blood glucose reading, each rat was given Insulin aspart-loaded Ba salt formulations via oral gavage. Rats from the control group were kept untreated (negative control), whereas rats from the positive control group received a solution containing free insulin (100 IU/kg). Treatment groups received 500 µL of the solution containing insulin-loaded particles (BaSO4, BaSO3, or BaCO3 particles) by gavage. Blood glucose was read at regular time intervals (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h). Blood glucose level at “0” h is the baseline blood glucose reading taken right before oral delivery of insulin-loaded particles. % reduction at any given point of time was calculated from baseline blood glucose level using the below formula,
(5)reduction of blood glucose level=(baseline blood glucose read − blood glucose reading at any point of time)×100baseline blood glucose level 2.7.3. Statistical Analysis The p-value was calculated by applying one-way ANOVA to confirm any significant reduction of blood glucose level compared to pre-treatment baseline blood glucose level, at any point in time after treatment.
