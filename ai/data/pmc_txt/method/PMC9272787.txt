Materials and Methods RNA-seq and Ribo-seq Library Preparation and Analyses Three biological replicates of P. aeruginosa strain O1 (PAO1; Holloway et al., 1979) were grown at 37°C in 100 ml Basal-Salt medium [BSM; 30.8 mM K2HPO4, 19.3 mM KH2PO4, 15 mM (NH4)SO4, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 μM FeSO4] supplemented with 5 mM succinate and 40 mM mannitol (Sonnleitner et al., 2009). Total RNA was prepared from each of the three biological replicates after they reached an OD600 of 0.4 [time 1 (T1)], 0.7 [time 2 (T2)], and 1.2 [time 3 (T3); Figure 1A], respectively. 10 ml samples were withdrawn from each culture, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 15 min at 4°C and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was removed using DNAse I (Roche), followed by phenol-chloroform purification and ethanol precipitation with 1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc, pH 5.5. To deplete ribosomal RNAs, the Ribo-Zero™ Magnetic Kit for Gram-negative Bacteria (Epicentre) was used. The libraries were constructed using the NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Preparation Kit from Illumina. Around 100 base pair single end sequence reads were generated using the Illumina HiSeq V4 platform at the Vienna Biocenter Campus Science Support Facility.1 Quality control assessment, sequencing adapter removal, and mapping of the samples against the PAO1 reference genome (NCBI accession number NC_002516.2) were performed as described previously with Segemehl using default parameters (Hoffmann et al., 2009). Reads mapping to regions annotated as either rRNA or tRNA were discarded. The mapped sequencing data were prepared for visualization using the ViennaNGS tool box, and visualized with the UCSC Genome Browser (Wolfinger et al., 2015). Reads per gene were counted using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) and the Refseq annotation of P. aeruginosa (NC_002516.2). Differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010). The levels of transcripts with a fold-change (FC) greater than 2 and a multiple testing adjusted value of p below 0.05 were considered to be significant (shown in bold in Supplementary Table S1).

Ribosome profiling of elongating ribosomes (Ribo-seq; Ingolia et al., 2009) was performed with the same 100 ml cultures as used for the RNA-seq analyses. 10 ml samples were withdrawn from each culture after growth to an OD600 of 0.4 [time 1 (T1)], 0.7 [time 2 (T2)], and 1.2 [time 3 (T3); Figure 1A], respectively, transferred to new flasks and treated for 10 min with chloramphenicol (300 μg/ml) to stop translation. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, the pellet was washed in 50 ml ice cold lysis buffer (10 mM MgOAc, 60 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM TRIS–HCl, and pH 7.6), again pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml ice cold lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 100 U/ml DNAse I, frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryogenically pulverized by repeated cycles of grinding in a pre-chilled mortar and freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. About 100 μl aliquots of the cleared lysates were treated with 4 μl of Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase, NEB) and 6 μl of the RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at 25°C with continuous shaking at 450 rpm. The lysates were layered onto 10%–40% linear sucrose density gradients in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 256,000 g for 3 h at 4°C. About 500 μl gradient fractions were collected by continuously monitoring the absorbance at 260 nm. The RNA was extracted from fractions containing 70S ribosomes with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and precipitated with ethanol. The samples were treated with DNase I (TURBO™ DNase, Thermo Scientific) and separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. Ribosome protected mRNA fragments ranging in size from 20 to 40 nucleotides were removed and eluted from the polyacrylamide gel by overnight incubation in elution buffer (0.3 M NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA) at 4°C, which was followed by another phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation. The quality of the RNA samples was subsequently analyzed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and an Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies). The RNA was further processed into cDNA libraries with NEBNext™ Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® and their quality was assessed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer and a High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies). Pipin Prep™ was used to purify the 140–160 bp cDNA products which corresponded to adapter-ligated 20–40 nucleotide long ribosomal footprints. RNA sequencing and data processing were performed as described above. The raw RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data were deposited in the ENA under accession number PRJEB52258. Extraction of Cellular Proteins Cellular proteins were extracted from the same 100 ml cultures of two biological replicates as used for the RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses. 10 ml samples were withdrawn from each culture after growth to an OD600 of 0.4 [time 1 (T1)], 0.7 [time 2 (T2)], and 1.2 [time 3 (T3); Figure 1A], respectively, transferred to new flasks and treated for 10 min with chloramphenicol (300 μg/ml) to stop translation. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g at 4°C for 15 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were re-suspended in 200 μl 1x Laemmli buffer per 0.5 OD600 unit. The cell suspensions were sonicated for 1 min at 40% power for 40 cycles (Bandelin Sonopuls GM70), and then boiled for 5 min at 95°C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 24,000 g for 10 min at room temperature. The samples (100 μg/lane) were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel, which was stained with colloidal coomassie stain (Roth). The gel slices were cut into pieces and placed in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. About 1 ml of 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic) in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) was added to each sample followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The supernatant was discarded and the samples were further incubated with 500 μl of 50 mM AmBic in 5% ACN for 15 min at 37°C. The solution was removed and the gels slices were incubated two times in 500 μl of 100% ACN for 10 min at 37°C to remove water. The dried proteins were digested with 100 μl of trypsin (Thermo; 25 ng/μl), re-suspended in 25 mM AmBic in 10% ACN and 5 mM CaCl2, and further incubated for 16 h at 37°C. The peptides were extracted with 150 μl of 50% ACN/1% of formic acid (FA) by sonication in a low intensity ultrasound bath for 3 min, after which the supernatants were transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. The gel was further incubated with 100 μl 90% ACN/1% FA for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to the same tubes as in the previous step and dried in a vacuum concentrator. The protein digests were desalted with C18 solid phase extraction (SPE; Agilent Technologies) and carbon graphite SPE as described by Furuhashi et al. (2014). After desalting, the corresponding eluates were pooled and dried in a vacuum concentrator. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis The samples were analysed with an Orbitrap Elite hybrid ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were re-suspended in 99% of ACN and 1% of FA to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl and separated on a 50 cm EASY-Spray C18 LC column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were eluted with a 120 ml gradient from 2 to 40% of solvent B (90% ACN, 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300 μl/min. Full scans were obtained with an Orbitrap mass analyzer. The scan range was set to 350–1800 Th, the resolution to 120,000 at 400 m/z, the AGC target to 1,000,000 ions, and the maximum injection time to 100 ms. Up to 20 most intense precursor ions (charge ≥ 2) were selected for CID fragmentation (normalized collision energy 35%, activation time 10 ms, isolation width 2.0 Th, and minimum signal threshold 1,000) in an ion trap. The MS2 AGC target was set to 5,000 ions and the maximum injection time to 50 ms. The dynamic exclusion of fragmented precursors was set to 30 s. Peptide Identification and Quantification The peptide identification and protein quantification was done with MaxQuant (version 1.5; Cox and Mann, 2008; Cox et al., 2011). The spectra were searched against the P. aeruginosa protein database.2 The following settings were used: maximum two missed cleavages were allowed, methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were set to variable modifications and mass tolerance for precursor mass was set to 4.5 ppm and for fragment masses to 0.6 Da. The maximum FDR for peptides and proteins was 1%. Match between runs function was used with 20 and 0.7 min alignment and matching time window, respectively. Protein quantification was done with a peptide count ≥2. Filtering and further data processing and statistics were done with Perseus 1.5 software and Excel. Northern Blot Analyses Total RNA was isolated from strain PAO1 at OD600 = 0.4 (T1), 0.7 (T2), and 1.2 (T3) during diauxic growth in BSM medium supplemented with succinate (5 mM) and mannitol (40 mM), from strain PAO1 (pME10011) after growth to an OD600 of 2.0 in BSM medium supplemented with succinate (40 mM) and mannitol (40 mM), respectively, as well as from strains PAO1 (pME10011; pMMB67HE) and PAO1 (pME10011; pMMBcrcZ) after growth to an OD600 of 2.0 in BSM medium supplemented with succinate (40 mM). The corresponding RNAs were purified using the TRIZol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The levels of the CrcZ RNA and 5S RNA (control) were determined by Northern-blotting using 5 μg of total RNA. The RNA samples were resuspended in 1x RNA loading dye (95% formamide, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.025% xylene cyanol FF, and 0.025% bromophenol blue), denatured for 5 min at 98°C, separated on 6% polyacrylamide/8 M Urea gel, and then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham) by electro-blotting. The RNAs were cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV light. The membranes were hybridized with gene-specific 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides [CrcZ: K3 (5’GCT GGA GTC GTT ACG TGT TG-3`); 5S rRNA: I26 (5`-CCC CAC ACT ACC ATC GGC GAT GCG TCG-3`); Sonnleitner et al., 2018]. The hybridization signals were visualized using a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics). The normalization was performed with ImageQuant TL version 8.1. Determination of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration PAO1 was grown to an OD600 of 0.3–0.4 in BSM supplemented with 40 mM succinate and mannitol, respectively. 2 ml of the cultures were transferred to 10 ml glass tubes, containing 50 μl norfloxacin in serial dilutions (concentration range 78 μg/L–10 mg/L). The cultures were shaken for 16 h at 37°C followed by measurement of the OD600. The MIC corresponds to the lowest concentration of antibiotics that impacted growth. Candida albicans Bioassay 300 μl of overnight culture of C. albicans was mixed with 10 ml YPD agar medium [2% Yeast Extract (Sigma-Aldrich), 4% peptone (Sigma-Aldrich), 4% Dextrose (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.75% Agar (Merk)], poured into Petri dishes and incubated for 36 h at 37°C. 10 μl of the PAO1 culture grown in BSM (see above) supplemented with 40 mM succinate or 40 mM mannitol (OD600 = 3.0) were spotted on top of the C. albicans lawns, and then incubated for 48 h at 37°C. Determination of the Pyocyanin Levels Strain PAO1 was grown at 37°C for 24 h in 20 ml of BSM supplemented with 40 mM succinate and mannitol, respectively. The strains PAO1 [pMMB67HE (vector control); Fürste et al., 1986] and PAO1 [pMMBcrcZ (Ptac driven constitutive expression of crcZ); Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014], respectively, were grown at 37°C for 24 h in 20 ml of BSM supplemented with 40 mM succinate. Pyocyanin was extracted from 4 ml of culture supernatant with 2 ml of chloroform, followed by an extraction with 1 ml of 0.1 M HCl. The concentration of pyocyanin was measured at A520, and is given as A520/ml of the culture supernatant. β-Galactosidase Assays The β-galactosidase activities were determined as described by Miller (1972). The cells were permeabilized with 5% toluene. The β-galactosidase units in the different experiments were derived from three independent experiments.
