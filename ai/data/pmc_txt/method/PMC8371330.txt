Materials and Methods Isolation, Preservation, and Culture Conditions Strain P38-E01T was isolated in 2004 by the Gause Institute of New Antibiotics (Moscow, Russia) from marine sediments in the Trondheim fjord of Norway, harvested at 3- to 4-m depth between high and low tide (063°26′24.94″ N 010°20′50.28″ E). This work was part of an extensive marine Actinobacteria strain isolation campaign by SINTEF and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU (Trondheim, Norway). Details about the isolation methods from marine sediments used in this campaign are referred to in earlier studies (Bredholdt et al., 2007; Paulus et al., 2017). Pure cultures were maintained on ISP 2 (International Streptomyces Project medium 2) (Shirling and Gottlieb, 1966) at room temperature for biochemical and morphological studies. For long-term preservation, a suspension of culture containing mycelia in ISP 2 supplemented with glycerol (20% v/v) was stored at −80°C. The reference strains used for comparative purposes, Streptomyces daliensis DSM 42095T, Streptomyces rimosus subsp. rimosus NRRL B-2659T, and Streptomyces sclerotialus NRRL B-2317T, were obtained from DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) and Agricultural Research Service (NRRL) Culture Collection (Peoria, IL, United States) and maintained under the same conditions as described above. Reference strains were tested in parallel with isolate P38-E01T. Morphology Culture characteristics including colors of aerial and substrate mycelium of the strain P38-E01T and reference strains following incubation at 30°C for 14 days were determined using various ISP media, namely, ISP 2 (yeast extract–malt agar), ISP 3 (oatmeal agar), ISP 4 (inorganic salts–starch agar), ISP 5 (glycerol–asparagine agar), ISP 6 (peptone–yeast extract iron agar), and ISP 7 (tyrosine agar), all prepared according to the method of Shirling and Gottlieb (1966). Production of melanin was observed on ISP 6 and ISP 7 media. Additionally, nutrient agar, Czapek–Dox agar (Atlas, 2004), and modified Bennett’s agar (Jones, 1949) were also used in order to describe macroscopic morphology. The color of colonies, reversed-phase colony color, and soluble pigments were determined using the NBS/ISCC color charts (Kelly et al., 1965). Scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used to observe microscopic morphology of strain P38-E01T, cultivated for 14 days on ISP 2 medium at 30°C (Supplementary Figure 1). Growth Conditions Strain P38-E01T was tested along with the reference strains for tolerance to different temperatures (3, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37, and 40°C) on ISP 2 medium. Tolerance to salinity was determined on ISP 2 medium with 0–6% (w/v) NaCl (at intervals of 0.5% w/v) at 30°C. Additionally, growth at different pH was tested on ISP 2 medium with pH ranging from 3 to 14 (at intervals of 0.5 pH unit) using the buffer system described by Barbour et al. (2017). The growth was observed periodically for up to 4 weeks. Biochemical and Physiological Characteristics Catalase and oxidase activity were evaluated as described by Smibert and Krieg (Kamlage, 1996). Urease activity was evaluated on Christensen’s medium (Christensen, 1946), and nitrate reduction was tested using ISP media according to the method by Gordon et al. (1974). Other relevant tests included DNA hydrolysis test (DNAse agar, BD Biosciences), test for hydrolysis of gelatin and Tween 80 (Páčová and Kocur, 1984), tests for hydrolysis of starch and esculin (Barrow and Feltham, 1993), tests for hydrolysis of casein and tyrosine (Kurup and Babcock, 1979), and tests for hydrolysis of xanthin and hypoxanthine (Nocardia hydrolysis kit, Hardy Diagnostics). Cellulolytic activity was evaluated using cellulose (ISP 2 broth with strip of Whatman paper No. 1), and growth and/or degradation activity were observed periodically for 4 weeks. Utilization of different carbon sources was evaluated according to Shirling and Gottlieb’s protocol (Shirling and Gottlieb, 1966) using ISP 9 medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) carbon source and cultivated in two parallels. Additionally, enzymatic activity was evaluated using an API ZYM kit (bioMérieux, France) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing For antibiotic resistance profiling the Kirby–Bauer disc-diffusion method on Mueller–Hinton agar was used (Bauer et al., 1966). Antibiotic discs used for these purposes were ampicillin (10 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), kanamycin (30 μg), neomycin (5 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), penicillin G (10 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), cefixime (5 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), and polymyxin B (300 U). The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards were strictly followed for cultivation and inhibition zone diameter reading (CLSI, 2015). Strain P38-E01T was susceptible to all antibiotics used, except for chloramphenicol (30 μg), penicillin G (10 μg), and cefixime (5 μg). Analysis of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters Cells for the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis were grown in trypticase soy broth (BBL). The media for FAME were prepared by dispensing 20 ml of TSB into 150-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, sterilized by autoclaving (30 min/121°C). All strains were cultivated in parallel for 10 days at 28°C on a platform shaker at 150 rpm. Cells were harvested by filtration; followed by the extraction procedure described in a standard protocol by Sasser (1990). Analysis of FAMEs was performed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph according to the standard protocol of the Sherlock MIDI Identification System (MIDI Sherlock version 6.2, MIDI database RTSBA 6.21). Analysis of Peptidoglycan, Quinones, and Polar Lipids Analyses of peptidoglycan, respiratory quinones, and polar lipids were carried out by the Identification Service, Leibniz-Institut DSMZ–Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). Cell mass was hydrolyzed and the hydrolysates analyzed according to protocols 1 and 3 of Schumann (2011) for whole-cell sugars and diaminopimelic acid. Menaquinones and polar lipids were extracted from freeze-dried cell material in a two-stage method to first extract the respiratory quinones followed by the polar lipids (Tindall, 1990a, b). Menaquinones were then analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS. Polar lipids were extracted using a choroform:methanol:0.3% aqueous NaCl mixture and recovered into the chloroform phase, modified after Bligh and Dyer (1959). Separation was done by two-dimensional silica gel thin-layer chromatography with the first direction developed in chloroform:methanol:water and the second in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water. Total lipid material was detected using molybdatophosphoric acid, and specific functional groups were detected using spray reagents specific for defined functional groups (Tindall et al., 2007). Genomic and Phylogenetic Analyses The draft genome sequence of strain P38-E01T was determined using a combination of Illumina HiSeq and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing. Extraction of genomic DNA from strain P38-E01T and both Illumina short-read and PacBio long-read sequencing were performed by BaseClear BV (Leiden, Netherlands). For Illumina short-read sequencing, a paired-end library was generated using genomic DNA of strain P38-E01T and approximately 300 bp of tagmentation using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer instructions of the manufacturer. A total of 2,157,583 2 × 125-bp paired-end sequence reads were generated using the Illumina HiSeq2500 system, yielding 516 Mb sequence data. FASTQ sequence files were generated using the Illumina Casava pipeline version 1.8.3. Initial quality assessment was based on data passing the Illumina Chastity filtering. Subsequently, reads containing PhiX control signal were removed by filtering. In addition, reads containing (partial) adapters were clipped (up to a minimum read length of 50 bp). Quality assessment was based on the remaining reads using the FASTQC quality control tool version 0.10.0. The average quality score (Phred) obtained was 38.27. The quality of the Illumina reads was improved further by trimming low-quality bases using BBDuk, which is a part of the BBMap suite version 36.77.1 High-quality reads were assembled into contigs using ABySS version 2.0 (Jackman et al., 2017), also incorporating paired-end read For the PacBio long-read sequencing; a total of 579,093 reads (mean read length 4,440 bases) were generated using the PacBio Sequel instrument, yielding 2,571 Mb of sequence data. The data collected were processed and filtered using the SMRT Link software suite, and subreads shorter than 50 bp were discarded. For scaffolding, the long reads were mapped to the Illumina draft assembly using BLASR version 1.3.1 (Chaisson and Tesler, 2012). Based on these alignments, the contigs were linked together and placed into scaffolds. The orientation, order, and distance between the contigs were estimated using SSPACE-LongRead version 1.0 (Boetzer and Pirovano, 2014). Using Illumina reads, gapped regions within scaffolds were (partially) closed using GapFiller version 1.10 (Boetzer and Pirovano, 2012). Finally, assembly errors and the nucleotide disagreements between the Illumina reads and scaffold sequences were corrected using Pilon version 1.10 (Walker et al., 2014). By that means, a draft genome sequence in 10 scaffolds was obtained, which has been deposited at NCBI GenBank under accession number JAELVF000000000, and the version described in this paper is version JAELVF020000000. The quality of the assembly calculated by Quast version 5.1 is listed in Table 3 (Gurevich et al., 2013). For whole-genome analyses, S. daliensis DSM 42095T was sequenced and its genome assembled as described above, with the sequence deposited at NCBI GenBank under accession number JAGSMN000000000. Whole-genome sequences of S. rimosus subsp. rimosus ATCC 10970T and S. sclerotialus NRRL ISP-5269T, S. harbinensis CGMCC 47047T, S. alkaliterrae OF1T, and S. durbertensis DSM 104538T were retrieved as genome assemblies from the NCBI GenBank database. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain P38-E01T (1,527 bp) was extracted from the draft genome sequence data and initially analyzed using the EzBioCloud server (Yoon et al., 2017). For phylogenetic analysis, the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the type strains of closely related Streptomyces species were retrieved from NCBI GenBank database. Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm, and phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA 10.0.5 software (Kumar et al., 2018). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining (Saitou and Nei, 1987), maximum-likelihood (Felsenstein, 1981), and maximum-parsimony (Kluge and Farris, 1969) methods, evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replications (Felsenstein, 1985). For greater taxonomic resolution, a multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) was performed by uploading the draft genome assemblies of strain P38-E01T and the closely related type strains to the Automated Multi-Locus Species Tree (autoMLST) web tool (Alanjary et al., 2019). A concatenated alignment was generated in autoMLST using default parameters with 100 core genes from 50 closely related genomes, and an IQ-TREE ultrafast bootstrap analysis (Nguyen et al., 2015) with 1,000 replications was performed. A phylogenomic tree was calculated using the Type Strain Genome Software (TYGS) implanting the Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP) strategy (Meier-Kolthoff and Göker, 2019). Calculation of orthoANI values (orthologous average nucleotide identity) and generation of an ANI heat map was performed by OAT software version 0.93.1 (Lee et al., 2016). Digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were generated in order to confirm genomic uniqueness of strain P38-E01T. All genomes were subjected to the Genome to Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) version 2.1 (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). Bioinformatic Analysis Genome annotation performed by the NCBI Prokaryotic Annotation Pipeline (Haft et al., 2018) and the eggNOG-mapper (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2019) was used for the prediction and classification of functional groups. Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZymes) were predicted using the dbCAN2 meta server (Zhang et al., 2018). PlasmidFinder v2.1 (Carattoli et al., 2014) was used for identification of plasmid, and the presence of putative prophage regions was analyzed by PHASTER (Arndt et al., 2016) and Prophage Hunter (Song et al., 2019) tools. The in silico resistome of strain P38-E01T was predicted using the Resistance Genes Identifier (RGI, v5.1.1) with The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD, v3.1.1) (Alcock et al., 2020). CRISPRDetect v2.3 (Biswas et al., 2016) was applied for the detection of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) arrays. AntiSMASH version 6.0.0 (Blin et al., 2021) was used to detect presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) predicted to produce secondary metabolites. Antimicrobial Activity For initial assessments of isolate P38-E01T ability to produce antimicrobial metabolites, supernatants from a broth culture were screened for the ability to inhibit the growth of various bacterial or fungal strains by a spot-on-lawn assay. Target organisms for antimicrobial activity assays included Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Xen29, MRSA strain EAMC30, C. albicans ATCC 90028, Escherichia coli BL21, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis 89C-4, and Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens subsp. flaccumfaciens CV3. Strain P38-E01T was grown in shake flasks with stainless steel coiled spring containing 100 ml each of six different media types of yeast extract–malt extract (YEME) broth with and without sucrose (Shepherd et al., 2010), marine fermentation (MF) broth (Costa et al., 2017), glucose yeast extract (GYE) broth (Koo et al., 1991), ISP 2 broth with and without artificial seawater, and TSB for 35 days at 25°C and shaking at 200 rpm. At 7-day intervals, a 1-ml volume was pulled from each culture, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g, and supernatants were filtered through a 0.2-μm microporous membrane. Target organisms were swabbed on the surface of a tryptic soy agar (TSA) plate, after which, 10 μl of cell-free supernatant was spotted on the surface of the agar. A 10-μl spot of each media type was used as a control. Plates were incubated for 24–48 h at the appropriate temperature for the test organism, and the antimicrobial activity was determined by the presence or absence of a zone of inhibition (ZOI) surrounding the test samples. Identification of Bioactive Compounds To identify the compounds responsible for the observed bioactivity, extracts of strain P38-E01T were fractionated and analyzed by LC-MS. Strain P38-E01T was grown in three media types all containing 0.5 × artificial sea water, i.e., 5010SW (15 g/L of sucrose, 1 g/L of NaNO3, 0.5 g/L of KH2PO4, 0.25 g/L of MgSO4 × 7H2O, 0.25 g/L of KCl, 0.005 g/L of FeSO4 × 7H2O), 5334SW (10 g/L of glucose, 5 g/L of soy meal, 0.1 g/L of CaCO3, 0.0005 g/L of CoCl2 × 2H2O), and 5254SW (7.5 g/L of glucose, 7.5 g/L of soy meal, 2.5 g/L of corn steep, 1.0 g/L of CaCO3, 2.5 g/L of NaCl), in 2-ml deep-well plates (Greiner Bio One) with 600 μl of culture/well. To limit pellet formation, 3-mm-diameter glass beads were added to each well with one glass bead per well. The cultures were incubated at 28°C and 800 rpm. The 5010SW cultures were incubated for 13 days, and the 5334SW and 5254SW cultures were incubated for 7 days. The cultures were dried by lyophilization and then extracted with 1× culture volume DMSO for 1 h. Cell-free extracts were tested for activity against Enterococcus faecium CCUG 37832, Kocuria rhizophila ATCC 9341, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15692, and C. albicans CCUG 39333. The assay was performed in 384-well plates, and a Tecan EVO liquid-handling workstation was used for robotic dilution, sample preparation, and inoculation. Gram-negative indicator organisms were cultivated in 0.5 × Muller–Hinton broth 2 medium and Gram positive in 1× Brain heart infusion medium. Cultivation volume in each well was 40 μl with 3.15% DMSO extract. Each DMSO extract was assayed undiluted, 4× and 16× diluted. The assay plates were incubated for 10 h without shaking. Growth was measured as OD600, and 100% growth was defined as OD600 of cultures to which was added 3.15% DMSO as a negative control. For fractionation, an Agilent 1260 HPLC equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) and an Agilent Zorbax Bonus-RP, 4.6 × 75 mm, 1.8-μm column was used. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium acetate with a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The acetonitrile gradient was linearly increased from 5 to 95% for 24 min, and fractions were sampled every minute for the run. Fractions from two parallel runs were collected in 96 deep-well plates. The resulting fractions were assayed for antifungal activity against C. albicans CCUG 39333, M. luteus ATCC9341, and E. faecium CCUG 37832. The DMSO crude extracts of strain P38-E01T were analyzed on an Agilent 1290 HPLC system with a Zorbax bonus RP, 2.1 × 50 mm, 3.5-μm column connected to a DAD, and a QTOF was used to precisely identify antifungal metabolites.
