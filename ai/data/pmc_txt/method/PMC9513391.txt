Materials and methods Gene cloning and site-directed mutagenesis of CmnC The cmnC (GenBank accession ID: ABR67746.1) from Streptomyces mutabilis subsp. capreolus (ATCC 23892) was amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified gene was subcloned into expression vector pET28a. For the triple mutant CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y, the plasmid was constructed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method. The primers used for the wild-type and the triple mutant CmnC are shown in Supplementary Table S1. All the plasmids used in this study were verified by DNA sequencing. Each of the wild-type and the mutant constructs was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for gene expression and protein production. Expression, production, and purification of CmnC and its triple mutant Both recombinant CmnC and its triple mutant were produced by a general procedure (Chang et al., 2014). For gene expression and protein production, 1 L LB medium was inoculated with 3 ml of an overnight E. coli BL21 (DE3) culture grown in LB medium containing 100 mg/ml kanamycin, induced by 300 μl 1 M IPTG at an OD600 of 0.5. Cells were grown for an additional 12 h at 18°C and were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. For protein purification, the cells harvested by centrifugation were subsequently resuspended in lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0. The cells were disrupted by sonication. The cell pellets after sonication were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. Both CmnC and the triple mutant were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography [HisTrap FF (GE Healthcare Life Science)]. All chromatography were performed by NGC Chromatography Systems (Bio-Rad). The purities of both proteins were justified by SDS-PAGE. The pure CmnC and the triple mutant were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator (Merck) in 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0 for the following enzyme activity assay and protein crystallization. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 595 nm using Micro BCA protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Activity assay of CmnC and its triple mutant The CmnC activity assay was followed by the procedures carried out in OrfP (Chang et al., 2014). The hydroxylation reaction was performed in a final volume of 200 μL containing a given substrate (1 mM), α-KG (1 mM), FeCl2 (0.05 mM), ascorbic acid (0.2 mM) and purified enzyme (5 μM) in a MOPS buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0). The reaction was incubated at 26°C for 5 h. Protein was precipitated with HCl, and the supernatant was collected for dansyl chloride (DNS-Cl) derivatization. For dansylation, the reaction mixture (100 μl) was added sequentially with solutions of 80 mM Li2CO3 (100 μl, in water) and 3 mM DNS-Cl (100 μl, in acetonitrile). The reaction mixture was then filtered and subjected to HPLC-ESI-LTQ analysis (Phenomenex Luna-C18 column, 3 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm, Agilent 1200 Series HPLC interface with an ESI source coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-XL ion trap spectrometer) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with three-stage elution gradient (% = A/B × 100%, A: deionized water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, B: acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid): 98% for 5 min, a linear gradient to 70% in 27 mins, a second linear gradient to 2% in 5 min. The UV wavelength was set at 254 nm. CmnC product characterization The CmnC product, compound 1, was dansylated and collected by HPLC. The separation condition is the same as that in enzyme activity assay. NMR analysis was carried out on a Varian Vnmrs-600 spectrometer. The NMR spectra were referenced to residual protonated solvent for 1H NMR (4.75 ppm for compounds in D2O). The compound was dissolved in D2O, and spectra were recorded at 25°C. NMR peaks are listed below; all NMR spectra can be found in Supplementary Figure S1.

The 1H-1H Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) and 1H-13C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectra of this compound are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Determination of the size of CmnC by size-exclusion chromatography Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out using a SuperdexTM 200 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva) for CmnC with by NGC Chromatography Systems (Bio-Rad) at 4°C and 1 ml of sample loaded per run. The column was calibrated with Gel Filtration Standard (Bio-Rad) and developed with the elusion buffer (100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Crystallization and data collection of CmnC CmnCapo and CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y were crystallized using the sitting drop vapor-diffusion method. CmnC and CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and were crystallized in a screen condition: 200 mM ammonium acetate, 24% v/v polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, pH 5.5, at 20°C. The CmnCα-kg complex and CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y in complex with α-KG (CmnCtriple,α-kg) were obtained by soaking 3 mM α-KG and 0.1 mM FeCl2 in the crystals for 12 h. CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y in complex with d-Arg (CmnCtriple,d−Arg) was obtained by soaking 20 mM d-Arg in the crystals for 12 h. The CmnC

Structure determination and refinement The structure of CmnCapo was solved by the molecular replacement method of MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997) using the structure of VioC (PDB entry 2WBO) (Helmetag et al., 2009) as a search model. Extensive manual model building was performed using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004; Emsley et al., 2010). The models were refined with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997).
