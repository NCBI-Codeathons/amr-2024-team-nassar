MATERIALS AND METHODS Identification of BGCs from ADT bacteria. To build a database of BGCs from bacteria that colonize the human ADT and environmental bacteria that are found transiently in the ADT, we first downloaded 1,527 bacterial genome sequences, representing 162 unique genera and 451 unique species, from the eHOMD V9.03 (30). We classified bacteria as being from the ADT (eHOMD habitat was listed as “Nasal,” “Nasal,Oral,” or “Oral”) or from the environment (eHOMD habitat was listed as “NonOralRef,” “Skin,” “Unassigned,” or “Vaginal”). We identified 3,895 BGCs (Table S1) using antiSMASH 4.2.0 (36) with the following parameters: --clusterblast, --knownclusterblast, --smcogs. Sampling ADT metagenomes. We downloaded the raw reads for 1,424 whole metagenome shotgun sequencing samples from the buccal mucosa, dorsum of tongue, external naris, gingiva, hard palate, nasal cavity, palatine tonsil, throat, and saliva from the iHMP (41). In total, 235 individuals were sampled between 1 and 16 times (median: 6 samples per individual [IQR: 4 to 8 samples per individual]) as part of the “Healthy Human Subjects” and “prediabetes” iHMP studies (Table S2). For any given visit, individuals were sampled at 1 to 7 sites (median: 3 sites [IQR: 2 to 4 sites]). For all analyses, we treated each individual metagenome as an independent sample. Alignment of metagenomic reads to BGCs. We used hmmscan from HMMER 3.1b2 (http://hmmer.org/) to identify ORFs that are commonly associated with BGCs but encode proteins that are not involved in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites (13). During the hmmscan, we discarded four BGCs that were erroneously called. Using kallisto 0.46.0 (116), we built a length 31 k-mer index that contained all ORFs from the BGCs predicted by antiSMASH, except for the nonbiosynthetic ORFs. Among these ORFs, there were 40,045 non-ACGT characters that were replaced by pseudorandom nucleotides. In total, the target de Bruijn graph contained 488,883 targets and 31,840,424 k-mers. We used fastp 0.20.0 (117) for quality control and preprocessing of the raw reads downloaded from the iHMP. We used kallisto quant to pseudoalign the processed reads onto this index. For subsequent analyses, we aggregated all estimated read counts for all ORFs into a single estimated read count per BGC. We removed BGCs that were not detected in any of the metagenome samples (21 BGCs from ADT bacteria and 274 BGCs from environmental bacteria). We rounded the estimated counts to the nearest integer value and added one pseudocount to each BGC in each sample. We normalized the estimated counts for each BGC using the size factor (118). To perform hierarchical clustering, we used Ward’s minimum variance method on the squared Euclidean distances between the metagenome samples in R 4.0.0 (119). Metagenome composition. To determine the bacterial community composition of metagenomes from the iHMP, we used MetaPhlAn 3.0 (120) with the following parameters: --ignore_archaea and --ignore_eukaryotes. MetaPhlAn estimates the RA of microbial taxa in metagenomes by calculating the coverage of metagenomic reads over clade-specific marker genes. NMDS and ANOSIM. We used the vegan package 2.5–6 (121) in R to perform NMDS and ANOSIM. To generate NMDS plots, we used the metaMDS function with the following parameters: k = 2, trymax = 100. To test for an effect of ADT site on species and BGC composition in the metagenome samples, we performed an ANOSIM with the following parameters: distance = “bray,” permutations = 10000. For both NMDS and ANOSIM of species composition, we filtered out species that were present in metagenomes at <0.1% RA or at 100% RA and species present in <25 metagenomes. Bacterial community and BGC diversity comparisons. We used H′ (122) to calculate the alpha diversity of species-level bacterial communities and BGCs in ADT metagenome samples. For bacterial communities, we used the RA determined by MetaPhlAn. For BGCs, we determined proportions by dividing the number of reads that aligned to each cluster by the total number of reads in a given metagenome. We determined significant differences in H′ across ADT sites by a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Dunn’s test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing (α = 0.05) using the fisheries stock analysis (FSA) (123) and Dunn’s test (124) packages in R. We calculated ε2 (125) using the rcompanion package (126) in R to measure effect size of ADT site on H′ metrics. Differential BGC abundance testing. To identify BGCs that were specifically enriched in microbiomes from different sites, we used DESeq2 1.26.0 (127) in R to compare a given site against all other sites in the data set. For this analysis, we selected only sites with ≥200 metagenome samples. We considered a BGC to be enriched in a specific site if it was detected at a ≥4-fold difference over all other sites with a Wald’s test adjusted P value of <1.0e−08. BGC similarity network. To identify relationships among the 3,895 valid ADT BGCs, we used BiG-SCAPE 1.0.1 (48) with the following parameters: --cutoffs 0.3, --include_singletons, --mix. In addition, we included BGCs in the MIBiG database 1.4 (49) in our network analysis using the following parameter: --mibig. During generation of the network, four additional low-quality BGCs were excluded. We visualized the network using Cytoscape 3.8.0 (128). ANCOM. We used ANCOM v2.1 (61) in R to detect species that were differentially abundant between ADT microbiomes. ANCOM performs pairwise comparisons of the ratio of each taxon to every other taxon and determines if these ratios differ between different types of microbiomes (e.g., different ADT sites) with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. The outcome of an ANCOM analysis is the W-statistic for each taxon, which is the number of pairwise comparisons in which the null hypothesis was rejected (α = 0.05). Prior to ANCOM, we estimated the number of reads for each taxon by multiplying the relative proportions estimated by MetaPhlAn 3.0 by the total number of reads after quality trimming with fastp. We filtered out taxa that were present in <10 metagenomes or represented by <1,000 estimated reads. Metagenomes that contained <10,000 total reads were also excluded from the analysis. We considered taxa to be differentially abundant between ADT sites if the absolute value of the mean difference of their center log ratio (CLR)-transformed relative abundances between sites was >0.5 and the corresponding W-statistic was in the 90th percentile. Identification of RiPP core peptides. To identify putative RiPP core peptides, we first extracted and translated all ORFs ≤450 nucleotides from RiPP-encoding BGCs predicted by antiSMASH. Next, we used NLPPrecusor from DeepRiPP (129) to classify each peptide either as non-RiPP-encoding or into specific RiPP classes (score of ≥0.75). For peptides classified as RiPPs, we removed the predicted leader sequence and used DIAMOND BLASTP (130) to align the core peptides against each other, previously characterized RiPPs from Streptococcus genomes (49, 69) (query length of 100%, query ID of ≥75%), and the NR protein sequence database. We visualized the network of related RiPPs using Cytoscape 3.8.0. Isolation and culture of Actinomyces. Informed consent was obtained from volunteers, and the Human Subjects Committee at the University of Wisconsin-Madison approved the study (institutional review board [IRB] approval number 2020-1027). Each volunteer self-swabbed their buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum using sterile flocked eSwabs (Copan Diagnostics) for approximately 15 s over a 3 cm2 area. After sampling, the volunteers immersed the swabs in 1 ml modified liquid Amies medium (Copan Diagnostics) for transport to the laboratory. Saliva was collected into a sterile tube, and the buccal mucosa and tonsils were swabbed (designated “oral swabs”) from participants of the WARRIOR study (93) during clinic visits and processed in our laboratory (IRB approval number 2018-1578). We serially diluted the samples in phosphate-buffered saline and inoculated 100 μl onto Actinomyces enrichment medium 1 plates (AEM1; 3.7% [wt/vol] BBL brain heart infusion [BHI; BD], 0.37% [wt/vol] sodium bicarbonate, and 1.5% [wt/vol] Bacto agar [BD], with the following additions after autoclaving and cooling the medium to 55°C: 0.005% [wt/vol] lithium mupirocin [Sigma-Aldrich], 0.003% [wt/vol] nalidixic acid [Dot Scientific], 0.1% [vol/vol] Tween 80 [Sigma-Aldrich], and 0.001% [vol/vol] vitamin K1 [TCI]). We incubated AEM1 plates for 7 days at 37°C in a GasPak jar containing carbon dioxide (CO2) generators (BD). We selected ≥2 colonies of each distinct morphotype per sample and passaged the isolates anaerobically on BHI plates at 37°C until we obtained pure cultures. We inoculated BHI broth with the bacterial isolates and incubated these cultures statically at 37°C until there was sufficient bacterial density for subsequent experiments (typically 2 days to 1 week). All bacterial isolates were cryopreserved at −80°C in 25% (vol/vol) glycerol (Dot Scientific). Colony PCR and identification of bacterial isolates. To identify bacterial isolates, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene. Briefly, we combined 20 μl of resuspended liquid cultures with 20 μl of 0.04 N sodium hydroxide and incubated the samples for 5 min at 95°C. Afterwards, we centrifuged the samples for 5 min at 21,130 × g and used 1 μl of the supernatant as the template for PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using the universal 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-CGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) primers (131). We verified amplification of PCR products using electrophoresis with Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) gels (40 mM Tris base, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA disodium salt, 1% [wt/vol] agarose). The PCR products were cleaned and sequenced with the Sanger method using the 27F primer at Functional Biosciences (Madison, WI). We identified isolates to the genus level using the eHOMD 16S rRNA sequencer identifier and ribosomal database project classifier (30, 132). Coculture plate inhibition assays. To assess the inhibitory activity of Actinomyces isolates, we used coculture plate inhibition assays as described previously (17, 31, 133). We diluted static liquid cultures of the bacterial isolates (see above) to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5 and spotted 3 μl on one half of a well (diameter, 2.4 cm) containing 3 ml of BHI agar on a 12-well plate (Greiner Bio-One). We aerobically incubated the plates at 37°C for 1 week. We diluted overnight cultures of the target strains to an OD600 of 0.5 using fresh lysogeny broth (LB; 1% [wt/vol] tryptone [Difco], 0.5% [wt/vol] yeast extract [Bacto], 0.5% [wt/vol] sodium chloride [Sigma-Aldrich]) or yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD; 1% [wt/vol] yeast extract [Bacto], 2% [wt/vol] peptone [Bacto], 2% [wt/vol] dextrose [VWR]) for bacteria and yeasts, respectively. We maintained filamentous fungi as spore stocks at −80°C, which we thawed and diluted 10-fold in YPD before use. Subsequently, we spotted 2 μl of each target adjacent to the established bacterial colonies and incubated the plates at 28°C. After 3 days of coculture, we scanned the plates and scored the inhibition phenotype for each interaction pair. Wells with contamination or overgrowth were not scored. All interactions were tested with ≥2 replicates with consistent results. We scored the plates for inhibition after overnight incubation. An inhibition score of 0 indicated no inhibition, a score of 1 indicated partial inhibition, and a score of 2 indicated full inhibition. All interactions were tested with ≥2 replicates, with consistent results. For subsequent assays to test the bioactivity of Actinomyces isolates when cultured anaerobically, we diluted liquid cultures to an OD600 of 0.5 and spread 50 μl in an ∼6 cm by ∼2 cm wide line in the center of a 25 ml BHI agar plate (diameter 8.6 cm) using an inoculating loop. We then incubated the plates at 37°C in a GasPak jar with CO2 generators, as described above. After 1 week, we removed the plates from the GasPak jar and spotted 5 μl of the target bacteria at an OD600 of 0.5 approximately 0.5 cm away from the line of Actinomyces. Once the spots dried, we aerobically incubated the plates at 37°C. All interactions were tested in triplicate, scored, as described above, and averaged. Statistical analysis and data visualization. All statistical analyses were performed in R, and the packages are described in the preceding sections. We generated graphs using ggplot2 (134), heat maps using ComplexHeatmap (135), and volcano plots using EnhancedVolcano (136), with some cleanup and figure assembly in InkScape. Data availability.
