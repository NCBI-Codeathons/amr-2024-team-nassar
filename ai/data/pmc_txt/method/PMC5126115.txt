Materials and Methods Strains, Media, and β-Galactosidase Analysis All of the B. subtilis strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. One-step competence medium (Kunst et al., 1994) [MC], Schaeffer’s sporulation medium (Schaeffer et al., 1965), and Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Difco, Lennox) were used. Antibiotic concentrations were described previously (Ogura and Tanaka, 1996; Ogura et al., 1997). Synthetic oligonucleotides were commercially prepared by Tsukuba Oligo Service (Ibaraki, Japan) and are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Growth Condition Strains were grown on a LB agar plate (1.5%) containing appropriate antibiotics at 37°C overnight. The cells were scraped from the plate and suspended in the sporulation medium. The suspension was inoculated into 50 ml sporulation medium (with or without glucose) without antibiotics in a 200-ml flask. Klett value was adjusted around 10 units. The flask was gently shaken (110 reciprocation/min) at 37°C. Cell growth was monitored using Klett colorimeter (Klett Mfg., Co., Inc., New York, NY, USA). Plasmid Construction The plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. pIS284-sigM-del1 and pDG1663-sigX-del2 were constructed by cloning of the double-stranded oligonucleotides PsigM-F/PsigM-R and PsigX-F/PsigX-R into pIS284 and pDG1663 which were treated with EcoRI/BamHI, respectively (Guérout-Fleury et al., 1996; Tsukahara and Ogura, 2008). To construct pDG1663-sigX-Wt and pDL2-sigX-del1, PCR products amplified by using the oligonucleotide pair SigX-F/SigX-R and SigX-F/SigX-R2, respectively, were digested with EcoRI/BamHI and cloned into pDG1663 and pDL2 treated with the same enzymes (Yuan and Wong, 1995). To construct pDG1729-PcshA, PCR products amplified by using the oligonucleotide pair, pDG1729-PcshA-E/pDG1729-PcshA-H, were digested with EcoRI/HindIII and cloned into pDG1729 treated with the same enzymes (Guérout-Fleury et al., 1996). To construct pMUTIN3DZ, PCR products amplified by using the oligonucleotide pair, ypuN-F/ypuN-R, were digested with HindIII/BamHI and cloned into pMUTIN3DZ treated with the same enzymes (Yoshimura et al., 2004). Construction of Strains The bkdB::Pxyl-cshA unit was constructed using PCR (Supplementary Figure S1). The bkdB-up linked to Kmr and xylR-Pxyl units were amplified from the total DNA of the strain containing bkdB::sinR and the pX plasmid, respectively (Hori et al., 2002; Ogura, 2016). The other fragments were amplified from the wild type derived total DNA. PrimeSTAR MAX DNA polymerase was used (TaKaRa). Four DNA fragments were assembled by using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs). The sequences of the cshA ORF in the resultant strains were confirmed by sequencing using the primers pX-cshA-seq-F and pX-cshA-seq-R. The cshA::Tcr unit was constructed using PCR. Briefly the upstream and downstream regions and Tcr from pBEST304 (Itaya, 1992) were amplified using the indicated primers (Supplementary Table S2) and then combined by PCR. Sublancin Production Assay Spot-on-lawn assays were performed as previously reported (Luo and Helmann, 2009). To prepare the lawn, overnight culture of the Sublancin-sensitive Y13 cells in liquid LB medium was inoculated into 4 ml of melted 0.7% LB agar (2%), and poured onto the solid 1.5% LB agar plate. Both media were supplemented with or without 1% glucose. Plates were dried for 30 min in an incubator (37°C), and 3 μl of each overnight culture in liquid LB medium was spotted on plates and incubated at 37°C. Transposon Mutagenesis The transposon delivery vector pMarA (Le Breton et al., 2006) was introduced into the strain OAM709. The resultant strain was grown in liquid LB medium containing kanamycin at 30°C overnight. The cells were diluted and plated onto sporulation medium with 1.5% agar plates containing 2% glucose, X-gal (100 μg/ml), kanamycin, and erythromycin. The plates were incubated at 42°C and the pale colonies were chosen. Otherwise, the diluted cells were plated onto LB medium with 1.5% agar plates containing kanamycin and erythromycin, and incubated at 42°C. Colonies were then transferred onto sporulation medium with 1.5% agar plates containing 2% glucose, X-gal (100 μg/ml), kanamycin, and erythromycin. The plates were incubated at 37°C to choose pale colonies. The insertion mutations were backcrossed into the parental strain and the resultant strains were used for the Lac-assay. Total DNA was taken from the candidate strain, SauIIIA1-digested, self-ligated, and subjected to inverse PCR using oligonucleotides 695 and 696 as described previously (Chan et al., 2014, Supplementary Table S2). The PCR products were sequenced using the oligonucleotide 696. Purification of CshA-His CshA-His was purified using a Ni-affinity column from B. subtilis OAM730 (cshA bkdB::Pxyl-cshA-His) cells as described previously (Ogura et al., 2014). Western Blot Analysis Western blot analysis was performed by a method described previously (Hata et al., 2001). Monoclonal anti-acetylated lysine rabbit antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). This antibody was diluted (1/1000) in 1x TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween20, and the solution was incubated with a protein-blotted nitrocellulose filter overnight at 4°C. To enhance signal, Can Get Signal solution 2 (ToYoBo) was used for secondary antibody.
