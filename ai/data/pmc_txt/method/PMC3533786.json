["Experimental procedures", "Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions", "All strains and plasmids used in this study are detailed in Table S1. All mutants constructed in S. marcescens Db10 were in-frame deletion mutants, generated by allelic exchange as described previously (Murdoch et al., 2011). Streptomycin-resistant derivatives were generated by phage \u03d5IF3-mediated transduction of the resistance allele from S. marcescens Db11 (Petty et al., 2006). Plasmids for constitutive expression of proteins in S. marcescens were derived from pSUPROM, plasmids for arabinose-inducible protein expression were derived from pBAD18-Kn, and derivatives of the pET15b-TEV plasmid were generated for protein overexpression and purification. S. marcescens was grown at 30\u00b0C in LB (10 g l\u22121 tryptone, 5 g l\u22121 yeast extract, 10 g l\u22121 NaCl, with 1.5 g l\u22121 agar for solid media) or minimal media (40 mM K2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.2% glucose) and E. coli was normally grown at 37\u00b0C in LB or M9 minimal media (M9). M9 (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) contained 0.5% glycerol (plus stated concentrations of arabinose and glucose as required). Growth analyses were performed in 96-well plates in a BioTek Synergy platereader. When required, media were supplemented with antibiotics: ampicillin (Ap) 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121, kanamycin (Kn) 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121, streptomycin (Sm) 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121, chloramphenicol (Cm) 25 \u03bcg ml\u22121; to maintain repression of proteins expressed from pBAD18-Kn, 0.5% glucose was added to the media for cloning and maintenance.", "Antibacterial competition/co-culture assays", "These were based on the assay described previously (Murdoch et al., 2011). In brief, the attacker strain and target strain (both at OD600 0.5) were mixed at an initial ratio of 1:1 attacker : target, co-cultured on solid LB for 7.5 h at 30\u00b0C and then the surviving target cells enumerated by serial dilution and viable counts on streptomycin-containing media. The target strain was always the streptomycin-resistant version of the mutant in question (Table S1). Statistical significance testing was performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post test (GraphPad Prism software).", "Bioinformatic identification of homologues of Rap and Ssp proteins and determination of their genetic contexts utilized the blast servers and sequence databases at the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).", "Immunodetection of secreted proteins", "Anti-Hcp immunoblots were performed as described (Murdoch et al., 2011). For detection of Ssp1 and Ssp2, cellular and secreted fractions were prepared from 25 ml of culture grown for 7 h in LB. Secreted proteins were precipitated using 50:50 chloroform : methanol followed by methanol wash and resuspension in 2\u00d7 gel sample buffer (Murdoch et al., 2011). Cellular samples were prepared by sonicating harvested cells in 20 mM Tris\u00b7HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and isolating the soluble fraction by centrifugation. Anti-Ssp1 and anti-Ssp2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised to the purified proteins (Eurogentec, Belgium) and used at 1:1000; peroxidase-conjugated secondary (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at 1:10 000. Anti-RNAP \u03b2 (Neoclone, USA) was used at 1:20 000, with anti-mouse secondary (Roche) at 1:10 000. In all cases, protein from the same number of cells was loaded in the secreted versus the cellular samples.", "Localization of Rap-HA proteins", "Fractionation was performed using a cold osmotic shock procedure. Following growth of cultures for 5 h in LB, Tris\u00b7HCl pH 7.8 was added to 5 ml of cells to a final concentration of 50 mM and the cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then recovered by centrifugation and washed once in LB. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 40% sucrose, 30 mM Tris\u00b7HCl pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA and incubated for 10 min at 30\u00b0C. One hundred microlitres of this fraction (\u2018whole cell\u2019) was removed for analysis. Remaining cells were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 900 \u03bcl of ice-cold water and incubated on ice for 10 min, resulting in the release of the periplasm. After centrifugation, 100 \u03bcl of the supernatant (\u2018periplasm\u2019 fraction) was retained for analysis. The pellet, containing the \u2018cytoplasm + membranes\u2019 fraction, was resuspended in 900 \u03bcl of 50 mM Tris\u00b7HCl pH 7.8 and 100 \u03bcl retained for analysis. Equivalent amounts, on a per cell basis, of each fraction in each strain were assayed. Anti-RNAP \u03b2 was used as above, anti-MBP (NEB) was used at 1:10 000 and anti-HA (Roche) was used at 1:6000, all with anti-mouse secondary as above.", "Microscopic analysis of colony and cell morphology", "Overnight cultures were normalized to OD600 0.5, diluted 10\u22122 (culture spots) or to obtain single colonies, 10 \u03bcl spotted onto solid media and grown for 24 or 48 h. Macroscopic morphology of culture spots and single colonies were recorded using a Zeiss MZ16FA Stereo Microscope with a Leica DFC350 FX camera and Leica AF6000 software. Microscopic analysis of single cells taken from spots grown on solid media as above was performed by Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy using an Axioskop 2 mot plus (Zeiss) with a SPOT RT KE camera and spot software (Diagnostic Instruments).", "Protein purification and in vitro analysis", "A full description of protein purification is provided in the Supporting information. In brief, proteins were overproduced in E. coli with a TEV protease-cleavable His6 tag and isolated by Ni2+ affinity purification. If required, the His6 tag was cleaved using TEV protease and the protein re-isolated by reverse Ni2+ chromatography. A final SEC step was then always performed. For SEC analysis of complex formation, His6-tagged proteins (10 nmol each) in 50 mM Tris\u00b7HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl were separated on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column, calibrated using molecular weight standards (GE Healthcare). Quantitative SYPRO Orange staining was performed as described (Rickman et al., 2004), with image analysis using ImageJ. Molar ratios were the mean of at least four quantifications. ITC was performed in 50 mM Tris\u00b7HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl at 30\u00b0C in a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter. The sample cell contained 6 \u03bcM Rap1a dimer or Rap2a dimer and the syringe contained 120 \u03bcM Ssp1 or Ssp2. Titrations consisted of 30 \u00d7 8 \u03bcl injections of Ssp into Rap (or into buffer alone as control). Data analysis was performed with the Origin software provided (MicroCal). For affinity isolation of Ssp1 and Ssp2, 10 \u03bcg of His6-tagged Rap protein was immobilized on magnetic Ni2+ beads (Qiagen), incubated for 1 h with culture supernatant (after 7 h growth in LB), beads washed and bound proteins eluted by the addition of gel sample buffer. Identified proteins were excised from the Coomassie- (Ssp2) or Silver- (Ssp1) stained gel and identified by mass spectrometry.", "Crystallographic analyses", "Well-ordered trigonal and orthorhombic crystals of Rap1b and Rap2b, respectively, were obtained. The asymmetric unit for Rap1b consisted of a single subunit, while Rap2b displayed two dimers in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were recorded in-house and experimental phases were derived by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction measurements (Micossi et al., 2002), exploiting the signal from endogenous S atoms and I\u2212 ions that had been added by soaking. The electron density maps were of high quality, and the models were completed, then refined to high resolution using standard methods (Dawson et al., 2008). Full crystallographic details are provided in the Supporting information and Table 1. Atomic co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes 4AX2 (Rap1b) and 4B6I (Rap2b)."]
