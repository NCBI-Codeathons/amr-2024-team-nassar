MATERIALS AND METHODS Sequence and structure analysis dRNA-seq and RNAtag-seq data signal tracks (54) were downloaded from the NCBI GEO (GSE155167) and visualised using svist4get (60). Searching for conserved short ORFs in 5′ leader region sequences of cplR, vmlR and vmlR2 was performed with uORF4u [https://github.com/GCA-VH-lab/uorf4u, https://server.atkinson-lab.com/uorf4u] (61). The pipeline consists of several steps: i) BlastP for homology searching (62) with cut-offs set on a protein by protein basis to optimise numbers and diversity of hits: 50% sequence identity to the query cutoff for CplR (WP_011861613.1), 70% identity cutoff for VmlR (WP_003234144.1) and VmlR2 (WP_024026878.1) and 80% for LsaA (WP_002398829.1), ii) retrieval of 300 nt upstream sequences preceding the identified ARE-ABCF genes, iii) uORF annotation and, finally, iv) conservation analysis and multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT v7.490 (63). Visualisation was performed with the ggmsa R package (64), msa4u (61) and Logomaker (65) Python packages. Secondary structures of the cplR 5′ leader region were predicted using RNAfold (66) and Mfold (67). For phylogenetic analysis, selected ARE-ABCFs were aligned with MAFFT v7.490 with the L-INS-i strategy (63), and visualized with AliView v1.26 (68) and Jalview v2.11.2.0 (69). Alignment positions with > 50% gaps were removed with trimAI v1.4.rev6 (70) before tree building with IQTree v2.1.2 on the CIPRES server with 1000 rapid bootstrap replicates and the model ‘LG-I-G4’, as selected using the automatic model detection setting (71,72). For the tree of CplR close relatives, 948 sequences were retrieved from the NCBI RefSeq-Select database using BlastP (E value limit 1e−70, C. difficile CplR as the query). The sequences were aligned with MAFFT v7.490 (63) and phylogenetic analysis carried out with FastTree v 2.1 (73). Bacterial culture C. difficile 630Δerm and its derivatives were grown anaerobically in Brain-Heart Infusion (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and 0.1% cysteine (BHIS) or BHIS agar under 80% N2, 20% CO2, 4% H2 atmosphere in the Coy anaerobic chamber (COY). C. sporogenes and its derivatives were anaerobically grown in Gifu anaerobic medium (GAM) (Nissui Co., Japan) in the Coy anaerobic chamber. C. perfringens and its derivatives were grown at 37°C in GAM under anaerobic conditions using Anaeropack system (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co. Inc., Tokyo, Japan). B. subtilis were routinely aerobically cultured in LB broth. When necessary, antibiotics were supplemented in the media: 20 μg/ml erythromycin and 10 μg/ml thiamphenicol in the case of C. difficile and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol in the case of C. perfringens. Strain and plasmid construction The plasmid and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1, respectively. To construct C. difficile cplR (CDIF630_02847) deletion mutant we constructed the plasmid for the allele exchange mutagenesis as previously reported by Peltier and colleagues (67). The CD2517.1 type I toxin gene under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter as well as ≈1 kb-long 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of the target gene were cloned into pMTL83151 plasmid (CHAIN biotech, Nottingham, UK), yielding the pMSRNO plasmid. Using E. coli HB101/pRK24, the pMSRNO plasmid was then introduced into C. difficile by conjugation. pRK24 (74) was a gift from Farren Isaacs (Addgene plasmid # 51950). Briefly, 500 μl of overnight cultured C. difficile were heated at 52°C for 2 min. Meanwhile, 1 ml culture of E. coli HB101/pRK24 harbouring pNO201 were centrifuged and pelleted at 1500 × g for 3 min. The E. coli pellet was suspended to 200 μl of the heated C. difficile culture in the anaerobic chamber. The mixture was spotted onto a BHI agar plate and incubated for 8 h. The mixed colonies were resuspended in 1 ml BHI broth, and then spread onto BHIS plates supplemented with 10 μg/ml thiamphenicol, 250 μg/ml d-cycloserine and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (BHIS-TCK). After incubation for two to three days, individual colonies were restreaked on BHIS-TCK for isolation. The protocol for allele exchange was based on that of Peltier and colleagues (67). The deletion of the target gene was confirmed by PCR amplification. C. sporogenes mutants were constructed using the Targetron system (Merck). A DNA fragment containing group II intron and ltrA gene from pJIR750ai (Merck) as well as a Clostridium-E. coli shuttle vector pMTL83153 (CHAIN biotech, Nottingham, UK) containing a constitutive promoter Pfdx were PCR-amplified, and the intron-containing plasmid was produced by ligation of these DNA fragments pre-digested with HindIII and XhoI. Then, a PCR-amplified C. sporogenes cplR-targeted intron was introduced into HindIII-BsrGI site in the plasmid. The resulting pNO201 plasmid was used for cplR mutant construction. The pNO201 plasmid was introduced into C. sporogenes by conjugation as described above, with one modification: the heat treatment prior to conjugation was omitted. While this step is crucial for obtaining transconjugants with C. difficile, in the case of C. sporogenes transconjugants are easily obtained without heat shock. To screen the mutant in which the target gene was disrupted, the colonies were restreaked onto BHIS containing 20 μg/ml erythromycin. The insertion of the intron in the appropriate locus was verified by PCR amplification. The C. perfringens mutant was constructed as described previously (75,76). Briefly, ≈1 kb of the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of the target gene were PCR-amplified, and the resultant fragments were cloned into pCM-GALK using the In-Fusion cloning system (Takara Bio, Japan). Resulting plasmid was introduced into C. perfringens HN13 via electroporation, and the desired mutant was isolated on agar plates supplemented with 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol or 3% galactose. The deletion of the target gene was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. For complementation of cplR genes in C. difficile and C. perfringens, cplR-expressing plasmids were constructed. The C. difficile cplR-expressing plasmid was based on pRPF185 plasmid which contains a tetracycline-inducible promoter (77). The pRPF185 was a gift from Robert Fagan and Neil Fairweather (Addgene plasmid # 106367; http://n2t.net/addgene:106367;RRID: Addgene_106367). A PCR-amplified cplR CDS was cloned into pRFP185 using the In-Fusion cloning system. For complementation of C. perfringens cplR, the DNA fragment containing a native promoter and CDS of C. perfringens cplR gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pJIR750 (78). An mCherry2-L variant codon-optimized for low-GC bacteria was used to construct the reporter constructs used to assay the regulation of cplR expression (79). The DNA fragment encoding a codon-optimized mCherry2-L CDS was synthesized at Eurofin Genomics (Tokyo, Japan). DNA fragments containing cplR promoter and 5′ leader region were amplified and ligated with the mCherry2-L by PCR. The resulting DNA was introduced into pMTL84151 (CHAIN biotech) using the In-Fusion cloning system. The B. subtilis strains were derivatives of wt168 (trpC2). The strains were constructed through homologous recombination by transformation with plasmids listed in Supplementary Table 1. The plasmids were constructed by standard cloning methods including PCR and Gibson assembly using oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table 1. Successful integration of a gene into the chromosome was accomplished by double crossing-over at the target loci. The resulting recombinant clones were checked for their antibiotic resistance markers, including the absence of those originally present on the plasmid backbone, as well as for inactivation of the thrC target locus. Antibiotic susceptibility testing The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) were calculated according to guidelines from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (http://www.eucast.org/ast_of_bacteria/mic_determination). Bacterial cells were cultured in 96-well plates in medium supplemented with 2-fold serial dilutions of the antibiotics. BHIS, GAM, or LB media was used to grow C. difficile, C. perfringens/C. sporogenes and B. subtilis, respectively. The 200 μl cultures were inoculated at the concentration of 5 × 105 CFU/ml and grown in the 96-well plates. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of antibiotics in which no bacterial growth was observed after incubation for 24 h at 37°C. The reproducibility was confirmed by at least three individual experiments. Immunoprecipitation of C-terminally HTF-tagged VmlR2N.viretiEQ2 The experiments were performed as described earlier (26). C-terminally HTF-tagged VmlR2N.viretiEQ2 inducible strain VHB220 (ΔvmlR thrC::Phy-spnak-vmlR2B.viretiEQ2-HTF; HTF stands for His6-TEV-FLAG3) was pre-grown on LB plates overnight at 30°C. Fresh individual colonies were used for inoculation and grown in LB medium with 1 mM IPTG. 0.5 l cultures were grown at 37°C to OD600 = 0.8. Cells were collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, JLA-16.25 Beckman Coulter rotor), pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of cell opening buffer (95 mM KCl, 5 mM NH4Cl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 15 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 8 mM putrescine, 1 mM spermidine, 1 tablet of cOmplete™ EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) per 50 ml of buffer) and disrupted using FastPrep homogeniser (MP Biomedicals) with 0.1 mm Zirconium beads (Techtum) in 6 cycles by 20 s with 3-min chilling on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14 800 rpm for 20 min 4°C in F241.5P rotor using 149 Microfuge 22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). The supernatant was combined with 100 μl of ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) pre-equilibrated in cell opening buffer, and incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C on a turning wheel (Fisherbrand™ Multi-Purpose Tube Rotators). The samples were loaded on Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated in cell opening buffer, and washed 5 times with 0.5 ml of cell opening buffer by gravity flow. VmlR2viretiEQ2-HTF was eluted by addition of 200 μl opening buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml poly-FLAG peptide (Biotool, Bimake) for 45 min on a turning wheel. All incubations, washes and elutions were performed at 4°C. The eluted sample was collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 1 min 4°C in a F241.5P rotor using a 149 Microfuge 22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). For SDS-PAGE analyses, 20 μl aliquots of samples were mixed with 5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer and heated at 95°C for 15 min, and denatured samples were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE. SDS-gels were stained by ‘Blue-Silver’ Coomassie Staining (80) and washed with water for 6 h before imaging with LAS4000 (GE Healthcare) (Supplementary Figure S1). Preparation of cryo-EM grids Elutions from pull-downs were kept on ice until being applied within two h to glow discharged cryo-grids (Quantifoil 2/2 Cu300 coated with 2 nm continuous carbon). 3.5 μl of sample was loaded on grids in Vitrobot (FEI) under conditions of 100% humidity at 4°C, blotted for 5 s and vitrified by plunge-freezing in liquid ethane. Samples were imaged on a Titan Krios (FEI) operated at 300 kV at a nominal magnification of 165 000× (0.82 Å/pixel) with a Gatan K2 Summit camera and a BioQuantum energy filter with a slit width of 20 eV. The exposure rate was 5.277 electrons/pixel/s with a 4 second exposure and 20 frames using the EPU software. Cryo-EM data analysis MotionCor2 was used to correct for beam-induced motion in 6384 starting micrographs (81). Contrast transfer functions were estimated with Gctf (82). Subsequent processing was performed in RELION 3.1 unless specified otherwise (83,84). Micrographs with MaxRes >4 Å and/or a CtfFigureOfMerit <0.05 were discarded, resulting in 5014 micrographs used for further processing. From the resulting set of 5 014 micrographs, 279 082 particles were picked with Gautomatch [https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/download/gautomatch-056] and extracted with a pixel size of 2.46 Å. 2D classification was used to remove non-ribosomal particles, resulting in 193 343 particles which were subjected to 3D auto refinement. The initial reference, which was low-pass filtered to 60 Å, was a B. subtilis 70S ribosome that contained a P-tRNA and no factor in the E site (EMD-0176, (34)). The output volume was used as a reference for subsequent 3D refinements. 3D classification with four classes and without angular sampling was then performed, resulting in two classes of interest that contained density in the E site. The best-resolved of the two classes, class 2, was used for most analyses, on the grounds that this class had the most continuous and feature-rich density for the protein in the E site. Particles from class 2 were re-extracted at the original pixel size and used for 3D autorefinement, and then anisotropic magnification, per-particle defocus, per-micrograph astigmatism, beam tilt, and higher-order aberrations were refined before final 3D autorefinement and post-processing (84). A combined volume, containing particles from both classes with VmlR2 density in the E site, was also re-extracted as above and partial signal subtraction followed by 3D classification around the A and E sites was performed. For the A-site classification, three classes with 29.1%, 37.6% and 33.3% occupancy were observed. The first and last of these classes contained a tRNA, each in a slightly different conformation, while the second class had no density in the A site, consistent with the poorly resolved density for the A tRNA in the parent map. Each of these classes was reverted to full density and used for 3D autorefinement. Partial signal subtraction and 3D classification around the E site and L1 stalk yielded three maps that differed mostly in the conformation of the L1 stalk, consistent with the poor resolution of this region in the parent map. However, density for VmlR2 was not improved in any of these classes, so class 2 from the initial 3D classification was used for further analyses. For post-processing, soft solvent masks and a B factor automatically estimated by Guinier analysis were used. See also Supplementary Figure S2 for an overview of processing and Supplementary Table 2 for collection and processing statistics. Model building and refinement Starting models for B. subtilis ribosomal proteins and VmlR2 were obtained from the AlphaFold2 database (85). Ribosomal RNA was taken from PDB 6HA1 (34). Models were first adjusted using Coot (86) into a high-resolution B. subtilis 70S map (to be described elsewhere). The resulting model was then fitted in the VmlR2-70S map and adjusted manually with Coot. The starting model of VmlR2 was fitted domain-by-domain and adjusted by hand. A prediction created by ModelAngelo was also used to guide modelling of VmlR2 in places (87). For the P-site tRNA and 23S rRNA of the L1 stalk, PDBs 7NHK and 7NHL were used as starting points, respectively (26). Density for the uL1 protein and the CCA-3′ end nucleotides of the P-site tRNA was very unclear and these regions were therefore omitted from the model. PDB 7K00 was used as a reference to guide modelling, especially around 23S rRNA helix 69 (88). The resulting model was refined first with REFMAC5/Servalcat (89,90), then with Phenix using the starting model as a reference for restraints to decrease bond length and angle root-mean-square deviations (91). MolProbity through Phenix was used for model validation (92). Model statistics are available in Supplementary Table 2. Figures showing maps and models were made with UCSF ChimeraX (93) or PyMOL (https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source). RNA extraction and RT-PCR Overnight culture 630Δerm C. difficile strain in BHIS was diluted 1:20 in fresh BHIS medium and incubated anaerobically for 2 h to reach the log phase. Then we added various concentrations of antibiotics to the culture. After incubation for 0.5–6 h, the cells were collected from 1 ml of the culture by centrifugation at 10 000 × g for 2 min and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNAs were extracted as described previously (94) with minor modifications. Briefly, the cell pellets were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. The cells were resuspended in 500 μl of LETS buffer (100 mM LiCl, 20 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 1% SDS) and disrupted by addition of 500 μl of glass beads and 500 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalchol followed by shaking for 5 min using a Shake Master NEO (Bio Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). After centrifugation at 20 000 × g for 5 min, the aqueous layer was transferred to a fresh tube and mixed with equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalchol. To recover the total RNAs, the aqueous layer was mixed with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of 3 M NaOAc, pH 5.2. The RNA was harvested by centrifugation at 20 000 × g for 10 min, washed with 70% ethanol, and contaminated DNA was removed by DNase I treatment (Promega). Purified RNA samples were resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water and stored at −80°C. Reverse transcription was preformed with PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix kit (TaKaRa, Japan) using 10 or 0.5 ng (genomic or plasmid encoding genes, respectively) of total RNA. The cDNAs for the target genes were amplified using Tks Gflex™ DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) and the primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1. mCherry fluorescent reporter assays C. difficile harbouring reporter plasmids were cultured in BHIS supplemented with 10 μg/ml thiamphenicol. Cells were harvested from 1 ml cultures by centrifugation at 10 000 × g for 2 min and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The resultant cell pellets were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 8 min, washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. After exposure to oxygen for 90 min for chromophore maturation, fluorescence (ex/em = 579/616 nm) and absorbance (600 nm) of each sample were measured using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA). To calculate the relative promoter activity, relative fluorescence intensity normalised by O.D.600 was further normalised by the signal from the constitutive Pfdx-mCherry reporter.
