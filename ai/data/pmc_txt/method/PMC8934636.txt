MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Expression vector pBG102 (Supplementary Table S1) was obtained from the Vanderbilt University Center for Structural Biology. DNA oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S2) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. AlkA, AlkC, AlkD, AlkZ and YcaQ were purified as previously described (28,29,38–40). E. coli EndoIV was purchased from New England BioLabs. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TXNA and LLD were isolated from S. bottropensis NRRL 12051 and S. vinaceusdrappus NRRL 15735, respectively, as described below. Sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis The 15,119 homologous proteins of AlkZ were obtained from the InterPro website (41) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence-search) by using AlkZ as the query. Sequences were then clustered by CD-HIT Suite (42) on the website (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi?cmd=cd-hit) with 53% sequence identity threshold. The representatives of the resulting clusters and TxnU2, TxnU4, LldU1, LldU5, AlkZ were used for construction of SSN by the online Enzyme Function Initiative-Enzyme Similarity Tool (43) with an alignment score threshold of 110. Cytoscape software was used to view the sequence similarity networks. Fermentation and isolation of TXNA and LLD For TXNA production, Streptomyces bottropensis NRRL 12051 and its relative mutant strains were cultivated as previously reported (44). After fermentation in SYG medium (soluble starch 60 g/l, glucose 10 g/l, yeast extract 10 g/l, NaCl 3 g/l, MgSO4•7H2O 1 g/l, KH2PO4 1 g/l, CuSO4•5H2O 70 mg/l, FeSO4•7H2O 10 mg/l, MnCl2•4H2O 8 mg/l, ZnSO4•7H2O 2 mg/l, CoCl2•7H2O 6 μg/l, HP20 30 g/l) for 5 days, the TXNA was isolated and detected as described (45). The fermentation and isolation of LLD was similar to TXNA (46). S. vinaceusdrappus NRRL 15735 and those mutants were cultivated in SYG medium for 10 days, and then isolated and detected by HPLC. HPLC analysis was performed on an Acclaim 120 C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and a linear gradient program: 0–5 min, 10% phase B (0.1% formic acid in CH3CN); 5–24 min, solvent B gradient from 10 to 90% followed with 90% B at 24–26 min; 26–27 min, gradient from 90 to 10% B; 27–31 min, constant 10% B. Phase A is 0.1% formic acid in H2O. TXNA/LLD-related compounds were determined by measuring UV absorbance at 400 nm using an Agilent 1200 series system (45,46). LC–MS was carried out on a ThermoFisher LTQ XL under the same conditions. Cellular TXNA and LLD self-resistance assays Zone of inhibition assays in streptomyces The inhibition zones of Streptomyces were performed by a disc diffusion assay. Specifically, filter paper discs spotted with different concentrations of TXNA or LLD were laid on the MS plate (20 g/l soybean meal, 20 g/l mannitol, 20 g/l agar, pH 7.2), which were pre-inoculated with wild-type strains S. bottropensis NRRL 12051 (txnWT), S. vinaceusdrappus NRRL 15735 (lldWT), the gene mutant strains, ΔtxnU2, ΔtxnU4, ΔlldU1, ΔlldU5 or heterologous expression strains S. lividans::pSET152, S. lividans::txnU2, S. lividans::txnU4, S. lividans::lldU1, S. lividans::lldU5 (Supplementary Table S1). After incubation at 30°C for 36 h, resistance levels to TXNA or LLD were determined by the zone of inhibition. Heterologous survival assays in E. coli E. coli BL21 cells transformed with protein overexpression plasmid txnU2-pET28a, txnU4-pET28a, lldU1-pET28a, lldU5-pET28a or empty vector pET28a alone were grown overnight at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Kan). The overnight cultures were then transferred to fresh LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml Kan and incubated at 30°C. When the OD600 reached 0.6, 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce protein expression. After growing at 16°C for 2 h, cells were diluted to 0.01 OD600 in 2 ml fresh LB supplemented with Kan and IPTG. The dilutions were treated with various concentrations of TXNA for 12 h at 30°C and cell density was measured by OD600. The surviving fraction (%) was calculated as (OD600(treated)/OD600(untreated)) × 100. The data were fit by non-linear regression and plotted using GraphPad 8.0 software. TxnU2/4 and LldU1/5 purification The lldU1/5 (GenBank accession numbers QDQ37873 and QDQ37896) and txnU2/4 (GenBank accession numbers AKT74276 and AKT74302) genes were synthesized by GenScript and cloned into pBG102 (Vanderbilt Center for Structural Biology). N-terminal His6-SUMO proteins were overexpressed in E. coli Tuner (DE3) cells at 16°C for 18 h in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed with sonication and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 45 000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Clarified lysate was passed over Ni-NTA agarose equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol) and protein eluted in 250 mM imidazole/buffer A. Protein fractions were pooled and supplemented with 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) before incubation with 0.5 mg of Rhinovirus 3C (PreScission) protease and 0.5 mg of yeast ubiquitin-like-specific protease 1 (Ulp1) at 4°C overnight. Cleaved protein was diluted 10-fold in buffer B (50 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.5, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA) and purified by heparin sepharose using a 0–1 M NaCl/buffer B linear gradient. Fractions were pooled and repassed over Ni-NTA agarose in buffer A, concentrated and filtered, and buffer exchanged into buffer C (20 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA). Proteins were concentrated to 100 μM, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. For purification of TxnU2 and LldU5, buffers A and B were supplemented with 0.02% NP-40 and buffer C was supplemented with 0.01% NP-40. Proteins used in HPLC analysis did not contain NP-40. LldU1/5 and txnU2/4 mutants were generated using the Q5 Mutagenesis Kit (New England BioLabs). Mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified the same as WT. Preparation of DNA substrates The TXNA- and LLD-DNA substrates for HPLC analysis, which contained two lesions per duplex, were prepared by annealing the 8-bp self-complementary strand 5′-AACCGGTT-3′ (36), followed by incubation of 50 μM DNA with 100 μM TXNA or LLD in PBS buffer (pH 7.0) at 16°C for 2 h. TXNA- and LLD-DNA substrates used in gel-based assays contained a single TXNA-G or LLD-G adduct and a 5′-cyanine 5 (Cy5) label, and were prepared by annealing the strand containing the TXNA/LLD target sequence (TXN/LLD Top, Supplementary Table S2) to the complementary unlabeled oligo (TXN/LLD Bottom, Supplementary Table S2), followed by incubation of 100 μM DNA with 200 μM TXNA or LLD in 10% methanol and 20% DMSO at 4°C on ice in the dark for 36 h. Unreacted drug was removed using a G-25 spin column equilibrated in TE buffer (pH 8.0), and the DNA was stored at -80°C. DNA substrates containing a single N7-methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine (7mG) lesion and a 5′-Cy5-label on one strand were prepared as described previously using 7mG_Top and 7mG_Bottom oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S2) (47). NM-ICLs containing both 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and Cy5 labels were generated using NM_Top and NM_Bottom oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S2) and purified as reported previously (29). Base excision assays HPLC analysis A 50 μl reaction containing 50 μM TXNA- or LLD-DNA, 20 μM protein, and buffer (100 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) was incubated at 16°C for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were quenched with 30 μl methanol and analyzed by LC–MS at 400 nm absorbance. TXNA-Gua (gutingimycin), [M + H]+ ion with m/z 1028.53; LLD-G, [M + H]+ ion with m/z 1102.43. Denaturing page analysis Glycosylase reactions were performed with 50 nM DNA in glycosylase buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol) at 25°C. Single-timepoint reactions shown in Figures 4–6 were performed with 1 μM enzyme for either 30 s, 30 min, or 96 h, as indicated in each figure legend. Single- and multiple-turnover kinetics reactions shown in Figure 4G were performed with 50 nM (single turnover) or 5 nM (multiple turnover) TxnU4 and 50 nM Cy5-labeled TXNA-DNA. Thermal depurination controls shown in Figure 5A were conducted at 95°C for 5 min. Enzyme and mock reactions involving TXNA, LLD and 7mG monoadducts were quenched by adding 1 μl of 1 M NaOH to a 4-μl reaction aliquot and heating at 70°C for 2 min. Samples were denatured by addition of 5 μl loading buffer containing 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 80% (wt/vol) formamide, and 1 mg/ml blue dextran, and incubating at 70°C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a 20% (wt/vol) acrylamide/8 M urea sequencing gel at 40 W for 1.5 h in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM borate and 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0). Gels were imaged on a Typhoon Trio variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) for Cy5 fluorescence (633 nm excitation, 670 nm emission), and bands were quantified with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). Percent product was calculated as the percent of both β- and δ-elimination bands divided by the total intensity of substrate and β/δ-elimination bands. Unreacted DNA in LLD-DNA reactions was not included in the calculation of percent product. NM-ICLs reactions were performed the same as monoadducts, but were quenched and denatured at 55°C prior to electrophoresis. Gels were imaged for both FAM (488 nm excitation, 526 nm emission) and Cy5 fluorescence and artificially colored (FAM, green; Cy5, red) using Adobe Photoshop and overlaid using ImageJ software as previously described (29). All excision assays were performed in triplicate. Spontaneous depurination Non-enzymatic depurination of G, 7mG and TXNA-G were conducted at 37°C in glycosylase buffer using 50 nM DNA, with the same Cy5-oligodeoxynucleotides described above. The G-DNA oligo was the same as that used to make the TXNA-G oligo. Samples were quenched and products quantified the same as the enzymatic reactions described above. EndoIV abasic site incision kinetics AP-DNA substrates were generated by incubation of 5 nM YcaQ or TxnU4 with 50 nM Cy5-(TXNA/7mG)-DNA in glycosylase buffer for 2 h at 25°C. EndoIV incision reactions were performed by adding 6 μl of 83 nM EndoIV (17 nM final concentration) to a 24-μl glycosylase reaction aliquot and incubating at 37°C. Reactions were heated at 70°C for 5 min with 5 μl of formamide/blue dextran loading buffer and electrophoresed and imaged as above. Curve fitting was performed in Prism 9 using a single exponential one-phase association for 7mG-AP site incision and an exponential two-phase association for TXNA-G-AP sites.
