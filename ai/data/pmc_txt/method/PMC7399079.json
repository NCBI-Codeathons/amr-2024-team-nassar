["Materials and Methods", "Isolation and Characterization of Discosia Strains", "Strain TTI-0863 was isolated by transferring mycelial fragments emerging from the cut end of a dead hardwood log onto cornmeal agar (Becton Dickinson) amended with streptomycin sulfate and chlortetracycline at 50 \u03bcg/mL. Strain TTI-0885 was recovered from mixed pine-hardwood forest litter using the dilution-to-extinction method (Torres et al., 2011). For morphological analysis and photography, strains were grown on oatmeal-wheat germ agar, V8 juice agar, and double-strength malt-yeast extract agar. Strains are available from the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research Culture Collection (NRRL) as strains NRRL 66951 (TTI-0863) and NRRL 66952 (TTI-0885).", "General Experimental Procedures", "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were collected on a Bruker 500 MHz NMR instrument equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe at 298 K, with CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard (\u03b4H/\u03b4C = 0). Semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separations and HPLC-MS (mass spectrometry) data were acquired on an Agilent 1260 system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) and coupled to an Agilent 6120 single quadrupole mass spectrometer, with a binary solvent system consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B).", "Growth Conditions", "To produce mycelial extracts for agar zone of inhibition (ZOI) assays, strains TTI-0863 and TTI-0885 were grown on five media in 12-mL fermentations. For the seed cultures, cryopreserved agar plugs were grown for 7 days in YM agar plates (malt extract 10 g, yeast extract 2 g, agar 20 g, 1000 mL deionized H2O). Six agar discs from each culture were inoculated into 50 mL of SMY (maltose 40 g, neopeptone 10 g, yeast extract 10 g, agar 3 g, 1000 mL deionized H2O) in a 250-mL baffled flask. Seed cultures were grown at 24\u00b0C, 220 rpm for 4 days. One mL aliquots of the seed cultures were transferred to 50-mL EPA glass vials containing 12 mL of the following media: Wheat 1 medium (5.0 g whole wheat seeds, 8.5 mL of base liquid consisting of yeast extract 2.0 g, sodium tartrate 10.0 g, KH2PO4 1.0 g, MgSO4.7H2O 1.0 g FeSO4.7H2O 0.050 g in 1000 mL deionized H2O); CYS80 (sucrose 80.0 g, yellow cornmeal 50.0 g, yeast extract 1.0 g in 1000 mL deionized H2O); MMK2 [mannitol 40.0 g, yeast extract 5.0 g, Murashige and Skoog Salts (Sigma-Aldrich M-5524) 4.3 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O]; MPP [maltose 25.0 g, glucose 10.0 g, dried baker\u2019s yeast 5.0 g, Pharmamedia (Archer Daniels Midland) 10.0 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O], and MR (glucose 10.0 g, glycerol 10.0 g, sucrose 10.0 g, oat flour 5.0 g, soybean meal 20.0 g, primary yeast 10.0 g, CaCO3 1.0 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O). For TTI-0885, MPP medium was substituted for Supermalt (malt extract 50.0 g, yeast extract 10.0 g, FeSO4.7H2O 0.02 g, ZnSO4.7H2O 0.007 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O), and MR for GGP media (10.0 glucose, 30.0 g glycerol, 5.0 Bacto peptone, 2.0 g NaCl in 1000 mL deionized H2O). Cultures in the Wheat 1 and CYS80 media were incubated statically with vials slanted at a 45\u00b0 angle; the other media were agitated at 220 rpm. Fermentations were carried out at 24\u00b0C for 14 days, after which for each fermentation, 17 mL of 2-butanone was added and agitated at 220 rpm for 2 h. Eight mL of the organic phase was transferred to a glass vial and evaporated to dryness. The extracts were dissolved in 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to assay. For a scaled-up cultivation, 100 mL of SMY seed media in a 500 mL flask was grown for 4 days at 23\u00b0C and 180 rpm, then 2.5 mL was transferred to each of ten 250-mL baffled flask containing 50 mL of MMK2 media. Fermentations were carried out at 24\u00b0C for 10 days.", "Two-Plate Thermal Sensitivity and Zone of Inhibition Assays", "The assay for temperature-selective growth inhibition of C. neoformans was described previously (Xu et al., 2018). Overnight cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Sigma-Aldrich), and C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. neoformans H99 grown in YM broth (1% malt extract, 0.2% yeast extract in deionized H2O) at 37\u00b0C were diluted with ATCC 43300 sterile H2O to an OD600 of 0.4 for S. aureus and 0.8 for C. albicans and C. neoformans. One-mL aliquots of the resulting mixture were combined with 35-mL aliquots of YMA (or LB agar for S. aureus) at 45\u00b0C and dispensed into one-well plates (Nunc Omnitray). Test wells (4 mm diam) were aspirated from the solidified plates with a syringe tip, and 10 \u03bcL of each extract in DMSO was applied to each well. Sets of fungal fermentation extracts were tested at a density of 20 extracts/plate in paired plates. One plate of each pair was incubated at 25 and 37\u00b0C. ZOIs were photographed after 48 h."]
