MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains A total of 202 S. lugdunensis isolates were collected between 2003 and 2014 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Linkou), Taiwan. The sample sources and antimicrobial susceptibility results of 202 S. lugdunensis isolates are shown in Table S1. All S. lugdunensis isolates were identified using a Bruker Biotyper (database 2.0) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry system, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and S. lugdunensis isolates were stored in a tryptic soy broth with 20% glycerol at −80°C until further experiments. Vancomycin susceptibility was determined using the modified population analysis profile/area under the curve (19). In all, 91 S. aureus strains containing 28 ST5, 8 ST45, 27 ST59, and 28 ST239, with different vancomycin susceptibilities, were randomly selected and used as test pathogens to examine lugdunin activity in S. lugdunensis (20). Screening of lugdunin activity by an agar spot test Basic medium (BM) agar was prepared (1% soy peptone, 0.5% Kat yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.1% glucose, and 0.1% K2HPO4; pH 7.2) as previously described (21). A single colony of S. aureus HG001 was inoculated into a 5-mL BM medium tube (17 × 100 mm) and incubated at 37°C with shaking for 18–24 h. The BM agar was then melted and allowed to cool in a 50°C water bath for 0.5–1 h. The BM agar was then supplemented with 2,2′-dipyridyl (2-DP, 200 µM), an iron chelator, and the optical density (OD)600 of S. aureus was adjusted to 0.125 and added together in the BM agar. The mixture was poured into a Petri dish and allowed to solidify. An S. lugdunensis overnight BM medium was prepared, and the S. lugdunensis culture was washed twice with 0.1× volume of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded. The S. lugdunensis pellets were adjusted to OD600 = 20 using the BM medium, and 10 µL was dropped at the center of the BM agar and allowed to dry. The BM agar was incubated for 48 h, and zone clearing or inhibition was observed. Clear zone inhibition was calculated as the inhibition zone diameter—colony diameter (cm), and the absence of a clear zone of inhibition was considered negative. Strains SL131 and SL118, with known genome sequences, were used as lugdunin-active positive and negative controls, respectively (22, 23). Strain SL85, with strong lugdunin activity (zone size >0.2 cm), was used to examine anti-S. aureus activity. SCCmec, STs, and agr genotyping All protocols for SCCmec, STs, and agr genotyping were adopted from previous studies. For SCCmec typing, all ORSL isolates were performed using multiplex PCR (M-PCR 1 and M-PCR 2) and were interpreted as described previously (24). Briefly, the 10 µL reaction mixtures of M-PCR 1 contained 10 ng chromosomal DNA, M1 oligonucleotide primers (0.1 M), and Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at a final volume of 10 µL. A three-step thermal cycling protocol was used with an initial denaturation step (94°C, 2 min), followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 1 min), an annealing step (50°C, 1 min), and an extension step (72°C, 1 min); and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. The 10 µL reaction mixtures of M-PCR 2 were the same as those for M-PCR 1 except that the annealing temperature was raised to 60°C for 1 min (24). For MLST typing of S. lugdunensis, seven housekeeping genes (aroE, dat, ddl, gmk, ldh, recA, and yqiL) were used, and the fragments were amplified using the primers as described previously (10). The selection of these housekeeping genes relied on their use in MLST schemes of S. aureus (25). The Pasteur MLST sequence definition database contains allele and profile data of S. lugdunensis (https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/staphlugdunensis/). The ST of each S. lugdunensis isolate was determined using the search tool with a combination of S. lugdunensis loci (26). Two PCR primers (SL_agr-F and SL_agr-R) were designed to detect the agr genes of S. lugdunensis isolates (27). In addition, two forward primers and one reverse primer (SL_agr-1-F, SL_agr-2-F/SL_agr-R) were used to determine the agr type (27). Statistical analysis We used chi-square tests to compare categorical variables. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
