Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were grown aerobically at 37°C in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) (Difco) where not mentioned otherwise. Good aeration for liquid cultures was assured by vigorously shaking flasks with an air-to-liquid ratio of 4 to 1. Ampicillin 100 [μg/ml], anhydrotetracycline 0.2 [μg/ml], chloramphenicol 10 [μg/ml], kanamycin 50 [μg/ml] or tetracycline 10 [μg/ml] were added to the media when appropriate. Phage 80αalpha was used for transduction. Where nothing else is mentioned, experiments were repeated at least twice and representative data are shown.

Construction of mutants and complementation plasmid In-frame markerless deletions of sa2056 (NWMN 2'384'867-2'388'051), sa2339 (NWMN 2'696'046-2'698'531) and secDF (NWMN 1'706'584-1'708'866) from the chromosome of S. aureus Newman (accession number NC_009641) was performed using pKOR1 [23] yielding single mutants CQ33, CQ65 and CQ66, respectively. Correct deletion was confirmed by PCR and by sequencing. Furthermore, strain stability was confirmed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of total genome SmaI digests [55]. To complement the secDF mutant, secDF with its endogenous promoter was amplified from S. aureus strain Newman with primers listed in additional file 2 table S1. The amplified region was ligated into the SalI/BamHI restriction sites of pCN34, a low copy (20-25 copies/cell) E. coli-S. aureus shuttle vector [56]. The junction region was sequenced as a control. The resulting plasmid pCQ27 was electroporated into RN4220 with subsequent transduction into the strains of interest. To construct MRSA strains, the plasmid pME2, containing the mecA promoter and gene from strain COLn [28], was either electroporated or transduced into the strains selected. Promoter predictions were performed by BPROM http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml. Rho-independent transcriptional terminators were retrieved from the CMR terminator list http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Cells were grown to exponential phase, harvested at OD600 0.5 and fixed for one hour in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Electron microscopy was performed by the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis, University of Zurich. Resistance profiles For qualitative susceptibility comparisons, bacterial suspensions of McFarland 0.5 were swapped across LB agar plates containing antibiotic gradients and incubated at 35°C for 20-24 h. Glycopeptides were tested on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) (Difco) agar with a bacterial suspension of McFarland 2 [57]. Spontaneous and Triton X-100 induced autolysis Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.7, pelleted by centrifugation and washed with 0.85% NaCl. The cells were then resuspended in 0.01 M Na-phosphate buffer pH 7 and the OD600 was adjusted to 0.7. After splitting the cultures, 0.01% Triton X-100 (Fluka) or an equal volume of PBS pH 7 was added. Cultures were incubated at 37°C and the decrease of OD600 was measured. Zymographic analyses Cultures were grown to an OD600 = 0.7, centrifuged and the filtered supernatants (pore size 0.45 μm, TPP) stored at - 20°C until further use. The cell wall peptidoglycan was digested in SMM buffer (0.5 M sucrose, 0.02 M maleate, 0.02 MgCl2 pH 6.5) supplemented with 72 μg/ml lysostaphin and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) [38]. Cell wall containing supernatant was separated from the protoplasts and stored at - 20°C until further use. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay (BioRad). Twenty μg of protein from each fraction was separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) containing cell wall extract of heat-inactivated (1 hour at 100°C in 4% SDS) S. aureus (end concentration OD600 = 6). The gel was washed twice for 15 min in dH2O and incubated for 18 h at 37°C in 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer pH 6.8. Afterwards the gel was incubated for 3 min in staining solution (0.4% methylene blue, 0.01% KOH, 22% EtOH) and destained in cold water for several hours. Murein hydrolase activities produced clear bands. Coagulase test Overnight cultures were pelleted at full speed, 0.5 ml supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes and 2 mM PMSF was added. The supernatants were normalized to an OD600 of 1 of the original culture with PBS. 0.1 ml supernatant was added to 0.25 ml reconstituted rabbit plasma (BBL Coagulase Plasmas, BD) and incubated at 37°C. Every 30 min tubes were examined for coagulation. Qualitative hemolysis assay Cells were grown overnight in Todd-Hewitt (TH) medium [58], which was originally developed for the production of streptococcal hemolysins [59]. To visualize hemolysis production of sessile bacteria, overnight cultures were normalized to an OD600 = 1 in PBS pH 7.4. Fifty μl was dispensed into 5 mm wide holes punched into 5% sheep blood agar. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and then stored at 4°C. To determine hemolysis in liquid media, the overnight cultures grown in TH medium were normalized to the same OD600 with PBS and pelleted for 10 min at 5'900 g. The supernatant was filtered (pore size 0.22 μm, TPP) and 140 μl added to the holes in sheep blood agar. Plates were incubated as above. Quantitative hemolytic activity Cells were grown for 24 h in TH medium and normalized with PBS pH 7.4 to the same OD600. After pelleting the cells, the filtered supernatants (pore size 0.22 μm, TPP) were diluted up to 1:50'000 in TH medium. Sterile sheep blood was treated with 26 mM sodium citrate and 15 mM NaCl and diluted 1:100 in PBS pH 7.4. After washing the erythrocytes four times in PBS pH 7.4, they were resuspended to a dilution of 1:100 in PBS pH 7.4. Five hundred μl of washed erythrocytes were added to 500 μl of the diluted supernatants and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, followed by 30 min at 4°C. Finally the samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 7'000 g and the absorption of hemoglobin in the supernatant was measured at 415 nm [58]. Determination of protease activity on skim milk agar plates Skim milk agar plates were prepared as follows: Skim milk (Difco) and Bacto agar (Difco) were dissolved separately in 250 ml dH2O, each with an end concentration of 75 g/l and 15 g/l, respectively. After autoclaving for 15 min at 110°C and cooling down to 50°C, the skim milk and Bacto agar solutions were mixed together. Overnight cultures grown in LB broth were normalized to an OD600 = 1 with 0.85% NaCl and 50 μl was added into punched holes in skim milk agar. Skim milk agar plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h and another 96 h at room temperature. Transcription analyses Prewarmed LB broth was inoculated with an overnight culture to an OD600 0.05 and incubated at 37°C. Cells were harvested at OD600 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3 and 6, centrifuged for 5 min at 20'000 g and 4°C. Cells were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C. Total RNA was extracted as described in [60]. Seven μg RNA was separated in a 1.5% agarose gel containing 20 mM guanidine thiocyanate in 1× TBE [61]. RNA was transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche) using the downward capillary transfer method. The blots were hybridized with specific digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled DNA probes (Roche). Primers used are listed in Additional file 2 Table S1. Analyses of subcellular protein fractions Cells were sampled as described for transcription analyses and culture supernatant was collected as described for zymographic analysis. Cells were fractionated basically according to Schneewind et al. [38]. Briefly, cells were digested in SMM buffer supplemented with each 72 μg/ml lysostaphin and lysozyme, 36 μg/ml DNase and 2 mM PMSF. Protoplasts were separated from the cell wall containing supernatant by centrifugation for 4 min at 16'000 g. Protoplasts were resuspended in membrane buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.01 MgCl2 pH 7.5) and lysed by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen/thawing at 20°C. Cell membranes were separated from the cytoplasm by centrifugation for 30 min at 20'000 g and 4°C. Membrane pellets were solubilized in buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 30% glycerol) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, by gently mixing end-over-end at 4°C. Where necessary, protein fractions were concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15, -4 or -0.5 centrifugal filter units (MWCO 10 kDa, Millipore). Cell fractions were kept at - 20°C. Five μg of protein was separated by SDS-10% PAGEs and either stained with Coomassie Imperial™ Protein Stain (Thermo Scientific) or blotted onto a PVDF-membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). For detection of SpA, membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS and then incubated with goat anti-human IgA conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma-Aldrich), 1:10'000 in 0.5% milk powder/PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (AppliChem). After washing three times with PBS pH 7.4, HRP was detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). PBP2a was detected as described in [28]. For detection of PBP4, membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS. Membranes were pre-incubated with 40 μg/ml human IgG in 0.5% milk powder/PBS. Rabbit anti-PBP4 antibodies (1:2000, [62]) and 0.05% Tween 20 were then added. After incubation for 1 h, membranes were washed three times with PBS before addition of goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:10'000 in 0.5% milk powder/PBS/0.05% Tween 20. After washing three times with PBS, HRP was detected as described for SpA. Molecular weights of PBP2a, PBP4 and unprocessed SpA are 76 kDa, 48 kDa and 56.7 kDa, respectively. Bocillin-FL staining Hundert μg of cell membrane fraction were incubated for 30 min at 35°C with Bocillin-FL (Invitrogen) as described by [63] before separation by SDS-7.5% PAGE. Fluorescence was visualized with the FluorChem™ SP imaging system (AlphaInnotech).
