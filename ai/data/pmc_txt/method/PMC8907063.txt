Methods Bacterial strains, plasmids and routine cultivation Bacterial strains and plasmids used in these studies are listed in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, E. coli DH10β (NEB) was used for all strain construction and propagated aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB-Lennox, RPI) broth at 37 °C. All experiments involving faecal communities were performed in an anaerobic chamber (70% N2, 25% CO2, 5% H2). Oligonucleotides (Sigma) and dsDNA gene blocks (IDT) used in plasmid construction are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Plasmid construction steps and recombineering were performed using enzymes obtained from NEB (NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly master mix, T4 DNA ligase and DpnI) and lambda red (pKD46 and pKD3), respectively. Sequencing of all inserts was performed using Sanger sequencing. Plasmid sequencing of PR-lux revealed that the vector consists of two copies of the DNA-damage-responsive element (cI and PR). Growth, reporter and lysis assays were all carried out in M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% casamino acids (M9-CAS, Quality Biological) unless otherwise specified. Antibiotics, inducers and indicators were used at the following concentrations: 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin (IBI Scientific), 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin (VWR), 25 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol (Sigma), 100 ng ml−1 MMC (Sigma), 40 μg ml−1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactosidase (X-gal, Takara Bio), and 500 μM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Teknova), unless otherwise specified. Growth and competition assays For growth inhibition by cell-free fluids Overnight cultures of wild-type E. coli BW25113 harbouring either BAC-pks or the empty BAC were centrifuged (16,100g and 1 min) and the supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Corning Spin-X). Growth of non-colibactin-producing E. coli cultures was assayed in fresh LB in the presence of varying amounts of each supernatant (5%, 10%, 20%, 50% v/v). OD600 was measured at regular intervals using a BioTek Synergy HTX multi-mode plate-reader. For testing ClbS protection from cell-free fluids Overnight cultures of wild-type E. coli BW25113 harbouring either pTrc-clbS or pTrc-∆clbS were centrifuged (16,100g and 1 min) before addition at 10% v/v to co-cultures containing a 1:1 ratio of E. coli BW25113 harbouring the PR-lux reporter and E. coli BW25113 harbouring either BAC-pks or the empty BAC. Bioluminescence was measured after 24 h and quantified in a plate-reader as outlined below (see ‘E. coli-based reporter assay’). For E. coli–E. coli competition assays Overnight cultures of lacZ +
E. coli MG1655 (KIlacZ, Addgene: 52696) harbouring BAC-pks were back-diluted 1:100 into fresh M9-CAS and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a similarly back-diluted culture of lacZ −
E. coli MG1655 (delta-Z, Addgene: 52706) harbouring the empty BAC. The co-cultures were incubated at 37 °C, and, at regular intervals, an aliquot was taken for differential plating on LB supplemented with X-gal and IPTG. Both BAC combinations (pks+ versus empty) and marker combinations (lacZ + versus lacZ −) were tested to rule out the influence of carrying the lacZ marker. For assaying RecA-dependent growth of pks+∆clbS E. coli Overnight cultures of wild-type E. coli BW25113 or wild-type E. coli DH10β, each individually harbouring BAC-pks or BAC-pks∆clbS, were back-diluted 1:100 into fresh M9-CAS. The monocultures were incubated at 37 °C and the OD600 nm readings were obtained after 24 h. For E. coli–S. aureus competition assays S. aureus RN450 lysogenic for phi80α and S. aureus RN450 lysogenic for phi11 were grown overnight at 37 °C in fresh brain heart infusion (BHI) medium, and E. coli BW25113 harbouring BAC-pks or empty BAC were grown overnight at 37 °C in fresh LB broth supplemented with chloramphenicol. The overnight cultures were back-diluted 1:100 into fresh BHI medium and mixed in a 1:1 ratio and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cultures were plated on LB agar supplemented with Cm for E. coli colony-forming units (CFUs), and mannitol salt phenol-red agar (Sigma) for S. aureus CFUs. For differential MMC susceptibility of phage-free S. aureus and E. coli lacZ −
E. coli MG1655 (delta-Z, Addgene: 52706) and S. aureus RN450were grown overnight at 37 °C in fresh LB and BHI media, respectively. The overnight cultures were back-diluted 1:100 into the same respective fresh medium and a twofold dilution series of MMC was added to achieve a final concentration ranging from 78 ng ml−1 to 5,000 ng ml−1. Cultures were subsequently incubated overnight at 37 °C and OD600 nm readings were obtained after 24 h. Normalized OD600 nm was calculated as the OD600 nm at a given MMC concentration relative to the OD600 nm of the same strain to which no MMC was added (defined as 100%). Production and isolation of phage lambda by MMC induction An overnight culture of the lambda lysogen was back-diluted 1:100 into fresh LB and incubated at 37 °C. After reaching an OD600 nm of 0.4–0.5, MMC (500 ng ml−1 final concentration) was added and the cultures were returned to 37 °C for an additional 3–5 h, over which time noticeable clearing occurred. After chloroform treatment and centrifugation (16,100g and 1 min), the clarified lysates were filter-sterilized and stored at 4 °C before use. Quantification of phage induction by colibactin E. coli-based reporter assay Overnight cultures were back-diluted 1:100 into fresh M9-CAS medium with appropriate antibiotics before being dispensed (200 μl) into white-walled 96-well plates (Corning 3610). For co-culture experiments, the two cultures were mixed 1:1 immediately after back-dilution. Monoculture controls for each strain were prepared by adding 100 μl of the back-diluted cultures to an equivalent volume of M9-CAS. For DNA interference experiments, herring sperm DNA (Promega) was used. To test DNA with varying AT richness, complementary oligonucleotide pairs (JWO-1046 and JWO-1047) and (JWO-1044 and JWO-1045) were annealed in 10 mM aqueous Tris-HCl buffer, and the resulting duplexes were added to the wells at the indicated concentrations. Plates were shaken at 37 °C and the OD600 nm and bioluminescence readings were obtained after 24 h. Relative light units (RLU) were calculated by dividing the bioluminescence by the OD600 nm. Phage quantification for phages of E. coli, S. Typhimurium, S. aureus, E. albertii 07-3866 and E. faecium E1007 Preparing and measuring viral titres from co-cultures with phage-infected isolates was carried out according to the identical conditions used for the reporter assays with the exception that the reporter strain was substituted for the relevant lysogen. Co-cultures with phage-infected E. coli, S. Typhimurium and E. albertii were conducted in M9-CAS, whereas co-cultures with phage-infected S. aureus and E. faecium were conducted in BHI as the growth medium. To prepare phage lysates, cultures were transferred after 24 h co-culture to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 16,100g for 1 min. The supernatant was removed and passed through a 0.22-µm filter. For phage quantification by plaque assays, supernatants were diluted logarithmically from 100 to 10−5, and 10 µl spotted on top agar (preparation below) containing the relevant indicator. For E. albertii 07-3866 phi12, 2-fold dilutions of the supernatants instead of 10-fold were used. In the case of quantifying S. Typhimurium phages from faecal communities, culture supernatants were concentrated approximately 40-fold from their starting volume in protein concentrators (Pierce, 100 kDa MWCO, spin columns) before use in plaque assays. For phage quantification by qPCR, supernatants were diluted 100-fold, treated with DNase (Promega) to remove residual DNA, then boiled to release encapsidated phage DNA. Host (JWO-1120 and JWO-1121) and phage (JWO-1116 and JWO-1117) specific primer pairs were used for PCR amplification using the Luna Universal qPCR kit (NEB) in a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Data were processed and analysed by comparing the relative amplification within samples of phage-specific primer pairs to host-specific primer pairs (Pfaffl method) using the Gene Expression calculator in the CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad). Preparation of top agar The indicators used to assay each phage-bacteria system were as follows: for lambda-E. coli and phi12-E. albertii (wild-type E. coli BW25113 or the lambda-resistant lamB::kan mutant); for P22-S. Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium D23580ΔΦ); for BTP1-S. Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium SNW22 D23580 ΔBTP1); for Gifsy-1-S. Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium D23580 ΔΦ ΔwaaG::aph); for phi80α and phi11 (S. aureus RN450). In each case, overnight cultures of the relevant indicator strains were back-diluted 1:100 into LB (for E. coli and S. Typhimurium) or BHI (for S. aureus) and incubated at 37 °C. At an OD600 nm of 0.3–0.5, E. coli and S. Typhimurium cultures were diluted 1:10 into molten LB-agar (0.6%) supplemented with 10 mM MgSO4 and 0.2% maltose and poured onto a LB-agar (1.5%) plate. For S. aureus, cultures were back-diluted 1:10 into molten tryptic soy agar (0.6%) supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 and poured onto a denser layer (1.5%) of the same agar. ELISA for Stx2dact detection Detection of Stx2dact from both aerobic co-cultures and faecal communities was performed using the Premier EHEC test kit, which specifically detects Shiga toxins I and II (Meridian Biosciences), following the manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: for aerobic co-cultures, overnight monocultures of C. rodentium harbouring stx2dact were back-diluted 1:100 and co-cultured in M9-CAS at a 1:1 ratio with E. coli BW25113 harbouring either BAC-pks or the empty BAC. For faecal community experiments, anaerobic monocultures of C. rodentium harbouring stx2dact were mixed with faecal communities in BHI as described in the relevant section below. To verify toxin production in response to a known DNA-damaging agent under these conditions, MMC (1.5 µg ml−1 final concentration) was added to aerobic cultures of exponentially growing stx2dact-harbouring C. rodentium in M9-CAS. In all cases, samples collected after 24-h incubations (exact volumes detailed below) were diluted in 200 µl of diluent buffer provided by the manufacturer before addition to Stx-specific antibody-coated microwells. The use of kit-provided positive and negative controls as well as all wash and substrate addition steps were carried out exactly according to the manufacturer-supplied protocol. The stop reagent was added approximately 2–5 min after adding the final substrate to each well, at which time the images used in Fig. 3c were taken. Absorbance at 450 nm (Abs450 nm) was measured using a plate-reader. According to the manufacturer, Abs450 nm values ≥ 0.180 are considered a positive test result. For aerobic experiments including MMC controls, 2 µl of culture supernatants were used as the sample input. For faecal community experiments, culture supernatants were first concentrated approximately 20-fold from the initial volume in protein concentrators (Pierce, 30 kDa MWCO, spin columns). Forty microlitres of the concentrated retentate was used as the sample input. Faecal sample processing Faecal pellets from C57BL/6J mice from the Jackson Laboratory (which lack Enterobacteriaceae and do not contain colibactin-producing organisms) were suspended in pre-reduced PBS supplemented with 0.1% l-cysteine (5% w/v), then left to stand to allow insoluble particles to settle. The supernatant was carefully removed and mixed with an equal volume of 40% glycerol. Aliquots (50 µl) of this suspension were stored at –80 °C until required. Ex vivo culture with faecal communities An aliquot of the faecal suspension prepared above was thawed and inoculated into BHI (1:100) and incubated at 37 °C in an anaerobic chamber alongside the relevant human-associated phage-containing bacteria and E. coli BW25113 harbouring either BAC-pks or the empty BAC. After 24 h incubation, the overnight cultures were back-diluted (1:1,000) and mixed in equal proportions in fresh BHI, then incubated for a further 24 h. Phages and toxin produced from faecal communities were measured in the same assays used in two-way cultures, involving plaque assays for S. Typhimurium (BTP1 and Gifsy-1) and S. aureus (phi80α and phi11), qPCR for E. faecium (phi1), and Stx ELISA for C. rodentium (stx2dact). Assaying protection by clbS-like open reading frames For reporter assays, each of the clbS-like open reading frames (ORFs) (or the pTrc-∆clbS construct) were transformed into E. coli BW25113 harbouring the PR-lux reporter. After overnight growth of each strain in monoculture, strains were back-diluted 1:100 and co-cultured in M9-CAS at a 1:1 ratio with E. coli BW25113 harbouring BAC-pks. Bioluminescence was measured after 24 h incubation at 37 °C in a plate-reader as detailed for all other E. coli-based reporter assays above. For measuring protection by the clbS-like ORFs from phage induction, the same clbS-like ORF-encoding constructs from the reporter assay were individually transformed into a E. coli BW25113 lambda lysogen. An identical dilution and co-culture procedure to that of E. coli BW25113 harbouring BAC-pks was used, after which phage production was measured by plaque assay as described in the relevant section above. To measure protection provided by a chromosomal copy of E. albertii-encoded clbS (clbSalbertii), the locus surrounding clbSalbertii from the E. albertii 07-3866 genome was PCR-amplified and transferred using lambda-red recombineering into wild-type E. coli BW25113 (JSO-1966–1973; Supplementary Table 4). The PR-lux reporter plasmid was introduced into the resulting strain, E. coli::clbSalbertii, and measured for its ability to be induced by colibactin using the identical co-culture procedure as that used for E. coli-based reporter assays, as noted in the relevant section above. Quantification of N-myristoyl-d-asparagine prodrug production by pks+E. coli For culture conditions and sample preparation Overnight cultures of E. coli BW25113 harbouring either BAC-pks or the empty BAC were back-diluted 1:100 and co-cultured in M9-CAS at a 1:1 ratio with phage-free E. coli BW25113 or lambda-infected BW25113. Cultures (1 ml) were dispensed into deep-well plates (VWR) and incubated with shaking at 37 °C. After 24 h, 10 µl deuterated (d27) N-myristoyl-d-asparagine (10 µM in DMSO stock solution) was added to each sample. Samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized for 48 h, then reconstituted in methanol (1 ml) and vortexed for 1 min. Three hundred microlitres of the mixture was filtered through a 0.22 µm filter (Pall) before mass spectrometry analysis. For prodrug quantification Analysis of the N-myristoyl-d-asparagine prodrug in samples was performed using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) system model Xevo TQ-S (Waters). The mass spectrometer system consists of a triple quadrupole equipped with a dual-spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Samples were analysed using an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (2.7 mm, 4.6 mm × 50 mm) with the following elution conditions: isocratic hold at 90% solvent A in solvent B for 0.5 min: linear gradient from 90% to 5% solvent A in solvent B from 0.5–2 min; isocratic hold at 5% solvent A from 2–3 min, gradient from 5% to 98% solvent A in solvent B from 3–3.5 min; isocratic hold at 98% solvent A in solvent B from 3.5–4 min (solvent A: 95% water + 5% methanol + 0.03% ammonium hydroxide; solvent B: 80% isopropanol + 15% methanol + 5% water; flow rate = 0.75 ml min−1; injection volume = 5 µl). The mass spectrometer was run in negative-mode MRM with a Cone voltage of 50 V, monitoring transitions of m/z 341 -> m/z 114 (retention time (rt) = 2.2 min, collision energy (CE) = 24 V) for the prodrug scaffold and m/z 368 -> m/z 114 (rt = 2.2 min, CE = 28 V) for the deuterated internal standard (d27-N-myristoyl-d-asparagine). For all samples, peak areas for the m/z 341 -> m/z 114 were normalized to the m/z 368 -> m/z 114 transition for the same sample, and then normalized values compared to a standard curve of unlabelled N-myristoyl-d-asparagine containing 100 nM d27- N-myristoyl-d-asparagine, which was run in triplicate. Bioinformatic analyses NCBI tBLASTn (nr/nt database, expect threshold = 0.05, word size = 6, BLOSUM62 matrix) was used to identify clbS genes that match E. coli ClbS (WP_000290498) but that are found outside of pks clusters. The more distantly related ClbS-like proteins examined in this study (Fig. 3d) were compiled from BLASTp results using E. coli ClbS as the query (nr protein sequences database, expect threshold = 0.05, word size = 6, BLOSUM62 matrix, 5,000 entries). After excluding entries that occur in genomes with pks clusters, the isolation source of the remaining hits was considered in identifying bee gut and human-associated isolates. Other members in the representative panel selected for cloning and heterologous expression were chosen heuristically and to cover the range in per cent identities returned by the BLAST search (spanning Mixta theicola having 80% pairwise identity and Bifidobacterium longum with 26.8% pairwise identity to E. coli ClbS). The genomes encoding clbS-like genes in the representative panel were submitted to PHASTER for identification of prophage regions. Genes encoded by predicted intact prophages (score higher than 90) were further analysed by domain analysis (InterPro) for features matching the lambda repressor (DNA-binding and peptidase domains), as mentioned in the main text and Supplementary Discussion, and shown in Extended Data Fig. 4d.
