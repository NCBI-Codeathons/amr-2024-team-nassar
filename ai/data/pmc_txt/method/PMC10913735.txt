MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of myxobacteria Both myxobacterial strains MCy12716 and MCy12733 originated from the citizen-science campaign “Sample das Saarland,” a regional project initiated in 2017 that aims to discover novel antibiotics and new anti-infectives from local samples. The first strain MCy12716 was isolated in March 2019 based on the standard bacterial predation method using Escherichia coli. This strain came from pond soil sediments collected in the summer of 2018 (03 June) in an area between Karlsbrunn and Ludweiler, Germany (coordinates: 49.20153847434484,6.800456559291888). On the other hand, the second myxobacterium MCy12733 was isolated after a month (April 2019) but from a soil sample with decaying leaves collected on 09 August 2018 at Aßweiler, Germany (GPS coordinates: 49.2189122,7.192166499999985). Its discovery was also based on E. coli lysis, formation of swarming colony, and development of fruiting bodies on Stan-21 mineral salt agar medium. Axenic cultures were achieved by repeated transferring of the swarm cells taken from the colony margin and by maintaining in VY/2 agar, which supports growth developmental stages, including swarming and fruiting body formation. These two myxobacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene amplification using universal 27F and 1492R primers. Their closest related type strains were determined by BLAST search and phylogenetic analysis. Fermentation of myxobacteria for analytical purposes Cultures for analytical purposes were grown in 300 mL shake flasks containing 50 or 100 mL of the respective fermentation medium inoculated with 2% (vol/vol) pre-culture. The medium was supplemented with 4% (vol/vol) of a sterile aqueous solution of XAD-16 adsorber resin (Sigma Aldrich) to bind secondary metabolites in the culture medium. After 7–10 days of cultivation, the culture is pelleted in 50 mL falcon tubes in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5804R at 8,288 × g and 4°C for 10 min. The pellet is then stored at −20°C until further use. Feeding experiments with stable isotope-labeled precursors Feeding experiments were performed in 100 mL shake flasks containing 20 mL of the respective fermentation medium inoculated with 2.5% (vol/vol) SBCy413 pre-culture. At 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-, and 60-h post-inoculation, 200 µL of an aqueous solution of 50 mM L-alanine 15N (Sigma Aldrich) or L-methionine-(methyl 13C) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added to the cultures. After another 12 h of cultivation, 5% (vol/vol) sterile aqueous solution of XAD-16 adsorber resin was added to the cultures. After approximately 4 days of cultivation, the culture is pelleted in 50 mL falcon tubes in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5804R at 8,288 × g and 4°C for 10 min. The pellet is then stored at −20°C until further use. Large-scale fermentation for compound purification Pre-cultures of MCy12733 were cultivated in 300 mL shake flasks containing 100 mL of the respective fermentation medium at 30°C and 180 rpm for 5 days. These pre-cultures are used to inoculate [5% (vol/vol) inoculum) 6 × 2 L of the respective fermentation medium, supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) of a sterile aqueous solution of XAD-16 adsorber resin in 5 L shaking flasks. Fermentation was performed at 30°C and 170 rpm for 21 days. Afterward, the combined cultures were pelleted with an Avanti J-26 XP centrifuge, equipped with a JLA-8.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 11,978 × g and 4°C for 15 min. The pellet was then frozen, freeze-dried, and stored at −20°C until further use. Preparation of gDNA Genomic DNA of P. fallax An d48 for cloning purposes and P. fallax An d48-AngKO to verify the integration of pTOPO-AngKO within angB was isolated using the Puregene Core Kit A (Qiagen) or the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To isolate the gDNA of MCy12716 and MCy12733 for Illumina sequencing, standard phenol-chloroform extraction was used. Whole-genome sequencing The genome sequence of strain MCy12733 was acquired using Illumina technology to give 88 assembled contigs with a total sequence length of 13.77 Mbp. PCR amplification Amplification of a genetic region in angB for gene disruption by single cross-over and PCRs to verify the integration of the plasmid into the angiolam BGC in P. fallax An d48 were done with the Phusion High-Fidelity polymerase (Thermo Scientific). All PCR amplifications were performed in a MasterCycler Pro S (Eppendorf). The success of PCR amplifications was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of PCR products for cloning purposes were cut out and purified using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-Up Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Further information about PCR mixes and cycler protocols can be found in the supplemental material (Tables S5 to S8). Restriction enzyme digestion protocols Restriction enzyme digestions for cloning purposes were performed in volumes of 20 µL with 350 ng PCR product or 1.2 µg cyclized pCR2.1-TOPO vector, respectively. Aqueous solutions of the PCR product or the cyclized pCR2.1-TOPO vector were mixed with 2 µL of 10× EcoRI buffer and 1 µL of EcoRI (10 U/µL, Thermo Scientific) and incubated at 37°C. After 2 h, 1 µL of FastAP (1 U/µL, Thermo Scientific) was added to the reaction mixture of the vector to dephosphorylate its ends. All digestion reactions were stopped after 3 h of incubation, and the resulting products were subsequently purified, using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-Up Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Control digestions to verify the success of cloning were performed in volumes of 10 µL with approximately 1 µg plasmid. Aqueous solutions of cloned plasmid were mixed with 1 µL of Tango buffer (Thermo Scientific) and 0.5 µL of NcoI (10 U/ µL, Thermo Scientific) or 0.5 µL of NaeI (10 U/ µL, Thermo Scientific) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Successful cloning was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing of the obtained plasmid. Ligation protocol Ligation of DNA was carried out with ~50 ng vector and a fivefold molar excess of insert. Vector and insert were mixed with 2 µL of 10× T4 buffer, 1 µL T4 ligase (5 U/ µL; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and autoclaved Milli-Q water to a final volume of 20 µL. Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 4 h or at 16°C overnight and subsequently electroporated into E. coli HS996. Transformation of E. coli HS996 One milliliter of an overnight culture of E. coli cells in LB was inoculated into 20 mL of LB medium and grown at 37°C until it reached an OD600 of 0.6. The cells were centrifuged at 11,467 × g and 4°C (HIMAC CT15RE, Koki Holdings Co.) for 90 s in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. The cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold sterile MQ water, first with 1,000 µL, then with 800 µL. After the washing procedure, E. coli cells were resuspended in 50 µL ice-cold sterile MQ water, kept on ice, and subsequently used for electroporation. E. coli cells were mixed with 3–5 µL ligation product or 100 ng plasmid and transferred to an electroporation cuvette. Electroporation was carried out at 25 µF, 200 Ω, and 1,250 V. The electroporation product was immediately mixed with 1 mL LB medium and incubated in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes at 37°C and 750 rpm for 45 min. Incubated cells were spread on LB-agar plates containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37°C. Around 10 clones were picked and cultivated in 5 mL LB containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin for subsequent plasmid isolation. Plasmid isolation Plasmid isolation for cloning purposes or transformation into P. fallax An d48 was performed with the GeneJET Miniprep Kit (Thermo Scientific). Plasmid isolation for control digestions to verify successful cloning was done with standard alkaline lysis (47). Transformation into P. fallax An d48 Electroporation of P. fallax An d48 was adapted from Panter et al. (27). Two milliliters of an An d48 culture in YM medium at OD600 of approximately 0.7 were centrifuged at 11,467 × g (HIMAC CT15RE, Koki Holdings Co.) for 2 min. The pelleted cells were washed twice with sterile MQ water, first with 1,000 µL, then with 800 µL. After the washing procedure, the cells were resuspended in 50 µL sterile MQ water, mixed with 5 µL of plasmid solution at a concentration of 0.3–0.4 μg/μL, and moved to an electroporation cuvette. Electroporation was performed at 675 V, 400 Ω, 25 µF, and 1 mm cuvette width. Afterward, the cells were flushed out with 1 mL YM medium and moved to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube with a small hole in the lid. After incubation at 30°C and 1,000 rpm for 5 h, the cell suspension was mixed with 3 mL YM soft agar, containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin, and the mixture was distributed on a YM agar plate containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin. Slightly red, spherical transformants could be observed after 10–14 days of cultivation at 30°C. Crude extract generation for analytical purposes Frozen or freeze-dried pellets from small-scale cultivations were suspended in 40 or 80 mL methanol and stirred at 250 rpm at room temperature for 2 h. The supernatant was decanted into a round flask through a 125-µm folded filter. The solvent and potential residual water were removed on a rotary evaporator with a water bath temperature of 40°C at appropriate pressures. The dried extract was dissolved/resuspended in 1,100 µL MeOH/100 mL cultivation volume. The crude extract was stored at −20°C until further analysis. For the purpose of UHPLC-hrMS analysis, the crude extract was diluted 1:5 with methanol and centrifuged at 21,500 × g and 4°C (HIMAC CT15RE, Koki Holdings Co.) for 5 min to remove residual insolubilities such as salts, cell debris, and XAD fragments. Standardized UHPLC-MS conditions UPLC-hrMS analysis was performed on a Dionex (Germering, Germany) Ultimate 3000 RSLC system using a Waters (Eschborn, Germany) BEH C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) equipped with a Waters VanGuard BEH C18 1.7 µm guard column. Separation of 1 µL sample was achieved by a linear gradient from (A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid (FA) to (B) ACN + 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 600 µL/min and a column temperature of 45°C. Gradient conditions for crude extract analysis were as follows: 0–0.5 min, 5% B; 0.5–18.5 min, 5%–95% B; 18.5–20.5 min, 95% B; 20.5–21 min, 95%–5% B; and 21–22.5 min, 5% B. Following gradient conditions were applied to monitor angiolams during purification: 0–0.5 min, 5% B; 0.5–9.5 min, 5%–95% B; 9.5–10.5 min, 95% B; 10.5–11 min, 95%–5% B; and 11–12.5 min, 5% B. UV spectra were recorded by a DAD in the range from 200 to 600 nm. The LC flow was split to 75 µL/min before entering the Bruker Daltonics maXis 4G hrToF mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) equipped with an Apollo II ESI source. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode ranging from 150 to 2,500 m/z at a 2 Hz full scan rate. Mass spectrometry source parameters were set to 500 V as end plate offset; 4,000 V as capillary voltage; nebulizer gas pressure 1 bar; dry gas flow of 5 L/min; and a dry temperature of 200°C. Ion transfer and quadrupole settings were set to funnel RF 350 Vpp; multipole RF 400 Vpp as transfer settings and ion energy of 5 eV as well as a low mass cut of 300 m/z. The collision cell was set to 5.0 eV and pre-pulse storage time was set to 5 μs. The spectra acquisition rate was set to 2 Hz. Calibration was done automatically before every LC-MS run by injection of a sodium formate solution and calibration on the respective sodium formate clusters formed in the ESI source. All MS analyses were acquired in the presence of the lock masses (C12H19F12N3O6P3, C18H19O6N3P3F2, and C24H19F36N3O6P3), which generate the [M + H]+ ions of 622.0289, 922.0098, and 1221.9906. Statistics-based metabolome filtering For statistical metabolomics analysis, both the myxobacterial culture and medium blanks were incubated and extracted in triplicates as described above. Each extract was measured as a technical duplicate, giving a total number of six replicates each for the bacterial culture and medium blank extracts. T-ReX-3D molecular feature finder of MetaboScape 2022b (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) was used to obtain molecular features. Detection parameters were set to an intensity threshold of 5 × 103 and a minimum peak length of five spectra to ensure a precursor selection that has a sufficient intensity to generate tandem MS data. Identification of bacterial features was performed with the built-in ANOVA/t-test routine and filtered to appearance in all six bacterial extracts and in none of the medium blank extracts. The t-test table was used to create a scheduled precursor list (SPL) for UHPLC-tandem MS analysis (28). Acquisition parameters for high-resolution tandem MS data LC and MS conditions for SPL-guided MS/MS data acquisitions were kept constant according to section standardized UHPLC-hrMS conditions. MS/MS data acquisition parameters were set to exclusively fragment scheduled precursor list entries. SPL tolerance parameters for precursor ion selection were set to 0.2 min and 0.05 m/z in the SPL MS/MS method. The method picked up to two precursors per cycle, applied smart exclusion after five spectra, and performed CID and MS/MS spectra acquisition time ramping. CID Energy was ramped from 35 eV for 500 m/z to 45 eV for 1,000 m/z and 60 eV for 2,000 m/z. MS full scan acquisition rate was set to 2 Hz, and MS/MS spectra acquisition rates were ramped from 1 to 4 Hz for precursor ion intensities of 10–1,000 kcts. Parameters for feature-based molecular networking All supporting feature-based molecular networking data presented here were created based on the UHPLC-hrMS² chromatograms using the parameters specified in the previous section. All molecular features were obtained by Metaboscape 2022b, with the same parameters as in Statistics-based metabolome filtering, and the respective MS/MS spectra were detected by the built-in “extract MS/MS data” function. The resulting output files were exported with the built-in “Export for GNPS/Sirius” function and uploaded to the GNPS server at the University of California San Diego via FileZilla FTP upload to ftp:// ccms-ftp01.ucsd.edu and all acquired SPL MS/MS spectra were used for feature-based network creation (29). A molecular network was created using the online workflow at GNPS. The data were filtered by removing all MS/MS peaks within ±17 Da of the precursor m/z. MS/MS spectra were window filtered by choosing only the top six peaks in the ±50 Da window throughout the spectrum. The data were then clustered with a parent mass tolerance of 0.02 Da and an MS/MS fragment ion tolerance of 0.02 Da to create consensus spectra. No further filtering of consensus spectra was done before spectral network creation. A network was then created where edges are filtered to have a cosine score above 0.7 and more than six matched peaks. Further edges between two nodes were kept in the network if and only if each of the nodes appeared in each other’s respective top 10 most similar nodes (29). Furthermore, library search parameters were set to a cosine of 0.7 and a minimum of six matched peaks. Library searches included analogs with mass differences up to 200 Da. The data set was downloaded from the server and subsequently visualized using Cytoscape 3.9.1. Extraction and liquid/liquid partitioning Extraction and liquid/liquid partitioning of cultures of MCy12733 in different production media were done with 100 mL of the respective solvents per 10 g freeze-dried pellet. Freeze-dried pellets were extracted four times with a 1:1 mixture of methanol and acetone. For each extraction step, the suspension was stirred at 250 rpm for 30 min and decanted through glass wool and a 125-µm folded filter. The combined extracts were dried using a rotary evaporator at 40°C water bath temperature and appropriate pressures. The dried extract was then dissolved/resuspended in a 95:5 mixture of methanol and water and defatted three times with hexane. Finally, the defatted extract was partitioned three times between water and chloroform. The angiolam derivatives were retained in the chloroform phase. The chloroform phase was concentrated, moved to glass vials, dried, and stored at −20°C. Pre-purification by reverse phase flash chromatography Reverse phase flash chromatography was carried out using the Isolera One (Biotage). Versa Flash Spherical C18 silica 45–75 μm, 70 Å in a 25 g SNAP column (Biotage) was used as the stationary phase, and H2O (A) and MeOH (B) were used as the mobile phase. Flow rate was 25 mL/min, fractions of 45 mL were collected in glass tubes and solvent volume was measured in column volumes (CV); 1 CV = 33 mL. After equilibration of the system with 3 CV of 50% B, ~300 µg sample was loaded on the column using vacuum-dried iSolute beads (Biotage). The conditions were kept at 50% B for 2 CV, followed by an increase to 80% B over 30 CV, a ramp to 100% B over 5 CV, and a flushing step at 100% B for 5 CV. Fractions were pooled according to the abundance of angiolam derivatives, dried, and stored in glass vials at −20°C. Purification of angiolams A, B, and F Purification of angiolams A (1), B (2), and F (5), as well as a mixture of angiolam C (3) and D (4a/4b) from the respective pooled flash chromatography fractions, was carried out on the Waters Autopurifier (Eschborn, Germany) high-pressure gradient system. Separation was carried out on a Waters X-Bridge prep C-18 5 µm, 150 × 19 mm column using H2O + 0.1% FA (A) and ACN + 0.1% FA (B) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 25 mL/min. Separation was started with 5% B for 1 min, followed by a ramp to 40% B over 2 min and an increase to 70% B over 22 min. The column was then flushed with a ramp to 95% B over 2 min, brought back to 5% B within 1 min, and re-equilibrated at 5% for 2 min. Purified angiolams A (1), B (2), and F (5) were dried with a rotary evaporator, moved to glass vials, freeze-dried, and stored at −20°C. Purification of angiolams C and D The mixture of angiolams (3) and D (4a/4b) was separated on a Waters Prep 15 SFC System equipped with a 5 µm Torus Diol 130 Å OBD Prep Column 250 × 19 mm (Waters) thermostated at 50°C. Separation was achieved by following multistep gradient of methanol as a co-solvent to the supercritical CO2. A ramp of 5%–11% co-solvent within 1 min was followed by an increase to 17% over 18 min to separate angiolams (3) and D (4a/4b). Afterward, the column was flushed with an increase of 20% co-solvent for 1 min, the co-solvent was decreased to 5% within 0.5 min, and the system was re-equilibrated at 5% co-solvent for 2.5 min. The flow rate was set to 15 mL/min, make-up flow to 3 mL/min, and backpressure to 120 bar. NMR-based structure elucidation The chemical structures of angiolam derivatives were determined via multidimensional NMR analysis. 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) or 700 MHz (1H) and 175 MHz (13C) conduction using an Avance III (Ultrashield) 500 MHz spectrometer or an Avance III (Ascend) 700 MHz spectrometer, respectively, both equipped with a cryogenically cooled triple resonance probe (Bruker Biospin Rheinstetten, Germany). All observed chemical shift values (δ) are given in ppm and coupling constant values (J) in Hz. Standard pulse programs were used for HMBC, HSQC, and gCOSY experiments. HMBC experiments were optimized for 2,3JC-H = 6 Hz. The spectra were recorded in chloroform-d, and chemical shifts of the solvent signals at δH 7.27 ppm and δC 77.0 ppm were used as reference signals for spectra calibration. To increase sensitivity, the measurements were conducted in a 5 mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi Inc., Allison Park, PA, USA). The NMR signals are grouped in the tables in the supplemental material and correspond to the numbering in the schemes corresponding to every table. In vitro antiparasitic activity assays In vitro activity assays against a panel of protozoal parasites, namely Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (STIB 900), Trypanosoma cruzi (Tulahuen C4), Leishmania donovani (MHOM/ET/67/L82), and Plasmodium falciparum (NF54), and cytotoxicity tests against mammalian cells (L6-cell line from rat-skeletal myoblasts) were performed according to previously described methods (2, 3). All assays were performed in at least three independent replicates.
