In order to quantify APV production, strains were cultivated in liquid 5b-medium (per liter demineralized water: solution A: 2.6 g KH2PO4, 5.5 g Na2HPO4, 2.5 g NH4Cl, 1.0 g Na2SO4; solution B: 0.1 g MgCl2·6 H2O, 0.01 g FeSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g MnSO4·4H2O, 8.8 g glucose; solution A and B were autoclaved separately and then mixed together) at 10, 18, or 28°C for 48 h. Agar diffusion assays (bioassays) Indicator strain E. amylovora Ea7 was cultivated in liquid St1 medium overnight at 28°C. Bacterial suspension was adjusted to OD578nm = 1 with sterile water, and 2 mL of this adjusted suspension was added to 48 mL 5b agar medium preincubated at 48°C and poured into sterile plates (120 mm). Pa48b mutants were spotted directly in this bioassay, incubated at 28°C for 24–48 h, and then analyzed. APV concentration supernatants derived from liquid cultures of P. agglomerans grown at 10, 18, and 28°C were filter sterilized, and then were quantified by applying 50 μL into holes (Ø 0.9 cm) in freshly prepared agar diffusion plates with E. amylovora Ea7 as the indicator strain. Inhibition zones were read after a 24-h incubation at 28°C. APV amounts were determined from a standard curve which was generated using purified APV in a range from 0.0064 to 1.6 mg/mL. The resulting standard curve is defined by the equation y = 0.6383ln(x) + 3.7575. Experiments were repeated three times with comparable results. DNA manipulation APV-negative mutants were constructed by transposon mutagenesis with the mini-Tn5 donor plasmid pRL27 (Larsen et al. 2002). Kanamycin-resistant mutants were screened on agar diffusion assays for their growth inhibition activity. Transposon insertions were analyzed as described previously (Larsen et al. 2002). Transposon insertion sites were subcloned by plasposon rescue cloning and the flanking regions were sequenced by GATC-Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). Self-formed adaptor PCR (SEFA-PCR) was used to close gaps in the sequence of the biosynthesis cluster, and to analyze sequences upstream and downstream of the gene cluster (Wang et al. 2009). For alignments, Vector NTI 9.0 AlignX (Invitrogen, Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. Southern blots were performed as described previously (Sambook et al. 1989) using a digoxigenin (DIG) DNA labeling and luminescent detection kit (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). A DIG-labeled DNA probe was prepared from a PCR amplification product carrying a 0.5-kb fragment of apvD gene from Pa48b. Hybridizations were carried out using a hybridization temperature of 60°C and two 10-min washes with 0.1× SSC (1× SSC consists of 0.15 mol/L NaCl plus 0.015 mol/L sodium citrate) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 60°C. Megaplasmids were prepared as described previously (Heringa et al. 2007). In planta experiments Soybean plant experiments Young trifoliate leaves of 14- to 18-day-old greenhouse-grown soybean plants (cv. Maple Arrow) were used for the in planta assays. Plants were kept in a growth chamber with a 14-h or 10-h photo period (26 or 20°C) and a 10-h or 14-h dark period (20 or 12°C), respectively. Cell suspensions of P. agglomerans (Pa39b; Pa48b) or of the mutant (Pa48b-C1) and Psg 8/83 (106 cfu/mL in distilled water supplemented with 0.001% Tween80) were prepared. Each cell suspension of the strains was mixed with the cell suspension of Psg at a ratio of 5:1. As control, the suspensions of P. agglomerans and Psg were separately mixed with sterile water in the same ratio. The leaflets were inoculated by a pin–prick technique (May et al. 1997). After inoculation, the development of the bacterial populations was monitored after 16 h, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days. Every treatment was performed on different plants with three plants per treatment. At each sampling day, three leaflets from the three different plants were sampled. Ten spots from each leaflet were cut out. The 30 spots were bulked and bacteria were isolated as previously described (May et al. 1997). Experiments were repeated three times. In planta assays with purified APV were conducted as described previously (Braun et al. 2010). APV was purified as described previously (Sammer et al. 2009). Three days after pin–prick inoculation of soybean leaves with Psg, 5 μL of APV solution (0.7, 7.0, and 20.0 μg diluted in water, and water as control per wound) was dropped onto the infected wounds. This procedure was repeated on days 6 and 10 after Psg inoculation. For each concentration, 15 wounds on three different leaves and plants were investigated. Bacterial populations were determined before the first treatment with APV, and always 1 day after treatment. An additional sample was taken 20 days after Psg inoculation to assess the effect after an extended time period. Apple blossom experiments Newly opened apple blossoms were collected from greenhouse trees (cultivar “Alkmene”). Each detached blossom was placed in a well of a plastic tube rack filled with sterile tap water. After inoculation of the apple blossoms, these racks were placed in humid chambers and these were put into a climate chamber with an alternating 14-h light period (24°C) and a 10-h dark period (16°C). The detached apple blossoms were inoculated by placing a 5 μL droplet of a bacterial suspension on the receptacle. The bacterial suspensions consisted of E. amylovora Ea7 or Ea1/79 (5 × 103 cfu/blossom) and Pa48b or its APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1 (1 × 104 cfu/blossom) for coinoculation treatment. Single inoculation with E. amylovora Ea7 or Ea1/79 (5 × 103 cfu/blossom), Pa48b or its APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1 (1 × 104 cfu/blossom), and water were conducted as controls. The development of the bacterial population was evaluated after 5 days. For each treatment, 10 flowers were separately washed with 1 mL NaCl (0.9%) and colony-forming units were determined by plating. The experiment was repeated three times. Immature pear slice assays Walnut-sized pears were obtained from pear trees of the cultivar “Williams.” Pears were surface sterilized in ethanol (70%) and sliced. Slices were washed in bacterial suspensions of P. agglomerans Pa48b, Pa48b-C1, or Pa39b (108 cfu/mL) and placed in petri dishes. After 2 h of drying, 10 μL of a suspension of E. amylovora Ea7 or Ea1/79 (5–5 × 103 cfu/μL) was dropped onto the slices and incubated for 6 days at 18°C. Each treatment was performed with 20 biological replicates. After incubation, the slices were evaluated for their bacterial ooze formation and necrosis in a plus/minus rating (Beer et al. 1984). Statistical analysis Data management and computation were performed using Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). The mean values and the standard deviations were calculated and statistically compared by t-test using SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat Software, Inc.).
