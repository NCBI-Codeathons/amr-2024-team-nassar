Materials and methods Strains and growth conditions Strains of polyyne-producing bacteria used in this study (Figure 1 and Table 1) were obtained from the Cardiff University Burkholderia culture collection (Mullins et al., 2020) and other recognised strain repositories [The Belgium Co-ordinated Collections of Microorganisms/Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Universiteit Gent (BCCM/LMG); The Burkholderia cepacia Research Laboratory and Repository (BcRLR; Lipuma, 2010); Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH (DSMZ)] and stored at −80°C in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB; Oxoid™) containing 8% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich). Cultures were revived onto Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA; Oxoid™) in Petri dishes and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Bacterial cultures were routinely streaked to single colonies on TSA to check for purity. Overnight liquid cultures were prepared by inoculating 5 mL of TSB with confluent growth from a fresh TSA plate, incubated at 30°C on a rocking platform (150 rpm) and used as bacterial inoculum in specialised metabolite induction, in vitro antagonism, and biocontrol assays.

Polyynes detected by HPLC on agar solidified BSMG or PEM after growth at 22°C for 3 days. Known metabolites in strain or presence of a recognised biosynthetic gene cluster. Bold font indicates metabolites were detected by HPLC on BSMG or PEM after growth at 22°C for 3 days in this study. Reference(s) for strain isolation source and/or identification of known BGCs. BSMG, basal salts medium with glycerol; PEM, pea seed exudate medium; 2,4-DAPG, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol; HCN, hydrogen cyanide. Insertional mutants Burkholderia ambifaria BCC0191::ccnJ (Mullins et al., 2019) and Burkholderia gladioli BCC1697::cayA (Jones et al., 2021) with their respective fatty acyl-AMP ligase-encoding gene disrupted from the polyyne BGC were maintained as above, with the exception that 50 μg mL−1 trimethoprim was included in the media. G. ultimum var. ultimum MUCL 16164 was obtained from BCCM/MUCL (Mycothèque de l’Université Catholique de Louvain) collection and grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Oxoid™) plates at 22°C. For long term storage, cultures were maintained on PDA slants at 4°C. Bioinformatic analysis Polyyne BGC architecture figures were visualised using Clinker v0.0.21 (Gilchrist and Chooi, 2021), and metabolite structures created with ChemDraw Professional 16. BGC relatedness was then demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis. The amino acid sequence of the fatty acyl-AMP ligase present in every polyyne BGC was aligned using MAFFT v7.505 (Katoh and Standley, 2013), and a phylogenetic tree constructed with RAxML-NG v1.0.3 (Kozlov et al., 2019) using the LG + G8 + F model with 100 bootstraps. Specialised metabolite induction media Production of polyynes and other specialised metabolites were induced from bacteria by growing them at 22°C on two different media. Basal salts medium supplemented with glycerol (BSMG) as previously described (Mahenthiralingam et al., 2011; Webster et al., 2020a) and pea seed exudate medium (PEM; Mullins et al., 2021; Petrova et al., 2022). PEM was designed as a biomimetic medium to represent nutrient conditions during pea seed germination and was made as follows. Early Onward variety Pisum sativum seeds (approx. 100 g) were washed three times with deionised water, and then suspended in ultrapure water made up to 500 mL. Seeds were incubated in the dark with agitation (40 rpm on a rocking platform) for 2 d at 22°C. After incubation, seed exudate was removed and filtered twice. First with a Whatman® glass microfibre GF/D grade filter to remove seed coat material, and second with a Whatman® glass microfibre GF/A grade filter to obtain a clear seed exudate. The filtered seed exudate was diluted with ultrapure water at a 1:1 ratio and mixed with 1.5% (w/v) purified agar (Oxoid™) prior to autoclaving. Specialised metabolite detection by HPLC Detection of specialised metabolites was conducted according to the rapid screening method described previously (Webster et al., 2020a). In brief, bacterial strains were streaked onto 20 mL BSMG or PEM agar plates in duplicate, and incubated for 3 d at 22°C. Following incubation bacterial growth was removed from the agar surface, and a 20 mm diameter disc cut from the centre of the plate. The agar disc was placed into a 30 mL wide-mouth amber glass bottle with 0.5 mL dichloromethane and agitated on a rocking platform (40 rpm) for 2 h. Dichloromethane extracts were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Waters® AutoPurification™ HPLC system fitted with a reversed-phase analytical column (Waters® XSelect CSH C18, 4.6 × 100 mm, 5 μm) and a C18 SecurityGuard™ cartridge (Phenomenex) in series. Detection of compounds was by absorbance at 210–400 by a photo-diode array detector (PDA). Mobile phases consisted of (A) water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Elution conditions were as follows: 0–1 min, 95% phase A/ 5% phase B; 1–9 min, gradient of phase A from 95 to 5% and gradient of phase B from 5 to 95%; 10 to 11 min, 5% phase A / 95% phase B; 11–15 min, 95% phase A / 5% phase B. Known specialised metabolites were identified by HPLC peak retention times and UV absorbance characteristics, and by referencing these to internal standards characterised by High Resolution Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as described (Mahenthiralingam et al., 2011; Song et al., 2017; Mullins et al., 2019; Webster et al., 2020a; Jones et al., 2021). Purified pyrrolnitrin (Sigma-Aldrich) and tropolone (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as additional standards to confirm HPLC detection and peak retention times for these specialised metabolites. Peak heights were calculated using MassLynx V4.1 software.1 In vitro microbial antagonism assays Antagonism assays for polyyne-producing bacteria were performed against a panel of susceptibility organisms: Pectobacterium carotovorum LMG 2464 (Gram-negative bacterium), Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 12981 (Firmicutes Gram-positive bacterium), Clavibacter michiganensis DSM 46364 (Actinobacteria Gram-positive bacterium), and Candida albicans SC 5314 (fungus) as described (Mahenthiralingam et al., 2011; Mullins et al., 2019; Webster et al., 2020b). In brief, polyyne-producing bacterial strains were grown overnight at 30°C in TSB, spotted (2.0 μL bacteria) onto BSMG or PEM agar plates and incubated at 22°C for 3 d. Polyyne-producing bacteria were then killed by chloroform exposure for 3 min, overlaid with susceptibility organism-seeded (0.4% [v/v] bacteria) half-strength iso-sensitest agar (Oxoid™) and the overlay plate incubated at 30°C or 37°C for 24 h. The diameter of the inhibition zone was then measured through the centre of the polyyne-producing bacterium. The mean inhibition zone was calculated from two plates per treatment. In vitro Globisporangium ultimum inhibition assay Polyyne-producing bacterial strains were grown overnight at 30°C in TSB, spotted (5.0 μL bacteria) onto BSMG and PEM agar plates as four evenly spaced drops, allowed to dry and incubated at 22°C. After 24 h incubation, a 5.0 mm diameter plug of leading-edge growth of G. ultimum was placed in the centre of the four bacterial spots and the plates incubated again at 22°C for a further 48 h. The distance between the leading-edge of G. ultimum and the centre of each bacterial colony was measured, and the mean inhibition zone calculated for each treatment. Biological control assays Globisporangium ultimum infested soil (a non-sterile potting mix) was prepared as previously described (Mullins et al., 2019). Briefly, a fresh PDA plate (90 mm diameter) was inoculated with a 5.0 mm diameter PDA plug of G. ultimum, and incubated at 22°C for 3 d. The agar was cut into 1.0 cm2 squares, added to 120 g potting mix composed of 5-parts generic compost (Levington Advance Pot and Bedding M2; ICL UK) and 1-part sand (Horticultural Sharp Sand, Melcourt Industries Ltd), and incubated at 22°C for 3 d. The G. ultimum infested potting mix was combined with fresh potting mix to achieve a 0.25% (w/w) infested soil. Pisum sativum seeds were either planted in G. ultimum infested soil or control un-infested potting mix contained within recycled pipette tip boxes (Starlab (UK), Ltd.). Each treatment consisted of 16 pea seeds split between two boxes with 200 g potting mix per box. Polyyne-producing bacterial seed coats were prepared by growing overnight liquid cultures in TSB at 30°C. Bacterial cultures were washed, resuspended, and concentrated in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). The concentrated bacterial suspension was diluted to allow optical density measurement on a spectrophotometer (Jenway 6300 Visible Spectrophotometer) and then adjusted to 5.0 OD600 nm, equivalent to approx. 1 × 109 cfu (colony forming units) mL−1. Seeds were submerged in the bacterial suspension resulting in a standardised coating of approximately 107 cfu ml−1 per seed (as demonstrated in Mullins et al., 2019), immediately planted, and watered with 30 mL deionised water. Plants were grown at 22°C in propagators to maintain high humidity and placed in a Fitotron® plant growth chamber set at 16:8 h photoperiod and 40% relative humidity for 14 d. All bacterial strains were assayed for biocontrol potential in a minimum of 2 experiments (at least 2 × 16 seeds per treatment), along with uninoculated seeds (PBS only) and Burkholderia ambifaria BCC0191 coated seeds as controls in every experiment. Treatments were assessed over 12 independent experiments (Table 2) due to restrictions in growth chamber capacity. Biocontrol experiments to test polyyne-producing bacteria efficacy to control damping-off disease of Pisum sativum.

Experiments 11 and 12 were used to compile data shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Means were calculated on data from different experiments after Levene’s test showed that the variances for protection between treatments (using BCC1697 and BCC0191) was not significantly different, F(1,12) = 0.28, p = 0.606. Burkholderia ambifaria root colonisation and soil persistence assays The ability of three B. ambifaria strains (BCC0191, BCC1237, and BCC1259) to colonise the root system of P. sativum was assessed. Seeds were coated with bacterial cell suspensions of approximately 1 × 109 cfu mL−1 and planted in potting mix as described above. Following 7 d of growth, the seedlings were removed and the first 2 cm segment of root from the seed was excised. This root section was macerated with a pestle in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL PBS and serially diluted in PBS. Serial dilutions were plated onto Burkholderia cepacia selective agar (BCSA, Oxoid™) and incubated overnight at 37°C to determine the B. ambifaria cfu per root section. To assess soil persistence, 10 μL of approximately 1 × 109 cfu mL−1 of each B. ambifaria strain (BCC0191, BCC1237, and BCC1259) was added to 1 g of hydrated potting mix (50% water content) in 25 mL sterile universal bottles. Each treatment was replicated six times, and initially three replicates per strain were serially diluted in PBS to determine the recoverable cfu g−1 at day 0. The remaining inoculated potting mix samples were incubated at 22°C for 7 d. Following incubation each 1 g of potting mix was serially diluted in PBS and plated onto BCSA to calculate the remaining cfu g−1. Control samples (no added bacteria) were also set-up and treated as described above. No Burkholderia growth was identified on BCSA from all control samples. Expression analysis of cepacin biosynthetic gene cluster during Pisum sativum colonisation The relative expression of the cepacin BGC across three B. ambifaria strains (BCC0191, BCC1237, and BCC1259) was determined by reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR. P. sativum seeds were coated with B. ambifaria and grown in potting mix as described above or on Whatman® filter paper grade 1 soaked in ultrapure water. Following 3 d of growth the seedlings were removed and 1 cm of root was excised, macerated, and pooled from three seedlings per treatment. Total RNA was extracted from the pooled samples using the FastRNA™ Pro Soil-Direct Kit (MP Biomedicals) and DNase I (RNase-free; New England Biolabs) treated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR was performed using the OneTaq® One-Step RT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s protocols. PCR primers were designed to target one of the polyyne-associated desaturase genes in the cepacin BGC [ccnN; (Mullins et al., 2019)] and amplify a 514 bp product: Fwd: 5’-CTG TTC TGG GCA GGT ACG TT-3′ and Rev.: 5′-TGT CGT AGA AGT GGC AGT GG-3′. Thermal cycler conditions for RT-PCR were as follows: RT at 48°C for 15 min; initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min; 35x cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 68°C for 30 s; then a final extension at 68°C for 5 min. RNA extracted from B. ambifaria BCC0191 grown on BSMG and molecular grade water (Severn Biotech Ltd.) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
