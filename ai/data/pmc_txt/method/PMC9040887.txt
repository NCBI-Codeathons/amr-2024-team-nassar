MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents. DNA oligonucleotides (see Table S4 in the supplemental material) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Escherichia coli K-12 wild-type strain was purchased from the Keio E. coli knockout collection (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare). HED (Streptomyces griseoruber ATCC 23919) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute’s Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI DTP) Open Compound Repository (NSC 70929). Trioxacarcin A (TXNA) was isolated from Streptomyces bottropensis NRRL 12051 as described previously (56). AZB was prepared from organic extract of Streptomyces sahachiroi (ATCC 33158) as in reference 31. NM8 compound was synthesized and purified by the Vanderbilt Molecular Design and Synthesis Center (31). AlkA, AlkC, AlkD, AlkZ, LldU1/5, TxnU2/4, and YcaQ were purified as described previously (30, 31, 52, 56, 74, 75). Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and all enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB). Cellular strains, plasmids, and oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study. All oligonucleotides were dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to 200 μM, and the DNA was stored at −20°C (stored in the dark for the Cy5/FAM oligonucleotides). The underlined nucleotide in the 7mG_Top, HED_Top, TXNA_Top, AZB_Top/_Bottom, and NM8_Top/_Bottom oligonucleotides is the site of the N7-alkylguanine lesion. PCR was performed with a primer concentration of 500 nM. Download Table S4, XLSX file, 0.01 MB. Taxonomy and phylogeny of Streptomyces HTH_42 proteins. To identify HTH_42 proteins in Streptomyces, the protein sequences for YcaQ (GenBank accession number QHB65847.1) and AlkZ (GenBank accession number ABY83174.1) were used for tBLASTn and BLASTp searches (BLAST+ v2.11.0) against all Streptomyces genomes (taxid:1883). Searches were run with the BLOSUM62 matrix, 1,000 maximum target sequences, and 0.05 threshold using an e-value and identity cutoff of 10−4 and 25%, respectively. All hits were verified for the presence of the (H/Q)Φ(D/Q) catalytic motif, during which the (H/Q)Φ(S/T)(D/E) (AZL2) variant was identified. Truncated genes, poor-sequence-quality genes, and pseudogenes were eliminated. Additional sequences were obtained by searching the Pfam database v33.1 (76) for Streptomyces HTH_42 superfamily members (PF06224). Sequences from Pfam were sorted according to their domain classes (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material), and only sequences from class 1 with >75% coverage were included. Protein sequences were aligned using EMBL-EBI Clustal OmegaW or MAFFT v7 using default parameters (77, 78). The evolutionary history of YQL/AZL sequences was reconstructed using IQTREE2 with default settings (79), and the phylogenetic tree was assembled with the Interactive Tree of Life (v5) phylogeny display tool (80). Sequence logos were generated with WebLogo v2.8.2 (81). The copy number frequency and coincidence of YQL/AZL in the same genome was determined by manually counting the number and identity of homologs in each species. A list of all YQL/AZL/AZL2 proteins and Streptomyces genomes analyzed in this study can be found in Table S1. Identification of AZL proteins in known biosynthetic gene clusters. To find AZL proteins in verified and/or published BGCs, we searched MIBiG v2.0 for the AZB BGC (BGC0000960) from S. sahachiroi (27, 82), followed by an iterative search using the MIBiG Hits function until no more hits were obtained. The homologs TxnU2 and TxnU4 were identified from the initial BLAST search within the deposited NCBI trioxacarcin BGC sequence (83). The homolog within the aclacinomycin BGC was also identified in the initial BLAST search as appearing in proximity to aclacinomycin biosynthesis genes. Closer inspection of the published sequence for the aclacinomycin BGC (GenBank accession number AB008466.1) revealed an AZL protein (Orf1) located immediately 3′ of the cluster (84). A detailed list of the AZL proteins in known BGCs can be found in Table S3. Identification of AZL proteins in uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters. To determine the physical distance in base pairs between the genomic coordinates of AZL proteins and those of BGCs present in the genome assemblies of Streptomyces (average number of scaffolds, 96.30; minimum, 1; maximum, 1,956), we first predicted the BGCs in each genome using antiSMASH v5.1.0 (38) with the taxon parameter set to bacteria. Using the BGC sequences identified from antiSMASH and AZL sequences, a custom python script using Biopython (85) determined the shortest base pair distance between the physical location of the YQL/AZL gene and the location of the nearest BGC on the same scaffold (less than 2 Mbp away). To be considered within a BGC, the homolog had to be observed within 5 genes or 2 kb of the nearest cluster. Known Cluster BLAST was performed within antiSMASH to determine the BGC most similar to the unknown clusters, and the result with the highest percentage of similar genes was recorded as the most similar cluster. A detailed list of the genome information, cluster identifiers (IDs), and closest 3′ and/or 5′ BGC can be found in Table S2. Gene ontology analysis. To identify GO terms for nearest neighbors identified through BLAST, Pfam, and MIBiG searches, we randomly chose 40 homologs each of AZL inside BGCs, AZL outside BGCs, and YQL, which represent ∼10% of the sequences for each. Amino acid sequences for the five genes on both sides of the YQL/AZL genes were downloaded from the NCBI database, for a total of 400 neighbors for each of the three classes. Cellular functions of any already annotated genes in the NCBI database were identified and recorded. The downloaded sequences were then run through the GhostKOALA (v2.2) and eggNOG (v5.0) GO annotation databases (86, 87). After known GO terms for all gene neighbors were identified, proteins were categorized by biological processes and molecular functions, and the values for these terms were used to create the GO term distributions. Proteins that had multiple GO terms associated with them were counted into each class of terms. A list of all proteins and their annotated GO terms can be found in Tables S5 and S6. AZL nearest neighbor GO term analysis. Nearest 5 open reading frames (ORFs) upstream (−) (3′→5′) and downstream (+) (5′→3′) of AlkZ-like proteins predicted to be within (A) or outside (B) BGCs. ORFs are listed with their GenBank/RefSeq ID and biological pathway and molecular GO terms, as determined by NCBI, GhostKOALA, and eggNOG databases. Empty cells mean no GO terms could be assigned to these proteins through homology search. Download Table S5, XLSX file, 0.04 MB. YQL nearest neighbor GO term analysis.

Genes encoding Streptomyces caeruleatus AZL2, Streptomyces griseoruber HedH4, Thermomonospora curvata YQL, and Thermobifida fusca YQL were codon optimized and synthesized by GenScript and cloned into pBG102. The N-terminal His6-SUMO fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli Tuner(DE3) cells at 16°C for 18 h in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Clarified lysate was passed over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, and 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) and protein eluted in 250 mM imidazole-buffer A. Protein fractions were pooled and supplemented with 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) before incubation with 0.5 mg rhinovirus 3C protease (PreScission) at 4°C overnight. Cleaved protein was diluted 10-fold in buffer B (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA) and purified by heparin Sepharose using a 0 to 1 M NaCl-buffer B linear gradient. Fractions were pooled and passed over Ni-NTA agarose in buffer A, concentrated and filtered, and buffer exchanged into buffer C (20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA). Protein was concentrated to 4 mg/mL, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Mutant protein expression vectors were generated using the Q5 mutagenesis kit (New England BioLabs), and proteins were overexpressed and purified the same as the wild type. DNA glycosylase activity. DNA substrates containing a single N7-methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine lesion and a 5′-Cy5 fluorophore were prepared as described previously (88). AZB- and NM8-ICL substrates were generated and purified as in reference 31. DNA substrates containing a single HED-guanosine or trioxacarcin A (TXNA)-guanosine adduct were prepared by annealing 5′-Cy5-labeled DNA containing the target sequence to the complementary unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide (Table S4). HED and TXNA were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 5 mM, and 100 μM DNA was incubated with 200 μM HED or TXNA in 10% methanol and 20% DMSO at 4°C on ice in the dark for 24 h. Unreacted drug was removed using an Illustra G-25 spin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the DNA was stored at −80°C. In each glycosylase reaction, 1 μM enzyme was incubated with 50 nM DNA in glycosylase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) at 25°C. At various time points, 4-μL aliquots were added to 1 μL of 1 M NaOH and heated at 70°C for 2 min. Samples were denatured at 70°C for 5 min in 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 80% (wt/vol) formamide, and 1 mg/mL blue dextran prior to electrophoresis on a 20% (wt/vol) acrylamide–8 M urea sequencing gel at 40 W for 1 h in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM borate, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were imaged on a Typhoon Trio variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare) using 633-nm excitation/670-nm emission fluorescence for Cy5, and bands were quantified with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). All excision assays were performed in triplicate. HPLC-MS analysis of HED and HED-guanine. HPLC was performed on an Agilent Series 1100 system equipped with an analytical SymmetryShield RP-C18 column (3.5 μm, 4.6 mm by 7.5 mm, 100-Å pore size) and using a linear gradient from 90% buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate)–10% buffer B (100% methanol) to 100% B over 40 min and a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. HED was diluted to 50 μM in 10% methanol and stored on ice prior to HPLC injection. To analyze the product of HedH4 activity, HED-DNA was diluted to 10 μM in glycosylase buffer and reacted with 50 μM HedH4 for 1 h at room temperature before injection. Mass spectrometry was performed with an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in positive ion mode from 300 to 1,000 m/z. Cellular assays for HED resistance. The hedH4 wild-type gene was subcloned from pBG102 into pSF-OXB1 using NcoI and XbaI restriction sites. The pSF-OXB1 vector contains a kanamycin resistance gene and allows for constitutive low-level expression from a modified AraBAD promoter. pSF-OXB1 and HedH4/pSF-OXB1 were transformed into E. coli K-12 cells. Cloning of hedH4 was confirmed by sequencing, restriction digest using NcoI-HF/XbaI (Fig. S4C), and colony PCR of K-12 transformants using the HedH4 NcoI and XbaI primers (Fig. S4D, Table S4). Cultures were grown at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/mL Kan. Growth curves were generated by diluting overnight cultures to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.01 in LB/Kan supplemented with 0 nM to 100 μM HED in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. The plate was incubated at 30°C with shaking for 24 h, and cell density was measured at 600 nm every 20 min using a Bio-Tek Synergy 2 microplate reader. IC50 values were determined from a fit to the equation lag time = minlag + (maxlag − minlag)/[1 + (IC50/[HED])h], where h is the Hill slope. Growth experiments were performed in triplicate. E. coli survival curves after HED treatment were performed using a colony dilution assay. A saturated overnight LB/Kan culture from a single colony was diluted to an OD600 of 0.01 in 1 mL fresh LB/Kan medium and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37°C. The cells were treated with various concentrations of HED for 1 h at 37°C. Treated cells were transferred to fresh LB/Kan medium and serially diluted by 10−6 in LB/Kan medium, and 100 μL of diluted cells was plated on LB/Kan agar plates and grown at 37°C overnight. Colonies were counted the next morning and the number of CFU/mL culture was determined. The percent survival was calculated as CFU/mL (treated) divided by CFU/mL (untreated). Curves were plotted on a logarithmic scale and IC50 values determined by nonlinear regression fits to the data. Growth experiments were performed in triplicate.
