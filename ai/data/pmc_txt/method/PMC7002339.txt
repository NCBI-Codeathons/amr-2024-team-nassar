MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and plasmids. Aspergillus oryzae strain M-2-3, an arginine auxotroph, was obtained from Colin Lazarus (University of Bristol, UK). Monascus ruber strain M7 was previously described (15). Plasmids pEYA and pTAYAGSarg3P were propagated in Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) as the host. Gateway destination vectors were propagated in E. coli
ccdB Survival 2 T1R cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant M. ruber and A. oryzae strains are listed in Table S1 (19). Primers used in plasmid construction are listed in Table S2 (19). Media and cultivation. E. coli was grown at 37°C in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. A. oryzae strains were routinely cultivated at 28°C in CMP (3.5% Czapek Dox broth, 2% maltose, 1% Polypepton) for 5 days with shaking at 200 rpm and were inoculated (1% [vol/vol]) from a preculture (a 100-ml overnight culture inoculated with 5 × 107 conidia/ml). M. ruber strains were cultured in PDB medium at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm, and the mycelia were harvested after 12 to 15 days of cultivation. For cocultivation, M. ruber strains were first grown as a monoculture in 100 ml PDB at 30°C for 3 to 4 days with shaking at 200 rpm, and then 5 to 10 ml of a freshly prepared culture of the challenger fungi or bacteria was added. The coculture was further incubated at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm for an additional 3 to 5 days. Challenger fungal cultures were prepared by culturing the appropriate strains in 100 ml PDB medium at 28°C for 2 to 4 days with shaking at 120 rpm. Mycelial pellets were dispersed by vortexing and resuspended in 100 ml fresh PDB. Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in LB medium at 37°C for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Qiagen) from mycelial samples that were prefrozen and ground to a fine powder. The resulting RNA samples were checked for purity (optical density ratio at 260 and 290 nm [OD260/280] of 1.8 to 2.2) and integrity (observation of two sharp bands for the ribosomal RNAs [rRNA] of the large and the small ribosomal subunits, with the intensity of the larger band approximately twice that of the smaller band). cDNA synthesis was performed in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing approximately 1 μg of total RNA, using the PrimeScript RT master mix (TaKaRa) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. qRT-PCR was performed using 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 5.0 μl SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (1×, TaKaRa), 0.4 μl of each primer (400 nM each), 0.4 μl ROX reference dye, and 1.0 μl of cDNA sample. A two-step thermal profile (step 1, 95°C for 10 s, and step 2, 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 25 s) was used on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed using the StepOne software (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems). The cycle number at which the fluorescence passed the cycle threshold (CT) was used for the quantitation of the expression level. Relative expression levels for each target cDNA were obtained by the 2−ΔΔCT method via normalization to β-actin (GenBank accession no. AJ417880), using the formula 2−(CT
target −
CT
actin). Controls with no added template were used to exclude the possibility that primer-dimer formation interfered with the calculations. Expression of biosynthetic genes in A. oryzae. The intron-free mrpigA polyketide synthase gene was amplified from M. ruber M7 cDNA as three overlapping fragments using primer pairs mrpigA-1-F/mrpigA-1-R, mrpigA-2-F/mrpigA-2-R, and mrpigA-3-F/mrpigA-3-R (Table S2 [19]). The resulting fragments were reassembled in the pEYA vector by homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741. The cloned mrpigA gene was then transferred to pTAYAGSarg3P by Gateway LR recombination (Invitrogen) to create pTAYAGSarg3P-mrpigA. In this vector, the mrpigA gene was under the control of the PamyB promoter and the TamyB terminator. Genes encoding tailoring enzymes were amplified from M. ruber M7 cDNA using primers (Table S2 [19]) that overlap the 3′ end of the appropriate promoter (Padh or Peno) or the 5′ end of the corresponding terminator (Tadh or Teno), respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pTAYAGSarg3P-mrpigA using the HiEff Clone One Step PCR cloning kit (Yeasen). After transformation of A. oryzae M-2-3 with the recombinant plasmids (Table S1 [19]), three to five independent isolates were evaluated for metabolite production for each recombinant strain. Protein extraction and purification. Genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes with an added N-terminal 6×His tag were cloned into the pTAYAGSarg3P vector and placed under the control of the PamyB promoter and the TamyB terminator. Plasmids were transformed into A. oryzae M-2-3 (Table S1 [19]). Recombinant A. oryzae strains were cultivated in CMP medium for 2 days with shaking at 200 rpm at 28°C and induced with 0.5% (wt/vol) maltose every day during continued growth for 3 days with shaking at 200 rpm at 28°C. Protein was purified as previous work reported with modifications (3). The mycelia were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by high-pressure homogenization with a French press in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Crude MrPigA protein extracts were filtered using a 0.22-μm cellulose nitrate membrane (Millipore) and then ultrafiltered (Millipore) to remove proteins with molecular weights less than 100 kDa. Crude protein extracts with MrPigC, MrPigH, or MrPigN were also clarified using a 0.22-μm cellulose nitrate membrane (Millipore), but the flowthrough fraction was collected during ultrafiltration (100 kDa cutoff; Millipore). The ultrafiltered protein extracts were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% to 90%) during overnight incubation at 4°C and then centrifuged, and the pellet was solubilized in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0). The resulting protein solution was clarified again by centrifugation, and the His-tagged enzymes were purified via Ni affinity chromatography (Thermo) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) with 50 mM NaCl and concentrated to greater than 1.0 mg/ml using a centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Protein deglycosylation. Five microliters of the purified protein sample (5 to 10 μg protein), 1.0 μl 10× glycoprotein denaturing buffer, and 4.0 μl water were mixed and then heated at 100°C for 10 min, followed by the addition of 2 μl 10× GlycoBuffer, 6.5 μl H2O, and 1.5 μl Endo H (NEB). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. In vitro enzymatic reactions. In general, substrates (1.5 mM each, final concentration) were dissolved in 150 μl HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0), and the reaction was started by adding 50 μl of the enzyme solution (10 μM, final concentration). Glycosylated enzymes were used for the reactions, as deglycosylated enzymes showed no improvements in their activities. After incubation at 30°C with shaking at 100 rpm for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl H2SO4 (1.0 M). Cosubstrates used for the MrPigA reaction were as follows (final concentrations): malonyl-CoA (10.0 mM), acetyl-CoA (3.0 mM), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM; 3.0 mM), NADPH (3.0 mM), and NADP (sodium salt, 3 mM). Reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN used cosubstrates as above. Reactions with MrPigC used NADPH (10 mM) as the cosubstrate. Enzymatic reactions with total protein extracts from M. ruber ΔmrpigC were performed as with MrPigC but with MrPigC replaced by the clarified lysate of the strain (50 μl). Reactions with MrPigH used NADPH (10 mM) as the cosubstrate and were conducted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. For anaerobic reactions, nitrogen was bubbled through the buffer solution for 1 h after degassing under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture was carefully flushed with nitrogen and stirred for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. For all reactions, the remaining substrate and the reaction product(s) were extracted with 200 μl of a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) three times, and the pooled organic phase was dried under a nitrogen stream, dissolved in 200 μl high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade methanol and analyzed by HPLC and NMR. Quantitative assays were repeated three times with three technical replicates each (n = 9). Qualitative assays were performed using three biological replicates. Extraction of metabolites. Mycelia of M. ruber strains were collected after cultivation for 12 to 14 days, while A. oryzae mycelia were harvested at day 5. Wet mycelia (100 g) were disrupted in a French press by high-pressure homogenization, acidified with 37% HCl to a pH less than 4.0, and extracted three times with 50 ml each of a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) by vigorous shaking for 1 h. The pooled organic fraction was dried on a rotary evaporator, and the crude extract was dissolved in 5 ml HPLC-grade methanol. Isolation of compounds. Compounds were isolated by HPLC on a Shimadzu autopurification system equipped with a supplementary L-10AP autosampler, an LC-6AD pump system, an SPD-M20A detector, and a Shim-pack C18 column (5.0 μm, 20 mm by 250 mm). The following gradient profile of solvents A and B was used at a column temperature of 30°C and at a flow rate of 20 ml/min: 0 to 5 min, 60% A; 5 to 25 min, 60% to 5% A; 25 to 30 min, 5% A; 30 to 35 min, 5% to 35% A; and 35 to 40 min, 50% A. The mobile phase solvent A was HPLC-grade water, and solvent B was HPLC-grade acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Detected peaks were collected in glass test tubes. The purified fractions were freeze-dried to completely remove the solvent. The purified compounds were subjected to HRMS/MS and NMR analyses. HPLC, HRMS, and NMR analyses. Analysis for metabolites was carried out using a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with an SPD-M20A photodiode array detector and a supplementary L-20A autosampler and managed by a LabSolutions LC Workstation (Shimadzu). The analytes were separated on an Inertsil ODS-3 C18 column (5.0 μm, 4.6 mm by 250 mm; Shimadzu) operating at 30°C, and compounds were detected at 280 nm. The mobile phase solvents A and B were water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.05% phosphoric acid. Gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min was performed as follows: 0 to 25 min, 85% to 30% A; 25 to 30 min, 30% to 5% A; 30 to 31 min, 5% to 85% A; 31 to 35 min, 85% A. High-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry were conducted on a Thermo Q Exactive Plus. 1H and 13C NMR was conducted on a Varian Mercury Plus 400 NMR spectrometer. The compounds 5, 7a, and 7b were characterized in our previous work (15). Antimicrobial susceptibility assays. The MICs of selected compounds against fungal and bacterial strains were determined using the broth microdilution method. Conidial suspensions of fungi were diluted to a final inoculum concentration of 1.0 × 105 to 5.0 × 105 spores/ml and dispensed into microdilution wells. Bacteria were grown on LB medium overnight at 37°C to an OD610 of 1.0 to 1.2 and inoculated (10%) into microdilution wells with fresh LB medium. The final concentrations of the test compounds were 0 to 256 μg/ml. For fungi, the inoculated microdilution trays were incubated at 30°C without shaking, and OD610 was measured on days 5 and 7. For bacteria, the inoculated microdilution trays were incubated at 37°C with shaking at 120 rpm, and OD610 was measured at 24 h. The MIC endpoint was defined as the lowest concentration that led to complete inhibition of growth. Test compounds were purified by semipreparative HPLC and analyzed by HPLC to show a purity of >95%. Assays were repeated three times with three technical replicates each (n = 9). Compound biotransformation with resting cells. A. oryzae M-2-3 was cultivated at 30°C in PDB medium with shaking at 200 rpm for 7 days. Compounds (each at 0.5 mg/liter) were added to mycelial pellets suspended in distilled water and incubated at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm. After incubation, the mycelia were processed by high-pressure homogenization on a GEA Panda2K NS1001L (GEA). The intracellular and extracellular test compounds were extracted by hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) and then analyzed by HPLC and LC-MS. Flux assays. M. ruber M7, ΔmrpigP, and CΔmrpigP strains were cultured at 30°C in 30 ml PDB medium in 250-ml flasks with shaking at 200 rpm for 7 days. The mycelia were dispersed by gentle vortexing with the help of glass beads for 5 min and incubated in PBS (50 mM, pH 5.5) containing the test compound (32 μg/ml, final concentration) at 30°C for 6 h with gentle mixing on a rotating table. The mycelia were washed with PBS (50 mM, pH 5.5) at least three times until the test compound was not detected in the eluent. The resulting mycelia were disrupted by high-pressure homogenization on a GEA Panda2K NS1001L (GEA). The intracellular test compounds were extracted every 2 h by hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) and then analyzed by HPLC. Assays were repeated three times with three technical replicates each (n = 9). Gene knockout in M. ruber M7. Targeted gene knockout and complementation of mrpigP in M. ruber M7 was performed as described in our previous work (15), and validation of the strains is shown in Fig. S7 (19). Data availability. Sequences of the genes mentioned in this article are available in GenBank (15).
