MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively, in the supplemental material. To harvest Streptomyces spores, Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and its derivatives, S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and its derivatives, and S. coelicolor M1146 were grown at 28°C on International Streptomyces Project (ISP) medium 3 agar (44), glucose-yeast extract-malt extract (GYM) agar (25), and MS (2% mannitol, 2% soya flour) agar, respectively. E. coli strains for nucleic acid manipulation were cultured at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. When necessary, antibiotics were added at the following final concentrations: 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 50 μg/mL apramycin or kanamycin, and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol for E. coli and 25 μg/mL apramycin, kanamycin, or nalidixic acid for Streptomyces. Construction of gene disruption and complementation mutants. Nucleic acid manipulations were performed using standard procedures for E. coli (45) and Streptomyces (46) and according to the instructions of the manufacturers of the restriction enzymes and kits. The lasalocid BGC sequences and genome sequences of Streptomyces were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. The Streptomyces mutant strains were constructed from wild-type strains by gene replacement via homologous recombination as previously described (26, 47). For the genetic complementation of lodR1, a DNA fragment carrying the lodR1 ORF was amplified by PCR using primers lodR1-orf-F and lodR1-orf-R (Table S3). The PCR product was gel purified and then ligated with EcoRV-digested pSET152 and a strong constitutive promoter, PkasO*, by Gibson assembly to give plasmid pSET152::PkasO*lodR1C. The recombinant plasmid was subsequently introduced into the lodR1 mutant (ΔlodR1) via conjugation to generate the ΔlodR1C complemented strain. Other complemented strains and heterologous-expression strains were constructed similarly. The primers used in this study are listed in Table S3. Analysis of lasalocid production and bacterial biomass. For lasalocid production, a suitable number of spores (~2.5 × 106) of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172-WT, wild-type S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T, or their mutants was inoculated into a 50-mL centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of liquid tryptic soy broth (TSB) (pancreatic digest of 1.7% casein and papaic digest of 0.3% soybean, 0.25% dextrose, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.25% K2HPO4 [pH 7.1 to 7.5]) and incubated on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm at 28°C for 48 h as a seed culture. Next, 1 mL of the seed culture was transferred into 50 mL of liquid SSC (2% soluble starch, 1% soybean powder, 0.5% calcium carbonate) medium. The cultures were incubated for different numbers of days at 28°C before sampling. For the analysis of lasalocid, 50 mL of fermentation broth was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min to separate the mycelia and the supernatant. The mycelia were extracted with 50 mL of ethanol, and the supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined and concentrated in vacuo to evaporate the solvent, and the residue was redissolved in 1.5 mL of methanol (MeOH) for analysis. HPLC analysis was performed on a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system using a Waters Xbridge octyl decyl silane column with a linear gradient of MeOH-H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of A: MeOH; and B: H2O. The following program was used to elute the column: 0 min, 20% A; 15 min, 100% A; 20.5 min, 100% A; 20.51 min, 20% A; 26.5 min 20% A. The effluent was monitored at 316 nm. Tandem mass spectrometry identification of lasalocid was performed as previously described (26). The lasalocid A standard was used as a positive control for HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses to confirm the production of lasalocid (Fig. S6). The bacterial biomass was determined by measuring the cell dry weight. An aliquot of 2 mL of the cell culture was harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to separate the mycelia and the supernatant, and the mycelia were then dried at 50°C to a constant weight. RNA isolation and transcriptional analyses. Total RNAs were isolated from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and its derivatives after incubation for 72, 96, and 120 h in SSC medium as described previously (48). Likewise, total RNAs were isolated from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and its derivatives after incubation for 120 and 144 h in SSC medium. First-strand synthesis of cDNA was carried out with a Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, CA, USA) using 1 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 20 μL according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cotranscriptional analysis was performed by RT-PCR according to previously reported procedures (49) to ascertain the transcriptional units of lod and las. Subsequent RT-qPCR of selected genes was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of each primer and 1 μL of cDNA in a total volume of 20 μL. RT-qPCR was also conducted without reverse transcriptase to test DNA contamination in the RNA. The 16S rRNA gene was used as an internal control to normalize the RNA concentration. Primers used for transcriptional analyses are listed in Table S3. Expression and purification of LodR1-His6, LodR2-His6, and Las3-His6 proteins. The lodR1, lodR2, lodR3, and las3 coding regions were amplified using primer pairs lodR1-orf-F/lodR1-orf-R, lodR2-orf-F/lodR2-orf-R, lodR3-orf-F/lodR3-orf-R, and las3-orf-F/las3-orf-R (Table S3), respectively. The amplified fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI and then inserted into the same sites of pET23b or pET28a to generate the expression plasmids. The recombinant plasmids were confirmed by sequencing and subsequently introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The transformants were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37°C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 16 h at 28°C. The recombinant proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Novagen). Protein purity was determined by Coomassie blue staining after SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The concentration of protein was determined according to the protocol of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Novagen). The purified proteins were stored at 4°C. EMSAs and DNase I footprinting. EMSAs were performed mainly as previously described (50). DNA probes covering the intergenic regions were amplified using primer pairs listed in Table S3. The probe (10 ng) was incubated individually with various quantities of the recombinant proteins at 25°C for 25 min in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μg/μL calf bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol in a total volume of 20 μL. After incubation, protein-bound and free DNAs were separated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 4.5% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with SYBR gold (Invitrogen), and the images were captured by a Bio-Rad GelDoc 2000 system. DNase I footprinting assays were performed as previously described (51), with slight modifications. To determine the LodR1- and LodR2-binding sites, 32P-labeled probes PR1–A and PR2–E were amplified by PCR with the labeled primers (Table S3). The footprinting reaction mixture contained 30,000 cpm of the 32P-labeled DNA probe, 0.2 to 1 μM LodR1-His6 or LodR2-His6, and 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) in 50 μL of EMSA buffer. After incubation at 25°C for 25 min, 5.5 μL RQ1 RNase-free DNase buffer and 0.2 U DNase I were added to the above-described reaction mixture, followed by further incubation at 25°C for 70 s. Next, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL of stop solution (20 mM EGTA, pH 8.0) and 100 μL of phenol-CH3Cl (1:1, vol/vol) to the mixture. DNA fragments in the mixture were precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of isopropanol, and the pellet was washed with 75% (vol/vol) ethanol. The samples were resuspended, denatured, and electrophoretically fractionated according to previously described procedures (51). The sequencing ladder was made using the Silver Sequence DNA sequencing system (Promega, USA). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-ray film. To determine the Las3-binding sites on Plas2–3, the DNA probe was amplified by PCR with 5′-fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labeled primer pairs. Different concentrations of Las3-His6 and 400 ng of the labeled DNA probe were incubated in EMSA buffer for 25 min at 25°C. Next, samples were digested by DNase I (Promega) at 25°C for 45 s, and digestion was terminated with 20 mM EGTA. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the resulting DNA samples were subsequently loaded onto an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer. GeneMarker v2.2.0 software was used to analyze the DNA regions protected by Las3. gusA transcriptional fusion assays. The gusA reporter system was constructed as previously described (33). Briefly, the putative promoter region from lod was inserted into the upstream region of a promoterless gusA gene to generate pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmids (Px represents the promoters of the lod genes tested). The authenticity of each recombinant plasmid was confirmed by subsequent sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into S. coelicolor M1146 via E. coli-Streptomyces conjugal transfer and integrated into the Streptomyces chromosome at the ΦBT1 attB site. The resultant S. coelicolor M1146 derivative strains were used as negative controls in β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays and as conjugation recipients for the overexpression of lodR3. Subsequently, pSET152::PkasO*lodR3C containing lodR3 driven by PkasO* was introduced into the M1146 derivatives in which gusA was controlled by different promoters of lod genes. The resultant strains were cultured on AS-1 (0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% soluble starch, 0.25% NaCl, 1% Na2SO4, 0.02% l-Ala, 0.02% l-Arg, 0.05% l-Asn) agar with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide (X-Gluc) at a final concentration of 100 μM at 28°C for 72 h to observe the chromogenic reaction. Statistical analysis. For each gene disruption, at least three individual mutants were tested. Other experiments were performed at least in biological triplicate unless otherwise stated, and the data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD). Statistical significance was analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
