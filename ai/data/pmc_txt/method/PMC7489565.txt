Growth and maintenance of actinomycete cultures All actinomycete mycelial liquid cultures were grown at 30°C at 200 rpm in conical flasks. The liquid medium was filled to no more than 1/5 of the total flask volume. A steel spring was placed at the bottom of each flask that extended around the inside face, preventing the culture from clumping. Foam bungs were used to seal the flask. Actinomadura verrucosospora was maintained on oatmeal agar (20 g/L oatmeal, 20 g/L agar) while S. longisporoflavus was maintained on TWM medium (5 g/L d-glucose, 10 g/L sucrose, 5 g/L tryptone, 2.5 g/L yeast extract, 0.036 g/L EDTA, 15 g/L agar, pH 7.1.). S. sp NRRL 11266 was maintained on SFM medium (20 g/L soy flour, 20 g/L d-mannitol, 20 g/L agar). Genomic DNA extraction For the preparation of genomic DNA (gDNA), 250–500 μL of mycelia was centrifuged in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to pellet the cells and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of SET buffer (20 mM TrisCl, 75 mM NaCl, 75 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) containing 10 μL of lysozyme solution (50 mg/mL). After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, 60 μL of 10% SDS (w/v) and 10 μL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) were added and the tube was incubated at 55°C for an additional 2 h. The sample was then mixed with 300 μL of 5 M NaCl and 500 μL of chloroform and centrifuged at 2200 x g for 15 min. The aqueous upper layer was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube using a T1000 pipette tip with the end cut off to avoid shearing the gDNA. To precipitate the gDNA, 0.6x volumes of isopropanol was added followed by gentle mixing. The precipitated gDNA was washed twice in 70% ethanol before being air dried for 5–10 min. The gDNA pellet was dissolved in 100–200 μL of distilled water. Genome sequencing Nextera shotgun and Nextera mate-pair libraries were constructed from high molecular weight genomic DNA isolated from Actinomadura verrucosospora NRRL-B18236. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the Illumina V2 500 cycles kit in 2 × 250 bp mode. Reads were processed using a custom adapter trimming tool(fastq_miseq_trimmer). Read pairs were then preassembled using FLASH v1.2.11 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH). For de novo assembly we used newbler v3.0. Several assemblies were carried out using either all or subsets of the input dataset, and the best assembly was selected using a score calculated from scaffold N50, edge and total number of contigs. The best assembly was polished using Pilon. ORFs were predicted ab initio using a customised version of the FGENESB pipeline V2.0 (2008) [www.softberry.com] and BLAST-searched against a filtered NCBI NR and KEGG datasets. Customised linguistic analysis was used for transfer of gene annotations. Annotation results were saved in EMBL format and manually curated in Artemis (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis). The revised genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank under accession number CP053892. The tetromadurin biosynthesis gene cluster (mad gene cluster) can be found within the genome using the accession CP053892:2037887–2164555. Revised sequence of Mad10 Close examination of the mad10 gene revealed an alternative ATG start codon 15 codons upstream (corresponding to the amino acids MSDSVVIIGAGPVGL) to the start codon presented in Genbank: QKG20158. This alternative start codon was preferred as including these 15 extra amino acids improved its alignment with homologues proteins (see S12 Fig in the supplementary material for details), suggesting it is the true start codon. For clarity, the revised sequence of Mad10 used for alignments and expressed from pIB139-mad10 is presented below (bolded residues highlight the additional amino acid residues): MSDSVVIIGAGPVGLMLAHELALAGVRTVVIERRPEIDARTVSGLIHERSVELLEQRGLMEQIRREDGEPLVWDRLHFASFWLDMSELAKTDHSVVLLQTRIQRLLSDRAAARGVHILRRHELVGLSQDEDGVTARVHSPLGEEEIRCGYLVGCDGEDSAVRELAGFAVTRSGPSWYGLLADVGSYAGPVGAGSFHEGGMFGQFGDASTMFRLMTIEIGVEAPPAEQPVTLEEVRASIERITGERPTVEEPLWLHRHGNVTILADEYRNGRVFLAGDAAHFQFHPAGHAVTIGLQDAVNLGWKLAAKLQGWAPAGLLDSYDAERRPYGRRACVYGRAQMALLDTADGPSALREVFGELLDHDVVNRHLVRAATDARYPMGQAEDLVGRRVPLVSLSTPGGEVPVAETLHAARGVLLDLSGGTEPPDVTGWKDRVDVVAAEPTPEIPASAVLVRPDGHIAWAGEAVGEGLHTALAAWFGEPAA Creation of pYH7 and pIB139 constructs The general method used to create a gene-deletion construct was to PCR amplify 2 kb regions upstream and downstream of the gene of interest. The DNA polymerase used was PhusionTM High Fidelity Master Mix with GC Buffer (New England Biolabs). The PCR primers used to amplify each 2 kb fragment contained regions of overlap with both NdeI-linearised pYH7 [8] and the other 2 kb fragment, enabling all three to be seamlessly joined using Hot Fusion DNA assembly [9]. The assembled DNA product was then transformed into chemically competent E coli NovaBlue cells. Colony PCR was used to identify E. coli clones containing the correctly assembled insert, which were then fully sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The same protocol was followed to create the pIB139 [10] constructs, except the vector was linearised using XbaI and only a single fragment was inserted. Intergeneric conjugation of Actinomadura verrucosospora, Streptomyces longisporoflavus, and Streptomyces sp. NRRL 11266 The DNA methylation deficient ET12567/pUZ8002 cells transformed with the pYH7 or pIB139 plasmid to be transferred into the actinomycete host were grown to an A600 of 0.4–0.6 in 2TY (16 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl) medium containing selective antibiotics. The ET12567/pUZ8002 cells were then spun down and washed twice in 20 mL of 2TY medium before being resuspended in 300 μL of 2TY. The actinomycete strain to be conjugated (either as mycelia or spores) was prepared following the protocol from Practical Streptomyces Genetics [11]. After gentle mixing, the two bacteria types were plated onto 35 mL of SFM containing 10–20 mM MgCl2 and left at 30°C for 12–20 h. The surface of the plate was then flooded with 1 mL of MQ water containing 35 μL of apramycin (50 mg/mL) and 25 μL nalidixic acid (25 mg/mL). The plate was then incubated at 30°C to promote the growth of exconjugants. Exconjugants were verified by restreaking onto SFM containing 30–50 μg/mL apramycin and 25 μg/mL nalidixic acid. Metabolite analysis To detect the production of tetromadurin, A. verrucosospora was grown at 30°C for seven days on oatmeal agar. To detect the production of tetronasin, S. longisporoflavus was grown at 30°C on tsn medium B (30 g/L tryptic soy broth, 3 g/L CaCO4, 100 g/L dextrin, 20 g/L agar, trace elements: 4 mg/L FeSO4, 4 mg/L ZnSO4, 0.6 mg/L CuSO4, 0.4 mg/L MnSO4, 0.4 mg/L KMoO4). To detect the production of tetronomycin, S. sp NRRL 11266 was grown at 30°C on SFM medium. Following the fermentation, the agar was cut into cubes and extracted by submerging in ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and the organic extract was redissolved 1 mL of methanol and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min to remove any particulates, followed by HPLC-MS analysis. For the analysis of small molecules, an HPLC (Hewlett Packard, Agilent Technologies 1200 series) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan MAT LTQ) was used. The HPLC-MS was fitted with a 250 mm x 4.6 mm 5μm C18 reverse-phase column (5μ OSD3, 100 Å. Phenomenex, USA). The mobile phase consisted of 20 mM ammonium acetate and methanol. The mobile phase flow rate was 0.7 mL/min with the following gradient: 0–5 min, 5–75% methanol; 5–30 min, 75–95% methanol, 30–34 min, 95% methanol 35–36 min, 95–5% methanol. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive electrospray ionisation mode set to full scan (from m/z 200–2000). Construction of phylogenetic trees and protein sequence alignments Maximum-likelihood (based on the Le-Cascuel model [12]) phylogenetic trees were created using MEGA7 [13] by following the protocol described in [14]. 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed. Positions with less than 95% site-coverage were excluded. Protein sequence alignments were performed using ClustalOmega [15].
