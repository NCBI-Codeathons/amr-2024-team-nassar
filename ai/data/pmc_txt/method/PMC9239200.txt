MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions. All bacterial strains, phages, and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S2A, B, and C, respectively. For growth studies and double-agar overlay assays, Streptomyces sp. cultures were inoculated from spore stocks and cultivated at 30°C and 120 rpm using glucose-yeast extract-malt extract (GYM) medium for S. venezuelae and Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius and yeast extract-malt extract (YEME) medium for S. coelicolor (35). E. coli was cultivated in lysogeny broth (LB) medium at 37°C and 170 rpm, while C. glutamicum was grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium at 30°C and 120 rpm. For double-agar overlays, BHI agar for C. glutamicum, LB agar for E. coli, and GYM agar (pH 7.3) for all Streptomyces species were used, with 0.4% and 1.5% agar for the top and bottom layers, respectively. For quantification of extracellular phages, 2 μL of the culture supernatants was spotted on a bacterial lawn propagated on a double-agar overlay inoculated at an initial optical density at 450 nm (OD450) of 0.4 for Streptomyces spp., an OD600 of 0.1 for E. coli, and an OD600 of 0.7 for C. glutamicum. Both agar layers were supplemented with antibiotics at the indicated concentrations. For standard cloning applications, E. coli DH5α was cultivated in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic at 37°C and 120 rpm. For conjugation between Streptomyces spp. and E. coli, the conjugative E. coli strain ET12567/pUZ8002 was used (41). Recombinant DNA work and cloning. All plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table S2C and D, respectively. Standard cloning techniques such as PCR and restriction digestion were performed according to standard protocols (42). In all cases, Gibson assembly was used for plasmid construction (43). DNA regions of interest were amplified via PCR using the indicated plasmid DNA as the template. The plasmid backbone was cut using the listed restriction enzymes. DNA sequencing and synthesis of oligonucleotides was performed by Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). Phage infection curves. For phage infection curves, the BioLector microcultivation system of m2p-labs (Baesweiler, Germany) was used (44). Cultivations were performed as biological triplicates in FlowerPlates (m2p-labs, Germany) at 30°C and a shaking frequency of 1,200 rpm. During cultivation, biomass was measured as a function of backscattered light intensity with an excitation wavelength (λEx) of 620 nm (filter module: λEx/λEm, 620 nm/620 nm; gain, 25 or 20 in Fig. 3a) every 15 min. All growth curves are baseline corrected. Main cultures of Streptomyces spp. in 1 mL GYM medium containing the indicated supplements were inoculated with overnight cultures in the same medium to an initial OD450 of 0.15. Infection was performed by adding phages to an initial titer of 107 PFU/mL. Supernatants were collected in 2-h intervals to determine the time course of phage titer via double-agar overlays. Phage infection curves in E. coli were done in the same way at 37°C and 1,200 rpm using an initial OD600 of 0.1 in 1 mL LB medium and an initial phage titer of 108 PFU/mL, resulting in a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Phage infection curves in shaking flasks were performed analogously to the cultivation in microbioreactors using a shaking frequency of 120 rpm. To study phage infection and the influence of aminoglycosides in Streptomyces, we draw attention to the importance of ion content, e.g., of water used for medium preparation. Cultivation and perfusion in microfluidic devices. Single-cell analysis of S. venezuelae cells infected with phage Alderaan in presence and absence of apramycin was performed using an in-house-developed microfluidic platform (45–47). Cultivation and time-lapse imaging were performed in three steps. First, cultivation chambers in the microfluidic chip were inoculated with GYM medium containing an initial spore titer of 108 PFU/mL. During the following precultivation phase, cells in all chambers were cultivated under continuous GYM medium supply supplemented with 2.5 μg/mL apramycin (flow rate, 300 nL/min) to allow comparable growth conditions. After 6 h of precultivation, cells were cultivated for 3 h in GYM medium containing one of the final apramycin concentrations (0, 5, or 10 μg/mL). Subsequently, infection was initiated by a continuous supply of GYM medium containing the final apramycin concentrations and Alderaan phages with a titer of 108 PFU/mL (flow rate, 200 nL/min). By using disposable syringes (Omnifix-F tuberculin, 1 mL; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) and a high-precision syringe pump system (neMESYS; Cetoni GmbH, Korbussen, Germany), continuous medium supply and waste removal were achieved. Phase-contrast images were obtained at 5-min intervals (exposure time, 100 ms) by a fully motorized inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon Europe B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands). During the complete cultivation, the temperature was set to 30°C using an incubator system (PeCon GmbH, Erbach, Germany). Cultivation in spent medium. For preparation of spent medium, cultures of the natural apramycin producer Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius were prepared by inoculating 50 mL of GYM medium to an initial OD450 of 0.1 and were cultivated for 4 days. Spent medium of the culture was collected every day by centrifugation and subsequent filtration of the supernatant. After adjustment of the pH to 7.3, GYM medium and spent medium were mixed in a ratio of 4:1, so that spent medium accounted for 20% of the total volume. Ten-times-concentrated GYM was added to keep the concentration of C sources equal to that of fresh GYM medium. Cultivation and infection of the apramycin-resistant S. venezuelae/pIJLK04 strain in 20% spent medium was conducted in microbioreactors as describe above by using an initial OD450 of 0.5 and an initial phage titer of 106 PFU/mL. LC-MS measurements of apramycin. Aminoglycosides were analyzed using an Agilent ultrahigh-performance LC (UHPLC) 1290 Infinity system coupled to a 6130 Quadrupole LC-MS system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). LC separation was carried out using an InfinityLab Poroshell 120 2.7-μm EC-C18 column (3.0 by 150 mm; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) at 40°C. For elution, 0.1% acetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1% acetic acid (solvent B) were applied as the mobile phases at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A gradient elution was used, where the amount of solvent B was increased stepwise: minutes 0 to 6, 10% to 25%; minutes 6 to 7, 25% to 50%; minutes 7 to 8, 50% to 100%; and minutes 8 to 8.5, 100% to 10%. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, and data were acquired using the selected-ion-monitoring (SIM) mode. An authentic apramycin standard was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany). Area values for [M+H]+ mass signals were linear for metabolite concentrations from 10 to 50 μg/mL. Potassium efflux assays. Cultures of E. coli DSM 4230/pEKEx2.d were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL apramycin at 37°C and 170 rpm overnight. Fresh LB medium (50 μg/mL apramycin if needed) was inoculated 1:100 from the overnight cultures and incubated at 37°C and 120 rpm for 1.5 h. The cultures were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellets were resuspended in SM buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]). The OD600 was measured and adjusted to 2. The cultures were stored at 4°C and incubated at 37°C for 5 min directly before use. The measurements were performed using an Orion potassium ion selective electrode (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Five microliters of the prepared cultures was mixed 1:50 with Orion ionic strength adjuster (ISA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and measurements were started immediately to monitor the electric potential (in millivolts) every 5 s for a total of 60 min at room temperature with constant stirring. If apramycin was needed, it was added in the beginning to a concentration of 100 μg/mL. After 5.5 min, 100 μL of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated λ phage lysate in SM buffer (1011 PFU/mL) was added to the cultures. Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantification of cell-associated Alderaan phages was performed via quantitative real-time PCR. For this, infection of the apramycin-resistant strain S. venezuelae ATCC 10712 pIJLK04 with Alderaan was performed as described in “Phage infection curves.” At the indicated time points, 3 OD units of cells were harvested via centrifugation at 5,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being stored at −20°C. For quantification of intracellular phage DNA in presence and absence of apramycin, cells were resuspended in 500 μL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl [pH 7.0]), and cell disruption was performed using a Precellys instrument (Bertin, Montigny Le Bretonneux, France) at 6,000 rpm three times for 40 s each. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min, DNA concentrations in the supernatants were determined via nanophotometer (Implen, Munich, Germany) and adjusted to 1 ng/μL. Finally, 5 μL of the diluted supernatants as the template DNA was mixed with 10 μL 2× Luna universal qPCR master mix (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 1 μL of each oligonucleotide (Table S2D) (final oligonucleotide concentration, 0.5 μM) and adjusted to a final volume of 20 μL with double-distilled water (ddH2O). Measurements were performed in 96-well plates in the qTOWER 2.2 (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). For the determination of the relative concentration of cell-associated phages, the relative expression ratio of the phage target phage gene (HQ601_00028, coding for the minor tail protein of Alderaan; PCR product, 144 bp) to the S. venezuelae housekeeping gene atpD (coding for the ATP synthase beta subunit; PCR product, 147 bp) was calculated via the “Relative quantification method” function of the qPCRsoft 3.1 software (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). Transcriptomics via RNA sequencing. To compare transcription of phage and host DNA in presence and absence of apramycin, infection of the apramycin-resistant strain S. venezuelae ATCC 10712/pIJLK04 with Alderaan was conducted as described in “Phage infection curves.” Cells were harvested 90 min and 180 min after infection on ice at 5,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. RNA purification was done using the Monarch total RNA miniprep kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's manual. Depletion of rRNA, library preparation, and sequencing were conducted by Genewiz (Leipzig, Germany). After sequencing, all subsequent steps were conducted using CLC genomic workbench V. 20.0.4 software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The initial quality check to analyze read quality and sequencing performances was followed by a trimming step. This step was used to remove read-through adapter sequences, leftover adapter sequences, low-quality reads (limit = 0.05), and ambiguous nucleotides. Subsequently, the trimmed reads were mapped against the genomes of S. venezuelae (accession no. NC_018750.1) and the phage Alderaan (accession no. MT711975.1). Coverage plots were generated to show the distribution of mapped reads on both genomes. Subsequently, transcripts-per-million (TPM) values were calculated using the RNA-seq analysis tool of CLC genomics workbench (read alignment parameters: mismatch cost, 2; insertion cost, 3; deletion cost, 3; length fraction, 0.8; similarity fraction, 0.8; strand specificity, both; maximum number of hits for a read, 10). A table containing these values and an overview matrix containing all values were exported for each sample. Phage targeting direct-geneFISH. Visualization and quantification of intracellular phage DNA during the time course of infection were conducted via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), following the direct-geneFISH protocol (48), with modifications as described below. Design of phage gene probes was done using the gene-PROBER (49). Sequences of the 200-bp polynucleotides for Alderaan and 300-bp polynucleotides for λ are provided in Table S3. Phage infection was performed as described in “Phage infection curves” using 107 PFU/mL as the initial phage titer for both phages. For infection of E. coli, the chemical labeling of polynucleotides with Alexa Fluor 647 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as well as the “core” direct-geneFISH protocol for microscopic slides was conducted as described previously using 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme for permeabilization and 35% (vol/vol) formamide during the hybridization step. Imaging of cells was performed with an inverted time-lapse live cell microscope (Nikon Europe B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands) using a 100× oil immersion objective (CFI Plan Apo Lambda DM; 100× oil; numerical aperture [NA], 1.45; Nikon Europe B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands) (45). Fluorescence was recorded using the optical filters DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and CY5-4040C (DAPI: excitation, 360/40 nm; dichroic, 400 nm; emission, 460/50 nm; exposure time, 500 ms; CY5: excitation, 628/40 nm; dichroic, 660 nm; emission, 692/40 nm; exposure time, 500 ms [AHF Analysentechnik AG, Tübingen, Germany]). Phase contrast was imaged with an exposure time of 500 ms. Polynucleotides used for phage targeting direct-geneFISH. Download Table S3, DOCX file, 0.02 MB. For S. venezuelae infection, the protocol was adjusted as follows. Fixation of cells and phages was performed in 50% ethanol overnight at 4°C. After washing and immobilization, permeabilization was performed with 1.5 mg/mL lysozyme for 60 min at 37°C. Due to the high GC content of the phage Alderaan, the formamide concentration in the hybridization buffer and in the humidity chamber was adjusted to 60% (vol/vol) and the NaCl concentration in the washing buffer was reduced to 4 mM. After counterstaining with DAPI, imaging of cells was performed as described for E. coli using the optical filters DAPI and CY5-4040C with the indicated exposure times (DAPI: excitation, 360/40 nm; dichroic, 400; emission, 460/50 nm; exposure time, 800 ms; CY5: excitation, 628/40 nm; dichroic, 660; emission, 692/40 nm; exposure time, 500 ms [AHF Analysentechnik AG, Tübingen, Germany]). Phase contrast was imaged with an exposure time of 500 ms. The images for phage signal quantification were taken at the same exposure times to enable comparison; exposure times were adjusted to avoid overexposure of the signals. Preparation of image cutouts and adjustments of lookup tables (LUTs) were performed using NIS-Elements BR 5.30.03 (64 bit). As a quantification of the microscopic analyses, plots showing the distribution of Cy5 signal intensities for single microscopy images were generated. To this end, signal intensity of each pixel of the Cy5 channel images was determined using the software Fiji (50), and the frequency of occurrence of each intensity was calculated and plotted using R with the Rstudio interface (51, 52). Fluorescence intensity profiles of single replicates are shown in Fig. S6a and c. Purification of the AAC(3)IV apramycin acetyltransferase. For heterologous protein overproduction, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the pAN6_aac(3)IV_CStrep plasmid were cultivated as described in “Bacterial strains and growth conditions.” Precultivation was performed in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin (LB Kan50), which was incubated overnight at 37°C and 120 rpm. The main culture in LB Kan50 medium was inoculated to an OD600 of 0.1 using the preculture. At an OD600 of 0.6, gene expression was induced using 100 μM IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside). Cells were harvested after additional 24 h of incubation at 20°C. Cell harvesting and disruption were performed as described earlier (53) using buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) with cOmplete protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for cell disruption and buffer B (100 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) for purification. Purification of the Strep-tagged AAC(3)IV apramycin acetyltransferase was conducted by applying the supernatant to an equilibrated 2-mL Strep-Tactin–Sepharose column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). After washing with 20 mL buffer B, the protein was eluted with 5 mL buffer B containing 15 mM d-desthiobiotin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After purification, the purity of the elution fractions was checked by SDS-PAGE (54) using a 4 to 20% Mini-Protean gradient gel (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). The protein concentration of the elution fraction was determined with the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the elution fraction with the highest protein concentration was chosen for further use. In vitro acetylation reaction of apramycin. Protein purification of the AAC(3)IV apramycin acetyltransferase was conducted as described above. Acetylation of apramycin was performed using a modified version of the protocol described by Magalhaes and Blanchard (21). Assay mixtures were composed of 100 μL 100 mM Tris-HCl–500 mM NaCl (pH 8.0) containing the AAC(3)IV at a concentration of 10 μg/mL, as well as 10 mM apramycin (approximately 5 mg/mL) and 10 mM acetyl-CoA sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The assay mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Data availability. Raw data as well as processed tables were deposited in the GEO database under the accession number GSE171784. Apramycin prevents cell lysis during infection of S. venezuelae with phage Alderaan. Time-lapse video of S. venezuelae ATCC 10712 carrying the plasmid pIJLK04, which was cultivated in a microfluidics system and challenged with Alderaan (108 PFU/mL; flow rate, 200 nL/min) in presence and absence of 5 or 10 μg/mL apramycin.
