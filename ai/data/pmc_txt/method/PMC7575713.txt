Materials and Methods General Organic solvents were purchased from Anaqua (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., and other chemicals were purchased from Wako Chemicals Ltd., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sigma-Aldrich, or J&K Scientific Ltd., unless noted otherwise. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Tech Dragon Limited. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using a T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or the Plant Direct PCR Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). Analytical LC/HR-ESI-MS analysis was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a micrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics), using a COSMOSIL 2.5Cholester packed column (2.0 i.d. × 100 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). Flash chromatography was performed using an Isolera Spektra One flash purification system (Biotage). Preparative HPLC was performed on a Waters 1525 Binary HPLC pump with a 2998 photodiode array detector (Waters Corporation), using an XBridge BEH C18 OBD Prep Column (100 Å, 5 μm, 19 i.d. × 250 mm; Waters Corporation). NMR spectra were obtained 600 MHz (1H)/150 MHz (13C)/60 MHz (15N) with a Bruker Ascend Avance III HD spectrometer, and chemical shifts were recorded with reference to solvent signals [1H NMR: DMSO-d6 2.49 ppm; 13C NMR: DMSO-d6 39.5 ppm; 15N NMR: 78.98 ppm (15N urea as an external reference)]. Optical rotations were measured with P-2000 Digital Polarimeter (JASCO Corporation). CD spectra were obtained with J-1500 Circular Dichroism Spectrophotometer (JASCO Corporation). X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture Photon II diffractometer. The glufosinate solution for the fungal transformation was extracted from Basta (Bayer) as previously described (Chooi et al., 2010) and used at a 50 μL/mL concentration. HPLC Analysis Analytical HPLC was performed with a solvent system of 20 mM formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 20 mM formic acid (solvent B), at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and a column temperature of 40°C. The separation was performed using a linear gradient from 10:90 (solvent B/solvent A) to 100:0 for 10 min, 100:0 for the following 3 min, and a linear gradient from 100:0 to 10:90 within the following 2.5 min. Production and Purification of Pyranoviolin A (1) Aspergillus violaceofuscus CBS 115571 was purchased from the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, inoculated on 100 YES agar plates [ca. 2 L; 20 g/L yeast extract, 150 g/L sucrose, 0.5 g/L MgSO4⋅7H2O, 20 g/L agar supplemented with 1mL/L of a trace element solution (10 g/L ZnSO4⋅7H2O, 5 g/L CuSO4⋅5H2O), pH 6.5], and cultivated for 9 days at 25°C. The resultant fungal cultures including agar were crushed into small pieces and extracted with ethyl acetate twice using an ultrasonic bath. The crude extract was subjected to flash chromatography with Biotage® SNAP KP-Sil cartridge (100 g) and eluted stepwise using chloroform:ethyl acetate gradient (100:0 to 0:100). Fractions that contained 1 were concentrated and further purified by reverse-phase preparative HPLC (40% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 10 mL/min) to yield 64.9 mg of colorless crystals. Calculation of the ECD Spectrum of Pyranoviolin A (1) Initially, an exhaustive conformation space search of (7R)-1 and (7S)-1 were conducted by Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST) version 2.8 (Pracht et al., 2020). Fifteen conformers for (7R)-1 and (7S)-1, respectively, were obtained with relative energies in 5 kcal/mol. All conformers were then optimized in Gaussian 09 software package (Frisch et al., 2010) at M062x/def2tzvp level with PCM in methanol. The optimized conformers with the Boltzmann distribution >1% were further calculated for the ECD by using TDDFT at cam-b3lyp/tzvp level with PCM in methanol. The ECD spectrum was obtained by weighing the Boltzmann distribution rate of each geometric conformation in Multiwfn 3.6 (Lu and Chen, 2012). The ECD spectrum is simulated by overlapping Gaussian functions for each transition according to: Where σ represents the width of the band at 1/e height, and ΔEi and Ri are the excitation energies and rotational strengths for transition i, respectively. σ = 0.5 eV and Rvelocity have been used in this work. The optimized conformation geometries, thermodynamic parameters, key transitions, oscillator strengths, and rotatory strengths in the ECD spectrum and populations of all conformations were provided in Supplementary Tables 1–16. Gene Deletion Experiment of pyvA The gene deletion of pyvA was performed by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated target gene break and repair with a microhomology repair template, as previously described for Aspergillus fumigatus (Al Abdallah et al., 2017). The components for the dual Cas9-gRNA system, namely Cas9 protein, CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), and transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies; two separate crRNAs were designed at 5′- and 3′-end regions of pyvA, respectively (protospacer sequences: 5′-AAAGGCACCACACAAGACGG-3′; 5′-CGGAACCAAGTCCACGACGA-3′). The Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were assembled as reported (Al Abdallah et al., 2017). The microhomology repair template for the fungal transformation was amplified from pBARI (Matsuda et al., 2014) using the primers pyvA_bar-F (5′-CCGGAATCTCCTTGGAGGAGATGAACGGCTCACGCACC TTTGGTGATTGGAATAACTGAC-3′) and pyvA_bar-R (5′-GGAGCGCCGTGAGATAGTTGACCGGAACCAAGTCC ACGACGTGACGATGAGCCGCTCTTG-3′), generating the glufosinate-resistant gene (bar) flanked by microhomology arms targeting pyvA. The transformation of A. violaceofuscus and selection of transformants were performed as previously described for Aspergillus oryzae (Matsuda et al., 2018) except that the lysing enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as fungal cell lytic enzymes at a concentration of 40 mg/mL. The successful deletion of pyvA was confirmed by colony-direct PCR of the transformant using the primers pyvA-check-F (5′-CATCGAACAGAAGGATGTGAGGCGCAAAC-3′) and PptrA-check-R (5′-CTATCATCTGTTAGCCATTCCATCAACAGG-3′) (Supplementary Figure S10).
