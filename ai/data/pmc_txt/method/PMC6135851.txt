I11.2.G06 I11 cosmid carrying I11.2.G06 transposant 41. Dot Blot assay Genomic DNAs were extracted by salting out procedures, as described in Lo Grasso et al.48. Dot blot assay was performed following the protocol described in Caracappa et al.49. Briefly, genomic DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, spotted on nitrocellulose filter (Hybond ECL, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and fixed by UV (2 cycles at 700 J). The spotted DNA was detected by staining the filter with 0.02% (w/v) methylene blue in 0.3 mol/L sodium acetate (pH 5.2). After removal of the staining solution, the methylated cytosines were detected using the anti-5-methylcytosine mouse antibody (Calbiochem) and the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG-H&L chain specific peroxidase conjugate (Calbiochem). The images were taken using Chemidoc (Chemi Hi sensitivity) and SuperSignal®West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Life Technologies). Spots of the same area were manually labelled and quantified by Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS System Biorad. Percentage of methylation level was reported as arbitrary units per mm2 (AU/mm2). The experiments were performed at least twice and in triplicate. Genomic DNAs, extracted from Escherichia coli DH10B and Escherichia coli ET12567/pUZ8002 strains, were used as positive and negative control, respectively. The experiments were performed at least twice and in triplicate. 5-aza-dC treatment Preliminary experiments were performed to set up the demethylation. The amount of 5-aza-dC (Sigma) to add to the medium was chosen after checking the effect of increasing concentrations of the drug on the cells on solid medium GYM (Supplementary Fig. S3). 5-azadC is reported to have a half-life of 20h-24h under conditions of physiological temperature and neutral pH50, so the treatment was repeated every 24 h, from 0 to 96 h. A control experiment was done in parallel using DMSO (the solvent of 5-aza-dC). 5 µM 5-aza-dC was the highest concentration in which the cells were still viable, while 10 and 15 were lethal for the cells, indeed a halo of growth inhibition was present. This is in accordance with results reported for E. coli23. In addition, a treatment was carried out to liquid cultures every 12 and 24 h, from 0 to 36 h. A control experiment was done in parallel using DMSO. The efficiency of demethylation was evaluated after 48 h of growth of S. coelicolor in the presence of 5 µM of 5-azadC added every 24 h and 12 h, by dot blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). The results revealed that the efficiency of the treatment carried out every 24 h was 72%, while every 12 h was 99, 5%. Thus, for the demethylation experiments treatment was carried out with 5 µM 5-azadC added every 12 h. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis (CLSM) Culture samples were processed for microscopy at different incubation time points following the protocol reported in Manteca et al.46. Cells were stained with the LIVE/DEAD Bac-Light bacterial viability kit (Invitrogen), that contains the SYTO 9 green fluorescent stain for labelling all the cells and the non-cell-permeating nucleic acid stain (propidium iodide, PI) for detecting the dead cells. The samples were observed under a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope at a wavelength of 488 nm and 568 nm excitation and 530 nm (green) or 640 nm (red) emissions. More than 30 images were analyzed for each developmental time point in a minimum of three independent cultures. Antibiotic quantification To measure actinorhodin (intracellular and extracellular), cells were broken in their culture medium by adding KOH 0.1 N. Cellular debris was discarded by centrifugation, and actinorhodin was quantified spectrophotometrically with UV/visible spectrophotometer, applying the linear Beer-Lambert relationship to estimate concentration (Ɛ640 = 25,320). Undecylprodigiosin was measured after vacuum drying of the mycelium, followed by extraction with methanol, acidification with HCl (to 0.5 N), and spectrophotometric assay at 530 nm, again using the Beer-Lambert relationship to estimate concentration (Ɛ530 = 100,500). Reproducibility has been corroborated by at least three independent cultures at various developmental time points. Disruption of the SCO1731 To generate the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant, the cosmid I11.2.G06 containing a copy of the gene interrupted by the transposon Tn506241 was used. It contains the apramycin and kanamycin resistance cassettes in the transposon and in the cosmid, respectively. After transformation by interspecific conjugation with E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 as a donor strain, 8 apramycin resistant colonies were obtained. Genomic DNA was extracted from 4 mutants and analyzed by PCR for the presence of apramycin (~1.3 kb) and the absence of kanamycin (0.9 kb) resistance cassette. The following primers were used Kana_F 5′-GATGGCTTTCTTGCCGCC-3′ and Kana_R 5′-TCGGTCATTTCGAACCCC-3′, Apra_F 5′-CGGGGTACCCTCACGGTAACTGATGCC-3′ and Apra_R 5′-ATTTTAATGCGGATGTTGCG-3′ to amplify apramycin or kanamycin resistance cassette, respectively. Two samples (SCO1731-3 and -4) had the expected profile (Supplementary Fig. S5) and they were analyzed by Southern Blot using genomic DNA digested with SalI and Tn5062 as a probe. The expected restriction profile of the mutant is shown in the Supplementary Fig. S6. Southern blot analysis revealed that both putative mutants SCO1731::Tn5062 had the expected restriction profile, two bands of approximately 2.8 and 2.7 kb. Complementation of SCO1731::Tn5062 mutation A copy of SCO1731, placed under the control of its promoter was amplified via PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo), using the primers 1731_SpeI F 5′-GGACTAGTTGGCTGCCTCCTTACGGAT-3′ and 1731_compl R 5′-AAGATATCGTCTGGACGAGGACGAGTTC-3′ and was then cloned into pCR™-Blunt II-TOPO®. The sequences were checked via DNA sequencing using the M13 universal primers prior to subcloning them into pNG348 constructing the plasmid pNG3-1731compl (Table 2). The plasmid was used to transform the mutant SCO1731 strain by interspecific conjugation generating the SCO1731_compl strain. Thus, 32 colonies of putative SCO1731_compl strain were obtained after the growth in SFM with hygromycin. After 3 passages of these colonies on GYM with hygromycin, genomic DNA was extracted by 10 putative complemented strains and analyzed by PCR using the primers SCO4848_F 5′-CGTCGATCCCCTCGGTTG-3′ and SCO4848_R. 5′-GAGCCGGGAAAGCTCATTCA-3′. These primers amplified a fragment of 617 bp only if pNG3 is integrated at the attB site of SCO4848. Six of eight samples had the expected profile (Supplementary Fig. S7) and only the SCO1731_compl-8 was used for further experiment.
