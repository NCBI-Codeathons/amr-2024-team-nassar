["Materials and methods", "Sample collection and deoxyribonucleic acid extraction", "Microbial samples were collected in three replicates from rhizosphere of M. oleifera plant grown naturally in the North Western region of Mecca district of Saudi Arabia near the red sea coast (21\u00b012\u203217.8\u2033N 39\u00b031\u203226.4\u2033E) and from surrounding bulk soil (Al-Eisawi and Al-Ruzayza, 2015). The selected three plants for the experiment are single-grown, have similar size and received no rainfall for > 3 months prior sample collection, while bulk soil samples were concurrently taken \u2265 10 m apart from the plants. For soil rhizospheric samples, plant lateral roots were first cut at \u223c10\u201330 cm depth. Then, soil of a maximum of 1 cm apart from the root, not the soil that physically adheres to the root, was collected and immediately put in liquid nitrogen, transported to the lab, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use (Hurt et al., 2001).", "Whole genome shotgun sequencing and bioinformatics analysis", "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNAs) of different soil samples were extracted using CTAB/SDS method, and purity and integrity were checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA concentration was adjusted to 10 ng/\u03bcl using dsDNA Assay kit (Life Technologies, United States). Then, 1 \u03bcg of each DNA sample was shipped to Novogene Co. (Singapore) for whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. Physical fractionation of DNAs followed by data pre-processing were done and low quality bases (Q-value \u2264 38) exceeding 40-bp threshold were trimmed, and reads with N nucleotides over 10-bp threshold were removed. Then, effective clean data were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform after library preparation using an Ultra DNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEB, United States). Generated data were assembled to recover scaffolds using MEGAHIT (K-mer = 55) and chimeras were removed as described (Karlsson et al., 2012; Mende et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2014). Unassembled reads of different samples were mixed together to generate NOVO_MIX scaffolds exploring the less-abundant genes of the different samples. Generated scaffolds were cut off at \u201cN\u201d to get N-free fragments (or scaftigs) (Mende et al., 2012; Nielsen et al., 2014). Then, clean data were mapped to assembled scaftigs using Soap 2.21, and effective scaftigs (found in > 2 samples) were further utilized. Gene prediction was carried out by MetaGeneMark (Nielsen et al., 2014) and predicted genes were dereplicated using Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) (Li and Godzik, 2006; Fu et al., 2012). Then, non-redundant gene catalogs (nrGC) were constructed after removing redundancy using a greedy pairwise comparison (Li et al., 2014) and annotation was done using the binning reference-based classification method MEGAN (Huson et al., 2011, 2016).", "All unique open reading frames (ORFs) were subjected to Blastp against CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database)1 (e-value \u2264 1e\u20135) (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015) in order to identify and characterize ARGs. Then, relative abundance of different ARGs in unit ppm was estimated (Yang et al., 2013; Forsberg et al., 2014). ARGs were categorized to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) families (or metabolic processes) and resistance mechanisms were assigned as described (Liu and Pop, 2009). Based on abundance information of ARGs, heat map of abundance clustering for the top 30 highly abundant ARGs was drawn. Then, two circle charts were drawn to describe the overall proportion and distribution of the most redundant ARGs across the two soil types, on one hand, and the most redundant metabolic processes at the bacterial phylum level in ARO (antibiotic-resistant organisms) datasets, on the other hand. The first circle chart was divided into two parts of which the first refers to soil types (right side) and the second part refers to the most highly abundant ARGs (left side). The second chart was drawn to incorporate the most highly abundant bacterial phyla in terms of ARGs (right side) and the metabolic processes related to these highly abundant ARGs (left side). Stretches of different colors in the right side of inner circle refer to sum of relative abundance of all ARGs per sample in the first circus and sum of relative abundance of all metabolic processes per bacterial phylum in the second circus. While, color stretches in the left side refer to sum of relative abundance of all samples per ARG in the first circus and all bacterial phyla per metabolic process in the second circus. Colors in the right side of outer circle refer to detailed relative abundance of different ARGs per sample in the first circus and detailed relative abundance of different metabolic processes or AMR gene families per bacterial phylum in the second circus. While, colors in the left side refer to detailed relative abundance of different samples per ARG in the first circus and detailed relative abundance different bacterial phyla per metabolic process in the second circus.", "Validation of selected highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes via qPCR", "Total RNAs were isolated from samples gathered for each soil type using RNA PowerSoil\u00ae Total RNA isolation kit (Mo Bio, cat. no. 12866-25) following manufacturer instructions. DNA contamination was removed from RNA samples using RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and eventually checked by PCR. Then, primers of four highly abundant ARGs in plant rhizosphere in addition to those of 16S rRNA of Bacillus subtilis, used as a house-keeping gene, were designed using Netprimer software2 following standard criteria (Supplementary Table 1). Expression level of the different ARGs was detected by qPCR using Agilent Mx3000P System (Agilent technology, United States). Maxima\u2122 SYBR Green/ROX qPCR was done as previously described (Bahieldin et al., 2015). Similar amounts of RNAs of the two samples were used and calculations were made to detect the expression level of ARGs relative to that of the housekeeping gene."]
