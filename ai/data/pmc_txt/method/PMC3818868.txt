Experimental procedures Strain and cultivation Streptomyces coelicolor M110 is a derivative of S. coelicolor A3(2), which lacks the linear plasmid SCP1 and was kindly provided by D.A. Hopwood, Norwich, UK. Cultivation on plates (until spores developed) has been described earlier (Hopwood et al., 1985; Koebsch et al., 2009). Stock suspensions containing 2.5 × 109 spores per ml of 40% glycerol were stored at −20°C. Chemicals, dyes and enzymes Chemicals for SDS gel electrophoresis were from Serva, and Sepharyl S‐300 was from GE Healthcare Life Sciences. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Trypsin was from Roche. The dyes propidium iodine and SYTO9 were purchased from Molecular probes. Test for the presence of prodigiosin and actinorhodin A prodigiosin control was gained from cultures of S. lividans. Investigations for the presence of prodigiosin were performed as described earlier (Koebsch et al., 2009). In addition, samples were tested by LC/MS for the presence of the characteristic molecular weight (393 Da) of prodigiosin. An analysis for the abundance of actinorhodin and its related compounds was performed as described earlier (Bystrykh et al., 1996). Actinorhodin is red under acid and blue under alkaline conditions, and has an adsorption maximum at 640 nm (pH 11.5–14). Sucrose gradients Samples of droplets were subjected to sedimentation or flotation in sucrose gradients as reported earlier (Siemieniewicz et al., 2007). Samples (35 µl) were loaded onto a gradient (360 µl) if 30% to 5% sucrose (in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4), which had been placed onto a cushion (50 µl) of 50% sucrose in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Alternatively, the sample was adjusted to 40% sucrose, and overloaded with a gradient of 30% to 5% sucrose. Centrifugation was performed at 60.000 r.p.m. (≈ 132.000 g) in the TLA 120.1 rotor of the Beckmann mini‐ultracentrifuge for 60 min. Portions of 35 µl were taken subsequently from the top to bottom. Analysis of proteins A small portion (30 µl) from droplets or fractions obtained after sedimentation was subjected to electrophoresis (12.5% SDS‐PAGE). Each protein‐containing band was carefully cut out individually. After in‐gel digestion with trypsin, the generated peptides were separated by HPLC (reversed phase C18 column), and inline subjected to an ESI‐ion source mass spectrometer (Bruker HCT). The archived data were compared with a protein databank (Swissport) via Mascot software package. The identified protein sequences were further analysed for their domains as well as the corresponding genes. Analyses of samples without treatment or after staining with fluorescent dyes Portions of plates containing droplets (see Fig. 1A) were photographed (Canon Power Shot G2) using a macro lens (dioptre value of +4). Individual small droplets (on a plate, see Fig. 1B) were inspected with the Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Achroplan 4×, NA 0.10) and photographed (Canon EOS 450D). To visualize the life/dead status of hyphae, the dyes SYTO9 and propidium iodine are in use (Siemieniewicz and Schrempf, 2007). A mixture of propidium iodine and SYTO9 was prepared in Hepes as indicated by the manufacturer (Molecular probes) and injected directly (∼0.5 µl) into the droplets. After incubation for 40 min, samples were analysed with the Laser scanning microscope (510 Meta/Zeiss) equipped with a Zeiss Plan Neofluar objective as described earlier. After excitation at 488 nm, detection of hyphae (green fluorescence, containing SYTO9 within DNA) followed at 500–530 nm (Meschke and Schrempf, 2010). Hyphae, which had taken up propidium iodine into their DNA, had a red fluorescence, which was detected in the presence of the LP 560 nm filter following excitation at 543 nm. Areas, which contained both types of hyphae, resulted in a merged (yellow) fluorescence (see Fig. 1C). Transmission electron microscopy Samples of the droplets (5–10 µl) were either used directly or pre‐treated for 15 min with glutaraldehyde (0.25%). Samples were placed onto carbon‐covered Cu or Ni grids (300 mesh, Plano). After removal of the excess of liquid, neutralized phosphotungstic acid (3% w/v) was added for 1 min. Then, the grids were rinsed on drops of distilled water (Hegermann et al., 2006). Air‐dried samples were analysed in a Zeiss EM 902A and imaged using a digitalized camera. Cryo‐electron microscopy Samples (5 µl) were directly taken from droplets and applied to glow‐discharged quantifoil copper grids (Plano; diameter of holes 2 µm). A volume of 3.5 µl of a suspension containing 10 nm gold clusters was added from the backside of the grid, blotted to remove water except for a thin film, and immediately plunged into liquid ethane (≈ −170°C) for embedding in vitreous ice for cryo‐electron microscopy, essentially following the procedure described in Hoffmann and colleagues (2008). Frozen grids were either stored in LN2 or immediately inspected in a transmission electron microscope (Polara G2; FEI, Eindhoven, the Netherlands), equipped with a field emission gun and a postcolumn energy filter (HR_GIF or GIF 2000), at liquid nitrogen temperature. The microscopes were operated at 300 keV and a magnification of 41 000×, corresponding to pixel sizes of 0.55 nm or 0.31 nm on the specimen level. Zero‐loss images were recorded using 2048 × 2048 postGIF CCD arrays (Gatan). Tilt series were taken between ±60° with 2° angle increments at −3.5 to −5 µm defocus and a total dose of < 100 e‐/Å2. The images were aligned by means of gold beads as fiducial markers. Three‐dimensional reconstructions were calculated by weighted backprojection using the TOM toolbox (Nickell et al., 2005). The data were binned once or processed in original resolution. Statistical analyses of density distributions in tomograms of vesicles were performed as follows. Subareas of a number of z‐slices from a particular structure (e.g. vesicle interior) from a three‐dimensional data set were extracted and the common mean value and variance of voxel values calculated. The variances of four different tomogram areas (three vesicles and the background) were compared by means of the Bartlett test (homogeneity of variances). The result was highly significant (P << 0.001), i.e. the variances could not be considered as statistically identical. Therefore, the data sets could not be investigated by means of variance analysis (anova). As an alternative, histograms (separated into 10 bins) of voxel values from various equally sized subareas (60 × 85 voxels, resulting in 5100 data points each) in the same z‐slice were compared by the Chi‐square test for homogeneity, assuming that the voxel values of all subareas follow the same distribution (H0 hypothesis).
