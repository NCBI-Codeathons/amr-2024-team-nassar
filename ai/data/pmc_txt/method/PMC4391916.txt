Materials and Methods Isolation and Total DNA extraction of Serratia marcescens FS14 Serratia marcescens FS14 was isolated in May 2009 from an Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz plant infected by Fusarium oxysporum in Jiangsu Province, China. A single isolate was grown in LB media and incubated at 28°C until they reached the exponential growth phase. The bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation and their genomic DNA was extracted according to the JGI bacterial DNA isolation CTAB protocol (http://my.jgi.doe.gov/general/protocols/JGI-Bacterial-DNA-isolation-CTAB-Protocol-2012.pdf). Antibiotic-sensitivity tests Antibiotic-sensitivity tests were performed by spreading bacterial suspensions on culture plates [18] and applying discs impregnated with different antibiotics (Hangzhoutianhe, China) including gentamycin (10 μg), penicillin G (10 IU), tetracycline (30 μg), rifampicin (5 μg), novobiocin (30 μg), neomycin (30 μg), spectinomycin (100 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), amoxicillin (10 μg), acetylspiramycin (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), kanamycin (30 μg) and polymyxin B sulfate (300 μg). For all the above tests, each plate was incubated at 28°C for 24 hours under aerobic condition and the zones of inhibition were interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were performed in triplicate. Pyrosequencing and complete genome assembly of S. marcescens FS14 To confirm the purity of S. marcescens FS14 genomic DNA, the 16S rDNA-specific region was amplified and 20 individual positive clones were sequenced by Genetic Analyzer 3130 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, US). BLASTn analysis [19] revealed that the S. marcescens FS14 16S rDNA sequence has a high similarity to that of species from the genus of Serratia available on GenBank. The quality of genomic DNA was evaluated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and Nanodrop2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, US), and the quantity was evaluated by the Quant-iT Picogreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen). A whole genome shotgun library was generated with 500ng of S. marcescens FS14 genomic DNA. The shotgun sequencing procedure was performed using a Roche GS Junior Rapid Library Preparation Kit, per the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). In addition, an 8kb span paired end library was generated with 15μg of S. marcescens FS14 genomic DNA. The paired end sequencing procedure was performed using a Roche GS Junior Paired End Library Preparation Kit, per the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). One shotgun run and two paired end runs were performed on individual libraries prepared with the same genomic DNA sample. After sequencing, the raw data was assembled by Newbler 2.7 (Roche) with default parameters using paired end reads as an orientation guide. Primer pairs were designed along sequences flanking the gap regions and PCR gap-filling was followed by Sanger sequencing. The complete genome of S. marcescens FS14 was submitted to NCBI, GenBank accession number is CP005927, and it is publicly available for download at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP005927. Genome annotation Genome annotation and analysis of S. marcescens FS14 was performed using NCBI Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP) [20]. BLASTp [19] was applied to align the amino acid sequences against the COG database [21], VFDB database [22], and ARDB database [23]. Amino acid sequences with an alignment length over 90% of its own length and over 40% match identity (sequences annotated against COG database were filtered using over 20% match identity) were chosen and the descriptions of the best hits (with the highest alignment length percentage and match identity) were assigned as annotations of the predicted genes. All predicted amino acid sequences of S. marcescens FS14 were submitted to the KEGG database [24] for automatic pathway annotation (http://www.genome.jp/kaas-bin/kaas_main). All annotated pathways were manually downloaded and curated by in-house Perl scripts. PHAST (PHAge Search Tool)[25], available at http://phast.wishartlab.com/ was used for prophage identification. Genomic islands were predicted through IslandViewer [26] using the IslandPath-DIMOB method [27]. Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analysis For phylogenomic analysis, 11 complete genomic sequences of Serratia spp. (S. marcescens WW4 [CP003959], S. marcescens Db11 [HG326223], S. marcescens FGI 94 [CP003942], S. proteamaculans 568 [CP000826], S. plymuthica AS13 [CP002775], S. plymuthica AS9 [NC_015567], S. plymuthica AS12 [NC_015566], S. plymuthica S13 [CP006566], S. plymuthica 4Rx13 [CP006250], S. liquefaciens ATCC27592 [CP006252], and S. fonticola RB-25 [CP007044]) were downloaded from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/). The genomic sequence of Serratia symbiotica Cinara cedri uid82363 has a genome size of only 1.8 Mb due to its endosymbiotic nature [28]; therefore, it was not included in the analysis. The orthologous genes were identified using BLAT [29] to match and align S. marcescens FS14 (CP005927) CDSs to all annotated genes from other Serratia spp. genomes. BLAT hits that were presented as single copies in Serratia spp. and cover over 90% of alignment length of FS14 genes were considered core genes. All of the core genes were aligned by MUSCLE [30] and randomly concatenated together. Finally, the phylogenomic tree was generated using these concatenated aligned genes with the GTR+G+I substitution model by MrBayes [31]. The chain length was set to 10,000,000 (1 sample/1000 generations). The first 2,000 samples were discarded as burn in after scrutinizing the trace files of two independent runs with Tracer v1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). Since S. plymuthica AS9, AS12 and AS13 share a very high similarity, AS13 was chosen as the representative for all the following comparative analyses. Pan genome analysis was performed using reciprocal BLAT between the ten Serratia spp. genomes, and the number of orthologs shared between them was calculated by in-house Perl scripts. Genomes of S. marcescens were aligned by Mauve [32] with Progressive Mauve [33] based on default parameters for investigation of potential genomic rearrangements. The molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (MEGA5) [34] based on the Poisson correction model [35] with concatenated amino acid sequences of two proteins, GyrB and RpoD, which are conserved in bacteria. They were retrieved from 16 different strains of Serratia and an E. coli K-12 publicly accessible on GenBank. A bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 100 replicates was chosen. The multiple alignments of protein sequences were built by CLUSTALW [36]. The same procedures and models were applied to a dataset consisting of 8 concatenated proteins—PigA(RedW), PigC(RedH), PigF(RedI), PigG(RedO), PigH(RedN), PigI(RedM), PigK(RedY) and PigM(RedV), all of which are homologues among different prodiginine-producing bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of the Type III secretion system (T3SS) was performed based on a previous study [37]. Representatives of bacteria with T3SS were chosen to perform the phylogenetic analysis of T3SSs in Serratia. The multiple alignments of the T3SS ATPase sequences were built by CLUSTALW [36], and then a ML tree was constructed based on the Poisson correction model [35] with a bootstrap value of 100 by MEGA5 [34]. The T6SSs of Serratia were manually identified and the synteny study of the T6SS clusters was performed based on SyntTax [38] using default parameters and followed by manual confirmation. Bacterial and fungal antagonistic bioassays All biological samples involved in the bioassays designed to investigate the antibacterial and antifungal activities of S. marcescens FS14 were collected in Jiangsu province, China. The bacterial isolate, Ralstonia solanacearum NJ (RSNJ), was isolated from a tomato plant. The phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum was isolated from the same plant that S. marcescens FS14 was isolated from, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was isolated from an infected Brassica napus ZY5. For fungal antagonistic assays, each fungus was grown for four days at 28°C and a 0.5cm-diameter agar with mycelia was cut and placed at a spot 2 cm away from the edge of the PDA plate. The overnight culture of FS14 was streaked across the middle of the plate [39]. Controls were set up without FS14. Fungal growth was observed for one week. All assays were performed in triplicate. To prepare for the antibacterial competition assay, bacterial cultures were grown overnight in improved nutrient broth (1% glucose, 0.5% tryptone, 0.05% yeast extract and 0.3% beef extract) and adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5. For the biofilm culture, FS14 and RSNJ were mixed at a ratio of 1:1. 25μl of this mixture was spotted onto agar plates and incubated at 28°C. After 8-hour incubation, biofilm samples were recovered from the spot for quantification using sterile metal loops and then re-suspended in 1 ml improved nutrient broth. The recovery of viable cells is reported as the total number of recovered cells per biofilm co-culture spot. The control mixture was set up without FS14 and contained a 1:1 ratio of sterile nutrient broth to RSNJ. For the planktonic culture, FS14 and R. solanacearum NJ cells were adjusted to an OD600 of 0.1 and equal volumes (15 ml) of FS14 and RSNJ were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 in a 150 ml flask and cultured in a shaking incubator (200rpm at 28°C). One milliliter of culture was collected for quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours after incubation. Then the quantities of FS14 and RSNJ were measured by serial dilutions and presented as Log CFU (colony-forming unit)/ml. Serial diluted samples were plated out on improved nutrient agar (w/v 1.5%) plates and CFU was counted after an incubation of 48 hours at 28°C. FS14 and RSNJ can be distinguished by color and antibiotic selection. Samples containing only FS14 or RSNJ were set up as controls. Cell number of each bacterium spotted onto the biofilm coculture plate at t = 0 hour is ~1 x 106, and concentration of each bacterium in the planktonic coculture at t = 0 hour is ~1.2 x 106 CFU/ml. Three independent experiments were performed for each assay.
