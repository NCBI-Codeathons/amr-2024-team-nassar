2.1. Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions and Routine Procedures Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A and Rhodococcus sp. IB201691-2A2 were isolated during this work. Streptomyces albus J1074 was used as a host for the heterologous expression of the baikalomycin biosynthetic gene cluster [32]. For the routine cloning, Escherichia coli XL1Blue (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) has been used and intergenic conjugation was carried out with E. coli ET12567 (pUB307) [33]. S. cerevisiae BY4742 was used for transformation-associated recombination cloning [34]. E. coli strains were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth. Actinobacteria strains were cultured on soya flour mannitol agar (MS) medium and in liquid tryptic soy broth medium (TSB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). If necessary, the following antibiotics have been added: apramycin (50 µg·mL−1), spectinomycin (100 µg·mL−1), phosphomycin (100 µg·mL−1) and carbenicillin (100 µg·mL−1) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The chromogenic substrate X-gluc with 100 µg·mL−1 concentration was used to detect the GUS (β-glucuronidase) activity. Plasmid and total DNA isolation, E. coli transformation and E. coli/Streptomyces intergeneric conjugation were performed according to standard protocols [35,36]. S. cerevisiae BY4742 was transformed with the standard LiAc protocol [36]. Enzymes, including restriction endonucleases, ligase, Taq DNA polymerase, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, were used according to manufacturer’s recommendations (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
