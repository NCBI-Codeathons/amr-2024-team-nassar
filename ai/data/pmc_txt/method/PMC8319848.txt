Materials and Methods Bacterial Genomes, Subspecies Identification and Genome Quality All publicly available genome sequences of B. animalis subsp. lactis (50 strains including the type strain DSM 10140) and B. animalis subsp. animalis (8 strains including the type strain ATCC 25527) were downloaded from the NCBI microbe genome database on the 21st of November 2019 (Sayers et al., 2019). Subspecies identification was either obtained from previously published articles (Lugli et al., 2019) or performed by employing the rpoA and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence. A >98% identity to the type strain genes was used as threshold and the genes should furthermore be different from the type strain of a related subspecies, in this case B. animalis subsp. animalis, as shown through a phylogenetic tree (data not shown). The sequence quality was assessed and sequences with an average coverage of ≥30× and a contig number below 120 were considered acceptable for phylogenetic analysis. The quality of the genomes was also evaluated by checking that the length of the sequenced genome corresponds with the expected length of the genome, based on the type strain (Milani et al., 2014). Other bifidobacterial species, which have been shown to harbor tet(W) (Ammor et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2017) were also downloaded from the NCBI microbe genome database on the 21st of November 2019 and included B. longum (14 strains, type strain NCTC11818), B. thermophilum (6 strains, type strain DSM 20212), B. bifidum (11 strains, type strain ATCC 29521), B. pseudolongum (4 strains, type strain DSM 20099), B. pseudocatenulatum (3 strains, type strain DSM 20438) and B. breve (41 strains, type strain NCTC 11815). All tet(W) sequences from other genera where the gene have been described (Scott et al., 1997; Chopra and Roberts, 2001; Flórez et al., 2006; Kazimierczak et al., 2006; Ammor et al., 2008; Palmieri et al., 2011; Schröder et al., 2012) and shared identity to the tet(W) gene found in B. animalis subsp. lactis were also downloaded from NCBI on the 21st of November 2019. Screening for tet(W), Genome Annotation and Examination of Sequences Flanking tet(W) ResFinder (Zankari et al., 2012), with a 80% identity threshold, was used to search for the presence of tet(W) in the examined genomes and the Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology (RAST) server with default settings was used to annotate the genomes. The annotated genomes were downloaded in GenBank format from the RAST server (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014) and imported to CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (Qiagen Bioinformatics, Aarhus, Denmark), where the presence of tet(W), its flanking genes and presence of mobile genetic elements was examined. tet(W) nucleotide and protein sequences was extracted from the annotated genomes for further phylogenetic analysis. GC content of tet(W) and other genes was assessed by employing the DNA/RNA GC Content Calculator at ENDMEMO (Endmemo, 2020). ISFinder The blastN tool available at ISFinder (Siguier et al., 2006) with default settings was used to determine the identity of the mobile genetic protein next to tet(W) in B. animalis subsp. lactis and its sequence was used to search for its presence in other genomic regions in the B. animalis subsp. lactis genomes, which was performed in CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (Qiagen Bioinformatics, Aarhus, Denmark). tet(W) Nucleotide and Amino Acid Phylogenetic Analysis The phylogenetic analysis of tet(W) included both the nucleotide and protein sequences from B. animalis subsp. lactis (Supplementary Table 1) and tet(W) genes found in other bifidobacterial species and other genera where the presence of tet(W) previously have been published (Table 1) (Scott et al., 1997; Chopra and Roberts, 2001; Flórez et al., 2006; Kazimierczak et al., 2006; Ammor et al., 2008; Palmieri et al., 2011; Schröder et al., 2012). The nucleotide and protein tet(W) sequences was either extracted from the annotated genomes or from NCBI (Sayers et al., 2019). tet(W) encoded by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

ClustalX2 (Larkin et al., 2007) was used to perform a pairwise multiple alignment of the tet(W) sequences (Higgins and Sharp, 1988) and BioEdit (Hall, 1999) was used to remove gaps and unpaired ends. The nucleotide phylogeny was built by evolutionary analysis by the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model by MEGA X (Tamura and Nei, 1993; Kumar et al., 2018) and the amino acid phylogeny was built by evolutionary analysis by Maximum Likelihood method and JTT matrix-based model also by MEGA X (Jones et al., 1992; Kumar et al., 2018). Number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) was obtained from the multiple alignment output from MEGA X that was used to build the phylogenetic relationships. Core Genome Phylogeny The genomes, either fully assembled or contigs were annotated by Prokka, which annotates genomes through the use of different tools including Prodigal (coding sequences), RNAmmer (Ribosomal RNA genes), Aragorn (Transfer RNA genes), SignalP (Signal leader peptides) and Infernal (Non-coding RNA) (Seemann, 2014). Prokka annotation is a requirement for using Roary, since the .gff file (file containing sequences and annotations) provided by Prokka is used by Roary to create a multi-FASTA alignment of all the core genes (Page et al., 2015). Roary was set to perform nucleotide alignment using MAFFT and a Blastp percentage identity at 80% (Katoh, 2002). FastTree was used to produce an approximately maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree from the core gene alignment file, which was visualized by MEGA X (Price et al., 2009, 2010; Kumar et al., 2018).
