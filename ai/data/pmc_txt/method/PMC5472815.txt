MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and susceptibility testing. P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 was purchased from LGC Standards and was grown at 28°C in PS broth (1% [wt/vol] glucose, 0.5% [wt/vol] tryptone, 0.5% [wt/vol] meat extract, 0.5% [wt/vol] NaCl [pH 7.0]) except where indicated. Escherichia coli JM109 was purchased from Promega and was grown at 37°C in LB medium except where indicated. Antibiotics and metal salts were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, United Kingdom) or Melford (Ipswich, United Kingdom). All antibiotic susceptibility testing followed the methods described by the BSAC (47), except that Mueller-Hinton II agar (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for disc diffusion assays and PS broth was used for broth microdilution assays. Breakpoints were taken from BSAC methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing version 14 (30). For disc diffusion assays, antibiotic discs (a maximum of 3 per plate) were prepared using 5-mm filter paper discs impregnated with 5 μl of antibiotic stock solution. Metal susceptibility testing was performed only using broth microdilution assays, with 10, 1, or 0.001 mg ml−1 metal salt as the highest concentration on the plate. Antibiotic and metal susceptibility testing was performed at least in triplicate. Equivalent replicates for P. mesoacidophila and E. coli JM109 were performed on the same day using the same antibiotic stock solution. Genome analysis. Genomic DNA was prepared from a 3-ml overnight culture of P. mesoacidophila in tryptic soy broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 400 μl of 4 M guanidine isothiocyanate solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA extraction was performed using the Maxwell 16 automated nucleic acid purification system with the Maxwell Tissue DNA purification kit (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. The genome sequence was assembled from data obtained from two SMRT cells, with a PacBio RSII sequencer, using Canu 1.3 (48), polished using Quiver 2.1.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA), and circularized, where possible, using Circlator 1.2.1 (49). Gene annotations were made using PROKKA 1.11 (50) and RAST (51–53). Biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome were analyzed using AntiSMASH 3.0 (16). Graphical genome comparisons were obtained with EasyFig 2.2.2, and the ANI was calculated with pyani 0.2.1. A virtual machine hosted by the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) consortium (54) was used to perform genome assembly, annotation, and comparisons. The sequences of six MLST alleles (trpB, recA, lepA, gyrB, gltB, and atpD) from P. mesoacidophila and six available B. ubonensis genomes were concatenated and aligned. Publicly available complete B. ubonensis genomes, deposited by Northern Arizona University, were downloaded from NCBI BioProject accession number PRJNA279182. The corresponding loci from 26 Burkholderia species were downloaded from the Burkholderia MLST database (http://pubMLST.org). A phylogeny was reconstructed with Geneious 7.1.9 Tree Builder, using the Tamura-Nei genetic distance model and the neighbor-joining tree-building method. Detection of inducible β-lactamase activity. Starter cultures of P. mesoacidophila and E. coli JM109 were each subcultured (1:50 dilution) into four 100-ml portions of fresh PS broth and were grown at 28°C. Once A600 values of ∼0.4 were attained, cefoxitin was added to give final concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 μg ml−1. Three hours after the addition of cefoxitin, a 25-ml aliquot was removed from each flask and the cells were lysed by sonication. The crude cellular lysate (100 μl) was then added to 200 μM nitrocefin solution in 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 μM ZnCl2 and 150 mM NaCl (900 μl), and the initial rate of hydrolysis was recorded by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 482 nm. Three repeats were obtained for each initial rate of hydrolysis, and the entire experiment was performed in triplicate. Detection of bulgecin activity. A 48-h culture of P. mesoacidophila in PS broth was subcultured (1:50 dilution) into PF broth (3% glycerol, 0.5% [wt/vol] tryptone, 0.5% [wt/vol] meat extract, 0.5% [wt/vol] NaCl, 0.1% [wt/vol] glucose, 0.1% [wt/vol] cysteine [pH 7.0]) and incubated for 78 h at 28°C, at 200 rpm. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and nutrients were replenished in the supernatant solution by the addition of 0.8% (wt/vol) nutrient broth 3 (i.e., 0.5% [wt/vol] tryptone and 0.3% [wt/vol] meat extract) (Sigma-Aldrich), 2% (wt/vol) glycerol, and 0.1% (wt/vol) glucose. All broths were readjusted to pH 7 and held at 4°C overnight. An overnight culture of E. coli JM109 in LB medium was subcultured (1:50 dilution) into fresh LB medium and grown at 37°C to an A600 value of ∼0.3, at 250 rpm. Cultures were centrifuged and the cell pellets were resuspended in the test broths. Cultures were then grown for an additional 4 h at 37°C, at 250 rpm. Cefuroxime (final concentration, 5 μg ml−1) was added to one of each pair of flasks after 30 min; 60 and 90 min after cefuroxime addition, aliquots were removed and cells were viewed by light microscopy using an Ultraphot microscope (Zeiss). These experiments were repeated four times. Accession number(s). The assembled genome sequence has been deposited at GenBank under accession numbers CP020737 to CP020740.
