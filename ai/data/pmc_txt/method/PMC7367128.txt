MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Escherichia coli uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), and endonuclease (Endo) IV were purchased from New England BioLabs. Escherichia coli AlkA was generously provided by Pat O’Brien (University of Michigan). Human AAGΔ83, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mag1, and Bacillus cereus AlkD were purified as previously described (22–24). Expression vectors pBG103 and pHD116 were from the Vanderbilt University Center for Structural Biology, and pSF-OBX11 was from Millipore Sigma. DNA oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S1) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Escherichia coli K-12 wild-type and knockout strains were purchased from the Keio E. coli knockout collection (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare). Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. AlkZ and YcaQ purification The ycaQ gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from E. coli K-12 MG1655 cells and cloned into pBG103. His6-SUMO-YcaQ was overexpressed in E. coli Tuner (DE3) cells at 16°C for 18 hr in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed with sonication and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Clarified lysate was passed over Ni-NTA agarose equilibrated in buffer A [50 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol] and protein eluted in 250 mM imidazole/buffer A. Protein fractions were pooled and supplemented with 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) before incubation with ∼0.5 mg of Rhinovirus 3C protease (PreScission) at 4°C overnight. Cleaved protein was diluted 10-fold in buffer B [50 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.0, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA] and purified by heparin sepharose using a 0–1 M NaCl/buffer B linear gradient. Fractions were pooled and repassed over Ni-NTA agarose in buffer A, concentrated and filtered, and passed over Superdex 200 size exclusion resin equilibrated in buffer C [20 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA]. Protein was concentrated to 150 μM (AlkZ) or 10 μM (YcaQ), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. AlkZ and YcaQ mutants were generated using the Q5 Mutagenesis Kit (New England BioLabs). Mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified the same as wild-type. Synthesis of NM8 2,2′-(Ethane-1,2-diylbis(methylazanediyl))bis(ethan-1-ol) (1) was synthesized as follows. In a dry round bottom flask were placed 2-(methylamino)ethan-1-ol (24 g, 0.32 mol), 1,2-dibromoethane 30 g, 0.19 mol), potassium carbonate (44 g, 0.32 mol), and dry ethanol (200 ml). The reaction mixture was refluxed overnight, cooled, and half of the solvent was removed under vacuum in a rotary evaporator. The solid was filtered off and washed with dry ethanol. The solvents were removed under vacuum and the product distilled off at high vacuum to yield the product as a viscous liquid (4.6 g, bp 80–90°C at 15 mm Hg, 8%). Low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained on an Agilent series 1200 single quad ChemStation autosampler System using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode. HPLC was performed on an Accucore C18 column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 30 mm column) at 40°C, using a 40–90% acetonitrile/water with 0.1% trifluoracetic acid gradient for 1.5 min and a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. 1H-NMR (d4-MeOH; 400 MHz) δ 3.69 (tr, 4H, J = 4 Hz), 2.51 (tr, J = 4 Hz, 4H), 2.41 (s, 4H), 2.29 (s, 6H); MS (ESI): mass calcd. for C8H21N2O2, 177.2.; m/z found, 177.3 [M+H]+, Rf = 0.18. The NM8 compound, N1,N2-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N1,N2-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine (2), was synthesized as follows. A dry round bottom flask containing thionyl chloride was cooled to −20°C, and 2,2′-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(methylazanediyl))bis(ethan-1-ol) (4.6 gr, 0.026 mol) was added dropwise with vigorous stirring. The mixture was heated at 60°C for 2 hr, excess thionyl chloride was removed in vacuum by rotary evaporator, and the solid was dried at high vacuum for 30 min. The solid was recrystallized from acetone/methanol to give pure product as hydrochloride salt (1.3 g, 20%). 1H-NMR (d4-MeOH) δ 4.00 (tr, 4H, J = 8Hz), 3.60 (m, 8H), 2.96 (s, 6H); 13C-NMR (d4-MeOH) δ 57.3, 49.9, 39.8, 36.7 (Scheme 1). Scheme 1.Synthesis of NM8. Synthesis of NM8. Preparation of DNA substrates DNA substrates containing a single d7mG lesion and a 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) label within the sequence FAM-d(CACCACTACACC(7mG)ATTCCTTACAAC)/d(GTTGTAAGGAATCGGTGTAGTGGTG) were prepared as described previously (25). The mFaPy derivatives of 7mG-DNA and NM5-ICL-DNA were generated by treating 500 nM DNA with 100 mM NaOH at 37°C for 30 min, followed by re-adjusting to pH 7 with 100 mM HCl. The substrate to test excision of d7mG in proximity to an AP site was prepared by incubating unlabeled DNA with a sequence [d(GTTGTAAGGAUTCGGTGTAGTGGTC)] complementary to the FAM-labeled d7mG oligo with 1 U of UDG at 37°C for 30 min (Supplementary Figure S5B). AP-DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted and annealed to 12-fold molar excess of the complementary d7mG-DNA. Azinomycin B was obtained using the fermentation protocol established previously (26). Briefly, Streptomyces sahachiroi cultures were centrifuged at 7000 rpm at 4°C, cell pellets discarded, and the medium extracted with an equal volume of dichloromethane. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude extract was stored at −80°C and supplemented with 10% methanol prior to use. The presence of the AZB moiety was verified by HPLC-MS. AZB-ICLs were generated by annealing DNA with the sequence FAM-d(AAAAATAAAAGCCAAATAAAAATAAA) to the complementary oligo containing a 5′-Cyanine (Cy5) label. DNA (100 μM duplex) was incubated with 10 mg crude extract at 4°C on ice for 24 hr in the dark. The DNA was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter to remove debris from the extract and desalted using Illustra MicroSpin G25 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in TE buffer (10 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). AZB-DNA was purified by denaturing PAGE. Briefly, DNA was denatured at 55°C for 2 min in 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 80% (wt/vol) formamide, 0.5 mg/ml orange G and electrophoresed on a 15% (wt/vol) acrylamide/8 M urea denaturing gel pre-run in 0.5× TBE buffer. FAM (488 nm excitation, 526 nm emission) and Cy5 (633 nm excitation, 670 nm emission) fluorescence were detected from the gel using a Typhoon Trio variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). The band with the slowest electrophoretic mobility that contained both the FAM and Cy5 fluorescence was cut out and placed in 3500 MWCO dialysis tubing (Thermo Fischer Scientific) with 2 ml of 0.5× TBE, and the DNA electroeluted from the gel at 120 V for 1 hr. The ICL-DNA were concentrated to 4 μM using an Amicon Ultra-3K filter (3500 rpm, 4°C, 45 min), buffer exchanged into TE buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. NM-ICL DNA substrates were generated and purified similar to an established protocol (27). DNA with the sequence FAM-d(AAAAATAAAAGTCAAATAAAAATAAA) was annealed to the complementary Cy5-oligodeoxynucleotide at 100 μM duplex in 40 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0). Crosslinks were generated by incubating the DNA with 300 μM mechlorethamine•HCl or NM8 compound (2) for 3 hr at 37°C while shaking in the dark. Unreacted drug was removed using a G25 spin column equilibrated in TE buffer, and NM-ICL-DNA gel purified the same as AZB-DNA. Base excision assays In each glycosylase reaction, 1 μM enzyme was incubated with 100 nM FAM-DNA in glycosylase buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol] at 25°C. At various time points, 4-μl aliquots were added to 1 μl of either 1M NaOH and heated at 70°C for 2 min or 83 nM EndoIV and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. To test for AP lyase activity, the 4-μl aliquots were added to 1 μl glycosylase buffer and incubated at 70°C for 2 min. Samples were then denatured at 70°C for 5 min in 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 80% (wt/vol) formamide, 1 mg/ml blue dextran, and electrophoresed on a 20% (wt/vol) acrylamide/8 M urea sequencing gel at 40 W for 1 hr in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM borate, and 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0). Gels were imaged on a Typhoon Trio variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) using 488-nm excitation and 526-nm emission fluorescence, and bands were quantified with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). All excision assays were performed in triplicate. Base excision unhooking of AZB- and NM-ICLs used a modified version of the d7mG protocol. Positive controls for ICLs involved heating the lesions to 95°C for 5 min to fully depurinate the DNA, followed by work-up with either water or NaOH to nick the backbone. To perform β/δ-elimination of AP-DNA products, samples were incubated with either 0.2 M NaOH at 55°C for 2 min or 17 nM EndoIV at 37°C for 5 min. Samples were denatured at 55°C in loading buffer for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Gels were imaged for both FAM and Cy5 fluorescence and quantified individually. ICL unhooking was quantified by summing the individual FAM and Cy5 fluorescence intensities. The raw gels were artificially colored using Adobe Photoshop and overlaid using ImageJ software. Native PAGE analysis of AZB-ICL and NM-ICL excision products were carried out by suspending reaction mixtures in 2× native loading buffer [30% (vol/vol) glycerol, 4 mg/ml blue dextran, 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris•HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mM EDTA] and running on an 15% (wt/vol) acrylamide sequencing gel at 5 W for 3 hr. Double-stranded DNA standards were annealed in SSC buffer (300 mM NaCl and 30 mM trisodium citrate pH 7.0). Cellular assays Genetic knockouts of ycaQ and uvrA were obtained from the E. coli Keio knockout collection (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare) that contained a kanamycin resistance cassette in place of the endogenous gene. The kanamycin resistance cassettes were removed using a FLP recombinase expressed on a temperature-sensitive pCP20 plasmid (AmpR). ΔuvrA/ΔycaQ E. coli were generated by recombineering through knockout of ycaQ in λ-Red competent ΔuvrA cells (λ-Red carried on temperature-sensitive pKN208 plasmid- KanR). To generate E. coli growth curves, overnight cultures were diluted to 0.01 OD600 in LB supplemented with either 0 μM or 33 μM mechlorethamine in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. The plate was incubated at 30°C with shaking for 11 hr and cell density was measured at 600 nm every 20 min using a Bio-Tek Synergy 2 microplate reader. E. coli survival curves after MMS or mechlorethamine treatment were performed using a colony dilution assay. YcaQ was overexpressed from a modified pBG103 (KanR) vector and nfo (EndoIV) was overexpressed from a modified pHD116 (AmpR) vector, and expression confirmed by SDS-PAGE of cell lysates after IPTG induction (Supplementary Figure S6B). A saturated overnight culture from a single colony was diluted to 0.01 OD600 in fresh LB media and grown to 0.4 OD600 at 37°C, IPTG added to 100 μM, and the cells incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. The cells were transferred to fresh media and treated with various concentrations of either MMS or mechlorethamine for 2 hr at 37°C. Treated cells were transferred to fresh media, serially diluted by a factor of 10−5 or 10−6 in LB media, and 100 μl of diluted cells were plated on LB agar plates and grown at 37°C overnight. Colonies were counted the next morning and the CFU/ml of culture was determined. The percent survival was calculated as CFU/mlTreated/CFU/mlUntreated. Curves were fit to single exponential and EC50 values determined by the half-time, t1/2. For the genetic complementation experiments, ycaQ was expressed from a pSF-OBX11 (KanR) plasmid that allows for constitutive gene expression at intermediate levels, and LB media was supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin to retain the plasmid. Detection of gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR Saturated E. coli K-12 cultures from a single colony were diluted to 0.01 OD600 in LB media and grown at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.5, after which MMS (5 mM) or mechlorethamine (200 μM) was added and cultures grown at 37°C for an additional 2 hr. Cultures were lysed with TRIzol reagent and the RNA extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol/ethanol as in (28). Residual genomic DNA was removed from the RNA by treatment with DNase I (New England BioLabs). The RNA was re-extracted from the reaction mixture and quantified by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. The specificity of the primers and quality of the RNA was verified by agarose gel analysis of RT-PCR products (Supplementary Figure S6F). cDNA synthesis and qPCR were performed in a single step reaction using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step Kit (Bio-Rad) on a BioRad CFX-96 real-time PCR thermal cycler. The housekeeping gene used was gapA (Eco GAPDH). The results from the qPCR experiments were performed on three biologically replicated RNA extractions from both MMS and mechlorethamine treatments. The fold expression change was calculated using the formula: (fold expression change) = 2−ΔΔCt, where Ct is the cycle threshold for amplification above baseline, ΔCt = Ct (gene of interest) – Ct (housekeeping gene), and ΔΔCt = ΔCt (treated sample) – ΔCt (untreated sample).
