2. Methods and Materials 2.1. Isolation of Endophytes from Sugarcane Leaves The sugarcane leaves used for endophyte isolation were collected from the fields of South China Agricultural University. Surface sterilization of the leaves was performed following the established protocol: the leaves were washed thrice with sterilized ultra-pure water, then soaked in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 1 min, 100% ethanol for 1 min, 6.15% hypochlorite containing Tween-20 for 5 min, 3% hydrogen peroxide for 1 min, and rinsed thoroughly with sterilized ultra-pure water at least 5–6 times. The surface-sterilized leaves were ground and mixed with 1 mL of sterilized ultra-pure water, transferred to a 2 mL sterile centrifuge tube, centrifuged at a low speed, and then the supernatant was serially diluted (10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5) for plating on LB medium. The LB plates were incubated at 28 °C for 3–5 days, or until bacterial colonies appeared. 2.2. Genome Sequencing Genomic DNA extraction was carried out using Qiagen Genomic DNA Kit (10223). The size of DNA fragments was assessed by electrophoresis using 0.75% agarose gels. The quality of DNA was evaluated by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), using the standard requirement of OD260/280 between 1.8–2.0, and OD260/230 between 2.0–2.2. Qubit (Invitrogen, Singapore) was used for DNA quantification. For library construction, Bluepippin automatic nucleic acid recovery instrument (Sage Science) was used for large fragment recovery, and the purified DNA fragments were end-repaired and poly-A tails added. Sequencing libraries were generated using the Genomic DNA Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, SQK-LSK108). The library was loaded onto a flow cell (FLO-MIN106) and sequenced with GridION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). 2.3. Genomic Sequence Analysis Genome structure annotation: the genome was assembled by Canu (parameter: default; version 1.7.11) and then corrected by Pilon (parameter: default; v. 1.22). Coding genes were predicted by Prodigal (parameter: pnone-g11; v. 2.6.3), and the genes with complete open reading frames were preserved; tRNA genes were predicted by tRNAscan-SE (parameter: -b-i-m lsu, SSU, TSU; v. 2.0); rRNA genes were predicted by RNAmmer (parameter: SBAC; v. 1.2); other ncRNAs were predicted by Infernal (parameter: cut_ ga -rfam --nohmonly; v. 1.1.2), and only the predictions whose lengths were more than 80% of those of their best matches in the Rfam database were preserved; CRISPRs and gene islands were predicted using Minced (parameter: default; v. 0.3.0) and Islander (parameter: default; v. 1.2), respectively. Gene function annotation: translated protein sequences of all coding genes were analyzed by Interproscan (parameters: -appl Pfam, tigrfam, -iprloukup -goterms -t p –f tsv; v. 5.30–69.0), to identify protein domains and extract the corresponding GO annotations; BlastP (parameters: evalue 1 × 10−5 -outfmt ‘6 std qlen slen stitle ‘ -max_ target_seqs 5; v. 2.7.1+) was used identify best matches in KEGG and RefSeq databases (coverage greater than 30%); Rpsblast (parameter: -evalue 0.01 -SEG no -outfmt 5) was used to compare the encoded proteins to COG databases for annotation. BLAST was used to identify gene clusters, including gbn gene cluster, toxoflavin synthesis gene cluster, and QS homologous genes. CD-HIT (parameter: default; v. 4.6.1) was used to analyze core genes (identity ≥0.4, length of query sequence ≥0.4 × length of reference sequence). The phylogenetic tree of species was constructed based on the single-copy core genes, which were converted to the protein sequences and used for multiple protein sequence alignments with MUSCLE (parameter: default, v. 3.6), followed by the phylogenetic tree construction using PhyML (maximum likelihood estimate; parament: default, v. 3.0). Average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated by JSpeciesWS (based on ANIm, v. 3.4.8, http://jspecies.ribohost.com/jspeciesws/). 2.4. Fungal Strains and Culture Conditions Teliospores of the sugarcane smut fungus S. scitamineum collected from the fields in Guangdong province of China (21°12′36″ N; 101°10′12″ E) by Yan [15] were maintained at the Integrative Microbiology Research Centre (IMRC); and the MAT-1 or MAT-2 haploid sporidia isolated from such teliospores were used in this study. MAT-1 (eGFP) and MAT-2 (dsRed) generated by Yan [16] were also maintained at IMRC. The culture media used in this study includes YePSA (yeast extract 10 g/L, peptone 20 g/L, sugar 20 g/L, agar 15 g/L), PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar, MB-P1102, DingGuo, GuangZhou), and YePS liquid medium (yeast extract 10 g/L, peptone 20 g/L, sugar 20 g/L, pH = 7.0). P. Litchi, C. litchi, C. higginsianum, and F. oxysporum f. sp. strains used in the antagonism experiments were from Z. Jiang or E. Zhou lab; M. oryzae was from the Deng group. The culture medium used to grow C. litchi, C. higginsianum, and F. oxysporum f. sp strains was PDA; for M. oryzae complete medium [17]; and for P. litchi carrot juice agar (CJA) medium [18]. Fungal mycelia were cultured at 28 °C, in constant darkness, with or without CGB10 confrontation culture, for 3–5 d before photographing. 2.5. Assays for Antifungal Activity For antagonistic tests, CGB10 was grown in liquid LB medium for 12 h, and 2 μL of CGB10 culture was inoculated in the center of a PDA plate, surrounded by three pieces of fungal (M. oryzae, P. Litchi, C. litchi, C. higginsianum, and F. oxysporum f. sp.) mycelial plugs. For antagonism between CGB10 and S. scitamineum, sporidia of MAT-1 (+) and MAT-2 (−) mating-types were individually grown in liquid YePS medium to reach OD600 ≈ 1.0, then mixed with equal volume and 2 μL of such sporidial mixture was spotted onto PDA plate to surround the CGB10 inoculum. The fungal antagonism assays were performed in constant darkness at 28 °C for three days, before photographing. Three biological repeats, each containing three replicates were performed for each CGB10-fungus combination. 2.6. S. Scitamineum Teliospore Germination Assay CGB10 or E. coli (as negative control) was pre-inoculated on a layer of cellophane on top of the PDA medium for 48 h, then the layer of bacterial inoculation was removed, leaving only the secretion from the bacteria in the growth medium, before inoculation of S. scitamineum teliospores on this plate. The S. scitamineum teliospores collected from the diseased canes were suspended in 1 mL of sterilized water, and serially diluted 10, 102, 103, and 104 times. A 20 μL suspension of the teliospores at each dilution was streaked on the PDA plate, with or without the pre-treatment of liquid-cultured CGB10 or E. coli. The teliospores cultured on the PDA plates were incubated at 28 °C in constant dark conditions for 3 days for germination and promycelium formation. This experiment was repeated thrice, and each treatment contained three technical replicates. Representative images were taken with teliospores at 104 dilution. 2.7. Detection of Toxoflavin in B. gladioli CGB10 CGB10 was cultured on PDA medium at 28 °C for 2 days, and the medium was soaked in ethyl acetate for crude extraction. The organic layer of the stratified solution was carefully transferred to the rotary evaporator for distillation until fully dry. The dried residue was dissolved in about 1 mL of methanol (grade: AR). Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed with the following settings: mobile phase: 0.1% formic acid water (v/v): methanol (grade: LC, methanol gradient: 0–20 min, 5–100%, 20–40 min, 100–10%); flow rate: 0.3 mL/min; retention time: about 40 min. Mass spectrometry (MS) conditions: all products were scanned by FTMS mode (Q Exactive Focus; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, Germany). 2.8. Extracellular Hydrolytic Enzymatic Activity Test The composition of media for semiquantitative analysis of enzymatic activities followed established protocols [19]: Pel (pectate lyase) assay medium contains 10.0 g/L of polygalacturonic acid (PGA), 10.0 g/L of yeast extract, 8.0 g/L of agarose, 0.1125 g/L of CaCl2, and 4.8448 g/L of Tris-HCl, pH = 8.5; Cel (cellulase) assay medium contains 1.0 g/L of carboxymethyl cellulase, 8.0 g/L of agarose, and 3.8 g/L of sodium phosphate, pH =) 7.0 [20]; Peh (polygalacturonase) assay medium contains 5.0 g/L of PGA, 2 g/L of sucrose, (NH4)2SO4 and 15 g/L of agar, pH = 5.5 [21]; and Prt (protease) assay medium contains 10.0 g/L of skimmed milk, 5.0 g/L of Bacto tryptone, 2.5 g/L of yeast extract, and 5.0 g/L of NaCl. For preparing the enzymatic assays, 10 mL of assay medium was poured into each 10 cm circular plate, and wells of 5 mm in diameter were punched post solidification. Bacterial cells were cultured in liquid LB medium to reach OD600 ≈ 1.0, and 20 µL of such bacterial culture was applied to each well. The plates were incubated at 28 °C for 12 h before Pel and Peh assay plates stained with 4 M HCl, and the Cel assay plates stained with 0.1% Congo red and 1 M NaCl [21,22,23]. Halos around the wells due to protease activity became visible in Prt assay plates within 24 h without any further treatment. 2.9. Assessment of Bacterial Pathogenicity to Plants Pathogenicity assays using the potato tuber slices (left panel) or onion bulbs were performed using established protocols [21,22,23,24,25]. Twenty μL bacterial culture was added to the surface of plant material and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, before examination of disease symptoms and documentation. Rice seed germination assay was performed as described [19]. Seeds of the rice cultivar Co-39 were soaked in 20 mL of the bacterial culture (normalized to 104 CFU/mL) at room temperature for 5 h, followed by three washes with sterilized water, and transferred to moistened Whatman filter paper in a Petri dish for germination. Dishes were kept in an incubator set to 28 °C and 16 h light: 8 h dark cycle conditions. Rice seeds soaked with the same amount of sterile water served as a blank (negative) control. The experiment was repeated thrice, each of which contained 3 replicates. 2.10. Field Experiment for CGB10 Biocontrol of Sugarcane Smut A disease garden was established by pouring fermented S. scitamineum MAT-1 + MAT-2 sporidial mixture to reach an estimated inoculum of 106 cells/cm2, in March 2019, before planting sugarcane. The smut disease appeared in the seedlings in July 2019. The sugarcane was harvested in September and allowed to re-germinate (first stubble canes) and poured with CGB10 fermentation product (2 × 106 cell/cm2) in three randomized plots. The disease symptoms were examined in November. Each plot contained approximately 700 canes out of 200–300 clumps, and in total 2253 canes from 580 clumps, in either control plots or CGB10-treated plots. The occurrence of smut disease was calculated as a percentage of diseased canes/total canes, following an established method [26] with minor modifications.
