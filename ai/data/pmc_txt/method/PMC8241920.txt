Materials and Methods Fungal Strains, Culture Conditions, and DNA Extraction The wild-type strain Monascus ruber M7 (CCAM 070120, Culture Collection of the State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, China Center for Type Culture Collection, Wuhan, China) (Chen and Hu, 2005; Liu et al., 2014; Liu J. et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017, 2019; Li et al., 2020) and its derivatives used in this study are listed in Table 1. For the generation of the ΔmrpigAup1, ΔmrpigAup2, ΔmrpigPdown1, and ΔmrpigPdown2 strains, initial transformants were selected on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium containing 30 μg/mL hygromycin B (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China) at 28°C. For phenotypic characterization, all the tested strains were cultivated in triplicates on PDA plates at 28°C for 10 d. Fungal genomic DNA was isolated from mycelia grown on cellophane membranes covering PDA plates, using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Shao et al., 2009). Monascus ruber strains used in this study. Strain Parent Genotype References. M. ruber M7 – Wild-type Chen and Hu, 2005. ΔmrpigAup2 M. ruber M7 ΔmrpigAup2::hph This study.

Bioinformatic Methods The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the genomes of nine strains of filamentous fungi, including M. ruber M7, were retrieved from the Broad Institute3 and GenBank4, as shown in Supplementary Table 1. To predict the MonAzPs gene cluster boundaries, the predicted proteomes encoded by these genome sequences were subjected to comprehensive pairwise comparisons (Takeda et al., 2014). Briefly, pairwise similarities among the deduced proteome of M. ruber M7 and the other species were determined first, to detect orthologous, co-located genes that may form a BGC “seed” region (e < 1.0e–10; gap penalty: −0.2; and mismatch penalty: −0.2; Figures 1A,B). In the second step, the seed region was extended and the boundaries of the extended BGC were trimmed (extension length: 35 genes; negative penalty: −0.3; Figures 1C,D), as previously described (Takeda et al., 2014). FIGURE 1Motif-independent comparative genomic prediction of the MonAzPs BGC boundaries.

Dashed lines, gene pairs encoding homologous proteins (e < 1.0e–10 for the encoded proteins). Due to mis-annotation, XP_002149763 is described in NCBI as a separate gene; however, this nucleotide sequence is in fact part of the XP_002149764 gene. (B) Local protein sequence alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Pairs of contiguous genes encoding MrPigG to MrPigK in M. ruber M7 and from XP_002149762 to XP_002149767 in T. marneffei ATCC 18224 form the seed region (R0) for predicting the MonAzPs BGC. SW scores shown were calculated as described (Takeda et al., 2014). (C) Extension of the gene cluster. The seed region (R0) was extended to include a total of 35 genes (Takeda et al., 2014). The symbols Ix and Iy represent the stretches of genes added to the seed region in the M. ruber M7 and the T. marneffei ATCC 18224 genomes, respectively. (D) Trimming of the BGC boundaries. ibegin and iend, the locations of the genes at the beginning and end, respectively, of the MonAzPs gene cluster in M. ruber M7; jbegin and jend, the corresponding gene locations in T. marneffei ATCC 18224.

CB values are the maximum cumulative SW scores of the predicted BGCs with the upstream and the downstream boundaries indicated (Takeda et al., 2014). 100–kb sequences flanking the MonAzPs polyketide synthase MrPigA (Xie et al., 2015) in the genome of M. ruber M7 were submitted to antiSMASH 5.0 (Blin et al., 2019), and PRISM (Skinnider et al., 2020) for SM gene cluster characterization. The MIBiG 2.0 curated repository for SM BGCs was also considered (Kautsar et al., 2020). The SMURF5 and CASSIS servers6 could not be accessed, or returned uncharacterized errors. The amino acid sequences encoded by the genes were deduced using FGENESH7, and analyzed using Pfam 27.08. Similarities of the deduced amino acid sequence were analyzed using BLASTP9. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) Analysis The wild-type M. ruber M7 and the pathway-specific regulator knockout strain ΔmrpigB were cultured in PDB medium with shaking at 180 rpm for 6 days at 28°C (start of the active production phase for MonAzPs). RT-qPCR was performed by Wuhan Goodbio Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, Hubei, China) as described by Liu et al. (2014). For both the wild-type and ΔmrpigB strains, three biological replicates were analyzed, and for each sample, three technical replicates for each targeted gene were performed. GADPH was used as the reference gene, and the relative expression fold-change was calculated using the comparative CT method. Significance analysis was performed using the one-way ANOVA test and significance level was set as 0.05. The used primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Gene Knockouts M. ruber M7 knockout strains ΔmrpigA, ΔmrpigO, and ΔmrpigP have been described (Xie et al., 2013, 2015; Chen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020). For the deletion of the mrpigAup1 gene, a gene disruption cassette carrying the hygromycin B resistance gene (hph) flanked by targeting arms (TA) derived from the 5′ or 3′regions of mrpigAup1, respectively, was prepared using the double-joint PCR method (Yu et al., 2004). Briefly, the 5′ and 3′flanking regions (910 and 893 bp, respectively) of the mrpigAup1 gene were amplified with the primer pairs P1–P2 and P3–P4, respectively. The 2.1 kb hph cassette was amplified from plasmid pSKH (He et al., 2013) with the primer pair P7–P8. The PCR products were purified with a TransGen gel purification kit (TransGen, Beijing, China), the three amplicons were mixed at a 1:1:2 molar ratio, then fused by PCR using primer pair P1–P4. The fused PCR product was purified, cloned into pMD19–T (Takara, Dalian, Japan), and confirmed by sequencing. The disruption cassette was then transferred from the resulting plasmid into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pCAMBIA3300 (He et al., 2013) to generate plasmid pCPIGAUP1. Analogous strategies were used to generate the pCPIGAUP2, pCPIGPDOWN1, and pCPIGPDOWN2 plasmids for the deletion of mrpigAup2, mrpigPdown1, and mrpigPdown2, respectively, using primers listed in Supplementary Table 3. The gene disruption plasmids were individually transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 (Hood et al., 1993) using the freeze-thaw method (Yu et al., 2003), and used for the transformation of M. ruber M7 to yield the gene knockout strains ΔmrpigAup1, ΔmrpigAup2, ΔmrpigPdown1, and ΔmrpigPdown2, using methods described previously (Shao et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011). Gene knockouts and the absence of the wild-type allele in the mutants were confirmed by PCR and end sequencing of the resulting amplicons. MonAzPs Analysis Freshly harvested spores (5 × 104) of representative isolates of the gene knockout strains, ΔmrpigAup1, ΔmrpigAup2, ΔmrpigA, ΔmrpigO, ΔmrpigP, ΔmrpigPdown1, ΔmrpigPdown2, and the wild-type strain M. ruber M7 were spread on cellophane membranes on PDA plates, and cultivated at 28°C for 10 days. The mycelia were harvested by scraping from the membranes, freeze-dried, and ground in a mortar with a pestle under liquid nitrogen. The mycelia powder (0.05 g) was suspended in 1.5 mL methanol, incubated at 65°C for 1 h, then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect the supernatant for analysis. HPLC was performed following the method described by Liu Q. et al. (2016) on a Waters system fitted with an Inertsil ODS–3 C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5.0 μm, GL Sciences). The mobile phases consisted of water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 0.5% phosphoric acid in water (C). The flow rate was kept at 0.8 mL/min. The system was run with the following gradient program: from 40 to 30% A for 3 min, from 30 to 5% A for 22 min, 5% A for 5 min, from 5 to 40% A for 1 min, and 40% A for 5 min. C was kept constant at 5% throughout the program. Absorbance was monitored with a 2487 UV/Vis Detector (Waters) at 190- to 700-nm wavelength. Metabolites were identified based on comparison to authentic standards (Chen et al., 2017, 2019). Accession Numbers The genes mrpigAup1, mrpigAup2, mrpigPdown1, and mrpigPdown2 of M. ruber M7 have been assigned GenBank accessions MH729876, MW557663, KC561931, and MW557664, respectively.
