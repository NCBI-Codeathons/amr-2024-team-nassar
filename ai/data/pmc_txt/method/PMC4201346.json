Amplification\nwas performed using the Advantage GC2 polymerase enzyme (Clontech)\nand the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C\nfor 3 min; 25 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 65\u201362 \u00b0C\nfor 30 s, 68 \u00b0C for 35 s; final extension temperature at 68 \u00b0C\nfor 5 min. Each PCR product was gel purified using the QIAquick gel\nextraction kit (Qiagen). Restriction digestion with NdeI/HindIII (New Englands Biolabs, NEB) followed by ligation using T4 DNA\nligase (NEB) into a linearized dephosphorylated pET28a (Novagen) yielded\npSECalU16, pSECalU17, and pSECalU19 for calU16, calU17, and calU19, respectively.

For structural\nstudies, plasmid preparation, overproduction, and purification were\nconducted following standard protocols of the Northeast Structural\nGenomics Consortium (NESG) to produce a uniformly 15N/13C-enriched and 5% biosynthetically directed 13C (NC5)-labeled protein samples for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine\n(Se-Met) labeled samples for X-ray crystallography and details can\nbe found in Supporting Information Methods.60,61 In brief, calU16 was PCR\namplified from genomic DNA and cloned into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET15\nexpression vector (NESG Clone ID MiR12\u201315.1; PSI:Biology Materials\nRepository clone ID MeCD000597015, see http://psimr.asu.edu/) to encode for the corresponding N-terminally tagged (MGHHHHHHSHM)\nfusion protein.

A single crystal of Se-Met labeled protein\nwas used for data collection at a wavelength of 0.978 \u00c5 and diffracted\nto 2.5 \u00c5 resolution. The data was collected at beamline X4A at\nthe National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory,\nand further processed and scaled using HKL-2000 (Table 1).63 Eight of the ten selenium\nsites in the asymmetric unit were successfully located by the SHELXD64 program for initial phasing. RESOLVE65 was utilized for automated model building and\nthe model was further built by manual refitting with the program Coot.66 The data were twinned, and a twin refinement\nwas performed. The refinement involved iterations of manual model-building\nin Coot and Refmac.67 The quality of the\nfinal structure was validated by PROCHECK.68 The diffraction images illustrate diffuse scattering perpendicular\nto the 61 screw axis indicative of order/disorder (Supporting Information Figure S24). The effects\nof the disorder are also evident in the data anisotropy where the\nB-factor component along the 61 axis is less than half\nof the B-factor in the perpendicular direction. The unmodeled disorder\nleads to higher than expected R-factors and is likely contributing\nto the lower percentage of residues in the Ramachandran favored regions\n(Table 1).
