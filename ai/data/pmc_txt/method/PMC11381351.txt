Materials and methods Phylogenetic analysis Representative sequences were selected from Murina et al. (29). Sequences were aligned with MAFFT v6.861b with the L-INS-i strategy (46) and visualised in AliView (47). Positions with 50% gaps were removed with trimAl v. 1.4.rev6 (48). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was carried out with IQ-Tree v. 2.2.2.6 (49) at the IQ-Tree web server (50) with the best fit model selected by the program (Q.pfam + I + G4), SH-aLRT and ultrafast bootstrap and branch support testing (1000 replicates) (51). Construction of bacterial strains and plasmids The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study as well as description of strain construction are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Plasmids were constructed by standard cloning methods: PCR, PrimeSTAR mutagenesis (Takara), and Gibson assembly. Marker-less gene deletion mutants of efp (BCHT209), ydiF (BCHT212), yfmM (BCHT213), yfmR (BCHT214), ykpA (BCHT215), gsaB (BCHT332), yaaO (BCHT333), yfkA (BCHT334), ymfI (BCHT335) and ynbB (BCHT336) were constructed by excising the antibiotic resistance cassette by the Cre-loxP system as described previously (52). Briefly, B. subtilis strains were transformed with pMK2, a pLOSS*-based Ts plasmid harbouring cre. To select for the excision of the resistance marker flanked by loxP, the resulting strains were grown overnight at 37°C on LB agar medium supplemented with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 100 μg/ml spectinomycin. Finally, to promote the loss of the pMK2 plasmid, the strains were grown overnight at 37°C on LB agar medium without spectinomycin. The loss of pMK2 was confirmed by the absence of spectinomycin resistance. Sucrose gradient fractionation and immunoblotting The experiments were performed as described previously (53). Briefly, B. subtilis strains were grown at 37°C in 40 ml LB cultures until the OD600 of 0.8, cells collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 0.5 ml of HEPES:Polymix buffer [5 mM Mg(OAc)2] (53), lysed by FastPrep homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) and the resultant lysates clarified by centrifugation. 10 A260 units of each extract were loaded onto 10–35% (w/v) sucrose density gradients prepared in HEPES:Polymix buffer [5 mM Mg(OAc)2] and the gradients were resolved by ultracentrifugation at 36 000 rpm for 3 h at 4°C. Both preparation and fractionation of gradients was done using Biocomp Gradient Station (BioComp Instruments); A260 was used as a readout during the fractionation. Ribosome stalling reporter assay Ribosome stalling reporters were based on the reporters developed by Chadani and colleagues (54). To construct the reporters, the test motif-encoding DNA segments encoding pairs of either homodecapeptides (A10, K10, R10, E10 or D10) or (DP)5 hetrodecapeptides connected via a (GS)2 liker were intercalated into the GFP-SUMO-coding ORF between the segments encoding the two domains. The construction was achieved via one-step PCR amplification with partially complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides. The use of a unified (GS)2 liker simplified the construction of the reporters. The presence of a relatively bulky C-terminal SUMO tag allowed for efficient SDS PAGE separation of the full-length product from the truncated product generated upon ribosomal stalling on the test motif. Reporters were expressed under the control of Phy-spank IPTG-inducible promoter (55) from a self-replicated pHT01-based plasmid carrying a kanamycin resistance marker (56). ABCF- and EF-P-coding genes were cloned on the pSHP2 plasmid (provided by Dr Henrik Strahl von Schulten) under the control of Pxy xylose-inducible promoter and integrated into the amyE locus. Individual reporter plasmids were amplified by EquiPhi29 polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transformed into recipient B. subtilis strains. The resulting strains were grown overnight at 37°C on LB plates supplemented with 3 μg/ml kanamycin. After isolating single colonies twice on LB plates supplemented with 3 μg/ml kanamycin, fresh colonies of B. subtilis harbouring reporter plasmids were used to inoculate 1-ml LB medium cultures dispensed into plastic 96 deep-well plates (Treff Lab). The cultures were grown at 30°C for 18 h with shaking at 1200 rev per min using DWMax M·BR‐034P constant temperature incubator shaker (Taitec). 20 μl of individual overnight cultures were then used to inoculate 1 ml cultures (LB supplemented with 3 μg/ml kanamycin as well as inducers: 1 mM IPTG and 0.3% xylose) dispensed into plastic 96 deep-well plates. 1-ml experimental cultures were grown at 37°C with shaking until OD600 of 1.0, 0.75  ml aliquots collected, combined with 83 μl of 50% TCA and kept on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation at 13 500 rpm for 2 min at 4°C, cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). After one more round of 2-min centrifugation at 13 500 rpm at 4°C, cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (0.5 M sucrose, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 20 mM HEPES:NaOH, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37  °C for 10 min. Next, an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 30% glycerol, 250 mM Tris pH 6.8, 1 mM DTT, saturated bromophenol blue) was added, and the lysates were denatured at 85°C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. GFP-tagged proteins were detected using anti-GFP (Wako, mFX75, 1:5  000 dilution) antibodies combined with Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) HRP Conjugate (Bio-Rad). Images were acquired using Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare) luminoimager and analysed in ImageJ (57). The stalled fraction was quantified by dividing the stalled (short) product signal by the total signal (short and full-length combined). All experiments were performed as three biological replicates; quantification is shown as mean ± standard deviation.
