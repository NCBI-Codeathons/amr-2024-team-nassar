Materials and methods Minimum inhibitory concentration The microplate dilution assay was employed to assess the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the various compounds as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). In Each well, a total of 190 μL of LB broth containing 2-fold serial dilutions of each of the tested compounds was inoculated with 10 μL of bacterial suspension taken from 1 × 108 CFU of Pb1692 solution so that the final concentration in each well was 1 × 106 CFU. The wells (in 96-well microtiter plates) were incubated for 24 h at 28°C, with continuous shaking at 150 rpm. The MIC was recorded as the lowest concentration of compound that was able to inhibit the visible growth of bacteria (at OD 600 nm). Time-kill test/checkerboard assay Two-fold serially diluted concentrations of one of the combination’s components were dispensed in the rows of a 96-well plate whereas two-fold serially diluted concentrations of the other component were dispensed in its columns. Each compound was diluted to different concentrations with growth effect close to control of the previously determined MIC. Briefly, each concentration of the tested EPI compound was mixed with different concentrations of the phytochemical compounds to a final volume of 190 µl in each well. The growth of Pb1692 was assessed by adding 10 μL of bacterial suspension (1x108 CFU/mL) into a well containing the combination of each EPI and tested compound. Following 24 h of incubation at 28°C, the plates were recorded. Each value was a mean of four replications out of three independent experiments. The effects of the antimicrobial combinations were defined according to the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) using the following equation: Ethidium bromide accumulation assays Accumulation of EtBr inside the bacterial cell, was measured according to Coldham et. al., 2010, with minor modifications. Briefly, a single colony of Pb1692 was cultured overnight at 28°C, and 10µL were transferred to fresh LB and incubated for 5 h at 28°C, under continuous shaking. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g and re-suspended in 1 mL PBS. The optical density of all suspensions was adjusted to 0.4 OD 600, and aliquots (0.18 mL) were transferred to a 96-well plate (flat-bottomed, black, Greiner Bio-one, Stonehouse, UK). The efflux inhibitors were added as follows: column 1: PBS blank; column 2: heat-inactivated Pb1692 (10 min at 90°C); column 3: control strain (No efflux inhibitor); columns 4 –12: efflux pump inhibitors at different concentrations. Eight replicates of each inhibitor were analyzed in each column. The plate was transferred to a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Männedorf, Zurich, Switzerland), incubated at 28°C and EtBr (25 µg/ml) was added (20 µL) to each well to a final concentration of 2.5 µg/ml. Fluorescence was recorded using excitation and emission filters of 360 and 590 nm, respectively, with 5 flashes/well; readings were taken for 60 cycles with a 75 s delay between cycles, and a gain multiplier of 1460. Raw fluorescence values were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft) and included mean values for each column following subtraction of appropriate control blanks. Each experiment was repeated twice. Gene expression RNA extraction and cDNA preparation Pb1692 cells were grown from a single colony for 16 h, at 28°C in LB under continuous shaking. Then fresh LB, with or without EPI (NMP and PAβN), antimicrobial compounds (Nar, Pht and CIP) and their combinations, was inoculated with 5x108 CFU of bacterial suspension, in 15 mL LB, and incubated for 15 min and 2 h at 28°C, under continuous shaking. After15 min and 2 h, 2mL samples were taken to an Eppendorf tube for RNA extraction. To extract RNA, GENEzol™ Reagent kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd, New Taipei City, Taiwan) was used, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was used to prepare cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cDNA reverse-transcription reaction was performed using a programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, St. Bruno, PQ, Canada) programmed to one cycle as step1: 25°C for 10 min, step 2: 37°C for 120 min, step 3: 85°C for 5 min and step 4: 10°C after which the cDNA was stored at -20°C for future use. Quantification of acrAB-tolC gene expression by qRT-PCR Real-time PCR was conducted to quantify the mRNA, as described by (Joshi et al., 2016). Briefly, all of the primers used in this study were designed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) primer BLAST software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). The generated primers were 100 to 120 bp in size and the melting temperatures of the primers were designed for 60°C, with a difference of less than 5°C for each primer pair (
Table S1
). To exclude the possibility of non-specific binding, primer sequences were analyzed by BLAST analysis (using NCBI BLAST software) against the database for the genus Pectobacterium. All PCR products were sequenced and found to represent the correct gene. The primer mixture for qRT-PCR contained 5 μL of Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.8 μL (5 μM) of each forward and reverse primer. A total of 3.4 μL (17 ng) of cDNA was added to each well, so that the total reaction mixture would be 10 µL for each well. Reactions were performed using a Step One Plus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycling parameters: holding stage, 95°C for 20 s; cycling stage, 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 30 s; and melting curve stage, 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min and 95°C for 15 s. The data were analyzed by the comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method, with expression normalized to the expression of the reference gene ffh, as described by Takle et al. (2007).
