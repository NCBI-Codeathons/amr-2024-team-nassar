Materials and methods RNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly of Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 Fungi on the stem of A. odorata (grown in Berkeley, CA) were harvested and subjected to RNA extraction with hot phenol. After further chloroform extraction, RNA was subjected to rRNA depletion by a Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Yeast) (Illumina). The RNA-Seq library was generated by a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kit (Illumina) and sequenced by HiSeq4000 (Illumina) with a paired-end 100 bp option. Notably, reads from rRNA genes (i.e., internal transcribed spacer [ITS]) remained after rRNA depletion and were used for phylogenetic analysis. Transcriptome assembly and functional annotation were performed as described previously (Iwasaki et al., 2019) using Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011) and Trinotate (Haas et al., 2013). The eIF4A and DDX3 homologous sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/) and depicted by ESPript 3.0 (Robert and Gouet, 2014; http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/). eIF4A and DDX3 homologous sequences of model species were obtained from UniProt. For Ophiocordyceps species, Tolypocladium species, and C. orbiculare, the ORF databases were obtained from EnsemblFungi (https://fungi.ensembl.org/index.html) or the Ohm laboratory (http://fungalgenomics.science.uu.nl; de Bekker et al., 2017). To survey the eIF4A and DDX3 homologs, the closest homologs of all the proteins in each species were searched with BLASTp (Camacho et al., 2009; https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/). Phylogenetic analysis To identify the genus of the Aglaia-infecting fungus, closely related species were predicted. The de novo-assembled transcriptome sequence of the Aglaia-infecting fungus was searched by BLASTn (Camacho et al., 2009; https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/) using the C. aotearoa ICMP 18537 ITS sequence (GenBank accession: NR_120136) (Schoch et al., 2014) as a query. Using the best hit sequence as a query, a BLASTn search was performed against the NCBI nucleotide collection (nr/nt) (Supplementary file 2). A multilocus phylogenetic analysis of the Aglaia-infecting fungus with Ophiocordyceps species was performed. A total of 68 isolates were used for phylogenetic analysis, including an Aglaia-infecting fungus, 63 previously classified Ophiocordyceps strains consisting of 52 species, and 4 Tolypocladium species that were expected to serve as outgroups (Supplementary file 3). DNA sequences of ITS, SSU, LSU, TEF1α, and RPB1 were used as previously reported for the classification of Ophiocordyceps species (Xiao et al., 2017). Additional genomic sequences of Ophiocordyceps species identified by BLASTn were added to the analysis (Supplementary file 3). A phylogenetic tree was calculated as previously described (Gan et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017). Each locus (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, and TEF1α) of the 68 isolates (Ban et al., 2015; Castlebury et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2013; de Bekker et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2013; Kepler et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2002; Luangsa-Ard et al., 2011; Luangsa-Ard et al., 2010; Quandt et al., 2018; Quandt et al., 2014; Sanjuan et al., 2015; Schoch et al., 2012; Spatafora et al., 2007; Sung et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2013; Will et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2017) was aligned using MAFFT v7.480 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and trimmed by trimAl v1.4.rev15 (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009) with an automated setting. The processed sequences obtained from every 68 isolates were concatenated by catfasta2phyml v1.1.0 (Nylander, 2018; https://github.com/nylander/catfasta2phyml) to generate sequences comprising 3910 nucleotide positions, including gaps (gene boundaries ITS, 1–463; LSU, 464–1363; SSU, 1364–2248; RPB1, 2249–2922; TEF1α, 2923–3910). The best model for nucleotide substitutions under the BIC criterion was determined by ModelTest-NG v.0.1.6 (Darriba et al., 2020; https://github.com/ddarriba/modeltest) as follows: ITS, TIM3ef + G4; LSU, TIM1 + I + G4; SSU, TPM3 + I + G4; RPB1, TIM1 + I + G4; and TEF1α, TrN + I + G4. Then, the maximum likelihood phylogeny was estimated based on concatenated sequences by RAxML-NG v.0.9.0 (Kozlov et al., 2019; https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng) using the ModelTest-NG specified best models for each partition with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The best-scoring maximum likelihood trees with bootstrap support values were visualized in iTOL v6 (Letunic and Bork, 2021; https://itol.embl.de/). Given sufficient separation from other known Ophiocordyceps, the fungus was named Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1. Compounds RocA (Sigma-Aldrich) and aglafoline (MedChemExpress) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used for this study. Plasmid construction pColdI-H. sapiens eIF4A1 WT, Phe163Gly, and Phe163His pColdI-H. sapiens eIF4A1 WT has been reported previously (Iwasaki et al., 2019). Phe163Gly and Phe163His substitutions were induced by site-directed mutagenesis. pColdI-O. sinensis eIF4A WT and His154Gly DNA fragments containing the O. sinensis eIF4A gene were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and inserted into pColdI (TaKaRa) downstream of the His tag with In-Fusion HD (TaKaRa). The His154Gly substitution was induced by site-directed mutagenesis. pColdI-Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A iso4 WT, Gly172His, and Gly172Phe The cDNA library of Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 was reverse-transcribed with ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs) and Random Primer (nonadeoxyribonucleotide mix: pd(N)9) (TaKaRa) from the total RNA of Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 (see details in the section 'RNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly for Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1'). Using the cDNA as a template, DNA fragments containing eIF4A iso4 were PCR-amplified and inserted into pColdI (TaKaRa) downstream of the His tag with In-Fusion HD (TaKaRa). The Gly172His and Gly172Phe substitutions were induced by site-directed mutagenesis. pENTR4-C. orbiculare eIF4A WT and His153Gly To replace the eIF4A (GenBank: Cob_v000942) sequence in the C. orbiculare genome with synthesized C. orbiculare eIF4A WT or His153Gly, donor DNAs for homology-directed repair were constructed. DNA fragments, including 2 kb genome sequences upstream and downstream of C. orbiculare eIF4A (as homology arms), the C. orbiculare eIF4A genome sequence, and the neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII) expression cassette, were fused into the pENTR4 plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by HiFi DNA assembly (New England Biolabs). These fragments were PCR-amplified using C. orbiculare genomic DNA, which was isolated from the mycelium, or pII99 plasmid (Namiki et al., 2001). The His153Gly substitution was induced by site-directed mutagenesis. sgRNA-targeted sequences in homology arm sequences were deleted by site-directed deletion to prevent cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9. Recombinant protein purification His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (Chen et al., 2021). BL21 Star (DE3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) cells were transformed with pColdI plasmids (see 'Plasmid construction' section). After the induction of protein expression by isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 15°C overnight, cells were collected by centrifugation and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, the thawed cells were lysed by sonication. The His-tagged protein was purified by Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN). Eluted proteins from beads were then applied to the NGC chromatography system (Bio-Rad). Using a HiTrap Heparin HP column (1 ml, GE Healthcare), proteins were fractionated via an increased gradient of NaCl. The peak fractions were collected, buffer-exchanged with NAP-5 or PD-10 (GE Healthcare) into the storage buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]), concentrated with a Vivaspin 6 centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa MWCO) (Sartorius), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Proteins in the SDS-PAGE gel were stained with EzStainAQua (ATTO). Fluorescence polarization assay The fluorescence polarization assay was performed as previously described (Chen et al., 2021). The reaction was prepared with 0–25 μM recombinant protein, 10 nM FAM-labeled [AG]10 RNA, 1 mM AMP-PNP (Roche), 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, and 1% DMSO (as a solvent of RocA) with or without 50 μM RocA/aglafoline. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the mixture was transferred to a black 384-well microplate (Corning), and the fluorescence polarization was measured by an Infinite F-200 PRO (Tecan). Under ADP + Pi conditions, 1 mM ADP (Fujifilm Wako Chemicals) and 1 mM Na2HPO4 were used as substitutes for AMP-PNP. The data were fitted to the Hill equation to calculate Kd values and visualized by Igor Pro v8.01 (WaveMetrics). The affinity fold change was calculated as the fold reduction in the Kd of RocA compared to the Kd of DMSO. Reporter mRNA preparation The DNA fragments PCR-amplified from psiCHECK2−7×AGAGAG motifs or psiCHECK2-CAA repeats (Iwasaki et al., 2016) were used as a template for in vitro transcription with a T7-Scribe Standard RNA IVT Kit (CELLSCRIPT). RNA was capped and poly(A) tailed with a ScriptCap m7G Capping System, a ScriptCap 2′-O-Methyltransferase Kit, and an A-Plus Poly(A) Polymerase Tailing Kit (CELLSCRIPT). In vitro translation assay in reconstituted system The reconstitution system for human translation has been described previously (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Machida et al., 2018; Yokoyama et al., 2019). The in vitro translation reaction and luciferase assay were performed as previously described (Iwasaki et al., 2019) with some modifications. The final concentrations of mRNA and the eIF4A protein were 60 ng/µl and 2.16 µM, respectively. The translation mixture was incubated for 2.5 hr. The fluorescence signal was detected using the Renilla-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and measured in an EnVision 2104 plate reader (PerkinElmer). In vitro translation in RRL with complex-preformed mRNAs Preformation of the eIF4A, RocA, and mRNA complex and subsequent in vitro translation in RRL were performed as previously described (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016), with modifications. For preformation of the complex containing eIF4A, RocA, and reporter mRNA, 1.4 µM recombinant eIF4A, 90.9 nM reporter mRNA, and 9.1 µM RocA were incubated at 30°C for 5 min in preformation buffer (16.6 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 55.3 mM KOAc, 2.8 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1.8 mM ATP, 0.6 mM DTT, and 0.2% DMSO). After supplementation of Mg(OAc)2 to 26.3 mM, 30 µl of the reaction was loaded into a MicroSpin G-25 column (Cytiva) equilibrated with equilibration buffer (30 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 1 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mM DTT), centrifuged at 700 × g for 1 min at 4°C to remove free RocA, and mixed with 2.5 μl of storage buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). Then, 4 µl of complex-preformed mRNA was incubated with 50% RRL (Promega) in a 10 µl reaction volume for 1 hr at 30°C, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The fluorescence signal was detected using the Renilla-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and measured with the GloMax Navigator System (Promega). In the control experiments, instead of recombinant eIF4A proteins, storage buffer was used. Moreover, recombinant eIF4A proteins were added to the G-25 flowthrough solution in place of the storage buffer. Fungal transformation C. orbiculare strain 104-T (NARO GeneBank ID: MAFF 240422), a causal agent of anthracnose disease in Cucurbitaceae plants, was used. The isolated strains in this study are also listed in Supplementary file 4. Preparation of protoplasts C. orbiculare protoplasts were prepared as previously described (Kubo, 1991; Rodriguez and Yoder, 1987; Vollmer and Yanofsky, 1986) with modifications. A frozen glycerol stock of C. orbiculare was streaked on 3.9% (w/v) potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Nissui) in a 90 mm dish and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 3 days. Outer edges of a colony were transferred to 20 ml of 2.4% (w/v) potato dextrose broth (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 2 days at 25°C in the dark. The proliferated mycelium was collected using a 70 µm cell strainer (Corning) and incubated in 150 ml of potato-sucrose liquid medium supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (BD Biosciences) at 25°C with shaking at 140 rpm. The mycelium was harvested, washed with sterile water, and resuspended in 20 ml of filter-sterilized (0.2 µm pore size, GE Healthcare) osmotic medium (1.2 M MgSO4 and 5 mM Na2HPO4) containing 10 mg/ml driselase from Basidiomycetes sp. (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mg/ml lysing enzyme from Trichoderma harzianum (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 50 ml tube (Falcon, Corning). The suspension was gently agitated in a rotary shaker at 60 rpm for 90 min at 30°C. Then, the suspension was underlaid with 20 ml of trapping buffer (0.6 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 50 mM CaCl2) and centrifuged at 760 × g for 5 min using a swinging-bucket rotor (Hitachi, T4SS31). Protoplasts isolated from the interface of the two layers were pelleted, washed twice using STC (1 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 50 mM CaCl2), resuspended in STC at 108–109 protoplasts/ml, added to a 25% volume of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution (40% [w/w] PEG3350, 500 mM KCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 50 mM CaCl2), and stored at −80°C until use. gRNA preparation Template DNA fragments for sgRNA in vitro transcription were PCR-amplified using the primers listed in Supplementary file 5. Using the DNA fragments, sgRNAs (sgRNAUP-1, sgRNAUP-2, sgRNADW-1, and sgRNADW-2) were prepared with a CUGA7 gRNA Synthesis Kit (Nippon Gene) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Transformation The transformation was performed as previously described (Foster et al., 2018; Kubo, 1991; Yelton et al., 1984) with modifications. The mixture of plasmid DNA (5 µg, pENTR4-C. orbiculare eIF4A WT or His153Gly), the four sgRNAs (250 ng each), and Cas9 nuclease protein NLS (15 µg, Nippon Gene) were added to 150 µl of C. orbiculare protoplasts, followed by the addition of 1 ml of STC and 150 µl of PEG solution. The resulting suspension was incubated for 20 min on ice, supplemented with 500 µl of PEG solution, and gently agitated by hand. The suspension was serially diluted with a second addition of 500 µl, a third addition of 1 ml, and fourth and fifth additions of 2 ml of PEG solution, with gentle agitation at every dilution step. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the PEG solution was removed by centrifugation. The protoplasts were resuspended in 1 ml of STC, diluted with 15 ml of regeneration medium (3.12% [w/v] PDA and 0.6 M glucose), and then spread onto a plate containing 40 ml of selection medium (3.9% [w/v] PDA and 0.6 M glucose) containing 200 µg/ml G418 (Fujifilm Wako Chemicals). The plate was incubated for 5 days at 25°C in the dark. The G418-resistant colonies were further seeded in fresh selection medium containing G418 and subjected to selection for an additional 5 d. Screening by PCR Then, the genomic DNA isolated from each colony was subjected to PCR to ensure the desired transformation (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1A for the design). The primers used for the PCR screening are listed in Supplementary file 5. The selected transformed conidia were suspended in 25% glycerol and stored at −80°C until use. Growth comparison of C. orbiculare strains A C. orbiculare strain was seeded into 500 µl of PDA containing 0.04% (v/v) DMSO in one well of a 12-well plate with a toothpick and incubated in the dark at 25°C for 5 days. Colony sizes were measured with a ruler. C. orbiculare mitochondrial genome assembly Reads from three PacBio RSII cells of the C. orbiculare 104-T whole genome sequencing (Gan et al., 2019) were mapped onto C. orbiculare scaffolds that were identified as potential mitochondrial sequences by the NCBI Genomic contamination screen with minimap2 v2.17-r941 (Li, 2018) using the map-bp setting. Aligned fasta reads were then assembled using flye v2.8.1-b1676 (Kolmogorov et al., 2019) with default settings (min overlap = 5000 bp). The assembly (GenBank accession: MZ424187) possessed a 36,318 bp contig with 2023.72× coverage and showed the highest homology to the C. lindemuthianum completed mitochondrial genome (KF953885) according to nucmer (Delcher et al., 2003). These genome data were used for data processing for ribosome profiling. Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq Cell culture; mycelia Glycerol stocks of C. orbiculare eIF4AWT#1 and eIF4AH153G#1 strains were streaked on PDA in 90 mm plastic Petri dishes and incubated for 3 days. A single colony of each strain was transferred onto PDA and incubated for 3 days. The outer edges of colonies were transferred to 90 mm plastic dishes filled with 20 ml of PDB using plastic straws and incubated for 4 days. Aglafoline (0.3 or 3 µM) or DMSO was added to dishes and incubated for 6 h. Cell culture; conidia A single colony from the glycerol stocks was cultured by the same method used for mycelium preparation. The outer edges of colonies of each strain were transferred into six 300 ml flasks filled with 100 ml of PDA. Two milliliters of sterilized water was added to each flask, and the flasks were shaken well to ensure that the mycelial cells adhered to the entire surface of the PDA evenly. After 6 days of incubation in the dark, conidia generated on the surface of PDA were suspended in 20 ml of sterilized water. The conidial suspension was filtered through a 100 µm pore-size cell strainer and collected by centrifugation at 760 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Twenty milliliters of resuspended conidia at 0.5 OD600 (approximately 2.5 × 106 conidia/ml) was dispensed in 50 ml ProteoSave SS tubes (Sumitomo Bakelite) and then treated with aglafoline (0.3 or 3 µM) or DMSO for 6 h in the dark with shaking at 140 rpm. Cell harvest Cells were filtered by an MF membrane (0.45 µm pore size, Millipore), immediately scraped from the filter, and soaked in liquid nitrogen for 30 s. Then, 600 µl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 100 µg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1% Triton X-100) or 400 µl of TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added dropwise into a tube containing the cell pellet and liquid nitrogen to form ice grains for ribosome profiling or RNA-Seq, respectively. The samples were stored at −80°C to evaporate the liquid nitrogen. Library preparation For ribosome profiling, the frozen cells and lysis buffer grains were milled by a Multi-beads Shocker (YASUI KIKAI) at 2800 rpm for 15 s for one cycle. The lysates were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 3000 × g and 4°C for 5 min. The supernatant was treated with 25 U/ml Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was used for downstream ribosome profiling library preparation as described previously (Mito et al., 2020). Briefly, the lysates containing 10 µg of total RNA were treated with 20 U RNase I (Lucigen) at 25°C for 45 min. After ribosomes were collected by a sucrose cushion, the RNAs were separated in 15% urea PAGE gels, and the RNA fragments ranging from 17 to 34 nt were excised. Subsequently, the RNAs were dephosphorylated and ligated to linkers. Following rRNA removal with a Ribo-Minus Eukaryotes Kit for RNA-Seq (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the RNA fragments were reverse-transcribed, circularized, and PCR-amplified. For RNA-Seq, frozen cells with TRIzol grains were lysed in a Multi-beads Shocker instrument at 2800 rpm for 15 s and thawed on ice. Then, 0.5 µg of RNA extracted with a Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (Zymo Research) was used for library preparation. Poly(A) selection and cDNA synthesis were performed using an Illumina Stranded mRNA Prep, Ligation (Illumina), and subsequent steps were performed with a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina). The final DNA libraries for ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq were sequenced on a HiSeq X (Illumina) with a paired-end 150 bp option. Data processing Sequence data were processed as previously described (McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017) with modifications. For ribosome profiling, using the Fastp v0.21.0 (Chen et al., 2018) tool, sequences of reads 1 were corrected by reads 2, and quality filtering and adapter sequence removal were performed on reads 1. The adapter-removed reads 1 were split by the barcode sequence. Reads mapped to rRNA and tRNA sequences of C. orbiculare, which were predicted by RNAmmer (Lagesen et al., 2007) (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/RNAmmer/) and tRNA-scan SE (Chan et al., 2021) (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/) in the genome of C. orbiculare 104T (Gan et al., 2019) (PRJNA171217), using STAR v2.7.0a (Dobin et al., 2013), were removed from analysis. For all predicted tRNAs, the CCA sequence was added to the 3′ end. The remaining reads were mapped to the C. orbiculare genome (Gan et al., 2019) by STAR v2.7.0a. The A-site offset of footprints was empirically estimated to be 15 for the 19–21 nt and 24–30 nt footprints. Footprints located on the first and last five codons of each ORF were omitted from the analysis. For RNA-Seq, both reads 1 and 2 were used for analysis, and an offset of 15 was used for all mRNA fragments. The translation efficiency change induced by aglafoline was quantified by DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). Significance was calculated by a likelihood ratio test in a generalized linear model. For Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, IDs of sensitive mRNAs in C. orbiculare conidia were converted to IDs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs predicted using BLASTp (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/; Camacho et al., 2009) and the S288C reference from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). A functional annotation chart for this list was obtained from DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp; Huang et al., 2009a; Huang et al., 2009b). GO terms with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 were considered. For 5′ UTR assignment of C. orbiculare, published RNA-Seq data (GSE178879) (Zhang et al., 2021) were aligned to the C. orbiculare genome by STAR 2.7.0a and were then assembled into transcript isoforms by StringTie v2.2.1 (Kovaka et al., 2019). The extensions upstream of the annotated start codons were assigned as the 5′ UTRs. The 5′ UTRs of transcripts expressed in conidia and mycelia were obtained separately. For analysis of the polypurine sequence in Figure 3F and Figure 3—figure supplement 3E, we used the 5′ UTR with the highest coverage in StringTie when multiple 5′ UTR isoforms were assigned. The global translation change (i.e., the ribosome footprint change without consideration of the RNA abundance) was quantified by DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) and renormalized to the mitochondrial footprints (as an internal spike-in standard) (Iwasaki et al., 2016). Fungal inoculation Fungal inoculation was performed as previously described (Hiruma and Saijo, 2016; Kumakura et al., 2019) with modifications. Cucumber cotyledons were used for C. orbiculare inoculation. Seeds of cucumber, Cucumis sativus Suyo strain (Sakata Seed Corp.), were planted on a mix of equal amounts of vermiculite (VS Kakou) and Supermix A (Sakata Seed Corp.). Cucumbers were grown at 24°C under a 10 hr light/14 hr dark cycle using biotrons (NK Systems). Cotyledons were detached from seedlings of cucumbers and inoculated with C. orbiculare at 13 days post-germination. C. orbiculare strains (eIF4AWT#1 and eIF4AH153G#1, Supplementary file 4) were cultured on 100 ml of 3.9% PDA in a 300 ml flask at 25°C for 6 days in the dark. Conidia that appeared on the surface of PDA were suspended in 20 ml of sterilized water, filtered through cell strainers (100 µm pore size, Corning), pelleted by centrifugation at 760 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in sterilized water. The concentration of conidia was measured with disposable hemacytometers (Funakoshi) and adjusted to 105 conidia/ml with or without aglafoline (1 µM). Both conidial suspensions contained DMSO at 0.005% (v/v). Conidial suspensions were sprayed onto detached cotyledons using a glass spray (Sansho) and an air compressor (NRK Japan). Inoculated leaves were placed in plastic trays and incubated at 100% humidity for 3.5 days under the same conditions used for plant growth. Using a 6 mm trepan (Kai Medical), 6 leaf discs (LDs) were cut from each leaf, and 48 LDs were collected per sample. Six LDs were placed in a 2 ml steel top tube (BMS) with Φ5-mm zirconia beads (Nikkato), and eight tubes were prepared for each sample (n = 8). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground at 1500 rpm for 2 min using a Shakemaster NEO (BMS), and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Quantification of fungal biomass in planta The living fungal biomass in cucumber leaves at 3.5 days postinoculation (dpi) was measured by RT-qPCR. Relative expression levels of the C. orbiculare 60S ribosomal protein L5 gene (GenBank: Cob_v012718) (Gan et al., 2013) normalized to that of a cucumber cyclophilin gene (GenBank: AY942800.1) (Liang et al., 2018) were determined. Total RNA was extracted with the Maxwell RSC Plant RNA Kit (Promega) and Maxwell RSC 48 Instrument (Promega) with the removal of genomic DNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 500 to 1000 ng of total RNA per sample with a ReverTraAce qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All RT-qPCRs were performed with THUNDERBIRD Next SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO) and an MX3000P Real-Time qPCR System (Stratagene). The primers used are listed in Supplementary file 5.
