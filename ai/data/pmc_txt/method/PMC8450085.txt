MATERIALS AND METHODS Mycinamicins biosynthesis Mycinamicin I, II, and IV, were produced in M. griseorubida, purified and characterized as previously described (27,28). Broth microdilution assay Twenty seven strains of SA were tested, including twenty six isolates from human patients obtained from hospitals and community clinics and one reference strain (ATCC 29213). Spa types (29) and Panton-Vaentine Leukocidin (pvl) PCR (30) are reported in Table 1. Spa typing and pvl PCR were performed as previously described (31). The range of the antibiotic concentrations used for biological assays was 16–0.125 μg/ml. The concentration range for macrolides was selected according to the examined range of ery and azi in commercially available SensititreTM susceptibility plates (Gram-positive GPALL1F AST Plate). A stock solution of 3.2 mg/ml in DMSO was prepared for all compounds. In every 96-well plate, variable concentration antibiotic solutions were introduced in a total volume of 50μl/well. A serial dilution in the range of 32–0.25 μg/ml was prepared for every antibiotic (myc I, II, IV, ery and azi). One of the control experiments included bacterial growth in media containing DMSO without antibiotics, therefore one row was prepared accordingly, without the addition of antibiotics (Supplementary Figure S1). Four to eight colonies were suspended in 4 ml sterile milli-Q water to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland. Then, 10 μl of the suspension was transferred into an 11 ml stock of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth (cat. Number T3462) media. The plates were inoculated manually by adding 50 μl of MH media to every well, including positive control wells. As a negative control, we used the MH media from the same stock prior to the addition of bacteria. The plates were incubated for 24 h. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined according to CLSI guidelines (32) (Supplementary Figure S1). S/R was determined according to The Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Summary of the MIC values [μg/ml] of the growth inhibition assay using 27 SA strains . Disk diffusion assay The disk diffusion assay was conducted according to the CLSI guidelines (32) testing the iMLSB resistance mechanism where clindamycin (cli) was employed as a representative lincosamide. For each strain, the inducible effect of ery over cli (ery – cli) and ery over myc I (ery – myc I) was tested, as well as the effect of myc I over cli (myc I – cli). Commercial disks were used for ery and cli (Oxoid), and for myc I, 15 μg lab-made disks was used. As a control experiment, 15 μg lab-made disks of ery were prepared. Whatman (Cat. No. 1001 125) paper disks were cut into 5 mm diameter disks, autoclaved, and soaked with myc I or ery solutions (3.2 mg/ml in DMSO) as well as a DMSO (as control). Two MH agar plates were used for every bacterial strain, for each repeat. The plates were inoculated with bacterial strains as follows: four to eight colonies were suspended in 4 ml of NANOpure Diamond® sterile water in a test tube to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland, a swab was soaked into the tube and was used to streak the plate with a gentle back-and-forth motion, which was moved across and down the plate. The plate was rotated 60° twice and the streaking action was repeated, respectively. This ensures an even distribution of the inoculum for a confluent lawn of growth. For commercial disks, a dispenser that splits the disks into spaces of 25 mm was employed. The lab-made disks were placed manually in the same space. In the first agar plate, five disks were placed: DMSO, ery, cli, lab-made ery, cli (Supplementary Figure S2). In the second plate, four disks were placed: myc I, cli, ery, myc I (Supplementary Figure S2). All plates were incubated for 16 h at 37°C and the diameter of the clearance zone was measured (Supplementary Figure S2). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of ermA and ermC PCR primers were used to detect ermA and ermC genes according to previously described protocol (33). The following sequence, AAG CGG TAA ACC CCT CTG A, and TTC GCA AAT CCC TTC TCA AC for ermA and AAT CGT CAA TTC CTG CAT GT and TAA TCG TGG AAT ACG GGT TTG for ermC were used. Primers were synthesized by Syntezza (Israel). PCR amplifications were performed using PCRBIO HS Taq DNA Polymerase (PCRBIOSYSTEMS) in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing approximately 10 ng of template DNA and 2.5 pmol of tested gene primers. A sample of primers and reaction reagents, without DNA, was used as a negative control. Initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min was followed by 30 cycles of amplification with 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s (except for the final cycle, which had an extension step of 4 min). PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel using GeneDireX 100bp DNA Ladder RTU (Supplementary Figure S3). Deinococcus radiodurans (DR) growth and ribosomes purification Methodology was based on previously published protocols (34,35). Briefly, DR were grown at 30°C in a lysogeny broth (LB) Oxoid medium (pH 7.3). The culture was initiated from a 1:60 dilution of glycerol stock to LB oxoid, and incubation for 24 h. The bacteria were then diluted 1:10 and incubated overnight. The bacteria were diluted again in a 1:10 dilution, incubated for 6 h and then further diluted in a 1:33 ratio. The final growth stage was performed in a 10 l fermentor after a 1:20 dilution, under constant conditions of pH (7.3) and oxygen (80%). The culture was grown to a final OD600 of 3.0. The bacterial cells were harvested by continuous-flow centrifugation, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. The purification procedure was based on the protocol developed by Pfizer (35). The bacterial cells were suspended in H10M30N150β6 buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.8, 30 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and DNase RNase free (Roche Diagnostics) was added (1 μl per 1 ml of buffer). Cells were lysed using one passage through a French press at 10 000 PSI. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 45 min at 20 000 rpm in a Ti-70 rotor. The clear supernatant was collected and directly loaded onto a 10–40% linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 25 000 rpm for 16.5 h. The sucrose gradients were prepared using H10M30N150β6 buffer. The gradient was pumped out through an absorbance monitor and the fractions containing the 70S ribosomes were collected and concentrated by ultra-filtration using a Pelicon device (Millipore). The sucrose concentration in the samples was adjusted to 4% and loaded onto a second (10–40%) linear sucrose gradient in H10M1N100β6 (10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 1 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged at 27 000 rpm for 17.5 h in Ti-15 zonal rotor. Fractions contained the small and large ribosomal subunits were collected separately, and the ones containing the 50S subunits were used for 50S crystallization. The magnesium concentration of the sample was adjusted to 10 mM and centrifuged for 19 h in a Ti-70 rotor. The pellets were re-suspended in the H10M15N75 buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 15 mM MgCl2, 75 mM NH4Cl). The samples were centrifuged again in a TLA100 rotor at 75 000 RPM for 1.5 h. The pellets were re-suspended in the H10M15N75 buffer to a final concentration of 800–1000 A260 ml–1. The samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at –80°C. Crystallization of large ribosomal subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans (D50S) ribosomes Crystals were obtained following the protocol described in Harms et al. (34) at 20°C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique. Each crystallization drop (5 μl) included 10 mM spermidine, 1.25–1.5% 2-ethylhexan-1,3 diol (EHD): ethanol (ratio 1:2), 7.9–9 μM D50S subunits and H10M15N75 buffer. The reservoir solution contained 14–15% 1:2 EHD–ethanol and H10M15N75 buffer. The D50S subunits were heat activated for 30 min at 37°C before crystallization. These conditions usually yield both single crystals and clusters. After the crystals reached their maximal size (2–3 weeks), they were transferred to stabilizing solution (30% EHD–ethanol 1:2 in the crystallization buffer). Soaking of D50S crystals in stabilization solutions containing macrolide antibiotics To obtain crystals of D50S in complex with select antibiotics, the 50S crystals were soaked into a stabilization solution (30% EHD-ethanol 1:2 in the crystallization buffer) containing the compound. Prior to data collection, the crystals were transferred to a stabilizing solution (30% EHD–ethanol 1:2 in the crystallization buffer), which includes antibiotic (final concentration of 450 μM = ∼×50 to ribosomes) for 6 h. Afterwards, the soaked crystals were transferred to a cryo-protecting solution (15% EHD–ethanol 1:2, 15% MPD) for 10 min, which contains the same antibiotic concentration. The crystals were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data collection and processing of D50S ribosome complexes Crystallographic data were collected at the microfocus beamlines ID23-2 and ID30A-3, of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. Diffraction data were measured at 100 K to minimize radiation damage. Crystallographic data were collected for each D50S complex with one of the three mycs antibiotics. Due to the rapid decay of the crystals in the X-ray beam, several crystals were needed to achieve high completeness of the datasets. Data were processed using HKL2000 (36) and CCP4 package suite (37,38). Map calculation, model building and refinement The D50S structure (PDB code: 2ZJR) was used as a starting model for calculating difference electron density maps using PHENIX (39). A clear positive density, in both DFo – mFc and 2DFo – mFc maps, could be immediately identified and attributed to the antibiotic molecule (Figure 2D–F). The antibiotic structures were modeled using ChemDraw and their respective crystallographic Information Files (cif) was generated via Grade Web Server (40). Individual antibiotic structures were then docked into their electron density using Coot (41). Each ribosome complex was refined using alternate cycles of refinements with Phenix (42) and Coot (41). For R-free calculations, random 5% of the data were omitted during refinement. Figures were generated using Chimera (43).
