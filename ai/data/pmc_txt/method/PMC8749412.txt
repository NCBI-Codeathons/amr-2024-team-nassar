MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. Bacteria were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 28°C (X. nematophila) or 37°C (E. coli). When required, antibiotics were used at the following final concentrations: kanamycin, 20 μg/mL (or 10 μg/mL for chromosome selection); gentamicin, 15 μg/mL; chloramphenicol, 20 μg/mL for E. coli strains and 15 μg/mL for X. nematophila (or 8 μg/mL for chromosome selection); and ampicillin, 100 μg/mL. Ptet constructs were induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc) at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/mL. The Para ETγA (full-length recE, recT, redγ, and recA) and Para γβαA (redγ, redβ, redα, and recA) operons were induced by adding 10% l-arabinose. Plac constructs were induced by adding IPTG at a final concentration of 0.2 mM. We added 100 μg/mL of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) to cultures of the E. coli WM3064 strain, which is auxotrophic for this amino acid. Strains and plasmids used in this study.

Recombineering construction of p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob. As previously described by Fu et al. (29), genomic DNA from X. nematophila was first digested with NcoI and SphI to generate a 45.2-kb fragment containing the odl-BGC locus and surrounding genes. Homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached by p15A-cm PCR with pACYC184 as a template. One homology arm started at the start codon of the first gene cloned (ectB gene) and extended 80 bp downstream. The other homology arm started at the SphI site and extended 80 bp upstream. After linear-plus-linear homologous recombination by RecET in GB05-dir activated with arabinose (0.3%), the odl locus was inserted directly into the p15A vector to create the p15A-odl-BGC containing a 44.5-kb odl-BGC fragment (four odl genes plus the surrounding genes). For expression of the odl-BGC locus, homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached to the Kmr-Tetr-PLtetO1 fragment of pSC101. One homology arm started at the start codon of the ectB gene and extended 57 bp downstream. The other homology arm started 216 bases from the p15A origin and extended 52 bp upstream. After linear-plus-circular homologous recombination by Redαβ in GB08-red activated with arabinose (0.3%), the Kmr-Tetr-PLtetO1 fragment was inserted into the p15A-odl-BGC plasmid between the p15A origin and the start codon of the ectB gene, to create p15A- Ptet-odl-BGC containing the 44.5-kb odl-BGC fragment under the control of the PLtetO1 promoter. For complementation of the odl mutant with p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC, homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached to the Gmr-mob fragment of pBBR1-MCS5. One homology arm started at the end of the kanamycin resistance gene sequence and extended 57 bp downstream. The other homology arm started at the end of Tetr and extended 54 bp upstream. After linear-plus-circular homologous recombination by Redαβ in GB08-red activated with arabinose (0.3%), the Gmr-mob fragment was inserted directly into the p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC plasmid, between Kmr and Tetr, to create the mobilizable plasmid p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob. Insertion of diverse genes into E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′. For identification of the odilorhabdin self-resistance gene, the regions upstream and downstream from the odl locus of X. nematophila F1 were amplified by PCR with the L-ectB-KpnI and R-c-SacI primers (for abc genes) or the L-d-KpnI and R-j-SacI primers (for defghij genes), respectively, and inserted into pUC19 digested with KpnI and SacI. Genes a, b, and c were amplified separately, by PCR, with L-ectB-KpnI and R-ectB-SacI, L-b-KpnI and R-b-SacI, and L-c-KpnI and R-c-SacI, respectively, and inserted into pUC19 digested with KpnI and SacI. All these constructs were used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ and were assessed separately in odilorhabdin MIC assays after the addition of IPTG. We assessed the functionality of diverse OatA proteins from Photorhabdus strains or OatA-like proteins from Xenorhabdus strains, by amplifying the corresponding genes by PCR with appropriate primers (Table S2) and inserting the amplicon between the KpnI and SacI sites of pUC19. The resulting constructs were then used to transform the E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ strain, and odilorhabdin MIC assays were performed after adding IPTG. The ngrA PCR fragment was inserted into the pBBR1-MCS2 broad-host-range vector with the L-ngrA-EcoRI and R-ngrA-BamHI primers digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the resulting construct was used to transform E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ before the addition of p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of OatA. For purification of the N-acetyltransferase, the oatA gene was first amplified from X. nematophila genomic DNA with the F-Nterm-oatA-NdeI and R-Stop-oatA-SalI primers (Table S2), digested with NdeI and SalI, and inserted into pET-28a previously digested with the same enzymes, at a position downstream from the T7 promoter and in fusion with the His tag, yielding pET-oatA. Fresh precultures of the overexpressing strain BL21(DE3) harboring the pET-oatA plasmid were grown overnight in 20 mL of LB broth supplemented with 20 μg/mL of kanamycin at 35°C. We inoculated 200 mL of LB broth supplemented with 20 μg/mL of kanamycin in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask with fresh overnight preculture (2% [vol/vol]) and incubated it at 35°C with shaking until the culture reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.4. The cells were induced by incubation with 0.2 mM IPTG for 3 h at 35°C. Cell pellets from two flasks were recovered by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, pooled, and washed once with saline. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 4 mL of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 2% glycerol (ACT buffer). Cells were lysed by processing the cell suspension in a Fast-Prep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 20 s at a speed of 4 m/s with 100-μm glass beads/cell at a suspension ratio of 1/3. The samples were then centrifuged (13,000 × g for 5 min) and the supernatants were recovered. Cell pellets were washed once with ACT buffer and the supernatants were pooled. Imidazole was added to a concentration of 10 mM before enzyme purification by the HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) Superflow agarose batch method (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, 1 mL of equilibrated Ni-NTA resin was added to 3 mL of sample. The mixture was incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking and was then washed four times with 25 mM imidazole in ACT wash buffer. Three elutions were performed, with 150, 250, and 500 mM imidazole. The eluates obtained with 250 and 500 mM imidazole were pooled and subjected to dialysis overnight against 75 mM HEPES at 4°C with a PurA-Lyzer cutoff at 3.5 kDa. Glycerol was added to the purified His-tagged OatA enzyme at a final concentration of 10% before storage at −20°C. Production and LC-MS analysis of secondary metabolites. For the detection of secondary metabolites in the culture supernatants, bacteria were collected from 96-h cultures by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants after filtration on 0.2-μm filters were analyzed by LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system coupled to an Agilent 6120 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The conditions for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation were as follows: a Symmetry C18 analytical column (5 μm, 4.6 mm by 150 mm; Waters Corporation) was used in positive mode, the injection volume was 100 μL, mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, mobile phase B was acetonitrile, and the linear gradient was 0% mobile phase B–100% mobile phase A at 0 min to 80% mobile phase B–20% mobile phase A at 40 min. UV detection was performed at 210 nm. During separation, the flow rate was 0.7 mL/min, and the column temperature was 37°C. In vitro acetylation of NOSO-95C. N-Acetylation of NOSO-95C or NOSO-95179 was performed in a polystyrene microtube with purified His-tagged OatA diluted to 300 μg/mL in 75 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) supplemented with glycerol (5.7% [vol/vol]), 250 μM NOSO-95C or NOSO-95179, and 750 μM acetyl-CoA in 75 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) for 24 h at 28°C. Aliquots were sampled at 15 min, 4 h, and 24 h. LC-MS/MS analysis. The acetylated NOSO-95C compounds were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Data were obtained in the positive mode on a Waters Alliance LC-MS/MS system (Waters Synapt G2-S mass spectrometer, Waters UPLC Acquity H-class). The HPLC column used was a Phenomenex EVO C18 T HPLC column (100 by 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) maintained at 25°C. Solvent A was H2O plus 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile plus 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phase composition was 100% solvent A from 0 min to 5 min, ramped to 30% solvent B at 10 min. Sample injection volume was 0.1 μL. UV-visible detection was by absorbance at 200 to 500 nm. An ion spray (IS) voltage of 3,000 V, a source temperature of 140°C, a desolvation temperature of 450°C, a declustering potential (DP) of 30 V, and a collision energy (CE) in the range of 20 to 60 V were applied. Antibiotic activity. Total antimicrobial activity was assessed with Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816 as a target of strains harboring odl-BGC loci. We placed 15 μL of an overnight bacterial culture on a plate containing Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Bio-Rad) supplemented with 1.4% agarose (Sigma), and aTc (200 ng/mL) was added when required. After incubation for 72 h at 28°C, the bacteria were exposed to chloroform fumes for 30 min and allowed to dry in air for 30 min. The Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (200 μL of an overnight culture) target strain was then added to 8 mL of MHB supplemented with 0.7% agarose, which was poured over the bacterial colony. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, zones of growth inhibition were observed. The antibiotic activity of the samples acetylated in vitro was also assessed, as follows. We spotted 10 μL of sample onto Mueller-Hinton II (Becton, Dickinson) medium supplemented with 1.4% agarose. We poured an overnight culture of E. coli ATCC 25922 in LB broth (2% [vol/vol]) over the plate. The plate was allowed to dry and was then incubated at 35°C for 20 h. We then observed the plates to check for zones of growth inhibition. IVTT assay. The effect of in vitro acetylation on bacterial protein synthesis was investigated in the Expressway cell-free E. coli expression system (Invitrogen). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was amplified from the pCmGFP plasmid (47) and inserted into pEXP5-CT TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the resulting plasmid was used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT). Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, in 50 μL of reaction mixture, in the wells of a black polystyrene 96-half-well microplate (Greiner). Feed buffer was added after 30 min of incubation, to ensure optimal protein synthesis. Reactions were initiated by adding 1 μg of plasmid DNA. The plate was incubated at 30°C and fluorescence was measured every 20 min (λex = 475 nm; λem = 520 nm) with a Spark M10 microplate reader (Tecan). Fluorescence from GFP synthesis was recorded at 20 min after addition of feed buffer using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Gentamicin was used as positive control at 10 μM. Gene expression and identification of the compounds produced in complemented strains. We investigated the production of secondary metabolites in complemented strains, by incubating 100-mL broth cultures of ΔxcnKL::odl1 (MCS5) and ΔxcnKL::odl1 (p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob) strains with gentamicin and aTc at 28°C for 78 h, centrifuging the cultures, and passing the supernatants through 0.2-μm filters and concentrating them 10-fold for LC-MS analysis. Natural odilorhabdins (NOSO-95A, -B, and -C) and xenocoumacin 1 (Xcn 1) were identified in culture supernatants by LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system coupled to an Agilent 6120 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The conditions for HPLC separation were as follows: a Symmetry C18 analytical column (5 μm, 4.6 mm by 150 mm; Waters Corporation) was used in positive mode, the injection volume was 100 μL, mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, mobile phase B was acetonitrile, and the linear gradient was 0% mobile phase B–100% mobile phase A at 0 min to 80% mobile phase B–20% mobile phase A at 40 min. UV detection was performed at 210 nm. During separation, the flow rate was 0.7 mL/min, and the column temperature was 37°C. Construction of X. nematophila mutants. For the construction of a ΔoatA mutant, we first constructed an ngrA-deficient strain, to prevent the suicide of the X. nematophila producer strain. The upstream and downstream regions of the ngrA gene were amplified by PCR with the L-PCR1-ngrA-XbaI and R-PCR1-ngrA-BamHI primers for the upstream region (579 bp) and the L-ngrA2bis-BamHI and R-ngrA2bis-ApaI primers for the downstream region (522 bp). The two fragments obtained were inserted, together with the 3.8-kb BamHI fragment omega interposon cassette from pHP45-ΩCm conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, into pJQ200SK digested with XbaI and ApaI for insertion of the ΩCam cassette between the two PCR fragments. The resulting plasmid, pJQ-ngrA::ΩCm, was used to transform E. coli strain WM3064 and was introduced into X. nematophila F1 by mating. Allelic exchange was performed as previously described (48). Omega insertion was confirmed by PCR analysis, and the loss of NRP products was checked by antibiosis tests. The clone obtained was called the ΔngrA clone. For construction of the ΔngrA ΔoatA double mutant, the upstream and downstream regions of the oatA gene were amplified by PCR with the appropriate primer pairs, L-SacI-b/R-SpeI-oatA (upstream) and L-SalI-oatA/R-ApaI-odl1 (downstream), generating a 595-bp PCR1 fragment and a 611-bp PCR2 fragment, respectively (Table S2). The pJQ-KmT1 plasmid was then digested with SpeI and SalI and the 2-kb KmT1 fragment containing the Kmr cassette and T1 terminators was purified with the Zymo gel purification kit (Ozyme). These three fragments were inserted into pJQ200SK digested with SacI and ApaI to introduce the Km-T1 cassette between the two PCR fragments. The pJQ-oatA::KmT1 plasmid was then introduced, by mating, into the X. nematophila ngrA mutant, and allelic exchange was performed. Kmr and Sacr exconjugants were selected on LB agar supplemented with 4% sucrose and kanamycin. The KmT1 insertion was checked by PCR analysis with the two primers L-b-KpnI/R-Km-PvuI amplifying a 1,791-bp fragment (Table S2), with confirmation by DNA sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). The resulting recombinant clone was named the ΔngrA ΔoatA clone. MIC determination. MICs were determined in triplicate, in accordance with CLSI guidelines but with modifications for Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus strains and for E. coli constructs (49). For Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus strains, inoculum preparation was modified as follows: 3 mL of MHB II (Becton, Dickinson, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was inoculated with bacteria grown overnight in LB broth and cultured to an OD600 of 0.11 to 0.15. The inoculum was prepared as described in the CLSI guide, with a 1:20 dilution in saline. Multiplates were incubated for 24 h at 28°C or for longer if the results were unclear. For E. coli constructs, a modified method of inoculum preparation was used in which about 10 colonies were picked from MH agar supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin and used to inoculate 10 mL of MHB II supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin. The inoculum was incubated for 1.5 to 2 h at 35°C, with shaking at 150 rpm, until the OD600 reached 0.15 to 0.25. IPTG was added at a concentration of 0.2 mM for induction, and the culture was incubated for 30 min at 35°C, with shaking at 150 rpm. The inoculum was then diluted 1:20 in saline to obtain the final inoculum. The reaction medium consisted of MHB II supplemented with 0.2 mM IPTG. For other E. coli constructs requiring aTc induction, aTc was added to the isolate used for streaking and the reaction medium at a concentration of 200 ng/mL. In all other respects, the procedure corresponded to the CLSI method.
