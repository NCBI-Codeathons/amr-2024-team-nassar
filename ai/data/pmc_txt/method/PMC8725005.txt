Materials and methods Macromolecule production A construct for DynF from M. chersina ATCC53710 with a cleavable 6×His expression and purification tag on the N-terminus was codon-optimized for production in Escherichia coli. It was ordered as a synthetic gBlock from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, Iowa, USA). Amplification of the gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Q5 High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB, Westwood, Massachusetts, USA). Gibson assembly was used to clone the gene into a pNIC28-Bsa4 vector (Savitsky et al., 2010 ▸; Addgene, Watertown, Masachusetts, USA). It was then transformed into DH5α competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). Sanger sequencing (Genewiz, South Plainfield, New Jersey, USA) was used to verify the sequence of the construct. The DynF_pNIC28-Bsa4 plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) expression cells (Agilent Technologies, Cedar Creek, Texas, USA). 5 µl of the transformed cells were then grown overnight on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin antibiotic. From a single colony, a seed culture of 50 ml was grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin to select for expression in the cells. DynF was expressed in BL21 (DE3) competent E. coli cells and was most soluble when induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and cultured at 291 K after induction. To obtain suitable quantities of DynF protein for crystallization experiments, 1 l culture was grown from a 50 ml overnight seed culture until an OD600 of ∼0.6–0.8 was reached. The cells were then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and cultured at 291 K for 17 h. These cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rev min−1 for 40 min. The cell pellet was resuspended using a lysis buffer consisting of 10% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). The cells were then lysed by sonication for 4 min 30 s pulse on and 2 min pulse off with 50% amplitude (Qsonica Q700 sonicator, Newton, Connecticut, USA). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 20 000 rev min−1 for 45 min. Immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) with Ni–NTA resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to purify the protein. The protein was eluted from the nickel column using a buffer consisting of 10% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole, 25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) was used to confirm the production of DynF protein with an expected size of 22.6 kDa. The protein was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) using an Amicon ultracentrifugal filter (10 000 molecular-weight cutoff, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The protein concentration was obtained using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer with an extinction coefficient of 1.191, and was confirmed using a NanoDrop. The histidine tag at the N-terminus of the DynF protein was cleaved from the protein using His-tagged TEV protease. Subtractive nickel column purification was performed to remove the uncleaved protein and protease. DynF was run on a size-calibrated HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) size-exclusion column (SEC) to further purify it and analyze its oligomeric state (Supplementary Fig. S1). Macromolecule-production information is summarized in Table 1 ▸. Crystallization DynF was concentrated to 20 mg ml−1 and subjected to high-throughput crystallization screening. A Mosquito LCP robot (SPT Labtech) was used with commercially available screens, including Wizard 1 and 2 and Wizard 3 and 4 (Rikagu Reagents, Bainbridge Island, Washington, USA), PEGRx and Crystal Screen HT (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, California, USA). Screens were set up via the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method in MRC 2 96-well crystallization plates (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, California, USA) with drops consisting of 200 nl protein solution (20 mg ml−1) mixed with 200 nl reservoir solution. Initial crystal hits (Fig. 2 ▸
a) were observed in two wells of the Wizard 3 and 4 crystallization screen [C1, 10%(w/v) PEG 1000, 10%(w/v) PEG 8000; F10, 25%(w/v) PEG 1500, 0.1 M PCB buffer pH 7.0]. Optimization for larger crystals from well F10 of the Wizard 3 and 4 crystallization screen was achieved by increasing the protein:precipitant ratio (300:200 nl) in the initial drop (Fig. 2 ▸
b). Potassium iodide (KI) derivatives were prepared by soaking native DynF crystals for 30 s in 0.5 mM KI dissolved in the reservoir solution. Native and KI-soaked crystals were looped using Mounted CryoLoops (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, California, USA), cryocooled in liquid nitrogen and shipped to the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron facility at Argonne National Laboratory. Crystallization information is summarized in Table 2 ▸. Data collection and processing X-ray diffraction data were collected remotely at wavelengths of 1.0332 and 1.823 Å for the native crystals and the heavy-atom derivative crystals, respectively. The native and iodide-soaked crystals diffracted to resolutions of 1.55 and 2.38 Å, respectively. The DynF diffraction data were indexed in the orthorhombic space group C2221, with unit-cell parameters a = 60, b = 65, c = 131 Å. The diffraction data were integrated and scaled using XDS (Kabsch, 2010a
 ▸,b
 ▸). Data-collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 3 ▸. Structure solution and refinement The SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) and SIRAS (single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) methods were used to phase the structure of DynF. Scaling, substructure solution and phasing were accomplished with SHELXC/D/E (Sheldrick, 2010 ▸) using the HKL2MAP graphical interface (Pape & Schneider, 2004 ▸). Automated protein tracing with ARP/wARP (Langer et al., 2008 ▸) was used on both the SAD and the SIRAS maps to build 418 of 422 residues. Refinement and model building were performed using phenix.refine (Afonine et al., 2012 ▸) and Coot (Emsley et al., 2010 ▸). The structure was visualized using a collaborative 3D graphics system (Yennamalli et al., 2014 ▸). The software applications used in this project were compiled and configured by SBGrid (Morin et al., 2013 ▸). The structure of DynF and its corresponding diffraction data have been deposited in the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; Berman et al., 2003 ▸) as entry 6ubl. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4 ▸. Ligand determination using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) Acetonitrile (0.5 ml) was added to 0.5 ml purified DynF protein (40 mg ml−1) and rotated at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged using a protein concentrator (3000 molecular-weight cutoff; Millipore, Cork, Ireland) at 4000 rev min−1 for 20 min, and the acetonitrile extract (100 µl) was filtered to remove any remaining insoluble debris. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890 GC with a 30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 mm HP-5ms UI capillary column and an Agilent G7081B MSD. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The temperatures of the injector, the interface and the liner were 523 K. Injections of 5 µl were performed in splitless mode. The column temperature was initially 343 K and was held for 2 min, increased to 513 K at 277 K min−1 and run for a total run time of 59.5 min. For GC–MS detection, an electron-impact ionization system was used. The mass range was set to 50–500 m/z with a filament delay of 4 min. The sample-injection volume was 1 µl. Co-expression of DynF with SgcE and DynE7 The genes encoding the C-1027 polyketide synthase SgcE and dynemicin thioesterase DynE7 were cloned into pETDuet using standard procedures. The gene encoding DynF was cloned into pDB.His.MBP. All genes were sequenced to confirm their identity. Both pETDuet and pDB.His.MBP plasmids with the respective genes were co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The transformed cells were plated on LB agar supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml−1 carbenicillin. After overnight incubation at 310 K, a single colony was used to inoculate 5 ml LB medium supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml−1 carbenicillin. Incubation was performed overnight at 310 K with shaking at 250 rev min−1. The culture (0.5 ml) was transferred into 50 ml fresh LB supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml−1 carbenicillin and incubated at 291 K and 250 rev min−1. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6, expression was induced with sterile IPTG solution (final concentration 0.1 mM) and incubated at 291 K and 250 rev min−1 for an additional 36 h. The cells were centrifuged at 4000 rev min−1 at 277 K for 30 min, and the wet pellet was washed once with 30 ml phosphate buffer pH 7.2. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and sonicated for 2 min with 10 s pulse on and 50 s pulse off (with 40% amplitude) on ice. The lysate was purified using nickel resin and then with amylose resin to purify the MBP-tagged DynF. The sample was extracted with acetonitrile and analyzed by GC-MS as described above.
