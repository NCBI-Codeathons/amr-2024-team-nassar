SAM, L-arabinose, apramycin, spectinomycin, kanamycin and trimethoprim (TMP) were purchased from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). S. lividans WJ2 contains the BS biosynthetic gene cluster and capable of producing blasticidin S (Li et al., 2013), S. lividans WXK1 is derived from WJ2 by deletion of blsL gene, S. lividans WXK2 is derived from WXK1 complemented with blsL in an integrative plasmid pIB139. All Streptomyces strains (Supplementary Table S1) were cultivated at 30°C on Soy Flour-Mannitol (SFM) agar plates for sporulation, mycelia were grown in 10.3% TSBY (tryptic soy broth supplemented with 10.3% sucrose (wt/vol) and 1% yeast extract (wt/vol) medium. E. coli strain DH10B was used for construction cloning vectors, BW25113/pIJ790 was used for in-frame deletion of blsL gene by PCR targeting, ET12567/pUZ8002 was used for conjugal transfer with Streptomyces. E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used as a host for protein expression. E. coli strains (Supplementary Table S1) were cultivated at 37°C in LB/LA medium containing corresponding antibiotic. Plasmid pJTU1780 contains 35 kb fragment of BS biosynthetic cluster and pET28a (Novagen) is for protein overexpression. General Molecular Biology Methods Plasmid DNA were purified by plasmid mini kit (Omega), isolation of genomic DNA and other manipulations of Streptomyces were performed using the method described by Keiser et al. (2000). Restriction enzymes NdeI, EcoRI and HindIII and DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beijing) Ltd. Primers (Supplementary Table S1) were synthesized by JIE LI BIOLOGY (Shanghai, China), PCR products were purified from agarose gels (0.8%) using DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Omega). T4 ligase kit for construction of recombinant plasmid was purchased from TaKaRa (China). The PCR-targeting method for in-frame deletion of blsL was done according to Bertolt Gust (Gust et al., 2002). HPLC and LC-MS Analysis The acquisition of the fermentation products of Streptomyces lividans WJ2 and its derived strains were employed using secondary fermentation according to Li et al. (2013). After 2–6 days of fermentation, 25 ml fermentation broth was transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tubes, 5000 r/min for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and adjusted to pH 5.0 using oxalic acid and then lay aside at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation (10000 r/min, 30 min) again. The Supelclean LC-SCX solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns (bed weight, 500 mg; volume, 3 ml) (Supelco) was used for purification of BS and other intermediates. The column was activated by washing with 3 ml methanol and 5 ml sterile water, the supernatants were injected to penetrate the column and followed by injection of 5 ml sterile water to remove unwanted inclusions, then 5 ml 0.5% ammonia solution were flowed through the column to further remove impurities. Finally, 3 ml 5% ammonia solution were used to elute BS-related products. HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent series 1260 using the innoval C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, Agela Technologies). Two buffer were used, buffer A1: 0.1% (vol/vol) trifluoroacetic acid in water was aqueous phase, buffer B was organic phase (methanol). The samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and the concentration of buffer B rose from 5 to 40% in 40 min. The substances were detected at UV275. To confirm the molecular weight of each peak, a LC-MS analysis was done using an Agilent 1100 LC/MSD (mass-selective detector) with electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive mode. Overexpression and Purification of BlsL High-fidelity DNA polymerase Hieff TM Pfu (YEASEN BiotechCo., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used to amplify the blsL gene sequence from plasmid pJTU1780 with the Forward primer: GGAATTCCATATGGAGCAGAGCACCGGCGCGAT and Reverse primer: CGGAATTCTCAGTCCTTGTAGAAACACT (NdeI and EcoRI sites are underlined) by PCR. The PCR product were purified and digested by NdeI and EcoRI and ligated with pET28a vector which was also cut by NdeI and EcoRI, the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli DH10B. After confirmation of the right clone by sequencing, recombinant plasmid pET28a-blsL was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and grown overnight at 37°C in 10 ml LB medium supplied kanamycin (final concentration 50 μg/ml). 10 ml of cell culture were inoculated in 1 L LB medium in a 3 L flask and cultured at 37°C until OD600 approaching 0.6 and then 250 μl isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 800 mM) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM, the culture medium was then transferred to 16°C and grown for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 r/min for 10 min and suspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 0.5 M NaCl and 20 mM imidazole) and lysed by high power press cell disrupter (UH-240/UH-480/UH-960, Union-Biotech, Co., Ltd.) at 800 bar for 5 min. Then centrifugation at 10000 r/min for 1 h and the supernatant were applied to a column filled with 3 ml Ni-NTA agarose (GE Healthcare), washing the column with 60 ml washing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 0.5 M NaCl and 40 mM imidazole) and eluted the His-tagged protein BlsL with 15 ml elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 0.5 M NaCl and 300 mM imidazole). The eluted BlsL was desalted using PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and stored in storing buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol). The purity of BlsL was detected by SDS–PAGE and the concentration of BlsL was determined by UV absorption at A280 using NanoDrop (Thermo). In Vitro Assay of the Purified BlsL The in vitro assay of BlsL was carried out in reaction buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 7.8 and 100 mM NaCl) at 37°C for 1 h or overnight, the reaction volume was 100 μl with 10 μM BlsL, 1 mM DBS or 1 mM LDBS and 2 mM SAM. The reactions were quenched by adding equal volume of chloroform and shocked for 1 min to denature the BlsL and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation (12000 r/min, 10 min). The measurement of the reaction products was performed by HPLC and LC-MS using TC-C18 (4.6 mm × 250 mm, Agilent). Aqueous phase was buffer A2 (20 mM aqueous phase, pH 5.5), organic phase was still buffer B, the sample were eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with buffer B rising from 10 to 50% in 30 min.
