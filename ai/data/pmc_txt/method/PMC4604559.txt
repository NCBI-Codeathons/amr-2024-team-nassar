Methods Lichen studies Lichen (Heterodermia obscurata (Nyl.) trevis) was collected from Yunnan province, People’s Republic of China. The lichen thallus was sterilised and cut transversely or longitudinally into sections for CLSM observation. Longitudinal z-stack observations were acquired using 30 confocal sections that covered the entire depth of the lichen. PQs produced by the endolichenic fungus identified as Phaeosphaeria sp25. were excited by 488 nm lasers and recorded in an emission spectrum of 400–603 nm for yellow fluorescence and 603–700 nm for red fluorescence. Fixed maximum-intensity projections and stacks of images were generated with Zeiss 2010 software. Phaeosphaeria sp. was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates in dark or under light irradiation. Each day, the growth of the colonies was recorded by imaging. After 7 days, a sample of the organisms was scraped from the colonies under light irradiation and suspended in PBS solution for CLSM observation with a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. The samples were also stained with BODIPY at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for confocal microscopic observations. BODIPY and PQs were excited by 488 nm and 555 nm lasers, respectively, and recorded in an emission spectrum of 490–550 nm for green fluorescence and 570–700 nm for red fluorescence. Measurement of singlet oxygen production generated by HA in different solvents The amount of 1O2 was measured using 9,10-diphenylanthracene, which specifically reacts with 1O2 to form an endoperoxide accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 355 nm, indicating the production of 1O247. Briefly, HA was dissolved in petroleum ether, liquid paraffin and n-heptane (3:1), n-heptane, dichloromethane, chloroform or acetone, at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml and separated into two groups. Triglyceride mix (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue No. 17811-1AMP) was added to the chloroform or acetone at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. The addition of 20 μg/ml 9,10-diphenylanthracene was used to trap the 1O2 produced by HA. One group was irradiated by light for 30 min, and the other group was maintained in darkness. Then, the absorbance of each sample was measured at 355 nm using an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu Japan). The decreased percentage was calculated to indicate the production of 1O2 generated by HA. Measurement of octanol-water partition coefficients The octanol-water partition coefficients of HA were determined according to a previously described method48. Briefly, HA was dissolved in a mutually saturated octanol and water mixed solution. The concentration of HA in octanol and water was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Agilent 1260 system. The HA was separated on an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 μm, 150 mm × 2.1 mm I.D., Agela. Science Inc., USA) through a 4 mm × 3 mm pre-column (Security Guard C18 cartridge, Phenomenex, Inc.) that was maintained at room temperature. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) and was set at a flow rate of 0.80 ml/min. The concentration of HA dissolved in octanol or water was calculated by comparison with the standard curve. Yeast strains and growth conditions The Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type strain BY4742 and the LD-defective strains RSY3290, RSY1826, and RSY3077 were cultured in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone and 2% dextrose) at 30 °C with rotational shaking at 200 rpm. C. albicans wild type strains were cultured in YPD, YPDO medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone, 2% dextrose and 0.1% sodium oleate (Sigma-Aldrich)) or SD medium (0.67% nitrogen base and 2% dextrose with all amino acids supplemented). C. albicans mutant strains were grown in YPD medium supplemented with the necessary auxotrophic requirements, including 80 mg/L uridine, 20 mg/L histidine, and 40 mg/L arginine. The genotypes of the yeast strains used are listed in Supplementary Material Tables S1 and S2. Strain construction The mutant strains deficient in LDs formation were generated in BWP17 using PCR deletion cassettes, as described previously49. The primers used are provided in Supplementary Material Table S3. Photodynamic inactivation by HA in C. albicans or S. cerevisiae C. albicans or S. cerevisiae strains were cultured in YPD medium at 30 °C overnight. Then, 1 ml aliquots of yeast suspensions (2 × 106 CFUs/ml) in YPD medium were incubated in glass tubes with HA at final concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 4 μg/ml. The samples were placed under a 9 W fluorescent lamp with an irradiation intensity of 10 W/m2, which was detected using a photometer. Aliquots of 100 μl were removed at the indicated times and spread on YPD plates to determine the surviving CFUs. Colocalisation studies C. albicans SC5314 was grown in SD medium overnight. Cells were collected and stained with BODIPY 493/503 (5 μM) or CMAC (5 μM) for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) to determine the localisation of LDs and vacuoles. Prestained cells were washed and incubated with HA (2 μg/ml) in the dark at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. To stain the nucleus, cells were pre-incubated with HA (2 μg/ml) in the dark at RT for 10 min and then fixed with 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were stained with 2.5 μg/ml of 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to indicate the location of nuclei. Stained cells were washed and then observed by CLSM. Argon lasers at 405 nm, 488 nm and 555 nm were used to excite CMAC/DAPI, BODIPY, and HA, respectively. To observe the distribution of amphotericin B in C. albicans cells, dansyl-labelled amphotericin B (AmB-Ds) was synthesised according to a previously reported method39. C. albicans SC5314 cells were treated with 30 μg/ml of AmB-Ds for 12 h. Cells were then collected and washed following with PI (10 μg/ml) staining for CLSM observation. AmB-Ds and PI were excited by 405 nm and 555 nm, respectively, and recorded in an emission spectrum of 430–530 nm for blue fluorescence and 590–700 nm for red fluorescence. The time-lapse observation of yeast death C. albicans SC5314 was cultured overnight in YPD or YPDO medium. The collected cells were incubated with HA (2 μg/ml) for 2 min in YPD medium containing SYTOX at a final concentration of 5 μM to observe cell death. Then, cells were exposed to light irradiation with a maximum intensity under a Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope LSM700. We manually imaged cell states at 1 or 2 min intervals. Susceptibility testing of yeast to antifungal agents C. albicans SC5314 cells were cultured in YPD medium or YPDO medium at 30 °C overnight. Cells were then collected and adjusted to 2 × 105 CFUs/ml with YPD or YPDO medium. C. albicans mutant strains and LD formation-defective S. cerevisiae strains were cultured in YPD medium. They were tested for their susceptibility to antifungal agents including fluconazole (FLC), caspofungin (CAS), terbinafine (Ter), miconazole (Mic), amphotericin B (AmB) and farnesol. After 6 or 12 h of treatment, the cells were serially diluted and spotted onto YPD agar plates. After 48 h of incubation at 30 °C, the plates were imaged, and the inhibitory effect was determined by colony counting. Quantitative real-time PCR C. albicans SC5314 was cultured in YPD or YPDO medium overnight for RNA extractions. Measurement of the relative quantitative expression of target genes was conducted using an Eppendorf Mastercycler Real-time PCR System50. Relative gene expression was calculated using the formula 2−ΔΔCT. The primers used for ARE2, DGA2, LRO1 and ACT1 in this test are listed in Supplementary Material Table S3. ACT1 was used as an internal reference gene. Measurement of LD size Cells were stained with BODIPY (5 μM) for 30 min or with Nile Red (10 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 5 minute, two probes of indicating LDs, at room temperature and washed twice with PBS for confocal microscopic observation. The cells were also subjected to a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with excitation at 488 nm to measure fluorescence intensity, which was indicative of LD size. The resultant data were processed with WinMDI 2.9 software. Intracellular ROS measurement C. albicans SC5314 or S. cerevisiae BY4742 was cultured overnight in YPD or YPDO medium. For LD mutants, cells were cultured in YPD overnight. Then, cells were collected and diluted to 106 cells/ml and incubated with HA in YPD medium for 2 min. The C. albicans cells were exposed to 10 min of light irradiation, and the S. cerevisiae cells were exposed to 20 min of light irradiation. Then, cells were collected by centrifugation and stained with 40 μg/ml DCFHDA. The loaded DCFHDA was converted into the membrane-impermeable agent DCFH by intracellular esterase. DCFH is rapidly oxidised by ROS into its fluorescent derivative, DCF. The green fluorescence intensity of DCF was used to indicate the amount of ROS production. The stained samples were subject to flow cytometry detection or confocal microscopic observation with excitation at 488 nm and emission in the range of 510–560 nm to measure the ROS levels. Statistical Analysis One-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni test was used to compare the survival time of C. albicans cells cultured in YPD or YPDO medium. Other data were analysed by Student’s t test. Statistical results are presented as the means ± SD. Asterisks indicate critical levels of significance (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001).
