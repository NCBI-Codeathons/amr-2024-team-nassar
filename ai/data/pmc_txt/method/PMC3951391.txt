Methods Screening of genome database Lantibiotic clusters were identified using PSI-BLAST, by taking the C39 peptidase domain containing transporter of haloduracin, HalT (Protein ID: NP_241317.1) as the driver sequence against genomic database on NCBI. PSI-BLAST was carried out using the default parameters, and the top 72 hits were taken for analysis. Bioinformatic analysis of LanT homolog containing gene clusters In cases where novel LanT-like genes were identified, the arrangement of adjacent genes was visualized using the genome viewer on NCBI. The individual ORFs obtained were subjected to both, BLAST with known lantibiotic clusters and analysis with the Conserved Domain Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/cdd/cdd.shtml), to identify potential genes involved in lantibiotic production, immunity and quorum sensing. LanRK system was also located using Microbial Signal Transduction database (MiST, http://mistdb.com). Immunity and transporter proteins were analysed with TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM) and CELLO [33] to ensure their membrane association. The selected genomes were also analyzed using BAGEL2 [18], a web based bacteriocin mining tool. In clusters, where most of the genes were found to be present but LanA encoding genes were not annotated, intergenic regions were inspected using ORF finder (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Properties of the identified precursor peptides (Table S1) were analyzed with APD2 [34]. Phylogenetic analysis Alpha and beta precursor peptides in a putative two-component lantibiotic cluster were identified by multiple sequence alignment with ClustalW2 and their phylogenetic analysis with known alpha and beta precursor peptides, of well-known lantibiotics. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbour-joining method in MEGA5 [35].
