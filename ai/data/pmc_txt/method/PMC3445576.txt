Materials and Methods Strains and culture media B. subtilis and Escherichia coli were routinely cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 1% NaCl). S. marcescens and Micrococcus luteus were routinely cultured in low salt Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). S. aureus was routinely grown in Tryptic Soya Broth (TSB) (0.5% NaCl, 0.5% soytone, 1.5% tryptone). Growth media were solidified through addition of agar to 1.5%. When required, media were supplemented with antibiotics: ampicillin (Ap) 100 µg/ml; kanamycin (Kan) 50 µg/ml (E. coli) or 100 µg/ml (S. marcescens and B. subtilis); streptomycin (Sm) 100 µg/ml, chloramphenicol (Cml) 100 µg/ml and tetracycline (Tc) 10 µg/ml. Construction of strains and plasmids S. marcescens chromosomal mutants with in-frame deletions or marked mutations in selected genes were constructed by marker (allelic) exchange using the suicide vector pKNG101, as described [39]. The T5 promoter was PCR-amplified from pQE-80 and used to replace the native chromosomal promoter by the same method. The primers used to amplify and clone the appropriate regions are detailed in Table S1 and the relevant plasmids are given in Table 2 and Table S2. For complementation of the S. marcescens Δalb2 (SAN3), Δalb3 (SAN88), Δalb6 (SAN60) and Δ2452::Cml mutants, the alb2, alb3, alb6 or SMA2452 coding region was amplified from genomic DNA of S. marcescens Db10. The PCR product was cloned into the vector pSUPROM using the restriction sites introduced into the primer sequence (Table S1). The integrity of the coding regions was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids (Table 2 and Table S2) were introduced into S. marcescens Db10 strains by electroporation and selecting with kanamycin (100 µg/ml) [40].

Activity assays The indicator strain was routinely grown at 37°C to early stationary phase and 100 µl of the culture was spread onto an agar plate. S. marcescens strains being tested for antibiotic production were grown to stationary phase at 30°C and 10 µl of culture diluted to an OD600 of 1 was spotted on the indicator lawn. To test the ability of the alb2, alb3, alb6 or SMA2452 complementation strains to produce althiomycin, B. subtilis strain NCIB3610 sacA::Phy-spac-gfp (Kan) (NRS1473) was used as the indicator and 100 µg/ml of kanamycin used to maintain replicative plasmids in S. marcescens strains. To test the ability of Alb1 to confer resistance to althiomycin in S. marcescens ATCC274, S. marcescens ATCC274 carrying pSUPROM or pSUPROM-alb1 (pSAN1) was used as the indicator lawn and was grown at 30°C to early stationary phase before plating. 100 µg/ml of Kan was added to the agar plate. The plates were incubated (15 h) at 30°C prior to photography. Images were captured using a Leica MZ16 FA stereoscope using LAS software version 2.7.1. To assess althiomycin production throughout growth, S. marcescens Db10 and SAN5 were grown in liquid culture. At hourly intervals the OD600 was measured and a sample was collected. The cells were removed and the supernatant was filter sterilized (0.2 µm). To prepare indicator lawns, a liquid culture of B. subtilis NCIB3610 was diluted 1 in 1000 into LB top agar (0.7% agar w/v) and poured onto an LB plate. 5 mm wells were bored and filled with the culture supernatant. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 6 hours, until the B. subtilis lawn was clearly visible and the halo was measured. Generation and mapping of S. marcescens Db10-Tn5 mutants To obtain S. marcescens transposon mutants, S. marcescens Db10 was incubated in the presence of the transposon donor strain E. coli S17-1 λPir harbouring plasmid pUT-mini-Tn5lacZ1 [39]. Individual S. marcescens Db10 Tn5 mutant colonies were patched onto an LB agar plate and an LB agar plate seeded with a lawn of B. subtilis strain NCIB3610. In total 2800 S. marcescens Db10 Tn5 mutants were screened. Of these, 6 colonies that showed a decreased ability to kill B. subtilis NCIB3610 were isolated and purified. The location of the insertion was mapped using inverse PCR of TaqI digested chromosomal DNA with primers NSW755 and NSW756 (Table S1). PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing (College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee). The positions of the Tn5 insertions within the S. marcescens genome were located by BLAST analysis [41] of the genome using the publicly available server at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/bacteria/serratia-marcescens.html. In order to analyse and utilise the complete sequences of relevant genes, the complete S. marcescens Db11 genome sequence and preliminary gene prediction were obtained from the Sanger Institute (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/bacteria/serratia-marcescens.html). Db10 is the direct parent of Db11. The genomic locations of the alb1–alb6 and PPTase-encoding genes are given in Table S4. Generalised transduction Mini-Tn5 insertions were introduced into a clean genetic background by generalised transduction using the φIF3 bacteriophage, according to the published procedure [42]. Transductants were selected on kanamycin and phage sensitivity was confirmed. RNA isolation S. marcescens Db10 was spotted onto an agar plate and incubated (16 h) at 30°C. Cells were collected and processed for RNA extraction using the RiboPure™-Bacteria RNA extraction kit (Ambion®) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop™ spectrophotometer. RT-PCR RNA was DNAse treated and cDNA was synthesised [43]. To confirm the RNA samples were free from contaminant DNA, samples of RNA lacking Superscript III (Invitrogen) were treated in parallel with samples intended for cDNA synthesis. PCR reactions using Taq DNA polymerase were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) with 25 cycles. Primer sequences are detailed in Table S1. 5′ RACE The transcription start site of alb1 was determined using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ RACE) using DNase treated RNA harvested from S. marcescens Db10. The method used was as described previously with the following exceptions [43]. 12.5 µl of synthesized cDNA was 5′-dA-tailed (rather than 5′-dC-tailed) by replacing the dCTP with dATP. From the poly-dA tailed cDNA, PCR was used to amplify the alb1 promoter region using primers NSW698 and the oligo dT anchor primer (SM044) with the conditions as described previously [43]. Here a second round of PCR was necessary to increase the quantity of product using 0.625 µM oligo dT anchor primer 2 (SM045) and 0.625 µM primer AG033. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript-KS II and ten plasmids from two independent rounds of 5′ RACE were sequenced. Detection of Alb4 and Alb5 from total cellular protein To detect Alb4 and Alb5 from total cellular proteins, S. marcescens Db10, SAN4 (S. marcescens Db10 Δalb3) and SAN5 (S. marcescens Db10 Δalb4–5) were grown to stationary phase in LB (16 h) at 30°C. Cells from 0.5 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. Cells were suspended in 100 µl 2× gel sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 3.2% SDS, 3.2 mM EDTA, 16% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 15 min. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a Mini-PROTEAN TGX 4–15% Precast gradient system (Bio-rad®) and visualised by staining with Coomassie blue. Characterisation of the Db10 secreted compound All strains were cultured in LB medium. Seed cultures were grown overnight at 30°C and 180 rpm. 5 ml of medium was inoculated with 10 µl of seed culture and the resulting culture was grown for 48 hours under the same conditions. Supernatant and methanol extracts of biomass were analysed by LC-MS on a Dionex 3000RS UHPLC coupled to a Bruker MaXis Q-TOF mass spectrometer. A Sigma Ascentis Express column (C18, 150×2.1 mm, 2.7 µm) was used. Mobile phases consisted of A (water containing 0.1% formic acid) and B (methanol containing 0.1% formic acid). A gradient of 20% B to 100% B in 15 minutes was employed with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Absorbance at 270 nm was monitored. The mass spectrometer was operated in electrospray positive ion mode with a scan range of 50–2,000 m/z. Source conditions were: end plate offset at −500 V; capillary at −4500 V; nebulizer gas (N2) at 1.6 bar; dry gas (N2) at 8 L/min; dry Temperature at 180°C. Ion tranfer conditions: ion funnel RF at 200 Vpp; multiple RF at 200 Vpp; quadruple low mass at 55 m/z; collision energy at 5.0 ev; collision RF at 600 Vpp; ion cooler RF at 50–350 Vpp; transfer time at 121 µs; pre-Pulse storage time at 1 µs. Calibration was done with sodium formate (10 mM) through a loop injection of 20 µL of standard solution at the beginning of each run. Purification of althiomycin Althiomycin was purified from the supernatant of a spent LB culture by semi-preparative HPLC (Agilent Zorbax, RP-C18, 100×21 mm, 5 µm) on an Agilent 1100 instrument. Mobile phases consisted of A: water containing 0.1% formic acid and B: methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 5 ml/min and absorbance at 270 nm was monitored. A gradient of 20% B (see above) to 100% B in 25 minutes was employed for the first purification. Fractions containing althiomycin were identified by MS and pooled. The pooled fractions were freeze-dried after solvent removal at reduced pressure; the dried material was then dissolved in a small volume of methanol and re-purified on the same column with a gradient of 60% B to 100% B over 25 minutes. Fractions containing althiomycin were freeze-dried and dissolved in 200 µl of d6-DMSO for NMR analysis.
