MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and identification of Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038. The soil sample was collected in May 2012 in the tropical rain forest in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, People’s Republic of China, at an altitude of 488 m and latitude and longitude N21°30′, E100°46′. Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 was isolated by using YIM 171 medium (raffinose, 5.0 g/L; histidine, 1.0 g/L; K2HPO4, 1.0 g/L; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g/L; agar, 15.0 g/L; water to 1 L [pH 7.2 to 7.4]) and incubation temperature of 28°C. Genomic DNA of YIM 121038 was isolated as described below and was used as a template to PCR amplify a 16S rRNA gene fragment using a previously described protocol (25). The resulting DNA fragment was sequenced, and the sequence was deposited in GenBank. Genome sequencing and analyses. For genome sequencing, chromosomal DNA was used to generate a TruSeq PCR-free library that was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system in a 2× 300-nucleotide (nt) run. A total of 559.3 Mbp of sequence materials (52.4× coverage) was assembled using Newbler version 2.8 (Roche), resulting in 117 scaffolds containing 214 contigs. Subsequently, 400 ng of genomic DNA was used to generate a second shotgun library for sequencing on the MinION system (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Using the rapid barcoding kit (SQK-RBK004), a one-dimensional (1D) sequencing library was created and sequenced on an R9.5 flow cell in a 24-h run on the MinION sequencer. Base calling and sequence material conversion were performed using Albacore version 2.1.7 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), yielding 11,928 reads with a total length of 166.6 Mbp (13,964-nt average read length, 15× coverage). The assembly was performed with Canu version 1.6 (26). After assembly, the resulting three contigs were polished with the short Illumina reads using Pilon (27). The final assembly and polishing were done manually using Consed (28) to assemble the two contigs making up the chromosome and to resolve polishing artifacts in repetitive regions. This resulted in two contigs representing the complete linear chromosome and the complete linear plasmid pSSP121038. Gene prediction and annotation were performed applying Prokka (29). Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence and protein sequences of CsbB and its homologues were performed with MEGA7 (30). Generation of recombinant bacterial strains, plasmids, and general growth conditions. The genomic DNA from Streptomyces was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, USA), as described previously (31). The culture was prepared by inoculation of 50 mL of 3% tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium (Oxoid, United Kingdom) with 50 μL of fresh prepared spore suspension (20% [vol/vol] glycerol) and incubation in 250-mL baffled flasks at 28°C at 250 rpm. All routine DNA standard techniques, cloning methods, and plasmid transformation into Escherichia coli were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (32). PCR amplifications were done with Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using oligonucleotides listed in Table S3A in the supplemental material. Plasmids and bacterial strains used or constructed during this study are represented in Table S3B. (A) Oligonucleotides used in this study. Italic indicates an endonuclease restriction enzyme site.

Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar supplemented with chloramphenicol (25 μg mL−1), apramycin (100 μg mL−1), and kanamycin (25 μg mL−1). XL1-Blue was used for general cloning, and ET12567(pUZ8002) was used for intergeneric conjugative transfer of plasmids to Streptomyces, as described previously (33). Identification, purification, and structure elucidation of new compounds. Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 was cultured in 500 mL TSB medium plus apramycin at 30°C for 4 days on the shaker. The culture was centrifuged and the pellet was extracted with acetone. The extract was dried and separated by RP-HPLC (Phenomenex Luna 5-μm C18, 10 by 250 mm, 2.0 mL/min, 220 nm) with a gradient elution from 5% MeCN plus 0.1% formic acid (FA) to 100% MeCN plus 0.1% FA. The fraction containing compound 1 was further separated by RP-HPLC (Phenomenex Luna 5-μm phenyl-hexyl, 10 by 250 mm, 2.0 mL/min, 200 nm) with 30% MeCN plus 0.1% FA to obtain desertomycin X (compound 1) (1.0 mg). Fraction containing compound 2 was separated by RP-HPLC (Phenomenex Kinetex 5-μm C18, 10 by 250 mm, 2.0 mL/min, 200 nm) with 27% MeCN plus 0.1% FA to obtain desertomycin A (compound 2) (3.9 mg). LC-ESIMS was performed on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer equipped with a cold probe at 500 MHz and 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz and 150 MHz for 13C NMR at 298 K. Chemical shifts were referenced to the solvent peaks at δH 2.50 and δC 39.51 for DMSO-d6 and δH 3.31 and δC 49.15 for methanol-d4. NMR data are presented in Table S4A and B. (A) NMR data of desertomycin X (compound 1); (B) NMR data of desertomycin A (compound 2). Download Table S4, DOCX file, 0.02 MB. To analyze the time-dependent production of desertomycin A and desertomycin X, Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 was cultured in 20 mL TSB medium supplied with apramycin at 30°C for 6 days on the shaker. Two milliliters of culture was sampled daily with further separation of supernatant and pellet by centrifugation and freeze drying. Next, the supernatant was extracted with methanol and the pellet with 80% acetone. Antimicrobial activity testing. Testing of antimicrobial activities of desertomycin A and X was done by disk diffusion assay using Bacillus subtilis 164, Escherichia coli DH5a, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 as test organisms. Desertomycins were dissolved in DMSO to a stock solution of 8 mg/mL and tested in triplicate at final assay concentrations from 128 to 0.25 μg/mL. In vitro susceptibility for desertomycin A was determined at Medina Foundation (Granada, Spain) by the broth microdilution method following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocol (34) using bacterial strains from the company’s strain collection (Table S4). Construction of the CsbC expression vectors. Expression of codon-optimized gene csbC was carried out using the pET-30a(+) vector (Novagen). The synthetic csbC gene encoded the protein with 6×His tag on its N terminus, and was cloned into the pET30a(+) vector as a NdeI-BamHI fragment, yielding the pET-CsbC-S vector. For the experiments aimed at verifying enzyme activity in vivo, the vector pET-CsbC-S was modified by replacement of the gene Kanr gene by the Ampr gene. For this purpose, the Ampr gene cassette (1,150 bp) was amplified from the pGEM-3Zf(+) vector with the primer set pGEM_Amp_fwd/pGEM_Amp_rev (supplemental material), and the PCR product was introduced into the 5.3-kb SmaI/PsiI fragment of the vector pET-CsbC-S and 4.7-kb SmaI/PsiI fragment of the vector pET30a(+) via Gibson assembly, yielding plasmids pA_CsbC-S and pA (negative control in assays). To prove the activity of CsbC in vivo Streptomyces cells, the pUWL_CsbCwt vector was generated; its construction was based on ligation of the amplified native gene csbC from YIM 121038 genomic DNA (gDNA) (designated below as csbCwt) and the pUWLoriT vector, over restriction enzymes MfeI/HindIII and EcoRI/HindIII, respectively. Heterologous expression of recombinant CsbC. To determine the activity of the CsbC enzyme in vitro, it was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) cells harboring pET-CsbC vector. After overnight incubation at 37°C with kanamycin, a 5-mL overnight culture was used to inoculate 200 mL triconcentrated LB medium supplemented with kanamycin. The cultivation was carried out at 37°C. To initiate overexpression, the culture was induced with 0.5 mM final concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when it reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1. After induction, the incubation was continued for 2 h at 25°C and overnight at 15°C at 220 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 4,000 × rpm at 4°C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL lysis buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 8], 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 100 μg/mL lysozyme), and the cells were disrupted using a Bioruptor Plus (amplitude, 30%; cycle 3) for 10 min. The sonicated samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 rpm at 4°C, and the supernatant was filtrated through a 2-μm-pore filter to remove cell debris. CsbC with a fused 6×His tag was purified via Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) affinity chromatography following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen), with the following exceptions for the buffers: washing buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 8], 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT), elution buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 8]), and dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl [pH 8], 50 mM NaCl). The purity of recombinant CsbC and its concentration were determined by SDS-PAGE and the Bradford assay, respectively. Assays for CsbC activity in vitro. The assay for CsbC activity was carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 25 mM succinyl-CoA sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) and various compounds as acyl group acceptors. The following acceptor compounds were used: 4 mM putrescine, 4 mM ornithine, 0.4 mM desertomycin A, ethionamide, colistin, vancomycin, gentamicin, daptomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin, ampicillin, and 0.2 mM trimethoprim. Activity of CsbC with substrates kanamycin, ampicillin, and acetyl-CoA was also investigated. The total reaction mixture of 100 μL was incubated 2 h at 30°C, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 0.5 μL formic acid. Negative-control samples were prepared in the same way, except that formic acid was added to the mixture before substrate to deactivate CsbC. After the reaction was terminated, 50 μL of reaction mixture was applied directly onto the disc for bioassays, and the remaining 50 μL was analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Generation and analysis of enzyme kinetics data. To study the kinetics of CsbC, a 50-μL reaction mixture was prepared, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 25 mM succinyl-CoA, 2 mg/mL CsbC, and various ampicillin (Amp) concentrations (0 to 8.1 mM). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C and terminated at different time points (0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) by addition of 0.5% formic acid. Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 15 min), and formation of succinylated ampicillin (Amp-S) was monitored by HPLC (with the same column and conditions as for LC-MS/MS analysis) by injection of a 5-μL sample. The peak area for Amp-S at ca. 18 min and 190 nm (Areaunknown) was identified with LabSolutions version 5.97 software (Shimadzu Corporations). As a standard concentration (Cknown), the sample with 0.2 mmol Amp was used. In this reaction, according to the HPLC chromatogram, all Amp was succinylated after 30 min of incubation. Thus, the measured area in HPLC at 190 nm (Areaknown) and known standard concentrations (0.2 mmol) were used in the following equation to determine Cunknown: Cunknown = (Areaunknown/Areaknown) × Cknown. LC-MS analyses. LC-MS/MS analyses of the reaction mixtures were performed on a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the ESI source of an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Separation was carried out on an Acclaim 120 C18 column (2.1 by 150 mm, 3 μm) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using water and acetonitrile, both modified with 0.1% formic acid, as mobile phases A and B, respectively. Depending on the polarity of the substrate, the sample components were separated and eluted with either of the following two gradient programs: (i) a linear gradient from 5% to 95% B in 45 min, followed by an isocratic column cleaning (9.5 min at 95% B) and reequilibration step (10 min at 5% B); or (ii) a gradient starting with an isocratic step at 3% B for 1 min, followed by a linear gradient from 3% to 30% B in 9 min, an increase to 95% B in 0.5 min, and finally an isocratic column cleaning (5 min at 95% B) and reequilibration step (9 min at 3% B). The flow rates were 0.45 and 0.50 mL/min, respectively, and the column oven temperature was set to 25°C. High-resolution ESI-MS (HR-ESIMS) spectra were recorded in positive-ion mode with an FT resolution of 60.000. High- or low-resolution ESIMS/MS spectra of the three most intense precursor ions in each MS1 spectrum were obtained in automated materials-dependent acquisition mode using helium as the collision gas and the following settings: activation type, CID; isolation width, Δm/z = 3; normalized collision energy, 35.0; activation Q, 0.250; and activation time, 30 ms. LC-MS/MS data for the cell pellet and supernatant extracts of the Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 cultures were obtained on a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system coupled to a timsTOF fleX mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) under similar conditions to those described above. CsbC activity in vivo. To test an in vivo activity of CsbC, the experiments were carried with E. coli BL21(DE3) and S. lividans TK24 strains. Single colonies of E. coli BL21 strains carrying csbC-expressing vectors pET-CsbC or pA-CsbC and control vector pET30a(+) or pA were inoculated in LB containing Kan for pET constructs or Amp for pA constructs and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. One milliliter of overnight cultures was added into the 250 mL LB supplemented with Kan/Amp and incubated at 37°C up to an OD600 of 0.25. Next, samples were divided, and some were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and incubated at 20°C for 1 h (pET constructs) or at 30°C for 30 min (pA vectors). After induction, some samples containing pA vectors were supplemented with 5 μg/mL Kan. After 24 h of incubation, 2 mL of the cultures was harvested, the obtained cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL lysis buffer, and the cells were disrupted by sonication. The production of CsbC was determined by Western blotting with 15 μL filtered extract using an antibody specific for the 6×His tag. After induction, different concentrations of Amp (0 to 50 μg/mL) were added to the cultures harboring pET30a(+) and pET-CsbC vectors with subsequent incubation for 18 h at 20°C and determination of the final OD600. Fifty microliters each of spore suspension of S. lividans/pUWL-csbC and S. lividans/pUWLoriT strains was inoculated in YEME medium (35) supplemented with 30 μg/mL thiostrepton and kanamycin (0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 7 μg/mL) and incubated for 3 days at 28°C at 220 rpm. In parallel, 50 μL of spore suspension were plated on SFM agar plates with the same antibiotic concentrations as for liquid YEME medium and incubated at 28°C. Data availability.
