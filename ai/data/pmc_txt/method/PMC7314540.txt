MATERIALS AND METHODS Estimation of kinetic parameters of AmiN Ami phosphorylation was performed in reaction buffer containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. Ami dependence of the reaction rate was measured at 30°C with 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.01 or 0.1 nM enzyme for 20 to 200 nM or 200 nM to 10 μM Ami, respectively. ATP dependence was measured with 30 μM to 10 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 μM Ami, and 0.1 nM AmiN at 30°C. Mg2+ dependence was measured with 0.05 to 100 mM MgCl2, 0.2 to 0.4 mM ATP, 1 μM Ami, and 0.1 nM AmiN at 30°C. Metal dependence for AmiN and hAmiN was measured using 10 mM ATP, 10 mM Me2+, 1 μM Ami, and 0.1 nM enzyme at 30°C. Reaction mix was analyzed using Symmetry C18, 5 μm, 3.9 × 150 mm (Waters) reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column; buffer A [10 mM NH4OAc (pH 5.0) and 5% ACN], buffer B [10 mM NH4OAc (pH 5.0) and 80% ACN]; flow rate: 1 ml/min: gradient: 0 to 1 min (0% B), 1 to 11 min (0 to 67% B), and 11 to 11.5 min (67 to 100% B) on Chromaster HPLC System (Hitachi) as described previously (12). Amicoumacin and its phosphorylated product were monitored using Chromaster Fluorescence Detector (λex = 317 nm and λem = 469 nm). Reaction rates were determined in triplicate. KM and kcat constants were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics at 20 to 200 nM Ami concentrations, assuming [ATP•Mg2+] >> [Ami]. Kinetic constants were determined using Prism 7 (GraphPad) software. Data represent means ± SD. Estimation of thermodynamic parameters of substrate binding The thermodynamic parameters of binding of ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/Ami to AmiN and Ami/phosphorylated Ami to AmiN-nucleotide complexes were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, USA) at 25°C in 20 mM bis-tris-propane-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 2 mM MgCl2 (or 2 mM CaCl2) (pH 8.5). Aliquots (2.5 μl) of ligands were injected into a 0.2-ml cell containing the protein solution to achieve a complete binding isotherm. Protein solution (20 μM) in the cell and 250 μM ligand in the titrant syringe were used for each experiment. In the case of AmiN-nucleotide complexes, samples contained 20 μM protein and 50 μM AMP-PNP or ADP. The heat of dilution was measured by injection of the ligand into the buffer solution; the values obtained were subtracted from the heat of reaction to calculate the effective heat of binding. All measurements were done in triplicate. The resulting titration curves were fitted and analyzed using the Microcal Origin software, assuming one set of binding sites. Affinity constants (Ka) and enthalpy variations (ΔH) were determined, and entropy variations (ΔS) were calculated from the equationΔG=−RTlnKa=ΔH−TΔS Crystallization of AmiN and hAmiN AmiN and hAmiN crystals were grown at 19°C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. All samples were centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min before crystallization. Native AmiN crystals were produced by combining 1 μl of protein with a concentration of 25 mg/ml and an equal volume of crystallization solution containing 0.1 M tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2.5 to 2.65 M ammonium sulfate. AmiN in complex with ATP was crystallized under similar conditions with preliminary mixing of protein and ATP (added to a final concentration of 10 mM). In both cases, the crystals appeared within 12 to 24 hours. For crystallization of AmiN in complex with AMP-PNP, Mg2+, and Ami, protein with a final concentration of 70 mg/ml (1.8 mM) was mixed with AMP-PNP, Ami, and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10, 3.6, and 20 mM, respectively. Crystals were obtained by mixing 1 μl of protein complex solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 M tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1.1 M LiCl, and 27.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. These crystals appeared within 3 to 5 days. In the case of hAmiN, protein with a final concentration of 40 mg/ml (1 mM) was mixed with AMP-PNP, Ami, and MgCl2 or CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2.2, 2, and 20 mM, respectively. hAmiN crystals were produced using 1 μl of protein complex solution and 1 μl of the crystallization solution containing 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), 0.2 M sodium acetate, and 27 to 29% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME (monomethyl ether). Crystals appeared within 2 to 3 days. Estimation of AmiN and hAmiN activity toward different substrates AmiN and hAmiN activity toward a broad range of substrates was measured using Fluorometric Universal Kinase Assay Kit ab138879 (Abcam) on the basis of quantification of released ADP. The following substrates listed below were used: N-acetylglucosamine, glucosamine 6-phosphate, glucose, sucrose, sorbitol, glycerol, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol (tris), serine, threonine, tyrosine, MBP, YAS-NH2, YLS-NH2, YS-NH2, PSW-NH2, choline, aminomethyl propanol, 3-dimethylamino-1-propanol, N-methyl-d-glucamine, glucosamine, galactosamine, kanamycin, ethanolamine, 3-amino-1-propanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, NS-NH2, Ac-PSW-NH2, Ac-ISW-NH2, Ac-RSW-NH2, NSL-NH2, NSLY-NH2, SL-NH2, and SLY-NH2. The ADP release was assayed in 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM substrates using 0.2 μM enzymes. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 30 min and assayed with ab138879 (Abcam) kit in kinetic mode using the Varioskan Flash reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The estimated release of ADP was calculated using the calibration curve, and background ADP released in the substrate-free reaction was subtracted. Reaction rates v/[E] were determined in triplicate and analyzed by multiple t tests using Prism 7 (GraphPad) software. Simulation of opening/closure dynamics Opening/closure free energy profiles were reconstructed in two dimensions with metadynamics implemented in Plumed 2.5.1 (32). The first collective variable (CV) corresponded to the interdomain distance, and the second corresponded to the relative twist of domains (fig. S14). To calculate the interdomain distance as the first CV, domain centers were designated as centers of mass of Cα atoms only, where the left domain is demarcated as a set of residues 1 to 55 and 84 to 110 and the right domain is demarcated as a set of residues 156 to 189 and 281 to 320. This CV was subsequently centered at the value corresponding to the closed AmiN kinase (30 Å). The second CV, being the twist of protein fold, was described as a torsion angle between Cα atoms of residues 46, 4, 302, and 184 and centered at the value for closed AmiN kinase (107°). Well-tempered metadynamics simulation was performed in parallel by 15 walkers, deposing a Gaussian potential with an initial height of 0.25 kJ/mol and a width of 0.025 nm, 0.025 rad each 1000 steps with time step of 1 fs. Bias factor was set to 9. Profile was sampled for 10 ns per walker. Simulation of phosphate transfer reaction Reaction free energy profiles were reconstructed in one and two dimensions with metadynamics. For one-dimensional profiles, collective variable was designed asCV1=d1−d2 whered1=mini(d (Oβi−Pγ)) andd2=d(Pγ−OAmi)to capture the phosphorus transfer process. Here, Oβi stands for each of three beta-oxygens of ATP. For two-dimensional description, second variable was added asCV2=d3−d4 whered3=d(OAmi−HAmi) andd4=minj(d(OD202j−HAmi))to explicitly capture the proton transfer process. Here, OD202j stands for each of two carboxylate oxygens of D202. Well-tempered metadynamics simulation (33) was performed in parallel by 28 walkers, deposing a Gaussian potential with an initial height of 2.0 kJ/mol and a width of 0.005 nm in each direction each 100 steps with time step 0.2 fs. Bias factor was set to 20. Profile was sampled for 20 ps per walker. Simulation of Ami proton transfer Free energy profiles of proton transfer from Ami-NH3+ to either E36 or D222 were reconstructed with metadynamics along single variableD=mini,j(d(Hi−Oj))where Hi is any of three protons on the NH3+ group and Oj is any of two carboxylate oxygens. Well-tempered metadynamics simulation was performed in parallel by eight walkers, deposing a Gaussian potential with an initial height of 1.0 kJ/mol and a width of 0.005 nm each 50 steps with time step of 0.2 fs. Bias factor was set to 15. Profile was sampled for 20 ps per walker.
