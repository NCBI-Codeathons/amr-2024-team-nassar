Results Isolation and identification of the Txn‐degrading enzyme To isolate Txn‐degrading bacteria, healthy rice seeds were germinated in AB minimal medium with 40 μg m–1 Txn. Two bacterial isolates that survived in the presence of Txn were isolated. The isolated bacteria were identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva SG14 and Agrobacterium sp. AL14 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing (> 99% identities) and whole‐cell matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF MS; score 2.2, species identification; and 1.6, genus identification respectively). To identify the genes responsible for Txn degradation, random mariner‐based transposon mutagenesis was performed in S. adhaesiva SG14. Seven mutants of S. adhaesiva SG14, which exhibited growth deficiency in Txn, were isolated, and their transposon‐flanking regions were analysed using touchdown PCR and sequencing. Sequencing revealed that the mutation sites were physically close. Two possible open reading frames, called stdA (Sphingomonas toxoflavin‐degrading gene) and stdR, were identified (GenBank accession no. MH253465) in 2.1 kb‐DNA regions, which were confirmed by PCR analysis using primers StdB and StdH, and sequencing (Fig. 1). One mutant of Agrobacterium sp. AL14, which exhibited growth deficiency in Txn, was isolated, and its transposon‐flanking region was analysed. Surprisingly, a gene 100% identical to that of S. adhaesiva SG14, annotated as glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance/dioxygenase, was identified (Fig. 1).

Highlighted letters represent the T‐N11‐A sequences of the putative LysR‐type transcriptional regulator (LTTR)‐binding boxes. The ribosomal binding site is underlined. Using primers StdH and StdB, the region of 2.1 kb‐DNA containing stdR and stdA genes was confirmed by PCR. The gene stdA encodes a protein that expected to be 16.37 kDa with 153 amino acid residues, which was much smaller than the previously reported tflA gene encoding 221 amino acid residues (Koh et al., 2011). BLASTP analysis showed 97% identity with the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily of Klebsiella pneumoniae (GenBank accession no. WP_023288345). VOC is found in a variety of structurally related metalloproteins, including extradiol dioxygenases, glyoxalase and antibiotic resistance proteins. Amino acid sequence analysis of StdA demonstrated 25.81% identity with human glyoxalase I (SWIS‐MODEL; template 3vw9.1) (Fig. S1). The gene stdR is 927 bp and encodes a protein expected to be 34 kDa. BLASTP analysis showed 75% identity with the LysR‐type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) of Sphingomonas panacis (GenBank accession no. WP_069206523). The presence of the putative T‐N11‐A sequences of the LTTR‐binding boxes suggests the regulation of stdA expression is under StdR control in S. adhaesiva SG14 and Agrobacterium sp. AL14 (Fig. 1). stdR and stdA are responsible for Txn degradation To further confirm the function of stdA and stdR in Txn‐degrading activity, lacZY transcriptional integrations of stdA and non‐polar deletion mutations of stdR were generated in both SG14 and AL14 strains. Wild‐type strains were resistant to Txn, whereas stdA
– or ΔstdR mutants were sensitive. Genetic complementation of stdA

The Txn degradation was confirmed using thin‐layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, which was proven to be a simple and effective method for the detection of Txn and its derivatives (Fig. 2B and D).

Biochemical characteristics of the Txn‐degrading enzyme, StdA To determine the biochemical characteristics of the Txn‐degrading enzyme StdA, StdA was overexpressed and purified as a His‐tagged recombinant protein from E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pCOK393(pET21b::stdA). StdA‐His was 17.19 kDa (Fig. S2A). The optimum pH and temperature for Txn degradation of StdA‐His were pH 8.0–8.5 and 28°C respectively (Fig. 3A and B). StdA‐His was stable at high temperature. The Txn‐degrading activity of StdA‐His was retained from 15 to 55°C (Fig. S2B). The specific activity and KM values of StdA‐His were 0.329 µmol min–1 mg–1 and 64.98 μM respectively (Fig. 3C). Unlike other metal‐dependent extradiol dioxygenases, StdA‐His degraded Txn in the absence of metal ions and required DTT for Txn degradation (Fig. 3D).

Corresponding spots were visualized under UV wavelength at 365 nm. To investigate the substrate specificity of StdA‐His, various Txn derivatives were tested as substrates (Fig. S3). Txn (100%) and reumycin (> 80%) were degraded by 3 μM StdA–His in 10 min at 28°C; however, other derivatives showed no detectable degradation (Fig. 3E). These results indicated that StdA has a high degree of specificity for Txn without a metal ion requirement. StdR regulates the expression of stdA in the presence of Txn To determine if StdR regulates stdA expression, we analysed the expression of stdA::lacZY in wild‐type SG14, ΔstdR and stdR‐complemented strain backgrounds (Fig. 4A). When β‐galactosidase activity was measured in each strain, stdA expression was abolished in the absence of StdR or Txn. StdR induced stdA expression in the presence of 1–10 μM Txn (Fig. 4B). Mutant strains were sensitive to Txn at concentrations higher than 10 μM, so concentrations below 10 μM were used. These results indicated that the StdR positively regulates the expression of stdA, and StdR requires Txn as a coinducer to activate the expression of stdA (Fig. 4B). By combining genetics with gene expression analysis, we propose a novel working model of how bacteria quench Txn (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that bacteria mimic the mechanism of Txn biosynthesis regulation (Fig. 4D) and employ it in the development of the Txn‐quenching regulation system.

ToxRTxn‐mediated autoregulation of Txn biosynthesis and efflux transporter system of Burkholderia glumae. Characterization of the StdR, Txn‐quenching regulator The specific DNA sequence of stdR revealed that StdR exhibits functional domains including DNA binding, Txn recognition/response and oligomerization (Schell, 1993; Kim et al., 2009). The sequence of StdR is similar to that of ToxR of B. glumae and contains a helix‐turn‐helix (HTH) motif in its N‐terminal domain (Fig. 5). To determine the regions of StdR important for stdA expression, StdR mutants were constructed in a similar manner as the StdA mutants. The StdR mutants were introduced into the ΔstdR stdA::lacZY mutant strain by conjugation, and their activation activities were analysed via stdA expression using β‐galactosidase assay. We examined six StdR mutants (P9L, V27A, N35S, P39S, L64P and R69Q) associated with DNA binding, three mutants (L106P, L115R and L191H,) associated with the coinducer recognition/response, and three mutants (W234R, G243E and D288G) associated with the oligomerization‐impaired expression of stdA (Fig. 5A and B). The results were consistent with the putative Txn binding pockets and oligomerization interfaces predicted based on the sequence‐structure comparison with Burkholderia sp. DntR structure (1UTH_A) (Kim et al., 2009). Fig. 5Characterization of the StdR Txn‐quenching regulator.A.

The column denotes the data mean, and error bars indicate the range. Next, we investigated the coinducer specificity of StdR with Txn and its derivatives (Fig. S3). The expression of stdA was induced only in the presence of Txn, indicating that Txn is a specific coinducer of StdR (Fig. 5C). The stdAR genes are present in a mobile plasmid To determine whether toxoflavin‐degrading genes, stdAR, are present in the mobile plasmid, we performed conjugation assays using the stdA::lacZY mutant strain (kanamycin‐resistant) as a donor. Agrobacterium tumefaciencs C58 harbouring pSRKGm (gentamycin‐resistant) was used as a recipient. The conjugation rates of SG14 stdA::lacZY strain and AL14 stdA::lacZY strain were 2.2 × 10‐7 transconjugants per donor and 2.2 × 10‐9 transconjugants per donor respectively. Transconjugants showing kanamycin and gentamycin resistance were confirmed using multiplex PCR amplification for simultaneous detection of stdA and virD genes (Fig. S4). These results suggest that the toxoflavin‐degrading genes are present in the plasmid and horizontal transfer occurs. Txn‐quenching is an ideal antivirulence strategy in Txn‐mediated diseases To determine whether transgenic plants expressing stdA are resistant to Txn, the pBS43 was constructed for plant transformation. The coding region of stdA was amplified and cloned into pCAMBIA 1300PT, which contains the hygromycin resistance gene under the control of the 35S promoter, resulting in pBS43 (Fig. 6A). Agrobacterium‐mediated rice transformation was performed using rice‐calli inoculation with A. tumefaciens LBA4404 carrying pBS43. Leaf discs of the T1 rice transgenic line, Nd43‐1, showed resistance against Txn up to 20 µg ml–1 (Fig. 6B). Wild‐type Nakdongbyeo was sensitive to 5 µg ml–1 Txn and showed complete chlorosis in 20 µg ml–1 Txn under light conditions. However, the Nd43‐1 line showed chlorosis only at the merged regions of leaf discs in 20 µg ml–1 Txn (Fig. 6B). These results were confirmed by the quantification of chlorophyll. As the Txn concentration increased, the chlorophyll levels in wild‐type rice leaf discs gradually decreased (Fig. 6B). The Nd43‐1 line exhibited approximate 60% Txn degradation compared to the wild type (Fig. 6C). Putative T1 rice transformants were verified using reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR with a stdA gene primer (Fig. 6D). These results indicated that rice expressing stdA may be useful in the development of cultivars resistant to rice grain rot. Fig. 6Transgenic rice plants expressing StdA.A.
