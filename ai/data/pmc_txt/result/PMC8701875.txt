2. Results and Discussion 2.1. FTIR Spectroscopy Studies Figure 1 shows the FTIR spectra of TMG polysaccharide, pure TMGA hydrogel, DOX, DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel and TMGA-Ag. The pure tamarind gum (TMG) polysaccharide (Figure 1A) demonstrated a broad stretching vibration at 3416.32 cm−1 for aliphatic -O-H and 2920.95 cm−1 for -C-H groups. The pristine TMGA hydrogel spectrum is depicted in Figure 1B, with peaks observed at 1729.52 cm−1 and 1612.95 for (acid/amide) -C=O stretching vibration. The broad peak for TMG’s -O-H bending vibration was recorded at 1380.95 cm−1 [29,30]. Furthermore, peaks for P-O, P=O, and -C-O-C stretching vibrations emerged at 1216.19 and 1053 cm−1, confirming the existence of phosphate crosslinker (BMEP). Figure 2 depicts the pure medication DOX spectrum (C). DOX showed characteristic peaks at 3334.28 cm−1, corresponding to -O-H and N-H stretching vibrations, and another peak at 1720 cm−1, corresponding to -C=O stretching vibrations. The peak at 1592.38 cm−1 corresponds to unsaturated -C=C- stretching vibration and 1399.04 cm−1 corresponds to hydroxy group -O-H bending vibration. Figure 1D depicts the spectrum of a DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel, with a characteristic peak at 3435.23 cm−1 corresponding to the -O-H functional moiety and a peak at 1667 cm−1 corresponding to the -CO-NH- functional moiety, and a peak at 1564 cm−1 corresponding to the unsaturated -C=C- stretching vibration of DOX. Figure 1E shows the FTIR spectrum of a green synthesis of TMGA hydrogel silver nanocomposite using aqueous leaf extract Terminali bellirica; the stretching vibrational peaks at 3425.12, 1612.89, 1389 and 1056.13 cm−1 reveal the phenolic moiety, amide and -C=O of hydrogels, respectively. The results show that TMG-based hydrogels can be successfully synthesized using simple free radical polymerization, DOX can be incorporated in TMGA hydrogels and silver nanoparticles can be produced in an environmentally safe manner. Figure 2 depicts a probable schematic chemistry of TMGA hydrogel. 2.2. UV–Visible Spectroscopy TGM-derived natural polysaccharide-based hydrogels were employed as templates for the green synthesis of solver nanoparticles from Terminalia bellirica leaf extract, an eco-friendly reducing agent. Essentially, the reduction of silver ions to silver nanoparticles is proven by a color change from light yellow to black at ambient temperature and a reaction time of 180 min, as shown in Figure 3. Significant absorption peaks were detected at 428–436 nm as a result of a quantum mechanical process known as surface plasmon resonance, which leads in the creation of silver nanoparticles within polymer networks with the help of polymer chains [31,32]. 2.3. X-ray Diffraction Studies of TMGA Hydrogel XRD was used to analyze the crystalline behavior of pure tamarind gum, pristine TMGA hydrogel, pure DOX, DOX-loaded hydrogel and TMGA-Ag hydrogel; the diffractograms are shown in Figure 4. The XRD curves of pure tamarind gum and pristine TMGA hydrogel (Figure 4A,B) are not shown in any significant crystalline peaks, which may be due their amorphous behavior. However, the XRD curve of pure DOX (Figure 4C) shows significant crystalline peaks at two theta values: 17.30°, 23.24°, 25.24°, 32.40°, 35.25°, and 40.29°. The DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel (Figure 4D) showed characteristic DOX peaks at two theta values: 17.52°, 19.53° and 25.29°, showing that DOX is physically present, chemically stable and molecularly distributed within the hydrogel network. The XRD pattern of the TMGA-Ag hydrogel (Figure 4E) showed typical peaks at 38.46°, 44.41°, 63.12° and 76.46° for planes (111), (200), (220) and (311), respectively [31,32]. These findings suggest that the silver nanoparticles found in the hydrogel network are face-centered cubic crystals in nature. 2.4. SEM and TEM Studies SEM and TEM are the most commonly employed techniques for the characterization of all types of materials to obtain quantitative data, i.e., morphology and particle size. The surface morphology and elemental analysis were analyzed for pristine TMGA hydrogel and DOX-loaded hydrogel, and TMGA-Ag hydrogels were examined with SEM and TEM; images are shown in Figure 5. Pristine hydrogel exhibited a smooth surface owing to hydrophilic behavior of functional moieties (hydroxyl and amide) present in the polymer network (Figure 5A,B). DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel has a rough surface compared to pristine hydrogel (Figure 5C), which may be due to (1) the presence of DOX molecules in and outside the network, which are formed as debris at the time of dehydration; (2) the surface having a high surface area based on the synthesis process, resulting in the rough surface. Ag nanoparticles were produced by a green method using aqueous leaf extract to reduce the Ag+ ions. Figure 5D–F show the SEM and TEM images of PMGA-Ag hydrogel and Ag nanoparticles, respectively. TEM images show that that Ag nanoparticles are mainly spherical shapes and are formed without any aggregation. This suggests that the green synthesis of nanoparticles by green methods is good. The presence of silver elements and the size of Ag nanoparticles inside the hydrogel was examined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The EDX spectrums in Figure 5G,H are before and after the production of silver nanoparticles in TMGA hydrogels; in the TMGA-Ag hydrogel, an optical absorption peak was observed at 3.02 kV. 2.5. Swelling Studies At room temperature, TMGA hydrogels were tested for (%) swelling ratio, (%) equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR), and pH–equilibrium swelling ratio (Table 1). Figure 6 depicts the swelling kinetics of TMGA hydrogels as well as pH-dependent equilibrium swelling. Among all of the formulations examined for swelling studies, TMGA-3 (2882) had the highest swelling ratio and TMGA-4 (2040) had the lowest. The results show that the swelling ratio of TMGA hydrogels increases when AGA concentration increases and reduces as BMEP concentration increases. pH-dependent equilibrium swelling experiments of TMGA hydrogels evaluated various pH media (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11). The presence of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH, which is associated with more ionizable hydroxy and carboxylate ions in a basic environment, may explain why the percent of ESR was higher in the alkaline zone rather than the acidic. For synthesized TMGA hydrogels, structural network parameters such as average molecular weight between crosslinkers (degree of crosslinking), polymer network volume fraction (V2s), mesh size (ξ), polymer crosslinker density (υe) and solvent interaction parameter of polymer network chain (χ) were calculated using swelling results, and the results are shown in Table 1. With rising monomer (AGA) concentration and lowering crosslinker (BMEP) concentration, the average molecular weight between crosslinkers Mc and ξ values rose. The polymer solvent interaction values of all the prepared hydrogels were approximately 0.52–0.54, indicating that the hydrogel network had good polymer solvent interactions. The data values for crosslinking density range from 0.11 to 0.54. These findings suggested that hydrogels become more hydrophilic as monomer content (AGA) increases and that hydrogels become softer and have a stronger network [28,30]. 2.6. Encapsulation and In Vitro DOX Release of TMGA Hydrogels The percentage of DOX encapsulation efficiency data of TMGA hydrogel are shown in Table 1; these values ranged between 31.86 ± 1.3 and 69.20 ± 1.2. The maximum (%) EE was observed in TMGA-3 and the minimum in TMGA-4; i.e., these values were influenced by monomers and crosslinkers in the hydrogel network. DOX-encapsulated TMGA hydrogels were tested using a tablet dissolution tester at 37 °C in various buffer solutions such as pH-1.2 (simulated gastric region) and pH-7.4 (simulated intestinal region). DOX release kinetics were shown against percentage of total drug release vs. time. In vitro DOX release studies were performed in pH 7.4 and 1.2 at 25 and 37 °C; release data are presented in Figure 7. DOX release results demonstrate that more drugs are released in pH 7.4 compared to pH 1.2, which may be due to the pH-responsive -COOH group of PAGA polymer chains (data shown in Table S1). This may be because TMGA hydrogels contain more hydrophilic groups and easily ionizable functionalities, such as carboxylic (-COOH) acid and hydroxyl (-OH); thus, the larger ionization polymer network in phosphate-buffered solution may be due to hydrogel expansion, and the ionic repulsion of COO− and -OH functionality results in the formation of high-release DOX from the hydrogel network [33,34,35]. This behavior was clearly observed for TMGA-3, as the increasing concentration of monomer drug release was observed more and the increasing concentration of crosslinker drug release was observed less. Further, these results are supported by the equilibrium swelling data. DOX release data fitted with various kinetics models, such as Higuchi square root, Hixson–Crowell cube root, zero-order, first-order and the Korsmeyer–Peppas equation, are shown in Table S1. The in vitro drug release kinetics mechanism fitted best to the Korsmeyer–peppas equation. The instance with a n < 0.45 polymer network followed Fickian diffusion, the second case between 0.45 < n < 0.89 corresponded to non-Fickian diffusion and an anomalous mechanism and in the third case, n = 1 totally non-Fickian and super case II drug release kinetics [21]. 2.7. Cell Viability Assay and Cell Cycle Analysis of TMGA Hydrogel Cancer cells of the HCT-116 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) cell line were incubated with different concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100) of pure TMGA, DOX and DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel. Cell viability was investigated through MTT assays (Figure 8). From the MTT assay, IC50 values observed for pure TMGA hydrogel, pure DOX and DOX-loaded TMGA were 51.42 μg/mL, 6.67 μg/mL and 31.54 μg/mL, respectively. The pure TMGA hydrogel cell viability displayed higher IC50 values with lower cytotoxicity; DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel exhibited significant cytotoxicity; compared to hydrogel formulations, free DOX is obviously more toxic [36,37,38]. The cell cycle analysis was carried out by staining treated and untreated cell lines with PI, which were subsequently examined by flow cytometry. The percentage of distribution cells in different stages of analysis for control and treated cells are presented in Figure 9. The cycle assay used HCT-116 cells analyzed by pure TMGA hydrogel, free DOX, and DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel; apoptosis was investigated with flow cytometry. The untreated percentage of cell cycles corresponded to sub G0/G1, 1.46%, G0/G1 79.65%, S phase 3.67% and G2/M 15.22, The pure TMGA hydrogel percentage of cell apoptosis is as follows: sub G0/G1 1.43%, G0/G1 75.71%, S phase 35.11% and G2/M 17.39%, pure DOX percentage of cell apoptosis given data sub G0/G1 1.36%, G0/G1 57.2%, S phase 13.92% and G2/M 26.98%, DOX-loaded TMGA hydrogel percentage of cell apoptosis given data sub G0/G1 2.93%, G0/G1 62.33%, S phase 12.13% and G2/M 21.68%, respectively; the results indicate that the HCT116 cells underwent either apoptosis or necrosis. 2.8. Anti-Microbial Studies of TMGA-Ag Nanocomposites The TMGA-Ag nanocomposite hydrogel was developed for the inactivation of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Figure 10). Zone inhibition of TMGA-Ag against Klebsiella pneumonia was 6.0 mm, 9.0 mm, 6.0 mm and 7.0 mm, and zone inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus was 4.0 mm, 7.0 mm, 8.0 mm and 6.0 mm. The TMGA-Ags inhibited both Gram-positive and negative pathogen bacteria in the zone. The anionic nature of the generated TMGA-Ags absorbed at the cell membrane’s surface resulted in the formation of Ag nanoparticle diffusion, which led to the inactivation of MDR bacteria [39,40].
