2. Results 2.1. Confirmation of Ophiobolin Biosynthesis Genes in oblAu of A. ustus 094102 In the obl of A. ustus 094102, both oblAAu and oblBAu showed a higher identity of 82.28% and 79.38% with genes in oblAs compared to genes in oblAc or oblBm by amino acid sequence alignments (Table S1), which showed their similar functions to genes in oblAs. OblRAu was predicted as a Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor with an identity of 21.96%. Moreover, we searched a putative transporter gene au8000 (renamed to oblDAu) located upstream of oblRAu, which showed an identity of 85.64% to oblDAs (Table S1 and Figure 2a). To confirm the genes involved in ophiobolin biosynthesis in A. ustus 094102, we performed RNA-Seq and quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR) analyses at ophiobolin-producing (oph+) and non-ophiobolin-producing (oph−) conditions (see Supplementary Information). The primers for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S2. According to the calculated log2 (fold change), gene expression levels of oblAAu and oblBAu upregulated 1795-fold and 760-fold at the oph+ condition compared to that of oph−, respectively. The genes oblDAu and oblRAu also displayed a higher expression level (5.6-fold and 6.2-fold increased, respectively) at the oph+ condition compared to those of oph− (Figure S2a). Similarly, the 2−ΔΔCq values also reflected the gene expression upregulation of the four genes at the oph+ condition (Figure S2b). Next, we disrupted these genes separately by using the gene-targeting method based on homologous recombination [31]. Target genes were replaced by the hygromycin resistance gene hph and mutants were verified through the use of PCR amplification (Figure S3). The primers are listed in Table S2. The main product, 2, and its nonenzymatic transformation products, 6-epi-ophiobolin K (6) and 6-epi-ophiobolin G (7), were identified by LC-MS and NMR analyses and compared with the reported data (Figures S11–13 and S23–28) [7]. In the ΔoblAAu mutant, all ophiobolins absolutely disappeared compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 2b, i–ii). In the ΔoblBAu mutant, the yield of ophiobolins was abolished at the UV absorption wavelength of 234 nm (Figure 2b, i and iii), but a compound occurring at the retention time of nearly 20 min and the UV absorption wavelength of 200 nm was detected compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 2c, i–ii). The compound was identified as 1, confirmed by an NMR analysis and compared with the reported data (Figure S9-10) [27]. This result indicated that 1 was a substrate of OblBAu. The production of ophiobolins also decreased significantly in both the ΔoblDAu and ΔoblRAu mutants compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 2b, iv–v). Subsequently, the heterologous expression of genes in oblAu was performed in A. oryzae NSAR1 [27,28,32]. These genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of A. ustus 094102 and introduced into A. oryzae NSAR1 under the control of an α-amylase promoter. The primers are listed in Table S2. The heterologous expression strains were verified by PCR amplification (Figure S4). Indeed, compound 1 was detected from the mycelium of Ao-oblAAu (Figure 2c, iii). Two compounds with m/z 387 [M+H] + and 369 [M+H] + were detected in Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu compared to the strain containing the blank vector Ao-pTAex3-pAdeA (Figure 2d, i–ii and Figure S5, i), which were identified as 6-epi-ophiobolin C (4) and 6-epi-ophiobolin N (5) by using LC-MS and NMR analyses (Figure S17–22) [33]. Ophiobolin C (3) identified by using LC-MS and NMR analyses (Figures S14–16), was accumulated when oblDAu was introduced into Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu, and the yield of 4 and 5 increased significantly (Figure 2d, iii and Figure S5, ii). 2.2. Unclustered FAD-Dependent Oxidoreductase OblCAu Is Involved in Ophiobolin Biosynthesis According to the above results and the previous report [29], ophiobolin backbone 1 was synthesized by OblAAu; multiple oxidations at C5 and C21 of 1 were catalyzed by OblBAu to form 3 (Scheme 1); OblDAu could remarkably improve the ophiobolin production. However, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 3 to 2 in A. ustus 094102 remains unknown. No relative gene was found when we searched genes in the 20 kb upstream and downstream of the oblAu gene cluster. It was assumed that the gene similar to oblCBm/Ac could be located outside of the oblAu gene cluster in A. ustus 094102. Then, we conducted a local blast with the amino acid sequence of oblCAc. Three genes coded as au-orf1-3 outside of oblAu were selected with a 58%, 37% and 33% identity of oblCAc. The further detection of the gene expression level of these three genes showed a 161-fold increase in the au-orf1 gene expression in the oph+ condition compared to that of oph− (Figure S2a), while au-orf2 had no obvious expression differences in two conditions and the expression level of au-orf3 was downregulated in the oph+ compared to the oph− condition (Table S3). Therefore, au-orf1 (renamed oblCAu) was chosen as a candidate gene and gene deletion was performed. As expected, ophiobolins 2 and 6–7 disappeared, but three new peaks were detected in the ΔoblCAu mutant compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 3a). These new peaks were confirmed to be ophiobolin 3–5 according to the standards. Then, we introduced oblCAu into the Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu and Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu-oblDAu strains, respectively. In the metabolites of the Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu-oblCAu and Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu-oblCAu-oblDAu strains, except for the accumulation of products 3–5, one compound with m/z 367 [M+H] + and two compounds with the same mass of m/z 385 [M+H] + were detected (Figure 3b and Figure S5, iii-v), which were determined to be 2 and 6–7 according to the standards. These results confirmed that 3 was the substrate of OblCAu that was responsible for the dehydrogenation at C16–C17 of 3 to form 2. 2.3. OblCAu also Uses Ophiobolin F as the Substrate Interestingly, another compound with m/z 357 [M+H] + was detected in Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu-oblCAu and Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu-oblCAu-oblDAu strains (Figure 4a, i–ii). According to the difference in the molecular weight and MS spectrum of this compound and 1, we speculated that this compound was a product of dehydrogenation in the side chain of 1 catalyzed by OblCAu. To further verify this, we transferred oblAAu and oblCAu into A. oryzae NSAR1. The HPLC and GC-MS analyses of the metabolites of Ao-oblAAu-oblCAu showed 1 and the compound with m/z 357 [M+H] + were accumulated (Figure 4a, iii and Figure 4b–d). Finally, 45 mg of purified compound was obtained and was identified as 16,17-double bond-ophiobolin F (10) by using 1D and 2D-NMR analyses (Figure S29–35 and Table S4–S5). The main differences between 1 and 10 lie in the chemical shifts of the double bond at C16 and C17 (5.21, t, J in 9.7; 5.96, m) (Table S4). Herein, we surmised that 10 could be another substrate besides 1 used for further oxidation by OblBAu. Subsequently, compounds 1 and 10 were fed to the strain ΔoblAAu, respectively. A small amount of 2 and 6 and lots of 10 accumulated when 1 was added, while no product was detected from the strain fed with 10 (Figure S6). The results suggested that OblBAu with the substrate specificity only recognized 1 and not 10 as a substrate. To the opposite, OblCAu could catalyze the C17-allylic formation in the side chain of both 1 and 3 (Scheme 1). 2.4. Subcellular Localization Showed the Compartmentalize Biosynthesis of Ophiobolins In order to further determine the function of OblDAu, we performed a subcellular localization of proteins involved in ophiobolin biosynthesis. The eGFP tags were fused to the N-termini of OblAAu, OblBAu, OblCAu and OblDAu. Then, the fused genes were introduced into A. oryzae NSAR1 under the control of an α-amylase promoter, respectively. The mycelium of strains cultured for 3-5 days was observed by a fluorescence microscope. A microscopic observation of the Ao-egfp-oblAAu strain showed that the green fluorescence signal was widely distributed in the region outside of the nucleus marked in blue by DAPI dye (Figure 5a). It revealed that the OblAAu protein was located in the cytoplasm. The green fluorescence signal in the Ao-egfp-oblBAu strain coincided with the signal of the Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos that specifically marks mitochondria, indicating that the OblBAu protein was mainly present in mitochondria (Figure 5b). OblCAu was also located in the cytoplasm (Figure 5c). The fluorescence signal of OblDAu was observed in the outer membrane of the mycelium (Figure 5d). Based on the 91.3% probability predicted on the online website PSORT II, OblDAu was mainly located in the cell membrane. To answer why OblDAu was located at the cell membrane, the cytotoxicity of ophiobolins [6] reminded us that the intermediates or final products of strain 094102 may cause toxicity to its growth. Tests of the cytotoxicity of 3–5 showed a strong cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 with IC50 values of 3.64-4.88 μM, MDA-MB-231 with IC50 values of 1.52-2.26 μM and MCF-7/ADR cell lines with IC50 values of 0.77-2.71 μM, respectively (Table 1). Based on this, we guessed these compounds could also inhibit the growth of their producing strain. Therefore, we tested the inhibitory effect of intermediate 3 and final product 2 on the growth of A. oryzae NSAR1. When the concentrations of 2 and 3 were both 50 μM, the inhibition rates reached approximately 50% (Figure S7). It was obvious that 2 and 3 were toxic to the growth of A. oryzae. On the other hand, we noticed that the production of 2 drastically reduced when the ΔoblDAu gene was disrupted (Figure 2b) and the yield of 3–5 obviously increased when the oblDAu gene was introduced to Ao-oblAAu-oblBAu (Figure 2d). It revealed that OblDAu may function as an “antidote” for ophiobolin-producing strains by transporting the toxic compounds outside of the cell membrane. According to the subcellular localization of the four proteins related to the ophiobolin biosynthesis and “antidote” function of OblD, a workflow was presented (graphical abstract). In the cytoplasm, precursors IPP and DMAPP were elongated and cyclized to ophiobolin skeleton 1 by OblAAu; then, 1 was oxidized to 3 by OblBAu in the mitochondria. Compounds 1 and 3 were, subsequently, catalyzed by OblCAu in the cytoplasm to form 10 and 2, respectively. In order to avoid the toxicity of 2 and 3 in the growth of the strain, these products were transported outside of the cell membrane by OblDAu. Since ophiobolins can only be detected from the hyphae, we surmised that ophiobolins exist in the space between the cell wall and cell membrane.
