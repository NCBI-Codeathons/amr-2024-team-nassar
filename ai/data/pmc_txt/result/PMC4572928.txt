Results Analysis of the napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 Genome mining revealed a cryptic napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the supercont 3.1 genomic scaffold of S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 (GenBank accession number DS999644.1). The FramePlot 4.0 beta online program showed that the cluster consists of 28 complete open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1b), and BLAST homology searches revealed high similarities (94–99% identity) for all 28 deduced proteins with corresponding proteins encoded by genes within the napsamycin gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. DSM 5940 (Supplementary Table S1). It should be noted that there are two ORFs (SSGG_02981.a and SSGG_02981.b) in the annotated SSGG_02981 (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1), and further examination of the gene cluster identified two regulatory genes, SSGG_02978 and SSGG_02995 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Sequence analysis showed that SSGG_02978 encodes a putative ArsR family transcriptional regulator. SSGG02978 shows 99% identity with NpsA (GenBank accession number ADY76657.1) from Streptomyces sp. DSM 5940 and 47% identity with Y19_18380 (WP_017239216.1) from Streptomyces sp. strain SS. Though NpsA was proposed to be a transcriptional repressor8, functions of both NpsA and Y19_18380 remain unknown. Based on results of the FramePlot program and BLAST analysis, the annotation of SSGG_02995 should be revised and the amended nucleotide sequence was provided (Supplementary Fig. S1). SSGG_02995 encodes a hypothetical protein SSGG02995 (ZP_04694256.1) showing 97% identity with NpsM (ADY76675.1) from Streptomyces sp. DSM 5940, 84% identity with SsaA (AGG82463.1) from Streptomyces sp. strain SS, and 81% identity with PacA (ADN26237.1) from S. coeruleorubidus (Supplementary Fig. S2). SsaA was characterized as an activator of sansanmycin production in Streptomyces sp. strain SS9, while functions of NpsM and PacA have not been investigated. Effect of SSGG_02978 deletion on mureidomycin production Initially, we chose to use heterologous expression for activation of the cryptic napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. The gene cluster cloned from S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 was transferred into several well-developed surrogate hosts including Streptomyces albus J1074, S. coelicolor M1146, S. coelicolor M1152 and S. coelicolor M1154. However, no inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa was observed with these recombinant strains containing the gene cluster (data not shown). Our strategy was then redirected to genetic manipulation of the two CSRs within the gene cluster. Since ArsR family transcriptional regulators typically serve as repressors15, a SSGG_02978 disruption mutant (Sros-02978D) was constructed and tested for antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa PA14 and P. aeruginosa PAO1. Like the wild-type strain (WT), no inhibition zones were observed with Sros-02978D (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S3). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profile of culture filtrate from Sros-02978D showed no difference with that of culture filtrate from the WT strain (Fig. 3). These results showed that deletion of SSGG_02978 failed to activate the cryptic gene cluster in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998. Activation of the cryptic napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster Next, we determined to test whether overexpression of SSGG_02995 could activate the cryptic gene cluster. To do that, SSGG_02995 was cloned into pSET152 under the control of the constitutive hrdB promoter and the resulting recombinant plasmid pSET152::h02995 was transferred into the WT strain. Culture filtrate from the recombinant strain Sros-h02995 still could not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa PA14 (Fig. 2a). We then sought to introduce its homologue ssaA from Streptomyces sp. strain SS into the WT strain. For this purpose, ssaA was inserted into pSET152 under the control of its natural promoter and the hrdB promoter, and these constructs (pSET152::A and pSET152::hA) were introduced into the WT strain respectively to obtain Sros-A and Sros-hA. It should be noted that the annotation of ssaA was revised based on results of FramePlot program and BLAST analysis, and the amended ssaA coding sequence was provided (Supplementary Fig. S1). Both Sros-A and Sros-hA were subjected to antimicrobial assays. Sros-A could not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa PA14, while Sros-hA showed distinct inhibition zones against P. aeruginosa PA14 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S3). Next, we compared the growth characteristics of P. aeruginosa PA14 in the presence of fermentation extract from the WT or Sros-hA. When grown in LBNS media containing fermentation extract from the WT, growth patterns of P. aeruginosa PA14 was identical to that of P. aeruginosa PA14 grown in LBNS media supplemented with ISP-2 controls. However, P. aeruginosa PA14 exhibited a marked reduction in growth rate with supplementation of fermentation extract from the Sros-hA, and a complete inhibition of growth was observed when 1/10 volume of fermentation extracts were added (Fig. 2b). Moreover, HPLC analysis revealed distinct peaks in the culture filtrate of Sros-hA that were absent in the culture filtrates from the WT, Sros-02978D, Sros-h02995 and Sros-A (Fig. 3). To confirm the metabolites were the products of the gene cluster, we chose to inactivate the SSGG_02988 in Sros-hA. SSGG_02988 is a homologue of npsG from Streptomyces sp. DSM 5940, which was proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual 2,3-diaminobutyric acid (DABA)8. The resulting SSGG_02988 mutants (Sros-02988D) were subjected to antimicrobial assays. Unlike Sros-hA, culture filtrates from Sros-02988D lost the ability to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa PA14 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, HPLC analysis showed that those distinct peaks observed in the culture filtrate of Sros-hA were absent in the culture filtrate from Sros-02988D (Fig. 3). These results demonstrated that the gene cluster is responsible for the production of anti-Pseudomonas metabolites in Sros-hA. Previous study showed that SsaA can bind to five different promoter regions of the sansanmycin biosynthetic gene cluster and a consensus SsaA binding sequence was identified9. Interestingly, the S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 napsamycin/mureidomycin gene cluster also contains the highly conserved SsaA binding sites in five different promoter regions9. To examine the effect of ssaA overexpression on biosynthetic genes, transcriptional analysis was performed by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that three key structural genes (SSGG_02987, SSGG_02992 and SSGG_02997) were expressed only in Sros-hA, while the expression of SSGG_02979 was detected in all four strains with significantly increased transcription level in Sros-hA (Fig. 4), suggesting that the foreign ssaA from Streptomyces sp. strain SS can function as a pathway-specific activator gene in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998. Furthermore, we also evaluated the expression of SSGG_02995 and ssaA. Transcription of SSGG_02995 was detected both in Sros-h02995 and Sros-hA, while transcription of ssaA was detected only in Sros-hA. From these results, we concluded that S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 has indeed the genetic capacity to produce napsamycin/mureidomycin or related analogues, and these antimicrobial compounds are only detected after transcriptional activation with ssaA from Streptomyces sp. strain SS. Identification of mureidomycin analogues To identify the products of the activated gene cluster, we first compared the metabolic profiles of the WT and Sros-hA, and characterized eight compounds present only in the extract of Sros-hA with [M+H]+ ions at m/z of 899.2, 885.3, 883.3, 869.3, 867.3, 865.3, 851.3 and 849.3 by ESI-MS. Then, we optimized the isolation procedure to separate those distinct peaks in the culture filtrate of Sros-hA into six fractions, and eight compounds (compound 1–8) corresponding to those ions were identified by ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis (Fig. 5a). In the meantime, fractions containing different compounds were also subjected to bioassay against P. aeruginosa PA14. Fractions containing compound 1 or 6 showed distinct inhibition zones against P. aeruginosa PA14 and fraction containing compound 4 & 5 showed minor inhibition zones against P. aeruginosa PA14, while no inhibition zones were found with the rest fractions (Fig. 5b). Of these eight compounds, compound 1 and 3 were selected for NMR analysis. The detailed analyses of spectrometric data were as follows. The ESI-MS spectrum of compound 1 displayed the [M+H]+ ion at m/z 899.2. MS/MS analysis showed that most fragments of compound 1 were the same as those of mureidomycin A2, except for two fragments at m/z 694 and 355 (Fig. 6a). These two fragments are respectively 16 Da larger than the two daughter ions (m/z 678 and 339) of mureidomycin A, suggesting the methionine (Met) of mureidomycin A was replaced by a methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) in compound 1 (Fig. 6a). Next, the purified compound 1 was subjected to NMR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S8-S11) and the assignments of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR signals were listed in Table 1. Compared with 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of mureidomycin A, most signals of moieties m-Tyr, sugar, uracil and 2-amino-3-methylaminobutyric acid (AMBA) in compound 1 were consistent with those in mureidomycin A. The methyl proton signal (−SCH3) of mureidomycin A was shifted to low field (δH 2.54 ppm) in compound 1, and δH 2.54 ppm was correlated to the carbon signal (δC 48.9 ppm) of MetSO-4 position. The extra signals δH 1.76 ppm (3H, s-, COCH3) and carbonyl carbon (δC 173.41 ppm) of compound 1 indicated the presence of an acetyl group. According to COSY and HMBC data, both -CH3 (δH 1.76 ppm) and -CH (δH 4.79 ppm, N-terminal m-Tyr-2) showed correlations to carbonyl carbon (δC 173.41 ppm) of the acetyl group (Supplementary Fig. S9-S11). Furthermore, HR-MS analysis showed the molecular formula of compound 1 to be C40H51N8O14S (m/z calculated: 899.324, found: 899.3236[M]+). Taken together, compound 1 is a N-terminal acetylated mureidomycin with MetSO instead of Met in the peptide backbone (Fig. 6c). Thus, compound 1 was identified as a new compound and named N-acetylmureidomycin E. The m/z of compound 2 (885.3 [M+H]+) is 42 larger than that of mureidomycin B (843.3 [M+H]+) and the fragmentation pattern (Supplementary Fig. S5a) is identical to that of N-acetylmureidomycin B12. Compound 2 was therefore identified as N-acetylmureidomycin B. Similarly, compound 3 (883.3 [M+H]+) (Fig. 6b) corresponds to mureidomycin A (841.3 [M+H]+)8 with the attachment of an acetyl group. This was further confirmed by comparative analysis of the MS/MS spectra of compound 3 (Fig. 6b) and N-acetylmureidomycin B12. Purified compound 3 was also subjected to NMR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S12). The data on 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR of compound 3 are similar to those of compound 1 except for δH 2.54 ppm at MetSO-6 position, which was shifted to high field 1.96 ppm in compound 3, suggesting the presence of Met instead of MetSO. Furthermore, HR-MS analysis showed the molecular formula of compound 3 to be C40H51N8O13S (m/z calculated: 883.3291[M]+, found: 883.3290). Thus, compound 3 was identified as a new compound and named N-acetylmureidomycin A. The m/z of compound 4 (869.3 [M+H]+) is 16 lower than N-acetylmureidomycin B (885.3 [M+H]+). Comparative analysis of the MS/MS spectra of compound 4 and N-acetylmureidomycin B indicated that compound 4 corresponds to N-acetylmureidomycin B lacking a hydroxyl group in the C-terminal m-Tyr, suggesting the C-terminal amino acid in compound 4 is a phenylalanine (Phe) (Supplementary Fig. S6a). Similarly, compound 5 (867.3 [M+H]+) corresponds to N-acetylmureidomycin A (883.3 [M+H]+) lacking a hydroxyl group in the C-terminal m-Tyr, suggesting the C-terminal amino acid in compound 5 is a Phe (Supplementary Fig. S6b). Thus, compound 4 and 5 are new compounds and named N-acetylmureidomycin F and G, respectively. The m/z of compound 6 (865.3[M+H]+) is 18 lower than that of N-acetylmureidomycin A (883.3 [M+H]+). Comparative analysis of the MS/MS spectra of compound 6 and N-acetylmureidomycin A indicated that the loss of 18 in the position of Met, suggesting the presence of a leucine (Leu) or isoleucine (Ile) instead of Met in compound 6 (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Thus, compound 6 is a new compound and named N-acetylmureidomycin H. The m/z of compound 7 (849.3 [M+H]+) is 16 lower than N-acetylmureidomycin H (865.3[M+H]+). Comparative analysis of the MS/MS spectra of compound 7 and N-acetylmureidomycin H indicated that compound 7 corresponds to N-acetylmureidomycin H lacking a hydroxyl group in the C-terminal m-Tyr, suggesting the C-terminal amino acid in compound 7 is a Phe (Supplementary Fig. S7a). Similarly, the m/z of compound 8 (851.3 [M+H]+) is 2 larger than that of compound 7, and comparative analysis of the MS/MS spectra indicated that the compound contained a dihydrouracil instead of uracil in its nucleoside moiety (Supplementary Fig. S7b). Thus, compound 7 and 8 are new compounds and named N-acetylmureidomycin I and J, respectively. In summary, we have identified eight mureidomycin analogues with acetylation at the N-terminal m-Tyr. Apart from the N-acetylmureidomycin A and B, other mureidomycin analogues also differ from the known mureidomycin A and B at AA4 and/or AA5 (Fig. 7). Both MetSO and Leu have been identified at AA4 of sansanmycins, and Phe was previously identified only at AA5 of pacidamycins911. In this study, we observed the presence of these amino acids at AA4 and/or AA5 in six of the eight mureidomycin analogues (Fig. 7). Analogues generated by substitution of Met with MetSO or Leu/Ile at AA4 displayed better anti-Pseudomonas activity than that of N-acetylmureidomycin A and B, while analogues with substitutions at AA5 displayed similar anti-Pseudomonas activity as N-acetylmureidomycin A and B (Fig. 5b). Generation of these analogues expanded the chemical diversity of mureidomycins and altered their biological activity accordingly. It also suggested that the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) responsible for the selection and assembly of amino acid residues at AA4 and AA5 have a high degree of flexibility.
