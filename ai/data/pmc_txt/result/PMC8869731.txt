3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Biochemical Investigation of an Epimerase In an attempt to validate the biochemical function of KasQ, N-terminally His-tagged KasQ was purified, which exists in solution as dimeric proteins (Figure S3). At first, potential substrates/intermediates UDP-GlcNAc 1, 2-acetamidoglucal 2 (AAG), and UDP 3 were analyzed by HPLC-MS. Next, enzymatic reactions of KasQ incubated with UDP-GlcNAc and MgCl2 were examined at various time points (Figure 2A,B and Figure S4). At 10 min, the expected product, UDP-ManNAc 4 (m/z 605.15 [M-H]), appeared at the retention time of 9.90 min. On an elevated timeline, AAG 2 and UDP 3 (m/z 402.20 [M-H]) emerged, respectively, at 8.99 and 9.51 min, and then increased over time (Figure S5). The generation of UDP-ManNAc 4 stagnated after 10 min and slightly increased at 12 h. The optimum temperature for KasQ epimerization activity was 37–42 °C. (Figure S6). Next, the efficiency of the epimerase reaction was investigated. UDP-ManNAc formation was 6.8% at 10 min and marginally increased to 9.2% at 12 h. On the other hand, at 10 min AAG and UDP were formed at 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively. At 12 h, the conversion of AAG was 23.8% and that of UDP was 64.4%. UDP-ManNAc concentration was 2.6-fold lower than that of AAG and seven-fold lower than that of UDP, which indirectly suggested that the intermediates formed are thermodynamically stable, consistent with previous studies (Figure 2C and Figure S7) [14]. The KasQ epimerase reaction was parallelly probed by NMR spectrometry. The reaction of UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of KasQ and MgCl2 emanated the peak of a singlet at 6.60 ppm corresponding to an alkenyl proton of AAG and an appreciable amount of UDP-ManNAc was determined by its anomeric proton at 5.35 ppm. In contrast, a lesser number of UDP-GlcNAc anomeric protons at 5.41 ppm was observed (Figure S8). Extensive studies at various time intervals of the enzymatic reaction were executed (Figure 3). AAG formed at 10 min and increased consistently with respect to time (Figure 3B), whereas UDP-ManNAc formation from 10–120 min remained almost the same and slightly increased at 12 h (Figure 3C). The equilibrated existence of phosphorus in the epimerase reaction was tracked at various time periods by P31 NMR spectrometry. At 10 min, UDP extrusion was observed with Pα at −8.7 ppm and Pβ at −4.5 ppm, along with UDP-GlcNAc Pα at −11.7 ppm and Pβ at −10.0 ppm. At a wider timespan, the UDP-GlcNAc peak was reduced and the UDP peak was intensified, whereas UDP-ManNAc Pα and Pβ at −12.8 and −12.7 ppm moderately increased with respect to time (Figure 3D). Enzymatic isotope labeling studies of UDP-GlcNAc were scantly documented [14,28]. To gain further insight into the KasQ epimerization reaction, a reversibility experiment was performed. UDP-GlcNAc with or without KasQ in the presence of MgCl2 was incubated in D2O at different time intervals and the reaction mixtures were subjected to HPLC-MS analysis (Figure S9). No deuterium scrambling was observed when UDP-GlcNAc was incubated in D2O without KasQ up to 12 h (m/z 605.98 [M-H]) (Figure 3E and Figure S9A). Moreover, in the presence of KasQ with UDP-GlcNAc and MgCl2 in D2O, deuterium was labeled from 2 min to 12 h (m/z 606.96 [M-H]) (Figure 3E and Figure S9B). To validate the position of the deuterium incorporation, NMR studies were performed (Figure 3F,G). The C2 position of the UDP-GlcNAc was deuterated (97%) and appeared as a doublet at 5.36 ppm with minor traces of C2-deuterated UDP-ManNAc (<1%). Heavily incorporated deuterium at the C2 position of the UDP-GlcNAc clearly suggests that the abstraction of protons at the C2 position is highly reversible with the surrounding active-site residues of KasQ. It also postulates that first step of the reaction mechanism is highly reversible. A control experiment was performed to recognize the ability of thermodynamically stable AAG with UDP to generate UDP-ManNAc or UDP-GlcNAc. KasQ incubated with AAG and UDP in the presence of MgCl2 was monitored by 1H NMR (Figure S12). The absence of anomeric proton signals of UDP-ManNAc or UDP-GlcNAc concluded that the enzymatic reaction was ultimately futile. A similar finding was also noticed with SacA [16]. An ITC experiment for AAG with KasQ showed unfavored binding in the medium (Table 4). This implies that, thermodynamically, there is no binding affinity with KasQ for AAG. Enzyme binding interactions of UDP-GlcNAc were determined by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR (Figure 3H). The proton binding epitope of UDP-GlcNAc with KasQ suggested that the ribose framework accumulated a major zone of interactions, whereas the GlcNAc and uridine moieties occupied a minor zone with KasQ. Both uridine H13 (the alkenyl group) and ribose H7 bind closely with KasQ, acquiring major STD effects. Moderate binding was attained on H8 and H9 of the ribose ring. GlcNAc H5, H14, and ribose H11 formed weak binding interactions with KasQ. Based on these binding studies of STD NMR and ITC analyses, we propose that the KasQ epimerase may proceed through a kinetically favorable or an enzyme-bound reaction mechanism. The proposed pathway for this epimerization reaction is from UDP-GlcNAc which undergoes an anti-elimination to generate AAG and UDP. Then, it undergoes subsequent syn-addition to afford an epimer UDP-ManNAc 4. Overall, our biochemical investigations indicate that KasQ converts UDP-GlcNAc 1 to UDP-ManNAc 4 in a shorter reaction time, whereas in a prolonged reaction it releases a higher amount of AAG 2 and UDP 3. 3.2. Biochemical Characterization of Acetyltransferases The primary sequence analysis revealed that both KasF and KasH belong to enzymes of the acetyltransferase superfamily, while both share very low sequence identity (<10%) (Figure S13). Purified KasF forms monomers but KasH forms dimers in solution (Figure S3). The in vivo acetylation (resistance) activity of KasF and KasH versus KSM was evaluated with a disc diffusion assay (Figure S14). Individually, we introduced the pET28a+ plasmid carrying the kasF or kasH gene into the BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. The E. coli cells (carrying the empty pET28a+ plasmid without the given acetyltransferase gene) were used as a control. We observed a clear zone of inhibition (ZOI) in the E. coli cells (not carrying the acetyltransferase gene) representing the cells’ inability to grow in the presence of KSM (the disc contained ~5 μL of 7.6 mg/mL of KSM). The growth of E. coli that carried the kasH gene was not affected in the presence KSM, whereas moderate growth of E. coli was observed in the cells carrying the kasF gene (Figure 4A and Figure S14). This phenomenon indicated that KasH serves as a resistance gene specific to KSM. Whether KasF is a resistance gene against other aminoglycoside antibiotics was further examined (Figure 4B,C and Figure S15). The activities of these two acetyltransferases against a number of commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin B, sisomicin, streptothricin-F, and tobramycin) were examined. The appearance of ZOI in all conditions strongly suggested that neither KasH nor KasF are active towards these aminoglycoside antibiotics (Figure 4B,C and Figure S15). Based on this in vivo assay we concluded that KasH serves as a self-resistance gene, while KasF partially acts as a self-resistance gene to KSM. To support this finding, an in vitro assay was performed. KasF or KasH were incubated with 1 mM KSM and 0.5 mM AcCoA at 37 °C for 12 h. KasH completely acetylated KSM (m/z 380.16 [M+H]) to produce 2′N-acetyl-kasugamycin (Ac-KSM; m/z 422.38 [M+H]). Consistent with the in vivo analysis, KasF partially acetylated KSM (m/z 380.10 [M+H]) to form Ac-KSM (m/z 422.07 [M+H]) (Figure 4J–M). As a result, KasH is the main self-resistance enzyme in the biosynthesis of KSM, but KasF may play a supportive role in the overall resistance system. Additionally, both KasF and KasH that are unable to acetylate the generally used aminoglycoside antibiotics (Figure 4D–I) suggested that the two enzymes are a pair of resistance enzymes specific to KSM, the latter stronger than the former in terms of antimicrobial effectiveness. The specificity of KasF and KasH is due likely to their regioselectivity on KSM because it is an atypical aminoglycoside antibiotic, thereby incapable of acetylating other aminoglycosides. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantify the binding affinity of KasH versus CoA (Kd = 96.1 µM), AcCoA (Kd = 160.7 µM), and KSM (Kd = 56.1 µM). Among these binding affinity parameters, KasH and KSM concentrations are 2.9- and 1.7-fold higher than AcCoA and CoA, respectively (Figure S17 and Table S1). Although KasF is capable of partially acetylating KSM, it may not be a direct substrate. In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, KasF catalyzes the first step of reactions by converting UDP-GlcNH2 to UDP-GlcNAc. To check this proposition, KasF was incubated with 1 mM UDP-GlcNH2 and 0.5 mM AcCoA at 37 °C for 12 h. We could not observe the formation of UDP-GlcNAc, thus ruling out the possibility that KasF primes the KSM biosynthesis (Figure S18). The origin of UDP-GlcNH2 or UDP-GlcNAc may be directly from the first metabolism, as they are fundamental metabolites. To test whether KasF carries out the deacetylation reaction in the KSM biosynthesis pathway (given UDP-GlcNAc the precursor, a deacetylase is required but not found in the KSM BGCs), KasF was incubated with 1 mM UDP-GlcNAc and 0.1 mM divalent ion (Zn2+). We found that neither KasF nor KasH was able to catalyze the deacetylation reaction (Figure S19). A number of studies revealed that modified aminoglycoside antibiotics carried encouraging antimicrobial activity to inhibit some human pathogens [29,30,31,32]. For example, the enzymatically modified isepamicin (ISP), 6′-N-acetylated ISP analogs, manifested stronger antimicrobial activity but less cytotoxicity than ISP against ISP-resistant Gram-negative pathogens [33]. This fact prompted us to examine KasH for its ability to generate 2-N’-acylated KSM analogs. KasH was examined in the presence of AcCoA, isovaleryl-CoA, β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and propionyl-CoA alongside KSM, whereby new 2-N’-acyl substituted KSM analogs were generated (Figure 5). The binding affinity of KasH versus isovaleryl-CoA (Kd = 199.2 µM), acetoacetyl-CoA (Kd = 98.0 µM), and propionyl-CoA (Kd = 35.0 µM) was further determined (Figure S17 and Table S1), indicating that KasH has considerable substrate promiscuity when it comes to forming new analogs. 3.3. Crystal Structure of KasQ in Complex with UDP and UDP-Glc To better understand the catalytic mechanism of KasQ, we solved crystal structures of KasQ for the wild type (WT) and its complexes with UDP or UDP-Glc in resolutions of 2.44 Å, 2.58 Å, and 2.09 Å, respectively. Concerning the structure in complex with UDP-GlcNAc—the structure that was most wanted—it was not obtainable from all our co-crystallization conditions. Despite this, the structures, not least the one with UDP-Glc, are still in a position to provide a structural basis to help elucidate the mechanism of the epimerization reaction mediated by KasQ. Figure 6A and Figure S20, respectively show the ribbon diagram of the tertiary structure and the topology diagram of the secondary structure of KasQ-WT. In consistence with homodimers in solution, an asymmetric unit contains two monomers colored in rainbow (N-terminal blue, C-terminal red) and gray. Superimposition of these two monomers with an RMSD of 0.86 Å for 317 Cα atoms indicated no significant conformational differences. In brief, each monomer consists of two domains (N-terminal and C-terminal domains), in which each subdomain is made of a typical sandwich (αβα) architecture of a Rossmann fold (Figure 6A). Two fragments marked in dashed lines (residues 40–45 in the N-terminal domain and residues 184–190 in the C-terminal domain) are missing from the model due to lack of electron density, likely a consequence of structural disorder/flexibility in loop regions. The N-terminal domain is constituted by residues 1–170 that fold into a central seven-strand β-sheet (β1–β7) sandwiched by α-helices (α1–α7) on each side along with a stand-alone α16 helix (residues 357–370). The C-terminal domain is formed by residues 201–359 composed of a central six-strand β-sheet (β8–β13) sandwiched α-helices (α9–α16) on each side. The N-terminal and C-terminal domains are connected by two helices, α7–α8 (residues 173–199). The cleft between these two domains provides the substrate binding pocket. As revealed above, UDP or UDP-Glc is bound to its binding site at the interface of the two domains. The superimposition of KasQ–UDP and KasQ–UDP-Glc with an RMSD of 0.29 Å for 332 Cα atoms suggested no apparent conformational differences as a result of binding from different ligands (Figure 6B). The electron density of UDP or UDP-Glc is well defined and consistent in the substrate binding site (Figure 6C,D). The UDP binding site is highly conserved among all non-hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases (Figure S21): the guanidino side chain of Arg12 and the backbone of Leu267 are in close contact with the uracil O2 atom, likely due to hydrogen bonding (3.1 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively). The backbone of Leu267 is also in a hydrogen-bonding distance to the O4 atom (3.1 Å) and the N3 atom (2.7 Å) of the uracil base. The two hydroxyl groups of the ribose moiety are associated with Glu292 (2.8 Å and 2.6 Å) by hydrogen bonds. His209 may play a role in stabilizing UDP by interacting with its α-phosphate (3.1 Å) and β-phosphate (2.6 Å). Ser286, Gly287, and Gly289 are three highly conserved residues for molecular recognition, in which Ser286 interacts with α/β phosphate (2.7 Å/3.2 Å, respectively), Gly287 is in contact with the O1/O2 atom of β-phosphate (3.3 Å/3.1 Å, respectively), and Gly289 is associated with the O1 atom of β-phosphate (2.9 Å) (Figure 6C). In view of the KasQ–UDP-Glc complex, the UDP portion is well defined as it is surrounded by an array of highly conserved residues, His209, Leu267, Ser286, Gly287, and Gly289. The hexose moiety is held in place by a group of highly conserved residues for its recognition and epimerization, except for Arg12, which differs from the corresponding residues in other homologs pointing away from the uracil O2 atom (4.6 Å); the guanidino group of Arg309, which is associated with Glu291 (2.9 Å), is in close proximity to the C2 hydroxyl group (4.1 Å), and the terminal carboxyl group of Asp97 is in close proximity to the C2 atom (3.8 Å). These residues may act as a set of the interlinking acids/bases triggering the elimination/addition reaction for the epimerization of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc. The C3 hydroxyl group of the hexose moiety is also within hydrogen-bonding distances to both the guanidino group of Arg309 (2.7 Å/2.9 Å) and the carboxyl group of Glu119 (3.3 Å). The C4 hydroxyl group is interacting with both Lys17 and Gln95 through hydrogen bonding (3.5 Å and 3.1 Å, respectively). The C6 hydroxyl group is likewise interacting with the carboxyl and amino groups of Asp97 through hydrogen bonding (2.5 Å and 2.8 Å, respectively). Importantly, the carboxyl group of Asp97 that is located on top of the sugar plane relative to the C2 atom (3.8 Å) likely serves as the general base to deprotonate C2 in the first half of the reaction, yielding AAG and UDP; the Arg309/Glu291 dyad, on the other hand, acts as the general acid, likely protonating AAG to afford UDP-ManNAc, thus completing the epimerization reaction (Figure 6D). Samuel et al. created five mutants of catalysis-related residues K15A, D95Q, E117Q, E131Q, and H213N to evaluate their biochemical importance [34]: they observed that all the mutants can release the AAG intermediate. The activity of mutants D95Q and E131Q was 100-fold slower than that of the wild type. Although non-hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases have been extensively studied, the catalytic residues that engage in the anti-elimination and syn-addition to form the product remain unclear. On the basis of the KasQ structural complexes, we highlighted the importance of two residues, Q95 and E308, which were mentioned less frequently in all UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases reported thus far (Figure S21). To confirm their importance, we prepared four mutants, Q95A, Q95E, E308A and E308Q, and performed biochemical assays by incubating them with UDP-GlcNAc and MgCl2 at 37 °C for 12 h. For mutants E308A and E308Q, both HPLC and TLC analyses did not show the appearance of the intermediates, thereby confirming their importance in the catalysis (Figure S22). Moreover, given their special and geographic position relative to the AAG intermediate, we propose that Asp97 acts as the active site general base to trigger the elimination reaction, resulting in the formation of UDP and AAG. In contrast, both mutants Q95A and Q95E performed equally well, as did the wild type in terms of biochemical reactions, thus negating their direct participation in the epimerization reactions. To this end, obtaining the UDP-Glc or UDP bound complexes along with the mutagenesis studies allowed us to summarize the catalytic mechanism of KasQ: Asp97 may serve as the first base to abstract the C2 proton from GlcNAc, resulting in the formation of AAG and the neglect of UDP that is stabilized by nearby Arg210. Since the anti-elimination and syn-addition follow different electron-configuration courses, an oxocarbenium intermediate may be transiently present for buffering the transition state as well as helping change the reaction path. The positively charged oxocarbenium intermediate may be stabilized by the negatively charged UDP nearby [35]. In the UDP-addition course, the Arg309/Glu291 dyad opposite to Asp97 may serve as the general acid to protonate AAG so that UDP-ManNAc is derived in a syn-addition manner, completing the epimerization reaction. 3.4. Structural Comparison The primary sequence and tertial structural analysis revealed that KasQ is a homolog to many non-hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases in bacteria (Figure S21), for example, 2-epimerase from E. coli (PDB entry 1vgv; 47% identity [19]), Neisseria meningitidis (PDB entry 6vlc; 44% identity [36]), Burkholderia vietnamiensis (PDB entry 5dld; 44% identity), and Bacillus subtilis (PDB entry 4fkz; 42% identity). Despite the fact that KasQ exists as dimers in solution as well as asymmetric units, only one UDP-Glc molecule is bound to one protomer of the dimer. The superimposition of the KasQ–UDP-Glc complex with that from E. coli (PDB entry 1vgv) shows high structural similarity (RMSD of 1.0 Å for 286 Cα), UDP-glucose and UDP-ManNAc well overlapping each other in the active site, suggesting that both substrate-binding environments are comparable (Figure 7A). In light of the residue sequence of the substrate/active site of KasQ, it is highly conserved except for Q95 when aligned against other homologs (Figure 7B). Q95 was found interacting with the C4-OH of UDP-Glc (Figure 6D) in contrast to the histidine (H) counterpart in homologous 2-epimerases, which is at a distance from C4-OH of 4.5 Å. The close-up view out of these active sites suggests that there is adequate space for KasQ to accommodate UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-ManNAc (Figure S23). Residue R214 of that in E. coli is missing due to a lack of electron density (Figure 7C), while both structures fit well (E. coli epimerase bound with UDP, PDB entry 1f6d; 47% identity [37]) with an RMSD as low as 2.0 Å for 298 Cα (Figure 7D). The UDP binding sites among all the selected epimerases are conserved (Figure 7E) where residues SGG are highly conserved, likely to stabilize UDP by interacting with its α/β-phosphates through hydrogen bonds (Figure 7F). A sodium ion was observed in coordination with the carbonyl backbone of N-terminal residues Leu25, Asp26, Asp28, and Phe31 (Figure S24). In the KasQ–UDP complex, the carboxyl group of Glu32 makes an additional interaction with the Na+ ion. Moreover, we found that the C-terminal residues Pro298, Ser250, and Ala352 of a KasQ homolog (PDB entry 1f6d) are associated with a Na+ ion (Figure S24D). These metal-ion binding sites, however, are ~25 Å away from the substrate binding region (Figure S24E), suggesting that they have little or no influences on the substrate-binding and enzymatic activity (Figure S24F). 3.5. KasQ Substrate Specificity To investigate the substrate specificity, KasQ was assayed against an array of NDP-sugars. In brief, KasQ was incubated with NDP-sugars (UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Glc, TDP-Glc, GDP-Glc, and UDP-Gal) in the presence of MgCl2 at 37 °C for 12 h and then subjected to HPLC analysis. In comparison with standards (both retention time and molecular weight, m/z), we concluded that KasQ can only convert UDP-GlcNAc 1 to UDP-ManNAc 4. The consumption of a considerable amount of UDP-GlcNAc and release of AAG 2 and UDP 3 in solution were observed in a 12 h reaction. The fact is that none of the other NDP-sugars can be hydrolyzed by KasQ, suggesting that UDP-GlcNAc is the only valid substrate (Figure S25). The kinetic parameters for KasQ in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc and MgCl2 were determined: kcat 1.33 s−1, KM 40.28 mM, and kcat/KM = 0.032 s−1mM−1 (Figure S26 and Table S2). In addition, the dissociation constants (Kd) of KasQ versus nucleosides, (mono/di/tri) phosphates, NDP-sugars, and monosaccharides were examined using ITC, as summarized in Table 4 and Figures S27–S29. Neither UDP-GlcNH2 that was enzymatically synthesized using the published procedure [38] nor AMP, ADP, ATP, GMP, GDP, or GTP shows detectable binding affinity with KasQ. We nevertheless observed some binding affinity in a micromolar range when KasQ was titrated with UMP (Kd = 123.9 µM), UDP (Kd = 32.2 µM), UTP (Kd = 71.4 µM), and TTP (Kd = 174.5 µM) (Table 4 and Figure S27). Of these, the binding affinity of UDP versus KasQ was shown to be 2–5-fold higher than that of the others, suggesting that UDP-sugar is most likely the physiological substrate for KasQ. In contrast, UDP-Glc showed the highest binding affinity (Kd = 9.5 µM) in contrast to UDP-GlcNAc, which, for some reason, could not be determined (Table 4 and Figure S28). We speculated that divalent ions (Mg2+) may influence the binding but cannot conclude this from the ITC assay. Interestingly, both mutants Q95A and Q95E showed high binding affinity versus UDP-GlcNAc (Kd = 45.2 µM and Kd = 14.2 µM, respectively) comparable to that of WT versus UDP-Glc (Figure S30 and Table S3). In addition, we performed time course assays for KasQ in the presence of UDP-Glc and MgCl2, while we could not observe the formation of 2-hydroxyglucal and UDP-mannose, thereby concluding that UDP-Glc is not a substrate (Figure S31). Given these facts, we summarized that Q95 interacts with the C4 hydroxyl group of UDP-Glc (Figure 6D), while mutants Q95A and Q95E are not able to bind with UDP-Gal (C4-axial hydroxyl group). We propose that Q95 may play a critical role in the control of the reaction rate, directionality, and product release. Our mutagenic study may have shed new light on this subtle regulation in KSM biosynthesis while the actuality may depend on future detailed kinetic and biochemical/biophysical examinations. 3.6. In Vivo Isotope Incorporation Analysis The origin of the main chemical components of KSM has previously been examined using isotopically labeled sugars, glycine, or ammonia. These results as a whole revealed that glucose or mannose is the precursor of kasugamine, that the D-inositol moiety is derived from myo-inositol, and that the glycine imine side chain comes directly from glycine [39,40,41,42,43]. This information, however, is insufficient to shed light on the real roles of KasF, H, and Q in the biosynthesis of KSM. To address the insufficiency, we used Streptomyces lividans TK64 harboring pMKBAC08-KAS as a model system to produce KSM, for which the susceptibility of E. coli to KSM was gauged by disc diffusion assay to profile its production. The inhibition zone appeared in agar plates on the third day, suggesting that KSM had been produced to a considerable quantity by manifesting a significant inhibition zone against E. coli (Figure 8A and Figure S33). Samples collected from the culture medium were subjected to HPLC-TQ-MS (positive mode), whereby the molecular weight of KSM was determined with m/z at 380.1 [M+H] as a reference. To see if KSM directly derived from glucose or glucosamine, we fed three precursors, 13C1-D-glucose, 13C1-D-glucosamine, and 13C1,15N2-D-glucosamine, to the culture of Streptomyces lividans TK64. We found that only 13C1-D-glucose is partially incorporated into KSM, as shown by the isotopic profile of KSM with m/z at 380.1 [M+H], 381.2 [M+1+H], and 382.1 [M+2+H], in which the latter two displayed a ratio close to unit, likely as a result of D-glucose that serves as the precursor for both kasugamine and inositol in the KSM biosynthetic pathway (Figure 8B, Figures S1 and S32). Given 13C1-D-glucosamine, the isotopic profile is dissimilar to 13C1-D-glucose, where it showed a dominant m/z at 381.2 [M+1+H] and a second dominant m/z at 382 [M+2+H] with a ratio close to 2 in contrast to the almost vanished native KSM (m/z at 380.1 [M+H]), suggesting that glucosamine instead of glucose is the main or direct precursor of kasugamine and is readily convertible back to glucose at a high rate, an alternative source to myo-inositol (Figure 8B and Figure S32). Given 13C1,15N2-D-glucosamine, the isotopic profile showed the dominant m/z at 382.2 [M+2+H] and 383 [M+3+H] with a ratio close to unit confirming the above reasoning. D-glucose is an indirect substrate, while glucosamine is the “direct” substrate in terms of utilization efficiency towards incorporation into KSM. On the other hand, given 15N-glycine, the molecular weight of KSM increased by one mass unit (m/z 381.2 [M+1+H]), indicating that glycine is the key precursor for the carboxyformidoyl group at C4-NH2 of KSM. Although UDP-N-Glc derivatives are the key precursors for KSM, the origin of the C4 amino group was parallelly investigated using 15N-aspartic acid or 15N-glutamic acid. An equal isotopic increment at M+H and M+1+H and a relatively minor extent of M+2+H for KSM were observed, suggesting that both 15N-aspartic acid and 15N-aspartic acid are the C4-NH2 donor of KSM and a minor C2-NH2 donor of glucosamine (Figure 8B,C). Based on our bioinformatics analysis, we put forward that KasC, the committed transaminase (28% similarity to PDB entry 5ghg, ω-Transaminase), may transfer the amino group given by either of these two amine donors to the precursor of KSM [44]; KasN, the committed glycine oxidase (42% similarity to fms14), may oxidatively add the glycine to the kasugamine precursor, forming carboxyformimidoyl-kasugamine [45].
