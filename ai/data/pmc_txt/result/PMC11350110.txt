Results Agglomerin Homologs of the agglomerin cluster described from P. agglomerans PB-6042 were identified in a total of 181 strains, 178 of which belonged to the genus Dickeya (Table 2; Supplementary Tables 3, 4). No homologs were identified in any other strain of Pantoea. Neither the genome nor any barcoding regions for P. agglomerans PB-6042 are currently available to confirm the identity of this strain; consequently, the agglomerin cluster was not analyzed further.

Of these 40 BGCs, 11 were found in Pantoea: six within P. ananatis, two within P. stewartii, one within P. agglomerans, and two within uncharacterized Pantoea strains (Supplementary Table 4). Homologs of the andrimid cluster were also found in members of Serratia and Vibrio (Supplementary Table 4). Serratia had the greatest number of andrimid homologs out of the three representative genera (Supplementary Table 4); however, there were almost three times the number of Serratia genome projects and assemblies available as compared to Pantoea (Table 2). A phylogenetic analysis of the andrimid cluster revealed two distinct lineages within each clade (Supplementary Figure 1A). The first lineage contained all Pantoea and Vibrio strains as well as some Serratia representatives, while the other contained only a subset of the Serratia representatives (Supplementary Figure 1A). The cpn60 tree shows the expected relationships between representative taxa, with each species forming its own unique lineage (Supplementary Figure 1B). Predicted ORFs flanking andrimid clusters were largely conserved within genera although there were some exceptions (Supplementary Figure 1C). The flanking region of the P. agglomerans Eh355 cluster was not conserved relative to the other Pantoea clusters, and there was also significant intra-species variation in the flanking regions of S. plymuthica andrimid clusters (Supplementary Figure 1C). One predicted ORF encoding a LysR-family transcriptional regulator was found upstream of all Pantoea and Serratia andrimid clusters, but not upstream of the Vibrio BGCs (Supplementary Figure 1C; orange arrow). Similarly, directly upstream of the andrimid cluster, a hypothetical protein-encoding gene was predicted in both Vibrio strains, most Serratia, and P. agglomerans Eh335 (Supplementary Figure 1C; green arrow). Interestingly, the last gene in the published andrimid cluster, admU, a predicted transposase, was only found in the original strain, P. agglomerans Eh355 (Supplementary Figure 1C). An analysis of the %GC of the andrimid cluster from P. agglomerans Eh335 revealed a GC content of 46.87%, while the genome of P. agglomerans Eh335 had a GC content of 54.56% (Table 3). %GC content of Pantoea antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters and their host genomes/plasmids.

D-alanylgriseoluteic acid AGA cluster homologs were identified in 10 P. agglomerans strains, 10 Pectobacterium strains and 11 Xenorhabdus strains for a total of 31 AGA-containing representatives (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). AGA clusters were identified in a relatively small proportion of sequenced Pantoea genomes (0.4%) whereas it was distributed across 3% of available Xenorhabdus genomes (Table 2). The phylogeny of the AGA clusters formed three distinct lineages corresponding to the three genera, and this phylogeny was congruent with the cpn60 tree (Supplementary Figures 2A,B). An analysis of the flanking regions of all Pantoea strains containing the AGA cluster revealed extensive conservation, except for potential frameshifts in the second predicted ORF upstream of the clusters and the third predicted ORF downstream of the clusters of P. agglomerans 190, CFSAN047154, CFSAN047153, Pa39-23, and Pa39-21 (Supplementary Figure 2C). Very few flanking regions of Pectobacterium AGA clusters were available, but those that could be analyzed exhibited little conservation between representatives (Supplementary Figure 2C). Flanking regions of BGCs identified in Xenorhabdus showed conservation within, but not across the two representative species, with Xenorhabdus sp. SF857 flanking regions found to be highly divergent in comparison to other Xenorhabdus strains (Supplementary Figure 2C). Interestingly, an approximately 500â€‰bp ORF predicted to encode a DUF2165 family protein was identified downstream of the cluster across all representatives in all three genera, suggesting it may be important for AGA biosynthesis (Supplementary Figure 2C; purple arrow). Notably, the %GC of the P. agglomerans Eh1087 AGA cluster was over 10% lower than that of the genome (Table 3). Dapdiamide The dapdiamide cluster was found almost exclusively in P. agglomerans, with seven representatives carrying the cluster (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Homologous clusters were also identified in both P. vagans and Serratia inhibens (Supplementary Table 4). A phylogenetic analysis of the dapdiamide clusters showed all Pantoea representatives grouping together (Supplementary Figure 3A), although P. vagans C9-1 nested within the agglomerans clusters (Supplementary Figures 3A,B). Further, P. agglomerans C410P1 and SI1_M5 formed sister taxa in the gene cluster tree, but not in the cpn60 tree (Supplementary Figure 3B). The flanking regions surrounding the dapdiamide clusters showed the least amount of conservation in comparison to other antibiotic BGCs (Supplementary Figure 3C). Only one ORF predicted to encode a thioredoxin domain-containing protein directly downstream of the Pantoea clusters was found to be conserved, except in P. agglomerans DAPP-PG734 (Supplementary Figure 3C; green arrow). There were no shared ORFs between the flanking regions of Pantoea and the single Serratia representative. Herbicolin The sequence of the herbicolin cluster was obtained from the P. agglomerans ZJU23 genome (Xu et al., 2022). Our open-reading frame prediction resulted in two additional ORFs between acbB and acbC not previously described (Supplementary Figure 4C; Xu et al., 2022). These additional ORFs appeared to be the result of frameshift mutations in acbC, which may be sequencing artifacts. A search of the databases for this cluster identified it in three Pantoea strains and one Candidatus Fukatsuia symbiotica strain (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). It is unclear how widely distributed this cluster is across Candidatus F. symbiotica strains as there were only two genomes available; however, the herbicolin cluster appeared narrowly distributed across Pantoea (Table 2). Two P. agglomerans clusters were more closely related to each other than to the other two Pantoea representatives, which was consistent with the cpn60 species tree (Supplementary Figures 4A,B). The ORFS upstream of the four BGCs were not conserved, although some of the genes downstream were conserved across the three Pantoea BGCs (Supplementary Figure 4C). The herbicolin cluster appears to be plasmid-encoded in P. agglomerans ZJU23, P. agglomerans 9Rz4 and Candidatus F. symbiotica 5D. The P. agglomerans ZJU23 herbicolin cluster had a 59.72% GC content, while its host plasmid had a GC content of 54.06% (Table 3). Pantocin A Fifty-nine strains were identified as carrying the pantocin A cluster, 47 of which were members of Pantoea and the remaining 12 were strains of Dickeya chrysanthemi, Edwardsiella hoshinae, and various members of the Pectobacteriaceae (Supplementary Table 4). Among members of Pantoea, the pantocin A cluster was most prevalent in P. agglomerans and P. ananatis, but it is also present in strains of P. brenneri, P. vagans, P. stewartii, and Pantoea
spp. (Supplementary Table 4). The representative pantocin A clusters grouped into four distinct lineages that correspond to each genus, with the only exception being D. chrysanthemi Ech1591, which clustered with Pantoea strains instead of other Dickeya (Supplementary Figure 5A). The Pantoea lineage is subdivided into two well-supported lineages, one containing only P. ananatis and two P. stewartii strains, and the other all other representative Pantoea strains including one subset of P. ananatis strains (Supplementary Figure 5A). The antibiotic cluster tree was found to be mostly incongruent with the corresponding cpn60 tree at the individual gene cluster level, although highly congruent at the genus level (Supplementary Figures 5A,B). A comparison of the clusters identified in Edwardsiella, Dickeya, and the members of the Pectobacteriaceae showed that their flanking regions were mostly conserved, in contrast to those of Pantoea, which were variable (Supplementary Figure 5C). One ORF predicted to encode a hypothetical protein directly upstream of the cluster was found to be conserved across most Pantoea strains except for P. agglomerans Eh318, 540Y, Pa39-3, 20TX10122, Pa39-1, TX10, and PA4 (Supplementary Figure 5C; purple arrow). A predicted ABC transporter ATP-binding protein found upstream of the clusters of P. ananatis strains PNA_18_8S, PNA_18_9S, and PNA_18_10S was also identified upstream of the clusters of Pectobacteriaceae strains C52, C80, and CE70 and (Supplementary Figure 5C). The %GC content of P. agglomerans Eh318 was calculated to be 54.62%, while the pantocin A cluster from this strain was significantly lower at 40.47% GC (Table 3). Pantocin B At the time of our survey, the pantocin B gene cluster had not yet been fully described. To identify the BGC in the P. agglomerans Eh318 genome, we used a Perl script to search the available genome sequence for restriction site patterns that were previously reported (Wright et al., 2006). A single ~25â€‰kb region with a nearly identical restriction site pattern was identified, which also matched the cluster size (~17â€‰kb) and number of ORFs (13) that had been predicted previously (Supplementary Figure 6; Wright et al., 2006). Predicted protein products of ORFs in the pantocin B cluster based on BLASTx searches can be found in Supplementary Figure 6. Analysis of the distribution of the pantocin B gene cluster identified only two strains in P. ananatis that carry it in addition to P. agglomerans Eh318 (Supplementary Tables 3, 4; Supplementary Figure 7). The flanking regions of the cluster in the two P. ananatis strains were consistent with one another, although it is predicted that these strains may be clonal (Supplementary Figure 7C). The %GC content of the pantocin B cluster in P. agglomerans Eh318 was calculated to be almost 20% lower than that of the Eh318 genome (Table 3). PNP-1 Eight homologous PNP-1 clusters were identified within P. ananatis and P. stewartii subsp. indologenes strains, along with one cluster in a strain belonging to a member of the Pectobacteriaceae (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Clusters identified in P. stewartii formed a separate monophyletic group from those of P. ananatis, which was consistent with the relationship between these two species as shown in the cpn60 tree (Supplementary Figures 8A,B). The Pectobacteriaceae bacterium CE90 cluster also formed its own unique lineage in the cluster phylogeny, consistent with the species tree (Supplementary Figures 8A,B). The flanking regions of the PNP-1 clusters were conserved across Pantoea, with some divergence seen upstream of the clusters between P. ananatis and P. stewartii subsp. indologenes strains, with some of the P. ananatis strains appearing to be clonal (i.e., PANS 99â€“36, PANS_99_36, and 99â€“36; PANS_99_25 and 99â€“25) (Supplementary Figures 8Aâ€“C). Flanking regions of Pantoea strains and the single Pectobacteriaceae representative were not conserved (Supplementary Figure 8C). Additionally, the %GC content of the PNP-1 cluster in P. ananatis BRT175 is approximately 10% lower than that of the BRT175 genome (Table 3). PNP-2 The PNP-2 cluster was found to be broadly distributed, with homologs identified in 148 strains (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). The majority of Pantoea representatives containing the PNP-2 cluster were P. agglomerans, with others belonging to the species P. vagans and P. pleuroti, as well as unclassified Pantoea
spp. (Supplementary Table 4). Almost half of the strains containing the PNP-2 cluster were non-Pantoea strains and included those from the genera Providencia, Proteus, Pectobacterium, Enterobacter, and Serratia (Supplementary Table 4). Proportionally, however, PNP-2 was found to be most broadly distributed within Pantoea (Table 2). Of note, homologs of pnp2E, a predicted ferredoxin reductase, in Proteus strains were truncated, with only the first portion of the gene being conserved (Supplementary Figure 9C). A phylogenetic analysis of the PNP-2 BGC showed that clusters from each genus formed their own distinct lineages, with a few exceptions (Supplementary Figure 9A). First, P. vagans Mg1, P. vagans UBA6298, and Pantoea sp. S62 formed their own lineage separate from other Pantoea representatives, which was consistent with the cpn60 tree (Supplementary Figures 9A,B). Second, several E. asburiae strains along with P. agglomerans T6 and SI1_M5 formed their own lineage separate from both genera (Supplementary Figure 9A). In contrast, these strains grouped with their respective species groups in the cpn60 tree (Supplementary Figure 9B). The flanking regions of the PNP-2 clusters identified in Proteus and Providencia were conserved in all representative strains, while the flanking regions of the Enterobacter clusters were conserved across all strains except for the six E. asburiae strains that were similar to each other (Supplementary Figure 9C). Similarly, the majority of Pectobacterium strains shared flanking regions, except for Pe. colocasium LJ1 and Pectobacterium sp. F1-1, which were more similar to each other, and Pe. carotovorum 251, which was unique (Supplementary Figure 9C). The most diversity in flanking regions was seen in Serratia and Pantoea (Supplementary Figure 9C). Additionally, the %GC of the PNP-2 cluster in P. agglomerans TX10 was significantly lower (41.89%) than that of the genome (Table 3). PNP-3 The PNP-3 cluster was found only in members of Pantoea (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Of the 22 strains, most were P. agglomerans and P. vagans, along with some strains identified as only Pantoea
spp. (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). The PNP-3 cluster phylogeny formed three main lineages (Supplementary Figure 10A). The first lineage contained only P. agglomerans, the second contained P. agglomerans strains along with P. vagans C9-1, and the third contained only Pantoea
spp. (Supplementary Figure 10A). Although P. agglomerans strains were not fully resolved in the cpn60 tree, there was incongruence between the two trees, particularly within the second lineage, which grouped five P. agglomerans strains with the single P. vagans strain (Supplementary Figures 10A,B). Flanking regions of PNP-3 clusters showed high variability despite all representatives belonging to three Pantoea species (Supplementary Figure 10C). ORFs predicted to encode hypothetical proteins were found downstream of the cluster in all but four representatives (Supplementary Figure 10C; pink arrow). There were also several frameshift mutations identified within the PNP-3 cluster in several strains: P. agglomerans 553Y, 540Y, Pa31-4, Pa39-1, Pa39-7, Pa39-21, Pa39-23, P. vagans C9-1, Pantoea sp. M_6, M_8, and M_10 (Supplementary Figure 10C). The %GC of the P. agglomerans 3581 PNP-3 cluster is 49.06%, while that of the genome is 54.70% (Table 3). PNP-4 The PNP-4 cluster was also restricted to Pantoea, but was distributed across multiple representatives of P. dispersa, P. deleyi, P. ananatis, P. agglomerans, and Pantoea
spp. for a total of 14 representatives (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Three distinct monophyletic groups emerged in the PNP-4 cluster tree (Supplementary Figure 11A), including one that comprised P. agglomerans strains as well as Pantoea
spp. and P. deleyi, and the two others P. dispersa and P. ananatis, exclusively (Supplementary Figure 11A). The cpn60 tree closely mirrored the cluster tree, except P. deleyi LMG24200, which formed its own lineage in the cpn60 tree (Supplementary Figure 11B). Flanking regions of PNP-4 clusters fell into four main patterns. The first group was composed of clusters from P. deleyi and P. agglomerans strains, and the second group comprised Pantoea sp. EKM21T and EKM22T, which had upstream genes that shared some similarity with the first group (Supplementary Figure 11C). P. agglomerans CFBP1316 was basal to these two groups and showed the same upstream ORF pattern as group one, but matched the downstream pattern of group 2 (Supplementary Figure 11C). Two P. ananatis strains made up group 3, while both P. dispersa strains as well as P. agglomerans M1657A made up group 4 (Supplementary Figure 11C). Neither group 3 nor group 4 shared flanking regions with the first two groups (Supplementary Figure 11C). The GC content of the P. agglomerans B025670 genome was approximately 10% higher than that of the PNP-4 cluster from this strain (45.48%) (Table 3). PNP-5 The PNP-5 cluster was found to be distributed across 197 strains (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Only two Pantoea species carry the cluster, Pantoea sp. 1.19 and P. agglomerans 20KB447973; however, previous work has reported that Pantoea sp. 1.19 may be misidentified (Kirk and Stavrinides, 2023). The remaining 195 clusters are found in members of Serratia, Photobacterium, and Yersinia (Supplementary Table 4). Yersinia strains accounted for 171 of the total representatives (Supplementary Table 4), which represented approximately 1.4% of all available Yersinia genomes (Table 2). The gene cluster tree is largely congruent to that of the species tree with respect to the monophyly of the representative genera; however, there were noticeable differences between the Serratia clades of the two trees (Supplementary Figures 12A,B). The predicted ORFs in the flanking regions of PNP-5 clusters were conserved within genera, except Serratia sp. DD3, which did not show similarity to other Serratia representatives (Supplementary Figure 12C). Photobacterium strains showed the most diversity in flanking regions (Supplementary Figure 12C). Across most strains in Photobacterium, predicted ORFs for a LysR substrate-binding domain-containing protein and a DUF1127 domain-containing protein were found directly downstream of the cluster (Supplementary Figure 12C; green arrows). All Photobacterium strains also contained an additional gene within the PNP-5 cluster encoding a metallophosphoesterase (Supplementary Figure 12C; green arrow).
