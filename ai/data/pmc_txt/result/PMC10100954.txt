RESULTS Comparison of the lasalocid BGCs from Streptomyces. In our previous study, we identified a 76,167-bp putative lasalocid gene cluster (lod [GenBank accession number KT591188]) from the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (26). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the cluster contains 22 open reading frames (ORFs), designated lodA–lodT. In this study, to unravel the regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species, we first compared lod with the other two lasalocid gene clusters (las and lsd from S. lasalocidi strains). The results showed that all three BGCs share highly conserved biosynthetic genes and two regulatory genes (lodR2 and lodR3) that encode MarR and LuxR family regulators, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Intriguingly, lod contains four exclusive ORFs: lodR1, encoding a TetR family regulator; lodA, encoding a protein with domains of unknown functions; lodB, encoding a monooxygenase; and lodC, encoding a 3-oxoacyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) synthase that is much longer than its putative homologs encoded by orf09 in las and lsd3 in lsd (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This result illustrates the diversity of lasalocid BGCs in Streptomyces, notably the diversity of their regulatory elements.

All three regulatory genes in lod function in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. Three genes of the lod cluster are proposed to play a regulatory role in lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, including a variable gene (lodR1) and two conserved ones (lodR2 and lodR3). To verify the functions of these genes, we constructed their mutants by disruptive in-frame deletions in the Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 wild type (FXJ1.172-WT) and designated them ΔlodR1, ΔlodR2, and ΔlodR3, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the culture extracts from these mutants revealed a substantial loss of lasalocid production in the ΔlodR1 mutant and a complete loss in the ΔlodR3 mutant but a moderate increase in the ΔlodR2 mutant (Fig. 2). Complementation with lodR1, lodR2, and lodR3 (inserted into pSET152 and driven by PkasO*) in the corresponding mutants partially or completely restored lasalocid production (Fig. 2). These results indicate that lodR1 and lodR3 positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, while lodR2 plays a negative regulatory role.

AU, arbitrary units. LodR1 positively regulates lasalocid biosynthesis by repressing the expression of adjacent lodA–lodC, and this variable system of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 seems to act similarly when introduced into S. lasalocidi. The variable gene lodR1 encodes a transcriptional regulator belonging to the TetR family, members of which are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and the export of secondary metabolites (27, 28). To unveil the regulatory mechanism of LodR1, we performed transcriptional analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and DNase I footprinting experiments. Cotranscriptional analysis of lod by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed the existence of at least five transcriptional units (lodAB, lodED, lodR2–F, lodH–P, and lodST) and four individually transcribed genes (lodR1, lodC, lodG, and lodQ) (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that lodR2 was cotranscribed with lodR3 and lodF in one operon. Next, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted to investigate the effect of lodR1 disruption on lasalocid biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. Total RNAs of FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodR1 mutant were isolated at days 3 to 5. These time points were selected because lasalocid was initially detected in FXJ1.172-WT on the third day of fermentation, followed by a substantial increase in production over the next 2 days (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Compared to that in FXJ1.172-WT, the transcription of lodA–lodC was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig. 3B), implying that LodR1 negatively regulates lodA–lodC. In contrast, the transcript levels of the structural genes (lodF, lodG, lodH–P, and lodST) were decreased in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig. 3B). To determine the target genes of LodR1, EMSAs were performed with all potential interoperonic promoters indicated in Fig. 3A and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 (a possible intraoperonic promoter may exist in this region of over 500 bp in length). Recombinant protein LodR1-His6 was purified from Escherichia coli C41(DE3) containing expression plasmid pET23b::lodR1. The result showed that LodR1 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR1–lodA (PR1–A) rather than to the other promoter regions in lod or the promoter region of hrdB (Fig. 4A and Fig. S2). LodR1 comprises an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain and shows high identity to SCO6121 from Streptomyces coelicolor and SVEN_3912 from Streptomyces venezuelae (both with 88% identity). To investigate the potential substrate of the ligand-binding domain in LodR1, EMSAs were performed with PR1–A in the presence of different antibiotics (including lasalocid as the most probable ligand and other antibiotics with structural diversity, such as ampicillin, apramycin, and chloromycetin). Yet no perturbation of the DNA-binding activity of LodR1 was observed (data not shown), indicating that these antibiotics are not ligands of LodR1. To further elucidate the exact DNA-binding sites of LodR1, DNase I footprinting was carried out with probe PR1–A. The results showed that LodR1 protected a region from nucleotide (nt) −52 to nt +38 relative to the lodA transcription start point (TSP) (Fig. 4B). Analysis of this region identified a conserved recognition sequence (5′-CTAGCGTTGC-3′) forming a palindromic structure near the lodA TSP (Fig. 4C). Together, these data suggest that LodR1 directly represses the expression of lodAB. As lodC was not cotranscribed with lodAB and its intergenic region with lodB could not be recognized by LodR1, the increase in the lodC transcript level in the ΔlodR1 mutant is likely due to the indirect repression of lodC by LodR1.

(D) HPLC analysis of lasalocid A production in the Streptomyces lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT) and its derivatives 31180-KABC and 31180-R1ABC after fermentation for 240 h. 31180-KABC contains plasmid pSET152 with locus lodA–C driven by PkasO*, and 31180-R1ABC contains plasmid pSET152 with locus lodR1–C. Although the lodR1–lodC locus was found only in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, we speculate that it might also function in heterologous lasalocid producers. To test this speculation, the lodA–lodC and lodR1–lodC loci were heterologously expressed in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T to generate strains 31180-KABC and 31180-R1ABC, respectively. As expected, the constitutive expression of lodA–lodC resulted in a dramatic decrease in lasalocid production in 31180-KABC (Fig. 4D). In contrast, lasalocid production in 31180-R1ABC was comparable to that in the WT strain, which might be attributed to the inhibition of lodA–lodC expression by LodR1. These findings suggest that the variable genes lodR1 and lodA–lodC seem to function conservatively in lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species. LodR2 and LodE constitute a conserved repressor-activator system that senses changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinates its biosynthesis. The regulatory protein encoded by lodR2 contains DNA-binding domains with a characteristic winged helix-turn-helix fold that is conserved in the MarR family of transcriptional regulators (29). As a common feature of MarR members, these regulators can interact with specific ligands to modulate the DNA-binding affinity, thus regulating the transcription of their cognate genes (30). LodR2 exhibits extremely high identity (93%) to its homologs Las3 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd6–7 (which should be an intact ORF but was likely interrupted and split into two truncated ORFs by misannotation) from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table 1), suggesting a conserved role of this MarR regulator in lasalocid biosynthesis. To functionally characterize the regulatory role of LodR2, experiments similar to those described above for LodR1 were carried out. RT-qPCR results showed that the transcript levels of lodR3 and all of the structural genes were significantly increased in the ΔlodR2 mutant compared to those in FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 3B). This finding indicates that LodR3 may activate the expression of structural genes. Meanwhile, the transcription of lodED was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR2 mutant, indicating that LodR2 negatively regulates lodED. EMSAs of LodR2-His6 with all potential interoperonic promoters and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 also proved that LodR2 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR2–lodE (Fig. 5A and Fig. S2). Footprinting showed that LodR2 protected a region from nt −65 to nt +88 relative to the lodE TSP (Fig. 5B). There is a conserved sequence, 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G), in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region, forming a palindromic structure near the TSP of lodR2 (Fig. 5C). MarR family regulators, especially the cluster-situated ones, commonly have ligand-binding domains. To test whether the DNA-binding activity of LodR2 is modulated by lasalocid, EMSAs in the presence of different antibiotics were performed. The addition of lasalocid led to the dissociation of LodR2 from PR2–E, while the addition of the other antibiotics tested showed no effect on LodR2 (Fig. 5D), indicating that lasalocid interacts specifically with LodR2 and abolishes its DNA-binding activity.

Error bars show the standard deviations from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ns, not significant. As the ΔlodR2 mutant exhibited enhanced lasalocid production and LodR2 directly repressed the transcription of lodED (Fig. 2 and 3 and Fig. 5A to C), it was suggested that the proteins encoded by lodED could activate lasalocid biosynthesis. Based on the proposed functions of lodE and lodD (Table 1), we speculate that lodE (encoding a putative resistance protein) is vital for lasalocid biosynthesis. To test our assumption, a lodE mutant (ΔlodE) was constructed by disruptive in-frame deletion. Compared to FXJ1.172-WT, the ΔlodE mutant produced much less lasalocid (Fig. 5E), which was consistent with the significantly decreased transcription of the structural genes lodF–lodS in this mutant (Fig. 3B). Sequence alignment indicated that LodE belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters with relatively high protein similarity to MonT (53% identity), a putative efflux protein responsible for self-resistance to monensin in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (31). To ascertain whether LodE acts as a transporter of lasalocid, we compared the intracellular and extracellular distributions of lasalocid in FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant. As expected, the ratio of intracellular/extracellular lasalocid concentrations of the ΔlodE mutant was significantly higher than that of FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 5F), confirming that LodE is a transporter of lasalocid. Moreover, FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant had comparable growth rates and biomasses (Fig. S3), excluding the possible effect of the growth perturbation of the mutant on lasalocid production. LodR3 positively regulates the expression of key structural genes in lod. The third regulatory gene, lodR3, encodes a prototypical LuxR family transcriptional regulator containing an N-terminal ATPase domain and a putative C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The ATPase-associated LuxR regulators are usually involved in antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces (32). LodR3 shows strong sequence identity (80%) to both Las4 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd8 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table 1). RT-qPCR analysis supported the above-mentioned result that LodR3 could positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis. Very few transcripts of the structural genes were detected in the ΔlodR3 mutant compared to FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 3B), indicating that LodR3 is essential for initiating the transcription of the key structural genes. Unfortunately, all efforts to express soluble LodR3-His6 were unsuccessful. Thus, gusA transcriptional fusion assays were performed to determine the potential target genes of LodR3 as previously described (33). According to the results of the cotranscriptional analysis mentioned above (Fig. 3A), the putative promoters of lodC, lodG, lodH, lodQ, lodS, and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 were tested using Streptomyces coelicolor M1146 as a host (Fig. 6A). As a result, blue color was detected in S. coelicolor M1146 derivatives containing lodR3 driven by PkasO* and gusA driven by the above-mentioned promoters except for the lodC promoter (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that lodR3 may have its own promoter in the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 in addition to cotranscription with lodR2. It also suggests that the promoters of lodR3, lodG, lodH, lodQ, and lodS are the targets of LodR3 and that LodR3 can therefore directly activate the transcription of lodR3–F, lodG, lodH–P, lodQ, and lodST. FIG 6Determination of the potential target genes of LodR3 by gusA transcriptional fusion assays. (A) Schematic diagram of gusA transcriptional fusions.

Both pSET152::PkasO*-lodR3 and pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmids were introduced into S. coelicolor M1146 to determine the target genes of LodR3. (B) Chromogenic GUS assays of S. coelicolor M1146 derivatives. Potential promoters tested and their directions of transcription initiation are indicated by vertical and horizontal arrows, respectively. MPx(−) strains contain only pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmids, and MPx(+) strains contain both pIJ10500::Px-gusA and pSET152::PkasO*-lodR3 plasmids. Comparative and parallel functional analyses confirmed the conserved roles of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 homologs in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi. S. lasalocidi strains are used as industrially valuable lasalocid producers, and thus, the regulatory mechanism of their lasalocid biosynthesis is worth dissecting for the construction of high-yield strains. As las and lsd are very similar clusters from the same species, we then selected las (which is from the publicly available S. lasalocidi type strain) to compare the functions of its regulatory genes with those in lod. Homologs of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 were identified in las, which have been designated las2, las3, and las4, respectively (22). To verify the role of these genes in lasalocid biosynthesis, the corresponding disruption mutants (Δlas2, Δlas3, and Δlas4) were constructed from the S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT). Compared to that of 31180-WT, the lasalocid yield of the Δlas2 mutant was greatly reduced (from 33.8 to 4.7 mg/L), and that of the Δlas3 mutant was increased (from 33.8 to 112.5 mg/L), while lasalocid was no longer detected in the Δlas4 mutant (Fig. 7A). Complementation with the genes in the disruption mutants restored the yields (Fig. 7A). To verify the functional conservation of las4 and its homolog lodR3, cross-complementation of the two genes was conducted. As a result, both the ΔlodR3 mutant cross-complemented with las4 and the Δlas4 mutant cross-complemented with lodR3 could restore lasalocid production to the level of the WT strains (Fig. 7B). Cotranscriptional analysis of las revealed the existence of at least four transcriptional units (las1–2, las3–5, lasAI–lasAVII, and lasCB) and two individual transcriptional genes (las6 and las7) (Fig. S4). Similar to their homologs in lod, las3–5 form a single operon. Likewise, RT-qPCR analysis of las genes in 31180-WT and the disruption mutants displayed transcriptional patterns similar to those observed for lod genes in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (Fig. 7C). Moreover, soluble Las3-His6 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the expression plasmid pET28a::las3. Next, EMSAs and footprinting assays were performed to determine its target genes and binding sequences. As expected, Las3-His6 formed complexes with the intergenic region of las2–las3 and protected a region from nt −44 to nt +11 relative to the las2 TSP (Fig. 7D). Analysis of the binding sites revealed an 8-bp palindromic sequence near the las2 TSP (consensus, 5′-CATTMRTT-3′ [where M is C or A and R is A or G]) (Fig. 7D), which is similar to the 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G) sequence found in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. All of these results are consistent with those for Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in the two species. Based on the above-described regulatory studies, high-yield lasalocid-producing strains were constructed by overexpressing las4 in the Δlas3 mutant via a multicopy vector, pKC1139::PkasO*las4, or a single-site integrative vector, pSET152::PkasO*las4. The resultant mutants, Δlas3-1139-las4OE and Δlas3-152-las4OE, enhanced their lasalocid yields by 5.1 and 6.8 times, respectively, compared to 31180-WT (Fig. 7A). Overall, by the simultaneous disruption of the negative regulatory gene las3 and the overexpression of the positive regulatory gene las4, we obtained high-yield strains with lasalocid production of up to 230 mg/L.
