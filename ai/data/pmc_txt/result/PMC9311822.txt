3. Results 3.1. Effect of EPIs on the MIC Values of Antibiotics The results of the impact of three EPIs on the MICs of levofloxacin and gentamicin investigated for 94 clinical isolates are provided in Table S1 in Supplementary Materials. A 4-fold reduction in the MIC values of levofloxacin was observed after the addition of CCCP (for ten isolates), PAβN (for seven isolates), and reserpine (for only one isolate). Moreover, three of the above-mentioned isolates (no. 44/2011, 47/2011, and 52/2012) showed a 4-fold reduction in the MIC values of levofloxacin in the presence of both CCCP and PAβN. For one isolate (no. 20/2011), a 4-fold increase in susceptibility to levofloxacin was observed in the presence of all three EPIs. The addition of CCCP to MH II medium reduced the MIC values of gentamicin (4-fold to at least a 32-fold) in 16 out of 94 isolates. Two of these 16 isolates (no. 15/2010 and 35/2011) also showed a 4-fold reduction in gentamicin MIC values in the presence of a second inhibitor, PAβN. Moreover, only one isolate (no. 42/2011) demonstrated the 4-fold reduction in the MIC values of gentamicin after the addition of reserpine. The further investigations were performed on the 27 out of 94 isolates, for which at least a 4-fold reduction in the MIC values of levofloxacin or gentamicin was observed in the presence of any inhibitor (Table 2). For them, the effect of CCCP on the MIC values of following agents, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, polymyxin B, chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tigecycline, was determined. The results were presented in Table S2 in Supplementary Materials, and in Table 2. In the presence of CCCP, a significant reduction in the MIC values of polymyxin B, from 5-fold to 16-fold, was observed for 4 out of 27 isolates. Additionally, one of these four isolates (no. 31/2011) also showed a 4-fold reduction in the MIC values of chloramphenicol. Besides, only one out of the group of 27 isolates (no. 41/2011) showed a significant reduction (6-fold) in the MIC values of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole after addition of CCCP. No changes in the susceptibility of the tested isolates to erythromycin or to tigecycline were obtained after adding CCCP to the test medium. 3.2. Expression of the Efflux Pump Genes Six S. maltophilia isolates were chosen to analyze the expression level of genes encoding the following efflux systems: SmeDEF, SmeABC, SmeVWX, SmeGH, and SmeIJK. The selected isolates had a different susceptibility level to levofloxacin and also presented a significant reduction in the MIC values of: (I) only levofloxacin in the presence of all three investigated EPIs (no. 20/2011), (II) levofloxacin, and one other antimicrobial in the presence of one or two EPIs (no. 15/2010, 41/2011, and 52/2012), and (III) levofloxacin and two other antimicrobials in the presence of one or two EPIs (no. 31/2011 and 35/2011, respectively). The presence of efflux pump genes in the isolates selected for qPCR were included in Table S3 in Supplementary Materials. Expression levels of smeD, smeA, smeV, smeG, and smeI genes relative to the susceptibility to levofloxacin in the presence or absence of EPIs are presented in Table 3. At least a 3-fold increase in efflux pump gene expression of tested isolates in comparison to levofloxacin-susceptible S. maltophilia 67/2013 was assessed as significant [35]. Only two out of five tested genes, smeD and smeV, were overexpressed in the selected isolates. The highest expression level of smeV, (60.81) was observed for S. maltophilia 41/2011. This isolate presented the highest MIC values of levofloxacin (MIC 16 mg/L). The highest expression level of smeD gene (21.40) was obtained in the case of S. maltophilia 15/2010, which was susceptible to levofloxacin. The 4-fold reduction in the MIC values of levofloxacin was observed in the presence of one EPI, CCCP for S. maltophilia 41/2011, and PAβN for S. maltophilia 15/2010. 3.3. Analysis of Efflux Systems Regulatory Genes Analysis was performed for selected isolates, which presented the overexpression of smeD and smeV genes in comparison to levofloxacin-susceptible S. maltophilia 67/2013. Molecular detection by PCR revealed the presence of the smeT regulatory gene of the SmeDEF system in three studied isolates. The nucleotide sequences of smeT genes of isolates no. 31/2011, 35/2011, and 52/2012, in comparison to DNA of the reference isolate S. maltophilia 67/2013, are shown in Figure 1. Sequencing analysis revealed in all isolates from 27 to 35 nucleotide mutations in smeT in comparison to the reference isolate. However, the nucleotide mutations only led to the amino acid changes in one isolate, no. 35/2011 (AGG → AAG [Arg123Lys], GAC → GAA [Asp182Glu], and GAC → GAA [Asp204Glu]; Figure 1). The identical nucleotide sequences of smeT gene, as presented in isolates no. 35/2011 and 67/2013, were previously deposited in the GenBank NCBI database (accession no. CP067993.1, CP040440.1, and CP060026.1, respectively). The amplification of the smeRv regulatory gene of the SmeVWX system failed. Thus, the whole genome sequencing of S. maltophilia 41/2011 presented overexpression of smeV gene and the reference strain of S. maltophilia 67/2013 was performed. Sequencing analysis of the smeRv gene revealed 21 nucleotide mutations in the DNA of isolate no. 41/2011 in comparison to the reference strain, but only one of these mutations resulted in an amino acid change GGC → AGC (Gly266Ser). The nucleotide sequences of the smeRv gene of isolate no. 41/2011, in comparison to DNA of S. maltophilia 67/2013, are shown in Figure 2. The identical nucleotide sequence of smeRv as in reference strain 67/2013, is presented in the GenBank database (accession No. CP049956.1, CP040440.1, CP022053.2, CP060024.1, CP060026.1, AP021908.1, AM743169.1). The smeRv nucleotide sequence from 41/2011 strain has not been previously described.
