2. Results 2.1. Anti-A. solani Activity of the SYH3 Fermentation Broth and Its Purified Products Bioassay-guided fractionation allows for the evaluation of the activity of the components at each stage of the separation test and the tracing of the most active component to achieve a purposeful separation of the active product [19]. After the mycelium was removed from the fermentation broth of S. fungicidicus SYH3 by centrifugation and filtration, the diameter of inhibition zone that suppress growth of A. solani was 39 mm (Figure 1A). After resin adsorption, extraction, and silica gel column chromatography of the fermentation liquid, 15 components were obtained, among which component 6 had the most significant anti-fungal effect against A. solani with an inhibition zone diameter of 35.2 mm. Therefore, this component was then selected for further separation and purification to obtain active compounds (Figure 1B). Component 6 was repeatedly collected and separated by preparative HPLC, and four monomer compounds, 1, 2, 3, and 4, were obtained. The results showed that the IC50 value of compound 4 was 24.7 μg/mL, and the IC50 values of the other three compounds were 43.4 μg/mL, 42.9 μg/mL, and 30.6 μg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, the inhibitory rate of compound 4 on A. solani reached 93.8% at the concentration of 128 μg/mL, which was similar to the inhibitory rate after rapamycin treatment at the same concentration (Table 1). 2.2. Structural Identification of the Isolated Four Active Monomeric Compounds Determining the specific active components of the biocontrol microorganism metabolites is critical for the research, development, and practical application of biological pesticides. In this study, the structures of the four active compounds (1-4) were studied by analyzing the mass spectra of the compounds, combined with the hydrogen spectrum, the carbon spectrum, the distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) spectrum, and the two-dimensional spectrum in the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum. The compound 1 was determined to be a cyclic (L-proline-L-isoleucine) dipeptide (Cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Ile)) based on the spectral data, the public SCI Finder database (SciFinder. Available online: https://scifinder-n.cas.org/ (accessed on 16th March 2022)), and compared with the literature data. Its molecular formula was C11H18N2O2, and it was named (3R,8aR)-3-((S)-sec-butyl)hexahydropyrrolo [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione (Figure 2, Figures S1–S6). Meanwhile, the compound 2 was determined to be a cyclic (L-proline-L-leucine) dipeptide (Cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Leu)). Its molecular formula was C11H18N2O2, and it was named (3R,8aR)-3-isobutylhexahydropyrrolo [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione (Figure 2, Figures S6–S11); the compound 3 was determined to be a cyclic (L-phenylalanine-L-proline) dipeptide (Cyclo-(L-Phe-L-Pro)). Its molecular formula was C14H16N2O2, and it was named (3R,8aR)-3-benzylhexahydropyrrolo [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione (Figure 2, Figures S12–S17). According to HRESIMS m/z = 249.1460 [M + Na]+, (Figure 3) [M + Na]+ (calculated: C13H22O3Na, 249.1467), the molecular formula of compound 4 was determined to be C13H22O3, its melting point was 114–116.5 °C, and its optical rotation was [α]20
D = −31.5 (c 2.8, CHCl3). The results of the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra show that the compound has two tertiary methyl groups [δH 0.87 (t, J = 6.2 Hz, 3H), δH 1.13 (d, J =6.4 Hz, 3H)]; furthermore, there is one ester bond carbonyl carbon signal [δC 173.2 (C = O)] and a set of double bond carbon signals [δC 156.3 and δC 121.6] in the compound. The 13C NMR showed that it has 13 C signals, based on DEPT and HSQC. The results showed that the compound contains two primary carbons (δC = 19.5, 14.6), five secondary carbons (δC = 33.2, 25.0, 29.6, 27.0, 32.4), five tertiary carbons (δC = 121.6, 156.3, 83.4, 71.7, 40.0), and one quaternary carbon (δC = 173.2). Further analysis using HMBC showed that δH 0.87 (C-13) is related to δC 71.7 (C-10), δC 40.0 (C-11); δH 1.13 (C-13) is related to δC 71.7 (C-10), δC 40.0 (C-11); δH 3.65 (C-10) is related to δC 32.4 (C-9), δC 40.0 (C-11), δC 14.4 (C-13), δC 19.5 (C-12); δH 1.46 (C-6) is related to δC 29.6 (C-7); δH 5.04 (C-5) is related to δC 33.2 (C-4); δC 156.3 (C-3) is related to δC 25.0 (C-6); δH 1.76 (C-4) is related to δC 156.3 (C-3); δC 83.4 (C-5) is related to δC 25.0 (C-6); δH 7.45 (C-3) is related to δC 83.4 (C-5), δC 121.6 (C-2), and δC 173.2 (C-1) (Figures S19–S23). According to these data, the new compound 4 was chemically named 6-(5-hydroxy-6-methylheptyl)-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one (Figure 2). We applied for a Chinese national patent for compound 4 and were officially authorized (number: CN111320597A). 2.3. Effects of Compound 4 on Spore Germination and Germ Tube Morphology The effect of pesticides on the spore germination of the pathogens is the basis for inhibiting the occurrence and development of diseases, while the effects of pesticides on the mycelium of pathogens can affect the invasion and pathogenesis on host plants [20,21]. In this study, the results showed that the germination of A. solani was significantly inhibited when the pathogen was treated with the new compound 4 at the IC50 concentration for 12 h (Figure 4A,B), and the germination rate was 53.5% at 24 h, which was significantly lower than that of the control group (96.3%) (Figure 4C). The results indicated that the compound 4 treatment suppressed the spore germination rate of A. solani, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Compared with the control group, the hyphae in the compound 4 treatment group became thicker and denser, and the local swelling deformed (Figure 5A,B). Under the compound 4 treatment at the IC50 concentration, the mycelium length was reduced by approximately 50 µm compared with that in the control (0 μg/mL) group (Figure 5C). 2.4. Antimicrobial Spectrum of Compound 4 against Test Pathogens To determine the practical value of compound 4 as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, we evaluated its inhibitory activity against several other plant fungal pathogens. The results showed that compound 4 had a good inhibitory effect on most of the tested strains, and the diameters of the inhibition zones were larger than 20 mm. Specifically, the inhibitory effect of the compound on Rhizoctonia solani was the most significant, and the diameter of the inhibition zone was 43.2 ± 0.9 mm, while Gibberella zeae and Phytophora parasitica were slightly less sensitive to compound 4, with inhibition zone diameters of 21.3 ± 0.6 and 20.6 ± 0.8 mm, respectively (Table 2).
