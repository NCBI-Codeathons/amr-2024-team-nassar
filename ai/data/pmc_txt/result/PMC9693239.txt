3. Results 3.1. Isolation of Actinobacteria Strains, Associated with Messor Structor Ants All bacterial strains isolated from Messor structor individuals were divided into two morphotypes: one of which formed beige branching mycelium, dark-pigmented and straight spore chains (later labeled as 4-3), and the other, formed rough colorless colonies from Gram-positive cocci (L1). Results demonstrated that strains of 4-3-morphotype had more association with the caste of soldiers with 89% frequency among this group, while workers’ caste, pupae and larvae showed less specific results—50%, 21%, and 7% respectively. On the contrary, L1-bacteria were found in the vast majority of individuals from these groups besides soldiers (Table S1). A comparison with the GenBank database demonstrated that all strains assigned to the 4-3-morphotype, in addition to their phenotypical similarity, had an identical sequence of the 16S rRNA genes, indicating their belonging to the Streptomyces genus. The closest strains were Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus DSM 40136 (formerly a type strain of Streptomyces albovinaceus), Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus DSM 40199T, Streptomyces rubiginosohelvolus DSM 40176T and Streptomyces pluricolorescens DSM 40019T. The partial 16S rRNA sequences of L1-morphotype strains showed 100% similarity with Staphylococcus gallinarum DSM 20610T. Among the representatives of the mycelial morphotype, strain 4-3 was selected for a more detailed study of the genome features and antagonistic activity. 3.2. Genome Features and Phylogenomic Analysis of Streptomyces sp. Strain 4-3 Phylogenomic analysis based on whole-genome sequences showed that strain 4-3 formed a well-supported monophyletic clade with S. globisporus subsp. globisporus DSM 40199T and S. globisporus subsp. globisporus DSM 40136 with 95% bootstrap value (Figure 1). The complete genome size of strain 4-3 was 7,941,828 bp with DNA G + C content of 71.6%, which was consistent with the G + C content of the genus Streptomyces [36]. The closest neighbors S. globisporus subp. globisporus DSM 40199T and S. globisporus subp. globisporus DSM 40136 are characterized by similar genome size and G + C content (Table S2). The ANI and in silico dDDH values between strains 4-3 and S. globisporus subp. globisporus DSM 40136 and S. globisporus subp. globisporus DSM 40199T were above the recommended threshold of 96% and 70% (Table 1) needed for species separation [27,37]. Based on this, strain 4-3 most likely belongs to the species Streptomyces globisporus subp. globisporus. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that 4-3 was most closely related to type and not type strains of Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus: DSM 40199T, DSM 40139, C-1027, TFH56, as well as to S. rubiginosohelvolus DSM 40176T, S. pluricolorescens DSM 40019T, S. sindenensis DSM 40255T, S. anulatus DSM 40361T and S. griseus subsp. griseus ATCC 13273 and formed a share clade with 100% bootstrap value (Figure S1). However, type strains of actinobacterial species, first isolated from ants and other insects, did not form well-supported clades with 4-3. This relationship was also supported in the phylogenetic trees generated with maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods (Figures S2 and S3, available in Supplementary Materials). 3.3. Phenotypic Characterization of Streptomyces sp. Strain 4-3 To further evaluate the features of the 4-3 strain using a polyphasic taxonomy approach, the cultural, morphological and physiological properties of 4-3 were compared with ones of the type strains of Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus. Results demonstrated the identity of these organisms in morphology—the shape of sporophores and spore surface (Table S3, Figure 2) and the high similarity of their cultural characteristics on the series of ISP media (Table 2, Figure S4). However, some differences should be noted in the biochemical and physiological properties of strain 4-3 and the closest type strains of S. globisporus subsp. globisporus (Table S3). For example, the production acid from glucose and xylose was positive in strain 4-3 (Figure S5), whereas the other type strains showed negative results. In the decomposition of polymers, strain 4-3 was unable to use cellulose as a sole carbon source, whereas the other type strains utilized it. Furthermore, the enzyme assay of 4-3 was negative for L-ornithine decarboxylase and L-arginine decarboxylase; in contrast, DSM 40199T and DSM 40136 demonstrated positive responses (Table S3). However, most of the biochemical tests showed similar results. According to the obtained data, we may conclude that strain 4-3 isolated from Messor structor ants can be classified as Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus. 3.4. Analysis of 4-3 Bioactive Compound Biosynthetic Gene Clusters The bioinformatics analysis of Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus 4-3 genome revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster of albomycins, consisting of 18 genes from abmA to abmR, completely identical to that of Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974 (Figure 3), described in detail earlier [38]. The presence of abmK, participating directly in the formation of SB-217452 (the active seryl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor component of albomycin) [39] and also providing self-resistance to albomycins [40], indicates the ability of Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus 4-3 to actively produce albomycin δ2. Furthermore, the 4-3 strain genome contains a number of second metabolic biosynthesis gene clusters (SMBGCs), coded production of antimicrobial compounds (streptophenazines B/C/E/H/G, mayamycins), odor substances (geosmin), pigments (melanin, isorenieratene), siderophores (streptobactin, coelichelin), cytoprotectants (ectoine) and others (Table S4). 3.5. Screening Antimicrobial Activity All isolated strains were initially tested for the ability to secrete antimicrobial substances. It was noticed that all phenotypically similar mycelial strains showed the same activity pattern, so we focused on the study of strain 4-3. Analysis of antimicrobial activity demonstrated that the 4-3 strain noticeably inhibited the growth of various pathogenic microorganisms (Table S5): bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and fungi (Aspergillus niger), but it is especially active on entomopathogenic microorganisms (Bacillus thuringiensis, Paenibacillus alvei, Beauveria bassiana, Entomophthora coronata). To evaluate the MIC of the 4-3 compound, we chose strains that were the most susceptible during the screening procedure. The estimated concentration of the HPLC-purified sample was 0.6 μg/mL. In the prepared series of microdilutions, the test strains demonstrated high sensitivity to the 4-3 compound (Table S5), including entomopathogenic bacteria. The agar plugs and cultural broth aliquots of 4-3 demonstrated prominent antibiotic activity in tests on the reporter strains (Figure 4) and exhibited strong Katushka2S reporter induction, indicating that the active compound produced by the isolate functions as an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis. To further evaluate the possible mechanism of action, the in vitro translation analysis was performed. 3.6. Analysis of Bioactive Compounds: Cell-free Translation It was decided to test the HPLC-purified sample 4-3 in in vitro translation procedure to completely evaluate its translation inhibitory activity. Despite induction of the Katushka2S, indicating the inhibition of protein synthesis in the cells of the reporter strains (Figure 4), the active compound of the strain 4-3 did not suppress translation in the cell-free system (Figure 5). 3.7. Purification and Identification of Albomycin The liquid culture of Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus 4-3 was preconcentrated and purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) on LPS500H resin. It was binded on LPS500H, washed with water and the active compound was eluted with 10% MeCN solution in water. Further purification of active SPE fraction was carried out by RP HPLC on a C18 column in isocratic mode with aqueous solution of ammonium acetate—MeCN as eluent. Thus, a pure compound was isolated with a UV maxima at 283 and 424 nm, and the activity testing confirmed that it corresponded to an active metabolite (Figure S6). The metabolite identification was carried out using LC-HRMS/MS analysis (Figure S7). The observed exact masses 1046.3102 of molecular ion [M + H]+ of the compound and characteristic isotope distribution corresponded to the composition C37H57FeN12O18S (calculated exact mass 1046.3057). The main fragmentary ion in the MS2 spectrum due to the loss of the cytosine part was observed at m/z 878. MS1–MS2 raw data were analyzed in Compound Discoverer 3.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peak annotation was performed with ChemSpider, Natural Product Atlas 2020 and COCONUT databases using the mass spectra information with 5 ppm mass accuracy, isotopic distribution ≥ 50% and match score ≥ 85%. The result of the analysis allowed us to conclude that the active compound is a known inhibitor of bacterial seryl-tRNA synthetase, albomycin δ2 (Figure 6) [41].
