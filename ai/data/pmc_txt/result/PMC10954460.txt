Results Thiolutin or reduced thiolutin alone fail to inhibit fully purified Pol II in vitro Recent publications suggest that thiolutin does not directly inhibit Pol II, in contrast to classic in vitro transcription experiments demonstrating thiolutin inhibition of partially purified yeast extract fractions containing Pol I, II or III (20). We set out to understand this discrepancy by first examining thiolutin inhibition of purified Pol II. Given that thiolutin and holomycin activities could be sensitive to reduction of the disulfide bond by DTT (1,11,12) (Figure 1A), we removed DTT from the in vitro transcription reaction and performed thiolutin treatment with or without molar equivalents of DTT (Figure 1B). Under the buffer conditions employed here, we failed to observe thiolutin inhibition of Pol II, with DTT having no effect (Figure 1B). While these results are consistent with assertions that thiolutin does not directly target Pol II, they might similarly be explained by the absence of a cofactor or subtleties in experimental conditions between in vitro assays. We therefore set out to screen for potential co-factors while these biochemical assays are revisited below. Figure 1.Thiolutin or reduced thiolutin alone fails to inhibit purified yeast Pol II in vitro. (A) Thiolutin and holomycin structures.

Three independent genetic screens for thiolutin resistant and sensitive mutants To gain insights into factors controlling the cellular response to thiolutin, we performed three independent genetic screens for modifiers of thiolutin sensitivity (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure S1A). First, we performed a conventional forward genetic screen for thiolutin resistant mutants through UV mutagenesis followed by thiolutin resistance selection. The causal mutations for thiolutin resistance were identified by bulk segregant analysis and whole genome sequencing (48) (Supplementary Figure S1A). Second, we screened a yeast Variomics library for individual thiolutin resistant candidates (33). The Variomics library contained random mutations for almost all yeast genes cloned into a CEN-based plasmid and expressed in strains with the relevant endogenous gene deleted. The CEN-based plasmid used is known to propagate at 1–2 copies/cell and could result in increased gene dosage (49). Mutants from the forward genetics screen or those reproducibly isolated from the manual Variomics screens were re-tested for resistance (Supplementary Figure S1B, C, Supplementary Tables S1, S2). Third, we performed a set of high-throughput screens using both pooled Variomics and deletion libraries using barcode-sequencing (Bar-seq) (25,26) (Figure 2A, Materials and methods), where the thiolutin resistant and sensitive mutants were identified by quantifying changes of mutant-linked DNA barcode frequency under thiolutin-treated or control conditions (26,36). Overall, our data exhibited excellent reproducibility (Supplementary Figure S2) and revealed valuable common and distinct features between Variomics (putative gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutants combined) and deletion (LOF mutants) libraries (see Materials and methods). We have revealed contribution of multidrug resistance (Supplementary Figures S1B–E, S3), oxidative stress response (Supplementary Figures S1F, G, S5), multiple divalent metal homeostasis/trafficking pathways (Figures 2 and 3, Supplementary Figures S7 and S8) as well as the proteasome to thiolutin resistance (Supplementary Figures S6), and we have further genetically dissected a subset of these pathways. These data collectively support that reduction and manganese or other metals appear to contribute to the thiolutin inhibitory activity, supporting a model that reduction and manganese are both required for thiolutin inhibition of Pol II in vitro, tested in subsequent biochemical experiments (Figures 4,5). Each of these pathways is discussed below. Figure 2.Mutations in diverse cellular pathways confer resistance/sensitivity to thiolutin. (A) Four libraries (Variomics libraries for non-essential or essential genes, Deletion libraries for non-essential or essential genes) were used for screening thiolutin resistant or sensitive mutants. Changes in abundance in the library was detected by deep sequencing of the PCR amplicon of the barcode region (Bar-seq). Variomics libraries consist of random gene variants and can be used to screen for both gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) alleles, whereas ‘Deletion’ libraries consist of single-gene-deleted mutants that can be used to screen for complete LOF mutants.

Functional dissection of the multidrug resistance (MDR) and oxidative stress response (OSR) pathways in response to thiolutin We identified thiolutin resistant strains harboring mutations in MDR and OSR genes from all three genetic screens. These results are perhaps not surprising given that yeast has well characterized MDR pathways that sense and pump out the toxic small molecules as a self-protection mechanism, along with recent reports that thiolutin and holomycin activities require reduction in vitro (11,12). Reduction of thiolutin may itself oxidize cellular proteins and cause oxidative stress. In addition, it has been reported that reduced holomycin may act as a redox cycler, which could possibly generate ROS. Consistent with redox activity, thiolutin appeared to induce expression of several OSR genes (10). However, it has not been examined how thiolutin interacts with either MDR or OSR pathways. In light of our isolated thiolutin resistant mutants, we functionally dissected control of thiolutin sensitivity by these pathways. From both manual Variomics and forward genetic screens, we isolated multiple mutants in YAP1 and YRR1, encoding transcription factors that have been implicated in OSR and/or MDR, respectively (Supplementary Figures S1C). In addition, we also isolated mutants in the MDR efflux pump gene SNQ2 from the manual Variomics screen. Finally, from high-throughput Bar-seq screens, we identified distinct thiolutin resistance and sensitivity in additional mutants linked to MDR transcription factors or efflux pumps (Figure 2B). Several lines of evidence suggested that the isolated thiolutin resistant MDR mutants were GOF mutations. First, isolated yap1 mutations were clustered in C-terminal regions, where a variety of mutants are known to cause GOF (50–54). Second, isolated MDR mutants from the manual Variomics screen were dominant or functioned through increased dosage (overexpression) (Supplementary Figures S3). Third, in Bar-seq screens, we found Variomics mutants in several MDR genes (YAP1, YRR1, SNQ2) conferred thiolutin resistance whereas deletion of the same genes either conferred sensitivity or had no strong effect (Figure 2B), consistent with these MDR Variomics mutants being different from the gene deletion mutants (complete LOF). To determine the nature of identified MDR mutants from our screens, we constructed a series of MDR gene deletion mutants and tested their sensitivity to thiolutin (Supplementary Figures S1D). We found that none of the tested deletion mutants was thiolutin resistant (Supplementary Figures S1D). The lack of resistance for all the tested MDR deletion strains is consistent with the isolated thiolutin resistant MDR mutants from Variomics and forward genetics screens increasing MDR activity. In addition, pdr1Δ and snq2Δ conferred hypersensitivity to thiolutin (Supplementary Figures S1D), consistent with the Pdr1 and Snq2 functions in promoting thiolutin resistance for WT strains. Together, we conclude that the MDR transcription factor Pdr1 is the major transcription factor promoting efflux of thiolutin from the cell, whereas neither Yrr1 nor Yap1 appeared to promote baseline resistance, given that yap1Δ and yrr1Δ did not confer thiolutin hypersensitivity. However, increased Yap1 or Yrr1 activities through mutations or dosage may increase efflux pump expression to promote thiolutin resistance, through their known linkage to many multidrug efflux pumps (55–57). Holomycin did not inhibit yeast cell growth at low concentration (22), and we recapitulated these observations (Supplementary Figures S4A). Given that structurally similar compounds may have different cell permeability and efflux efficiency, we asked whether the same set of MDR deletion strains conferred sensitivity to holomycin, but failed to observe any (Supplementary Figures S4A). This observation suggested that the lack of holomycin sensitivity may not be due to selective efficiency of drug efflux, although we cannot rule out the possibility that thiolutin and holomycin may be transported by different efflux pumps. In addition to MDR pathways, we also identified thiolutin-modulating mutations in OSR-related genes, including YAP1 (discussed above) and genes in the thioredoxin pathway. Thioredoxins are a series of small anti-oxidant proteins that primarily function in reducing specific cysteines in client proteins (reviewed in (58) and references therein), and in turn are themselves reduced by thioredoxin reductases (Supplementary Figures S1F). In yeast, there are two thioredoxin reductases (cytoplasmic Trr1 and mitochondrial Trr2) and three thioredoxins (cytoplasmic Trx1, Trx2; mitochondrial Trx3) (Supplementary Figures S1F). Mutants in TRR1 were reproducibly isolated from our manual Variomics screen (Supplementary Figures S1B, E; Supplementary Table S1). In addition, TRR1* and TRX1* plasmid bearing strains obtained from from high-throughput screening of Variomics libraries were resistant to thiolutin but not trr1Δ or trx1Δ were not (Figures 2B), suggesting that TRR1* and TRX1* plasmids in the Variomics library could be GOF due to specific mutation or increased dosage of the plasmid. TRR1 was found to be essential in large scale gene deletion analysis (59) but nonessential in classical genetic experiments (60–64). To understand the nature of TRR1 function in thiolutin resistance/sensitivity, we constructed a trr1Δ strain to directly test its thiolutin sensitivity (Supplementary Figures S1G). Interestingly, trr1Δ conferred hypersensitivity to thiolutin (Supplementary Figures S1G), consistent with Trr1 activity antagonizing thiolutin and specific TRR1* mutants or increased Trr1 dosage enhancing this antagonism. The Trr1 function in antagonizing thiolutin also suggests that our isolated yap1 alleles could confer thiolutin resistance through promoting TRR1 expression, among other mechanisms. We conceive of trr1Δ hypersensitivity to thiolutin in two ways. It could be due to loss of Trr1 function in directly counteracting thiolutin activity or the accumulation of oxidized thioredoxins, or both. The observed TRX1*-linked thiolutin resistance in high-throughput Variomics screens suggested critical functions of thioredoxin(s) in thiolutin resistance downstream of TRR1. Therefore, we examined thioredoxin deletions directly for thiolutin resistance. We found that the trx1Δ, trx2Δ, or trx1Δ trx2Δ mutants did not confer thiolutin sensitivity (Supplementary Figures S1G). In contrast, trx1Δ trx2Δ conferred thiolutin resistance, and further, suppressed thiolutin hypersensitivity of trr1Δ (Supplementary Figures S1G), consistent with the hypothesis that trr1Δ hypersensitivity to thiolutin is due to accumulation of oxidized thioredoxins. The observed trx1Δ trx2Δ thiolutin resistance reveals a critical requirement of Trx1 and Trx2 for thiolutin activity in vivo and suggests that Trx1 and Trx2 may function either directly or indirectly in thiolutin reduction. However, further experiments are needed to test the direct thiolutin reduction by Trx1 or Trx2. Thiolutin resistance conferred by yap1 alleles and thioredoxin mutants suggests possible connections to OSR. Therefore, we set to test the roles of two additional OSR genes, TSA1, encoding a thioredoxin peroxidase, and SOD1, encoding a cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, in thiolutin resistance. Interestingly, sod1Δ, but not tsa1Δ, conferred hypersensitivity to thiolutin (Supplementary Figures S1G). Given that holomycin is a known redox cycler, we asked if simple addition of H2O2 could mimic the thiolutin effect in tested thioredoxin and OSR gene deletion mutants (Supplementary Figures S1G). Thiolutin sensitivities in tested strains were distinct from H2O2 sensitivities, suggesting distinct effects on cellular function. Finally, we tested if yeast could be sensitized to holomycin by the same set of mutants (Supplementary Figures S4). Interestingly, trr1Δ and sod1Δ were slightly sensitive to 10 μg/ml holomycin (Supplementary Figures S4), suggesting that the induction of oxidative stress could be general property of dithiolopyrrolone compounds and that yeast are at least somewhat permeable to holomycin. Thiolutin induces apparent oxidative stress Multiple lines of evidence presented above indicated that thiolutin may induce oxidative stress and increased Yap1 function may promote thiolutin resistance. Yap1 functions by sensing cellular oxidants through its C-terminal cysteines, causing it to translocate into the nucleus and up-regulating a series of OSR genes to counteract oxidants upon oxidative stress (50–54). Therefore, nuclear localization of Yap1 is in general a sign of increased Yap1 function and OSR (50,53,54). To test whether thiolutin treatment caused nuclear translocation of Yap1, we fused YAP1 to sequence encoding EGFP on the Yap1 C-terminus, and monitored Yap1::EGFP localization after thiolutin treatment. Thiolutin indeed induced Yap1::EGFP nuclear localization, consistent with induction of oxidative stress, although the thiolutin-induced Yap1::EGFP nuclear translocation appeared to be slower and weaker than that induced by H2O2 (Supplementary Figures S5). In addition, thiolutin depleted total glutathione within an hour of treatment (Supplementary Figures S6A). However, thiolutin depleted both active GSH and GSSG, a behavior similar to glutathione synthesis defective mutants but distinct from several well-known oxidants such as H2O2 and menadione (65–67). In contrast, a holomycin effect was weak at best on Yap1 localization and did not affect cellular glutathione levels (Supplementary Figures S6A), consistent with the lack of growth inhibition by holomycin and distinct activities or trafficking in yeast between the two structurally similar compounds. Previous studies suggested that the reduced holomycin was spontaneously re-oxidized when exposed to air (1), consistent with the behavior of redox-cycling compounds. To test if thiolutin exhibited similar behavior, we monitored thiolutin reduction and re-oxidation by its unique UV absorbance due to the conjugated ene-dithiol groups (Supplementary Figures S6B, C), as with the recent reports (1,11,12). Thiolutin could be reduced by DTT or TCEP, but not equimolar glutathione (Supplementary Figures S6B), consistent with the behavior of holomycin (1). Reduced thiolutin could be also re-oxidized (Supplementary Figures S6C), suggesting that thiolutin can act as a redox-cycler, similar to holomycin (1). Together, thiolutin induced the Yap1 nuclear accumulation and hypersensitivity of sod1Δ and trr1Δ mutant in vivo and appeared to be a redox cycler in vitro, consistent with the induction of oxidative stress. DNA damage can be a consequence of redox-cycling and can lead to transcription inhibition and cytotoxicity (68,69). We asked if thiolutin treatment could cause DNA damage or decrease viability. We did not observe an increase in mutation rate as measured by resistance to canavanine, consistent with little or no effect on DNA damage rates, nor did we observe a viability defect over the period of treatment (Supplementary Figures S6D, E). The lack of viability defect is consistent with an early report showing that thiolutin inhibition was reversible after several hours’ treatment (70). Together, we suggest that thiolutin is a redox cycler in vitro and possibly also in vivo but does not appear to inhibit transcription through widespread DNA damage. Additional cellular pathways are involved in thiolutin resistance The high-throughput screens of pooled yeast Variomics and deletion libraries, compared to conventional forward genetics and manual Variomics screens, revealed several additional pathways in thiolutin resistance (Figure 2B). We isolated mutants involved in metal homeostasis, SWI/SNF complex, proteasome, ribosomal RNA biogenesis, and small ribosomal subunits (Figure 2B). Many observations from the Variomics screens were already independently confirmed from two conventional screens, direct deletion analyses, or the existing literature (Supplementary Figures S1, Supplementary Table S2). For example, deletion of SWI/SNF complex subunits SWI3 and SNF12 have been shown to confer sensitivity to a variety of divalent metals including Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+ and Cd2+ (71–75), consistent with thiolutin perturbation of metal homeostasis (discussed more below). We further constructed 9 haploid (for non-essential genes) or heterozygous (for essential genes) deletion mutants to validate the observation from the bar-seq screens of the deletion libraries. We validated the observations in 7 out of 9 mutants, including one resistant and one sensitive mutant from the non-essential deletion pool, and 5 resistant mutants from essential heterozygous diploid pool (Supplementary Figures S7). Among them, we validated the observed thiolutin resistance conferred by three strains heterozygous for deletions in proteasome subunit genes (PRE10/pre10Δ, PUP1/pup1Δ, RPN5/rpn5Δ) (Supplementary Figures S7). The reconstructed strains validated the surprising but clear observation that heterozygous deletion mutants in proteasome subunit genes universally conferred thiolutin resistance (Supplementary Figures S7). This is surprising because thiolutin was recently demonstrated to be a proteasome inhibitor through Zn2+ chelation, and heterozygous proteasome subunit deletion mutants presumably may lead to reduced proteasome activity and would be expected to confer sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Interestingly, two recent reports observed similar paradoxical resistance to proteasome inhibitors in yeast strains and human cell lines with decreased level of the regulatory 19S proteasome subunits (76,77). In yeast and human, the fully assembled 26S proteasome consists of a 20S catalytic core and a 19S regulatory complex. It was demonstrated that decrease or transient inhibition of 19S proteasome subunits may in turn induce the level and activity of partially assembled 20S proteasome instead of the fully assembled 26S proteasome (77), resulting in a net increase of proteasome function. It was also recently suggested that specific reduced expression of 19S proteasome subunits induced an altered cellular state and altered the global transcriptome in response to proteasome inhibitors (78). However, our observation is distinct, because we observed decreases in both 19S and 20S proteasome subunits conferred thiolutin resistance. Whether the proteasome has increased level and activity in these strains has yet to be tested. Thiolutin alters divalent metal homeostasis The recent detection of direct Zn2+ chelation activity of reduced thiolutin and holomycin explains multiple thiolutin-induced phenotypes, such as inhibition of proteasome and glucose metabolism (7,11,12). From the high-throughput screens, we observed distinct thiolutin resistance or sensitivity linked to diverse Zn2+ trafficking genes, including those encoding the master transcription regulator Zap1 and various Zn2+ transporters Zrt1, Zrt2, Zrc1 and Cot1 (Figure 2B). Variomics strains linked to ZAP1, ZRT1, ZRT2, ZRC1 and COT1 conferred thiolutin resistance whereas deletion mutants were either not resistant (zrt1Δ, zrc1Δ, cot1Δ) or hypersensitive (zap1Δ and zrt2Δ) (Figure 2B), suggesting that these Variomics mutants could be gain-of-function or dosage modifiers of thiolutin resistance. We first constructed a zap1Δ strain and tested its sensitivity to thiolutin (Figure 3A). zap1Δ confers hypersensitivity to thiolutin, consistent with Zap1 function in cellular resistance to thiolutin and thiolutin alteration of Zn2+ homeostasis in vivo. Notably, zap1Δ also conferred hypersensitivity to holomycin (Supplementary Figures S8A). This observation is consistent with the reports that altering zinc homeostasis is a conserved mechanism among dithiolopyrrolones, and that holomycin could deplete cellular Zn2+ or access other essential targets in yeast if zinc homeostasis were otherwise perturbed, and suggesting that yeast resistance to holomycin may be partially explained by efficient transportation of Zn2+ that counteracts holomycin. zap1Δ hyper-sensitivity to thiolutin and holomycin was much stronger than that to H2O2, suggesting the zap1Δ hypersensitivity to thiolutin and holomycin were distinct from general oxidative stress exacerbation by zinc deficiency (79–82). and likely to Zn2+ homeostasis defects. Finally, Zn2+ supplementation at high concentration partially suppressed thiolutin inhibition (Supplementary Figures S8C). The lack of full suppression suggests that there may be other thiolutin-mediated defects in addition to Zn2+ chelation, although we cannot rule out that inefficient Zn2+ trafficking limits effective Zn2+ supplementation in the cell. In addition to Zn2+ homeostasis mutants, we observed genes involved in Mn2+ trafficking (PMR1, CCC2, VPS17, VPS25, SMF2) linked to thiolutin resistance (Figure 2B). Interestingly, PMR1 is a high affinity Ca2+ and Mn2+ ATPase that is required for Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport to Golgi and subsequent export (83,84). pmr1Δ has been shown to increase intracellular Mn2+ level and appeared to confer thiolutin sensitivity (Figure 2B), which we confirmed by reconstructing a pmr1Δ mutant and plate phenotyping (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figures S9A). In contrast, deletion of SMF2, a transporter for importing divalent metals including Mn2+, has been shown to cause intracellular Mn2+ depletion and conferred slight but consistent thiolutin resistance (Supplementary Figures S8A). Together, the intracellular level of Mn2+ appeared to be positively correlated with thiolutin hypersensitivity, suggesting a mechanism distinct from Zn2+, where Zn2+ supplementation confers partial thiolutin resistance (Supplementary Figures S8C). To rule out the possibility that this altered thiolutin sensitivity is due to indirect effect from interference of other divalent metals, we phenotyped wild-type yeast strain in the presence of thiolutin and Mn2+ supplementation. Indeed, we observed that Mn2+ dose dependently exacerbated thiolutin sensitivity in wild-type yeast, supporting the synergy between Mn2+ and thiolutin in vivo (Figure 3C). In addition to pmr1Δ, we also confirmed the thiolutin hypersensitivity of vps17Δ and vps25Δ (Supplementary Figures S9A). Vps17 and Vps25 are two vacuolar protein sorting genes and have been implicated in degradation of the Mn2+-importing protein Smf1, thus possibly causing intracellular accumulation of Mn2+ and conferring thiolutin hypersensitivity. However, vps17Δ and vps25Δ were not more sensitive to Mn2+ than WT in our strain background (Supplementary Figures S9B) and we found that smf1Δ did not suppress the hypersensitivity conferred by vps17Δ or vps25Δ (Supplementary Figures S9A), suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in these two Vps mutants. Given the contrasting Zn2+ and apparent Mn2+ modulation of thiolutin activity, and that metal homeostasis is complex with cross-talk between metals, we examined the intersection between divalent cations (Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ to compare with Mn2+), thiolutin, and thiolutin-sensitive deletions (zap1Δ, pmr1Δ, and sod1Δ). We also compared thiolutin with 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-pt), a chemically distinct Zn2+ chelator that can inhibit yeast transcription in vivo (85–87) (Figure 3D). Co2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ sensitized yeast to thiolutin specifically but not to 1,10-pt. The tested deletion strains appeared more sensitive to thiolutin than to 1,10-pt at the concentrations tested. 1,10-pt sensitivity was highest for zap1Δ, consistent with 1,10-pt function as a Zn2+ chelator. We also observed distinct effects of different 1,10-pt levels and suppression of sod1Δ sensitivity to 40 μM 1,10-pt by Cu2+ and Mn2+. These results suggest that thiolutin and 1,10-pt are distinct, especially in relationships to metals other than Zn2+. We tested whether reduced thiolutin chelates Mn2+ and Cu2+, while also confirming Zn2+ chelation. Consistent with two recent reports (11,12), Zn2+ caused a distinct UV shift of reduced thiolutin from ∼340 to ∼370 nm but did not change the UV spectra of non-reduced thiolutin (Figure 3E, Supplementary Figures S9C). In addition, we found that Mn2+ and Cu2+ can also interact with reduced but not non-reduced thiolutin, in a manner likely similar to Zn2+ binding (Figure 3E). Consistently, 1H-NMR experiments confirmed that DTT caused chemical shifts consistent with reduction of the ene-disulfide in thiolutin, and further chemical shifts caused by diamagnetic Zn2+ and selective broadening caused by paramagnetic Mn2+ were consistent with interactions between the divalent metals and the thiolutin sulfhydryls (Supplementary Figures S9D and E). In contrast, Mg2+ did not bind to reduced thiolutin, distinct from the other tested metals (Figure 3E). Thiolutin, when activated by DTT and Mn2+, directly inhibits Pol II in vitro Despite the progress in understanding thiolutin induced cellular phenotypes, whether and how thiolutin directly inhibits yeast Pol II in vitro remained unresolved. Multiple lines of evidence suggest possible involvement of divalent metals in this process. First, the co-clustering of thiolutin and bathophenanthroline induced phenotypic profiles suggests similar modes of action (Figure 2C). Bathophenanthroline is highly similar to 1,10-pt (Supplementary Figures S10), which was suggested to require Cu2+ for direct transcription inhibition in vitro (28,88), though these compounds may have similar activities because they are also well-known Zn2+ chelators (89). Second, the direct interaction between reduced thiolutin and divalent metals (Zn2+, Mn2+ or Cu2+) suggests the possibility that thiolutin may function with multiple metal co-factors. Many divalent metals inhibit RNAP activity (e.g. Pb2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Be2+, Cd2+, Ca2+) (90), and additionally are tightly controlled in cells due to toxicity (e.g. Fe2+, Co2+), so may not participate in possible Pol II inhibition by thiolutin. Mn2+ does not inhibit RNAP but instead increases the activity of multiple RNA polymerases (including Pol II) (90). In addition, Mn2+ is readily available in yeast cells (0.04–2 mM depending on the type of measurement while genetically shown to be at levels that likely can alter Pol II activity in vivo) (91–95) at a relevant range to the reported thiolutin inhibitory concentration (∼20 μM in (20)). We note that in the original Tipper observations (20), their transcription buffer contained 1.6 mM Mn2+ as many classical transcription buffers included both Mn2+ and Mg2+ to maximize observed activity. In contrast, most other studies did not report Mn2+ in buffers (12,18,21,22) (One report appears to have a high concentration Mn2+ (10 mM) and possibly also reductant (19)). Therefore, we set out to test whether Mn2+ might participate in thiolutin-mediated inhibition of Pol II. Remarkably, Mn2+ addition to reduced thiolutin potently inhibited purified Pol II activity (Figure 4A), in sharp contrast to the activation of Pol II activity caused by Mn2+ by itself in the absence of reduced thiolutin. Our observation is consistent with the known stimulation of RNAPs by Mn2+ (90,96), but also suggests a potent Pol II inhibition by Mn2+ activated reduced thiolutin (hereafter termed as Thio/Mn2+) (Figure 4A, Quantification of thiolutin treatments and controls in Figure 4C, D). We next designed a series of experiments to investigate properties of the inhibited Pol II and nature of the inhibitory species. We first tested if order-of-addition among Pol II, DNA and Thio/Mn2+ was critical for the inhibition, since order-of-addition is often informative on the mode of transcription inhibition (Figure 4B, E). This is especially important given the observation of Tipper that order-of-addition was critical for thiolutin inhibition in that study (20). Consistent with the early observation, we found that the template binding protects Pol II from Thio/Mn2+ inhibition (Figure 4B). Template protection of Pol II suggests Thio/Mn2+ inhibits Pol II DNA interaction or similarly early step in transcription, consistent with the behavior of a transcription initiation inhibitor. Therefore, we tested if Thio/Mn2+ affected Pol II elongation on a transcription bubble template using an RNA primer, where transcription initiation is bypassed (Figure 4E). Surprisingly, Thio/Mn2+ altered, but did not block Pol II transcription elongation, inducing a highly pause prone Pol II elongation mode (Figure 4E). This was unexpected because most specific initiation inhibitors do not cause elongation defects, and DNA binding does not protect RNAPs from elongation inhibitors by their very nature. In addition, pre-assembled transcription elongation complexes were also resistant to Thio/Mn2+ (Figure 4E, bottom middle panel), validating the critical order-of-addition in the non-specific transcription assay (Figure 4B). Thio/Mn2+ inhibited Pol II was pause-prone and appeared to irreversibly arrest at specific template positions (Figure 4E, bottom right panel). Whether thiolutin inhibits transcription initiation or elongation in vivo is unclear (17,21). In light of our in vitro results, we tested thiolutin-mediated Pol II transcription inhibition in vivo, first by monitoring Pol II occupancy on a long gene, YLR454W driven by the TEF1 promoter, and then by Pol II ChIP-seq genome wide (Figure 5). We observed a specific decrease of Pol II occupancy by qPCR on the 5′ end of YLR454W within the first 2 min of thiolutin treatment, consistent with fast transcription initiation inhibition after thiolutin treatment (Figure 5). After 2 min, we also observed a relatively slower loss of Pol II from the template compared to previous experiments where transcription initiation was inhibited by other means, specifically by glucose shutoff or by carbon starvation of transcription from a GAL1 promoter driven YLR454W reporter (39) (comparison with prior studies shown in Supplementary Figures S11). Additionally, this decrease in Pol II occupancy at later time points does not fully cover the 3′ end as it does at GAL1p::YLR454W under the aforementioned inhibition conditions where the gene is clear of Pol II by 4–6 min (39). These results suggest that thiolutin may have additional non-immediate inhibitory effects on Pol II elongation in vivo and that thiolutin treatment is not functioning solely through altering cellular signaling (e.g. through inhibition of the Tor pathway (8)) (Figure 5A). To assess kinetics of effects on Pol II occupancy in response to thiolutin treatment genome wide, we performed ChIP-seq for a FLAG-tagged Rpb3 Pol II component in triplicate upon thiolutin treatment (1, 2, 4, 8 min), DMSO vehicle treatment (8 min), or control cells (Figure 5B-D, Supplementary Figures S12). Our ChIP-seq protocol includes spike-in of Rpb3-FLAG chromatin from S. pombe allowing for determination of global effects (Figure 5B). Our experiments showed good reproducibility across replicates (Supplementary Figures S12A,B) with a clear trend of increased effects over time of thiolutin inhibition. We find evidence of broad decrease in Pol II occupancy genome wide (Figure 5C). We observe a continuum of effects for highly expressed genes where ribosomal protein (RP) genes are affected more strongly, then ribosome biogenesis genes (RiBi), then other genes (Figure 5D, E). These results are consistent with reported inhibition of the Tor pathway upon thiolutin treatment but there also more widespread, but muted decreases in Pol II occupancy. Consistent with our observation at TEF1p::YLR454W, metaplots for all genes in the top 40% of Pol II occupancy ≥ 1.5kb in length show an initial decrease in Pol II occupancy at the 5′ end upon thiolutin treatment (Supplementary Figures S12C). The most striking effects of thiolutin on Pol II occupancy are those that occur with rapid kinetics, e.g. decreased occupancy on highly expressed genes, specifically of the RP and RiBi classes, and rapid increased occupancy of a small subset of genes. These classes of effect like involve in Tor signaling inhibition (8,29,30,97) and stress response activation (11,85), respectively. The more muted but widespread effects and potential slowing of elongation could be consistent with additional, direct or indirect effects of thiolutin that occur with reduced kinetics (see Discussion). To investigate the nature of the inhibitory species, we further examined thiolutin interaction with Mn2+. Interestingly, we observed continuous and reproducible changes of the UV spectra after Mn2+ was added to reduced thiolutin (Figure 6A), suggesting changing chemical species in the reaction. The peak of UV absorbance was shifted from 340 nm (reduced thiolutin) to around 380 nm in the first two min, with subsequent decrease in the 380 nm peak as a third species at 300 nm started to accumulate (Figure 6A). The reaction reached a relative stable equilibrium after 20 min. Our data revealed the dynamic change and two major species after Mn2+ addition to reduced thiolutin but could not distinguish how either of these related to the inhibitory species. To test this question, we prepared Thio/Mn2+ and either freshly treated Pol II or incubated at room temperature for 20 min before treating Pol II (Figure 6B). Remarkably, we observed strong Pol II inhibition by freshly prepared Thio/Mn2+ but complete loss of Thio/Mn2+ inhibitory activity after 20 min (Figure 6B). This result is consistent with the 380 nm species possibly contributing to Pol II inhibition yet being unstable in solution. In contrast to the window for inhibitory activity of Thio/Mn2+, immediately treated Pol II was inhibited for up to 50 min (20-min incubation and 30-min reaction time), suggesting that the Pol II inhibition was stable (Figure 6B). Figure 6.The apparent thiolutin/Mn2+ complex is unstable in solution but Pol II can be stably altered. (A) Time course of changing UV spectra of reduced thiolutin treated with Mn2+.

Two replicates under these exact conditions were performed, and a representative replicate is shown. Results are representative of additional experiments performed under slightly different conditions. The apparent thiolutin/Mn2+ complex is unstable in solution but Pol II can be stably altered.

Results are representative of additional experiments performed under slightly different conditions. We propose two models to reconcile the observation that Pol II stabilized the unstable 380nm inhibitory species. First, Pol II might stabilize the inhibitory species in a tight pocket that prevented further reaction into other inactive species. Second, Mn2+ might coordinate with reduced thiolutin to form a disulfide bond within Pol II or possibly a thiolutin adduct, as Cu2+ does to facilitate disulfide formation through cysteine sulfenylation in other proteins (98–100). If sulfenylation and disulfide bond formation were involved, the Thio/Mn2+ inhibition is expected to be suppressible by a high concentration of DTT. Indeed, we found that excess DTT abolished the inhibition, consistent with the involvement of reductant sensitive inhibition (Figure 6C).
