Results Characterization of the patients Six patients with proven IA, and different underlying diseases and expressing high levels of anti-Aspergillus antibodies were selected for the immunoproteomic analysis. The details of the characteristics of the six patients with proven IA are listed in Table 1, histopathological results are given in Additional file 1 and the Western blots are shown in Figure 1. Multiple bands of immunogenic proteins were observed in each case, but not in the control sera. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) values of the patients with proven IA and the controls ranged from 1.105 to 2.561 and 0.114 to 0.362, respectively.

Identified immunoreactive proteins The 2-DE and Western blot analyses of the filtrate proteins are shown in Figure 2. A total of 40 distinct immunoreactive spots were identified. The 39 successfully identified spots corresponded to 17 individual proteins. The sequence coverage ranged from 18%-70%, and the MASCOT scores were from 68 to 258. The identified proteins with molecular weights, isoelectric points, Mascot scores, and sequence coverage are listed in Table 2 (MS data of all immunoreactive spots identified are shown in Additional file 2). Several proteins occurred in multiple spots. Post-translational modifications are a likely explanation, resulting in altered molecular masses and/or isoelectric points. All 17 proteins are shown as a protein spot on the 2-DE gel and a corresponding immunogenic spot on the matching film. Of 17 identified proteins, 14 were matched with A. fumigatus (Af 293), and 3 showed homology to proteins from another Aspergillus species. Most of these proteins are metabolic enzymes that are involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Seven of these proteins have been reported as antigens of Aspergillus and other fungi, and others have not been described as antigens before, such as fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase FahA, aldehyde dehydrogenase AldA, aromatic aminotransferase Aro8, G-protein comlpex beta subunit CpcB, actin cytoskeleton protein (VIP1), phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase family, urate oxydase UaZ, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, proteasome component Pre8, putative and hypothetical protein. One protein of interest, which showed the best immunoreactivity, was identified as TR. Figure 22-DE analysis and Western blot for identification of immunogens from filtrate proteins of A. fumigatus.

Bioinformatics analysis of TR TR was predicted as a secretory protein with the presence of signal sequences with good predictive value (signalP probability, 0.808). The protein localization of TR was predicted using WoLF PSORT, and the result also indicated that this protein might be an extracellular protein (Query Protein WoLFPSORT prediction: extr, 12.0; cyto, 6.5; cyto_nucl, 4.0; mito, 3.0; pero, 2.0). This protein was BLAST-searched for sequence homology with human proteins and other fungi using the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLASTp). The results indicated that TR of A. fumigatus had no matches with human proteins. Furthermore, TR of A. fumigatus had low homology with other fungi, such as Candida albicans (25%), C. tropicalis (25%), C. glabrata (24%), C. guilliermondii (27%), C. dubliniensis (23%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24%), Cryptococcus neoformans (28%), and Penicillium marneffei (27%). This protein was also BLAST-searched for sequence homology with all protein databases using the Uniprot program (http://www.uniprot.org). The results indicated that TR of A. fumigatus has < 55% homology with all proteins in the databases, excluding pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase of A. fischeri (identitiy, 94%) and the putative uncharacterized protein of A. terreus (identitity, 80%). TR of A. fumigatus also had low homology with most other Aspergillus species, such as A. oryzae (55%), A. flavus (54%), A. nidulans (50%), A. clavatus (47%), and A. niger (41%), as shown in Additional file 3. Expression and antigenicity of TR recombinant protein After induction by isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), the recombinant 6-His-tagged TR was expressed, and a novel protein band corresponding to 36 kDa was detected by SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A). Most of the recombinant proteins were soluble. After purification using a TALON metal affinity resin, the protein purity was approximately 91%. Protein identity was unambiguously confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, whereas following tryptic digestion proteins were identified yielding 37% sequence coverage (the MS spectra are shown in Additional file 4). Western blot showed that the recombinant proteins could be recognized by the sera from all six patients with proven IA (Figure 3B).
