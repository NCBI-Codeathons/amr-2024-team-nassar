Results Optimization of gene models for identification of new macrolide resistance genes We used fARGene, a software that identifies ARGs by utilizing optimized HMMs, to identify known and new macrolide ARGs in genomic and metagenomic data [26]. Three gene models were created, representing two of the most common macrolide resistance mechanisms: ribosomal target modification by Erm 23S rRNA methyltransferases and drug inactivation through phosphorylation by Mph macrolide 2′-phosphotransferases. As Erm 23S rRNA methyltransferases showed an inherently high sequence diversity, two separate models were built to ensure high performance (Fig. S1, Table S1). Each model was optimized based on a positive dataset containing experimentally validated protein sequences and a negative dataset containing protein sequences that were evolutionarily close to the ARGs without conferring a resistance phenotype. For the Erm models, the negative sequences consisted of proteins from the AdoMet MTase superfamily, while the negative data for the Mph model consisted of sequences representing homoserine kinase II. The models displayed an overall high sensitivity for full-length genes (0.94, 1.0 and 1.0 for Erm type A, Erm type F and Mph, respectively) while the specificity was 1.0 for all models (Fig. S2, Table S2). The performance for classification of metagenomic fragments varied more, with corresponding sensitivities of 0.7668, 0.8058 and 0.9663, and specificities of 0.90504, 0.9436 and 0.9857 (Fig. S2, Table S2). For additional evaluation of the specificity, simulated metagenomic reads generated from 1000 randomly selected genomes that did not contain macrolide ARGs were used. This resulted in a measured specificity of 0.9998, 0.9998 and 0.9999, respectively. Identification of macrolide resistance genes in genomic and metagenomic data Next, fARGene was applied to a large collection of genomic and metagenomic data (Table S3). From 427622 genomes retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database [27], 12753 erm genes (1281 unique protein sequences after clustering at 100% amino acid identity) and 15140 mph genes (1406 unique protein sequences) were predicted (Table 1). Analysis of 15 terabases of metagenomic data resulted in the identification of an additional 390 erm genes (229 unique protein sequences, 183 of which were not found in the analysed genomes) and 57 mph genes (31 unique protein sequences, 22 of which were not found in the analysed genomes). Of the 28340 total predicted macrolide resistance gene sequences, the 13143 erm sequences clustered into 422 gene families (<70% amino acid identity) of which 392 (93%) were not previously characterized. The erm genes predicted in metagenomic data were distributed across 114 families, and 57 new gene families exclusively contained sequences reconstructed from metagenomes. Analogously, the 15197 sequences representing mph genes clustered into 241 gene families of which 227 (94%) were not previously characterized (Table 1). The mph genes predicted in metagenomic data were distributed across 22 families, and seven new gene families exclusively contained genes reconstructed from metagenomes. Of the analysed genomes, 12689 (2.97%) contained at least one erm gene, while 15056 genomes (3.52%) were carrying at least one mph gene (Table 2). Furthermore, erm genes could be found in 884 (6.94%) of the analysed species while mph genes were slightly less common, being found in 573 (4.50%) species. Enrichment analysis showed strong associations between taxonomy and the presence of erm and mph genes (Fig. 1). Firmicutes were significantly overrepresented among hosts carrying erm and mph genes, including both known (p<10−15 and p<10−15, Fisher’s exact test) and new (p=2.97×10−11 and p<10−15) variants (Fig. 1). Proteobacteria were, on the other hand, significantly under-represented among hosts of known and new erm genes (p<10−15 and p<10−15) as well as new mph genes (p<10−15). Interestingly, Actinobacteria showed a strong overrepresentation of both new erm and mph genes (p<10−15 and p<10−15) while known mph genes were under-represented (p<10−15). Bacteroidetes showed an overrepresentation of known erm genes (p=1.39×10−8) while the number of known mph genes was significantly lower than expected and thus under-represented (p=2.28×10−6).

Interestingly, most of these environments also contained substantial levels of new genes that, in some cases, were considerably higher than those for known genes. Most of the metagenomes from non-polluted environments resulted in few or no reconstructed macrolide resistance genes, one exception being the metagenomes from soil sampled in forests in eastern China [48], which displayed high levels of both erm and mph genes. Another exception was the water samples from Lake Hazen (Canada) [49], which contained high levels of new erm genes but no known erm genes or any mph genes (Fig. 2).

Experimental validation of predicted genes The function of predicted genes was validated by expressing ten selected genes (seven erm genes and three mph genes) in an 

E. coli

 host and assessing the induced phenotype by observing the growth curves (Table 3, Figs S3 and S4). These genes were selected based on host species, similarity to known ARGs, and likelihood of having undergone HGT as indicated by the phylogenetic analysis. Of the ten tested genes, seven resulted in a significant increase in growth in the presence of erythromycin: erm genes G351, G423, G612 and G1525, as well as mph genes G373, G1169 and G879. The largest effect was seen for the erm gene G351 from the family UGF35, which displayed a growth fold-change increase of 3.4 after 15 h cultivation with 32 µg ml−1 erythromycin compared to the negative control. Of the seven validated genes, five genes also showed a significant increase in growth in the presence of azithromycin compared to the controls. Here, the mph gene G1169 from the family UGF100 showed the largest difference in growth, with a fold-change increase of 4.3 after 15 h cultivation with 2 µg ml−1 azithromycin. Of the ten genes, three did not show any induced phenotype in E. coli: erm genes G752, G883 and G1415. Note, however, that these genes might still be functional in their native or other hosts.

The structure of the tree showed that the genes were divided into groups based on the taxonomy of their hosts. In particular, genes found in Actinobacteria formed a large clade, where a total of 20 previously known erm genes could be found. This clade also contained a previously unknown gene family (UGF311) that was identified in 

Pseudomonas aeruginosa

, indicating HGT from Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria. The genes in this family were located close to genes involved in plasmid conjugation (MOBH
, tfc19), and induced a resistance phenotype when expressed in 

E. coli

. Further, 67 % of contigs containing genes from UGF 311 were found to also contain aminoglycoside resistance genes [aac(6’)−29a, aac(6’)−29b] (Table 3). The erm genes found in Firmicutes were split between three clades. The first clade included two known erm genes [erm(D), erm(34)] and contained new genes mainly found in Bacillaceae and Paenibacillaceae. This clade also contained a small cluster of genes found in Bacteroidetes, which, in addition to several new families, also contained two known erm genes [erm(F), erm(35)]. Here, the new family UGF171 was found in pathogenic and non-pathogenic species from Bacteroidetes as well as in a species from the Verrucomicrobia phylum (

Akkermansia muciniphila

). Almost one fifth (19%) of the genes from UGF171 were, furthermore, found close to genes involved in plasmid conjugation (MOBQ, MOBP, MPFB, and/or T4CP), suggesting mobility. In addition, 73% of the contigs containing a gene from UGF171 also contained genes conferring resistance to tetracycline [tet(Q)] and/or beta-lactam (cfxA3, blaOXA-347
) antibiotics. Expression of a gene from this family in 

E. coli

 did, however, not result in a measurable resistance phenotype (Table 3). The second Firmicutes clade could be further divided into two clusters, here denoted F.1 and F.2 (Fig. 3), which contained strikingly different numbers of mobile genes. Cluster F.1 contained as many as 12 known erm genes, including erm(A), erm(B) and erm(C) which have all previously been described in multiple phyla [16]. Most of the genes in this cluster were associated with the Bacilli class, suggesting that this may be the origin of many of the most widespread erm genes. More specifically, the genes most closely related to erm(B) were associated with the Lactobacillales order, while the genes most closely related to erm(A) or erm(C) were associated with Bacillales. In addition to the known genes, cluster F.1 also contained five previously unknown gene families, of which three genes were expressed in 

E. coli

 and two (UGF35 and UGF90) induced a macrolide resistance phenotype (Table 3). UGF35 was identified in pathogenic species from the genus 

Facklamia

 while UGF90, which shared a relatively high sequence identity with Erm(A) (60.1–62.1% amino acid identity), was identified in species from the genus 

Oceanobacillus

. In clear contrast to F.1, cluster F.2 only contained a single known erm gene [erm(Q)] and the new genes were primarily found in the class Clostridia or reconstructed from gut and wastewater metagenomes. Notably, several of the mobile genes in F.1 were also found in Clostridia, suggesting it may be more advantageous for Clostridia to acquire these genes rather than the more evolutionary close genes in cluster F.2.

The final clade in the tree mostly represented unknown genes that were identified in various Candidatus phyla or reconstructed from metagenomic samples, indicating a large diversity of erm genes in unculturable bacteria. However, the clade also contained a small cluster, here denoted cluster F.3 (Fig. 3), that contained four known genes in addition to several unknown gene families, two of which (UGF46, UGF122) were potentially mobile and found in pathogens (Table 3). Gene families UGF46 and UGF122 were both found in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e. 

Klebsiella pneumoniae

, however, when expressed in 

E. coli

 only UGF46 provided a resistance phenotype. Furthermore, 61% of the genes from UGF46 were found in the genetic vicinity of genes involved in conjugation (MOBF, MOBQ, MPFT), and/or ISCR elements (ISCR2). Notably, contigs containing genes from UGF46 were frequently found to contain other ARGs, with 55% of the contigs containing the sulfonamide resistance gene sul2, and 28% additionally containing one or more genes conferring resistance to other antibiotics [e.g. msr(E), aph(3’’)-Ib, tet(B), blaTEM-1
] (Table 3). A phylogenetic tree was also created from the representative protein sequences of the 241 identified mph gene families (Figs 4 and S6). The tree consisted of four main clades, representing the taxonomy of the identified host species. The largest of these clades contained genes identified in Firmicutes and included eight known mph genes. This included the widespread mph(B) – that is commonly encountered in Enterobacteriaceae – which was located close to genes from Bacillaceae. The next clade represented mph genes identified in Actinobacteria and included two known genes mph(H) and mph(O). This clade contained one new gene family (UGF100) wherein all genes were identified in predatory Proteobacteria (e.g. 

Myxococcus

 spp.), suggesting HGT between the two phyla. A gene from this family was also found to be functional when expressed in 

E. coli

 (Table 3). The next clade in the tree represented both genes from Bacteroidetes and genes from Proteobacteria. The genes associated with Bacteroidetes included two known variants [mph(E), mph(G)] as well as a new gene family (UGF5) that we were able to validate experimentally. In total, 27% of the genes from this family were flanked by ISCR2 elements, suggesting mobility. Furthermore, 27% of the contigs containing these genes (with a large but not complete overlap with the previously mentioned subset) were found to also contain other ARGs [e.g. erm(B), tet(X4), sul2] (Table 3). Genes from UGF5 as well as the known mph(E) and mph(G) were found in Proteobacterial pathogens, which suggests multiple gene transfer events from this part of the tree. The final part of the tree contained genes identified in proteobacterial hosts, including the known genes mph(A) and mph(F), as well as several new genes identified in Actinobacteria.
