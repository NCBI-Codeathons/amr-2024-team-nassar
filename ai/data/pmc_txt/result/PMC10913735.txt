RESULTS AND DISCUSSION New producers of angiolam As part of our ongoing efforts to isolate, investigate, and cultivate new myxobacterial strains as producers of novel and bioactive natural products, we launched a regional citizen science campaign named “MICROBELIX” (http://www.microbelix.de). In this project, soil samples were taken by members of the general public and channelled into the institute’s strain isolation and characterization workflow. Among the isolates from this sampling campaign, strain MCy12716 caught our attention because its crude extract displayed anti-parasitic activities in an initial screening. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis of the bacterial extract followed by dereplication of the secondary metabolite profile of MCy12716 revealed decent production of the myxobacterial antibiotic angiolam A (1), previously described from Pyxidicoccus fallax An d30 (formerly classified as Angiococcus disciformis strain An d30, Fig. 1) (25). In addition, a number of compounds with similar fragmentation patterns suggestive of similar chemical scaffolds were observed (Fig. 2A and B). However, MCy12716 showed strong variations in angiolam production within subsequent cultivations; hence, we searched for an alternative strain showing more stable production patterns. Thus, strain MCy12733 was eventually chosen for further analysis of the extended angiolam compound family. Based on phylogenetic analysis, strains MCy12716 and MCy12733 represent two novel producers of angiolams, which are located in a phylogenetically divergent clade compared to the original producer strains An d30 and An d48 (Fig. 1). The two novel isolates clustered within the Pyxidicoccus trucidator-Pyxidicoccus caerfyrddinensis-Pyxidicoccus xibeiensis clade, while the previously known angiolam producers branched with Pyxidicoccus fallax. The biosynthetic ability to produce angiolam, therefore, seems to be strongly correlated to the genus Pyxidicoccus.

Identification, production, and structure elucidation of novel angiolam derivatives In order to obtain a better overview of the natural product repertoire of MCy12733, the strain was cultivated in a standard Cy/H medium, and the resulting extracts were subjected to an untargeted metabolome mining workflow, using feature detection with subsequent MS/MS-based molecular networking according to the GNPS method (28–30). Evaluation of these data showed that the MS/MS spectra of known angiolam A (1) cluster with MS/MS fragmentation spectra of five additional, to date unknown angiolam congeners (Fig. 2B). As several of these observed angiolam-like compounds were produced in very low levels, a cultivation media screening was performed to improve their production. Cultivation of MCy12733 in RG5 medium improved the production of most observed angiolam derivatives two- to threefold (Fig. 2C; Tables S10 and S11). Analysis of the new extracts by MS/MS feature-based molecular networking showed the production of seven additional previously unknown angiolam derivatives, although mostly in trace amounts only (Fig. S1). As production levels of the minor angiolams were small, the effect of added amino acids and polyketide precursors on the production of angiolam derivatives was tested. The addition of 2.5 g/L l-valine to Cy/H medium improved the production of novel angiolam D (4a/4b) about sixfold (Fig. 2C; Tables S10 and S11). Production of all other angiolam derivatives was reduced about fourfold under these conditions making this a good example of precursor-guided steering of the angiolam biosynthesis. Further analysis of the extract with MS/MS feature-based molecular networking also led to the observation of novel angiolam F (5) that was only produced in cultivations with l-valine added to the production medium (Fig. 2B). In order to allow compound isolation, angiolams were produced in large-scale cultivations of MCy12733 using different media and subsequently purified by preparative HPLC and, in the case of angiolam derivatives C (3) and D (4a/4b), further separated by supercritical fluid chromatography. As part of compound purification efforts, angiolam A was also isolated and its known structure was verified. High-resolution electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS) of angiolam A (1) shows a [M-H2O + H]+ signal at m/z 570.3785 (calc. 570.37889 Δ = 0.68 ppm) that corresponds to a molecular sum formula of C34H53NO7 for [M]. The sum formula and the resulting nine double bond equivalents (DBEs) match the reported structure of angiolam A (24, 31). Comparison of 1H, 13C, and HSQC NMR spectra of 1 with authentic angiolam A confirmed the purified compound as angiolam A. Following the biosynthetic logic of angiolam A, we propose and employ a numeration for this family of natural products (Fig. 3). Fig 3Structures of known angiolam A and novel derivatives A, B, C, D1, D2, and F. Differences between angiolam A and novel derivatives are highlighted in the respective structures. Structures of known angiolam A and novel derivatives A, B, C, D1, D2, and F. Differences between angiolam A and novel derivatives are highlighted in the respective structures. Angiolam B (2) shows a HRESI-MS [M + H]+ signal at m/z 586.3748 (calc. 586.37385 Δ = 1.62 ppm), corresponding to the molecular sum formula of C34H51NO7 that has an unsaturation degree of 10 DBEs. With respect to the respective spectra of angiolam A, the 13C NMR spectrum of 2 displays a further carbonyl signal at δC-5 210.2, and the HSQC NMR spectrum lacks the signal corresponding to the hydroxylated methine 5 in the side chain of 1. HMBC NMR correlations of the surrounding H-3, H-6a, H-6b, H-7a, H-7b, and H-28 to this carbonyl signal demonstrate its location as C-5. The HRESI-MS signal of the angiolam C (3) ion [M-H2O + H]+ at m/z 572.3955 (calc. 572.39455 Δ = 1.66 ppm) points to the molecular sum formula C34H55NO7 for [M] with eight DBEs. Similar to angiolam B, angiolam C differs from angiolam A in the side chain. The HSQC NMR spectrum of 3 lacks the signals belonging to the terminal alkene of 1 but displays a new methyl group (δC-1 14.1 and δH-1 0.97) and a new methylene group (δC-2 20.8 and δH-2 2.03). COSY NMR correlations between this methylene group with the methyl group, as well as with H-3, show that angiolam C is fully saturated at the end of the side chain. Evidence from the HRESI-MS [M-H2O + H]+ signal at m/z 584.3953 (calc. 584.39455 Δ = 1.28 ppm) suggested that angiolam D (4a/4b) possesses a molecular sum formula of C35H55NO7 for [M] and nine DBEs. In contrast to the angiolam derivatives described above, angiolam D seems to be a mixture of one main and several minor components with very similar retention times (Fig. S2). Consequently, the purification workflow yielded the mixture of angiolam D1 (4a) as major and angiolam D2 (4b) as minor component. However, it was possible to elucidate the structures of 4a and 4b out of the same data set of 1D and 2D NMR spectra. The difference between angiolams A and D is located within the macrocycle. While 1 holds methyl residues at C-24 and C-26, they are exchanged by an ethyl residue at C-26 in 4a and at C-24 in 4b. In 4a, this is demonstrated by the HSQC NMR signals of a methyl group (δC-34’ 14.0 and δH-34’ 1.01) and a diastereotopic methylene (δC-34 20.6, δH-34a 2.35, and δH-34b 2.29). The methyl protons H-34′ show COSY-NMR correlations to the methylene protons H-34a and H-34b and HMBC-NMR correlations to the olefinic C-26 (δC-26 135.1). Furthermore, the HMBC correlations of the methylene protons H-34a and H-34b to C-25 (δC-25 141.3), C-26 (δC-26 135.1), and C-27 (δC-27 167.4), as well as the HMBC correlation between H-25 (δH-25 6.39) and C-34, demonstrate the structure of angiolam D1. The ethyl residue in 4b is indicated by the HSQC NMR signals of a diastereotopic methylene (δC-33 24.2, δH-33a 2.00, and δH-33b 1.33) and a methyl group (δC-33 11.2 and δH-33 0.86). COSY NMR correlations of methylene protons H-33a and H-33b to H-24 (δH-24 2.46), as well as to the methyl-group H-33′ (δH-33’ 0.86), show that these signals belong to an ethyl residue that is bound to C-24. This is further evidenced by HMBC-NMR correlations of H-23 (δH-23 3.84) and H-25 (δH-25 6.41) to C-33 (δC-33 24.2) and reciprocal HMBC correlations between the methine H-24 (δC-24 43.2 and δH-24 2.46) and the methyl-group H-33′ (δC-33 11.2 and δH-33 0.86). Angiolam F (5) shows a HRESI-MS [M-H2O + H]+ signal at m/z 598.4121 (calc. 598.41025 Δ = 3.09 ppm), corresponding to the molecular sum formula of C36H57NO7 for [M] and nine DBEs. Similar to angiolam D, a mixture of one major and several minor components can be seen in the crude extracts (Fig. S2). However, the purification workflow resulted in one pure natural product. Compared to 1, the HSQC NMR spectrum of 5 lacks the methyl groups 33 and 34. Instead, it displays two slightly different methyl groups at δC-33 11.2, δH-33 0.86 and δC-34 13.6, δH-34 0.99 as well as two methylene groups at δC-33 24.2, δH-33 1.98 and δC-34 20.7, δH-34 2.34, similar to the signals belonging to the ethyl residues in 4a and 4b. As described above, COSY NMR correlations of methylene H-33 (δH-33 1.98) to H-24 (δH-24 2.45) and the methyl group H-33′ (δH-33’ 0.86) identify an ethyl residue bound to C-24. Furthermore, methyl group H-34′ (δH-34 0.99) shows COSY correlations to methylene H-34 (δH-34 2.34) and HMBC-NMR correlations to olefinic C-26 (δC-26 136.6), pointing toward an ethyl residue, bound to C-26. The identity and location of both ethyl residues within the macrocycle are further evidenced by HMBC-NMR correlations, as elaborated for 4a and 4b. Due to their low production yields, angiolam derivatives E and G could not be purified in amounts sufficient for NMR-based structure elucidation. Considering a common biosynthetic route for angiolam A and its derivatives, it was deemed likely that they are produced by a set of enzymatic domains involved in polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) hybrid-type biosynthesis. In the biosynthetic assembly line, small parts of the PKS-NRPS megaenzymes, so-called domains control the incorporation of single building blocks into the growing scaffold and determine the stereochemistry of the emerging natural product. Therefore, we propose that the reported stereochemistry of angiolam A should also be found in all newly described derivatives (Fig. 3). In silico analysis of the angiolam BGC and biosynthesis hypothesis The discovery and understanding of the biosynthetic pathway for a given natural product class provide valuable insights that can be used to improve the production of these natural products or alter its biosynthesis towards the production of novel derivatives. In order to find the biosynthetic origin of the angiolam compound family, genome sequences of both novel producers MCy12716 and MCy12733 were obtained by Illumina sequencing. Analysis of both sequences with antiSMASH (32) together with retro-biosynthetic considerations pinpointed a candidate polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) hybrid cluster with 12 modules spanning five genes. Alignment of the core BGC and its flanking regions was used to determine the likely cluster borders of the angiolam BGC. According to the similarities of both sequences, the ang BGC comprises a total of 14 genes spanning a 78.5 kb region. Detailed analysis of the genes in the ang BGC in MCy12733 was carried out by BLAST searches against the NCBI database (see below and Tables S20 and S21; Fig. S3). Interestingly, the genome of P. caerfyrddinensis CA032A, the closest described relative of MCy12733, harbors genes coding for proteins highly similar to the ones of the putative ang BGC. While these genes are present in the same order in both strains, P. caerfyrddinensis lacks the PKS-NRPS core as well as angF, encoding an acyl-CoA/acyl-ACP dehydrogenase. Therefore, it is somewhat likely the ang BGC only consists of the biosynthetic core angA-angE and angF or also includes the flanking genes ang1-ang6 upstream and ang7-ang8 downstream the core region that might also perform relevant functions for angiolam biosynthesis. BLAST searches of angA-angE against draft genomes (Sebastian Walesch, unpublished data) of the known angiolam-producing strains Pyxidicoccus fallax An d30 (24, 25) and P. fallax An d48 (26) indicated the presence of the BGC but divided into several contigs due to poor DNA sequence quality. Furthermore, parts of the biosynthetic machinery, divided into at least two contigs, could be observed in the deposited genomes of P. fallax An d47 (GCA_012933655.1) and P. fallax CA059B (GCA_013155555.1). In order to verify the compound-to-BGC assignment, the angiolam biosynthetic gene cluster was inactivated via single crossover plasmid insertion. As genetic manipulation of both new angiolam-producing strains MCy12716 and MCy12733 could not be achieved, the inactivation was performed in the genetically amenable producer P. fallax An d48 (26, 27) for which single crossover inactivation has already been shown to be achievable. A pCR2.1-TOPO-derived vector carrying a 1 kb homology fragment of the angB gene was integrated into the angB gene on the P. fallax An d48 chromosome. A mutant strain was selected on YM agar, supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin. It was then cultivated for gDNA extraction and subsequent verification via PCR (Fig. S9), as well as to generate crude extracts to monitor angiolam production. The single cross-over inactivation abolished the production of angiolam A (1, Fig. 4). Furthermore, no other angiolam derivative could be detected. This finding confirmed that ang BGC is the locus responsible for the production of the angiolam compound family. Fig 4Analytical verification of the angiolam BGC assignment.

Gray traces represent the corresponding base peak chromatograms (BPC). Intensity scale in D is magnified 100-fold. EIC traces in panel D are stacked for a better overview. Our biosynthetic findings agree with previous feeding experiments, revealing the biogenesis of angiolam A to comprise seven propionate equivalents, five acetate equivalents, and l-valine (24). According to predictions by antiSMASH (32) and domain fingerprints (33), the acyltransferases (ATs) of the loading module and modules 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, and 12 selectively incorporate methylmalonyl-CoA and the ATs of modules 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are selective for malonyl-CoA (Table S22; Fig. S4). The adenylation (A) domain of module 8 incorporates glycine or alanine, according to antiSMASH (Table S22). Analysis of the ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoylreductase (ER) domains was done by antiSMASH, according to fingerprints (34, 35) or based on a hidden Markov model (36) (Table S23; Fig. S5 to S7). Deviations from the “colinearity rule” can be explained by inactive ER domains in modules 2 and 12, an inactive KR domain in module 10, a missing KR domain, as well as an inactive DH domain in module 7. Moreover, the in silico predictions of the stereochemistry based on KR, DH, and ER domains matched the actual stereochemistry of angiolam A. An unusual feature of angiolam A is the distal alkene moiety, an altogether rare structural feature in natural products (37). The terminal alkenes in curacin A and tautomycetin are formed while or after they are released from the respective megasynthase (38, 39). Similar to angiolam A, the alkene starter in haliangicin A is part of its starter unit and is formed by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase HliR through a γ,δ-dehydrogenation of 2-methylpent-2-enoyl-CoA (40). Based on this finding, a possible explanation for the distal alkene moiety of angiolam A could be a dehydrogenation of the methylmalonyl-CoA-derived starter unit to prop-2-enoyl-ACP by the acyl-CoA/acyl-ACP dehydrogenase AngF in the loading module (Fig. 5B). However, dehydrogenation to form the distal alkene is also possible later, during or after the assembly line biosynthesis. Fig 5In silico biosynthesis of angiolam A.

Following the incorporation of the starter unit, angiolam A undergoes seven PKS-derived elongation steps including the incorporation of four malonyl-CoA and three methylmalonyl-CoA extender units with varying oxidation states, based on the respective reductive loops. Next, l-alanine is incorporated by the NRPS module 8. This is followed by four further PKS-derived elongation steps of one malonyl-CoA and three methylmalonyl-CoA extender units to form the angiolam A backbone. Finally, the fully elongated intermediate is cyclized and released from the PKS-NRPS machinery by the thioesterase domain in module 12 (Fig. 5A). The likely explanations for the structural differences observed in angiolams B and C are incomplete reduction by the KR domain in module 2 and dehydrogenation reactions at the end of the angiolam side chain, respectively. The observation of the ethyl residues in modules 11 and 12 in angiolams D and F is more surprising. As feeding experiments with L-methionine-(methyl 13C) did not result in mass shifts (Fig. S8), a SAM-dependent methylation of the respective methyl residues seemed unlikely. Therefore, we concluded that these ethyl residues originate from ethylmalonyl-CoA extender units and are incorporated by AT domains with broader substrate specificities. A prominent example of an AT domain that incorporates methylmalonyl-CoA and ethylmalonyl-CoA is the AT domain of module 5 of the monensin biosynthesic gene cluster (41). Screening of the ang AT domains for the reported signature sequence RiDVV (41) revealed that not only modules 11 and 12 but also modules 3, 6, and 10 might have the capacity to accept ethylmalonyl-CoA as an extender unit (Fig. S4), leading to the observed natural structural diversity of angiolams. We reason that this also explains the finding of angiolams D and F as mixtures of several components. However, the reasons for the increased incorporation of ethylmalonyl-CoA by modules 11 and 12 in comparison to the others remain elusive. Interestingly, AT domains in modules 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the epothilone BGC in Sorangium cellulosum So ce90 (42) also display the signature sequence RiDVV. So far, there is only one report about an epothilone derivative with an ethyl residue, putatively incorporated by one of these AT domains (43), indicating that this signature sequence might point toward AT domains that accept either methyl- or ethylmalonyl CoA as their substrate. However, the prioritization of the substrate seems to depend on other parameters like other sequence motifs within the AT domains or its three-dimensional structure, KS domain substrate specificities, or precursor supply. The importance of precursor supply for the incorporation of ethylmalonyl-CoA is demonstrated by the increased production of angiolams D and F in cultivations with added l-valine, as it serves as a precursor for ethylmalonyl-CoA (44). As l-valine can also be a precursor of methylmalonyl-CoA (44), feeding experiments with l-valine 13C5 resulted in inconclusive results (data not shown). However, the role of l-valine as a precursor for the ethylmalonyl-CoA supply in MCy12733 is further evidenced by the presence of a gene encoding a fused isobutyryl-CoA mutase located elsewhere within its genome (Tables S19 and S20). Furthermore, the addition of butyrate, a possible intermediate in the pathway from l-valine to ethylmalonyl-CoA, also increased the production of angiolams D and F (Table S24) reinforcing this hypothesis. Antiparasitic activities Based on the antiparasitic bioactivity of the crude extract of MCy12716, angiolams A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), and F (5) were tested for their in vitro activities against the following protozoan parasites: Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (STIB 900) bloodstream forms, Trypanosoma cruzi (Tulahuen C4) amastigotes, Leishmania donovani (MHOM/ET/67/L82) axenic amastigotes, and Plasmodium falciparum (NF54) proliferative erythrocytic stages. In parallel, the cytotoxicity of these compounds in rat skeletal myoblasts (L-6 cells) was determined in order to obtain an initial assessment of their selectivity. The results are reported in Table 1.

Activity against trypanosomatids Comparing the activity of different angiolam congeners against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, there is a clear matching between the antitrypanosomal activity and selectivity (A > C > D1 >B > F). Angiolam A showed the highest activity (IC50 of 1.5 µM) toward T. brucei as well as preferential selectivity across all the three trypansomatids. Its trypanocidal activity is comparable to that previously described for Macyranone A, a peptide-epoxyketone isolated from another myxobacterial strain Cystobacter fuscus MCy9118 (11). Angiolams B, C, and D showed similar activity and toxicity profiles against T. b. rhodesiense (IC50 range: 4.5–6.3 µM, SI: 4.4–6.8), while angiolam F was the least active and most cytotoxic. Trypanosoma cruzi was the least sensitive parasite (IC50: 6.6–34.0 µM) with unfavorable selectivities displayed by most of the tested compounds (angiolams B, C, and F) due to their relatively high cytotoxicity (SI ≤ 2.1). Although both T. brucei and T. cruzi are trypansomatids, however, the lack of overlapping activity is not unusual (45). This could be partially explained by the intracellular nature of the parasite (46). Nevertheless, angiolam D was found to be the most active (IC50: 6.5 µM), with twofold higher activity with respect to angiolam A. This could be attributed to the CH3 extension at C-33 or C-34, which, on the other hand, diminished the selectivity. Angiolams exhibited moderate to low activity (IC50: 6.6–17.6 µM) and unsatisfactory selectivity (selectivity indices of 2–6) toward L. donovani axenic amastigotes. Angiolam B has shown the highest activity (IC50: 6.6 µM), though 20-fold weaker than its displayed activity against P. falciparum, followed by angiolam D (IC50: 8.2 µM). Angiolams A, C, and F showed comparable activities (IC50: 15.4–17.6 µM), with angiolam C being the most cytotoxic. Activity against Plasmodium falciparum The in vitro activity of angiolams against the erythrocytic stages of the P. falciparum strain NF54 was the most promising compared to the other parasites tested. Angiolams B, C, and D showed activity in submicromolar concentrations (IC50: 0.3–0.8 µM) with high selectivities (SI ≥ 30). The most promising compound of this series was angiolam B exhibiting submicromolar activity (IC50: 0.3 µM) and highest selectivity (SI: 91.6). We assume that this could be due to the oxidation of C-5 that has an augmenting effect on both activity and selectivity. Angiolams D and F showed IC50 values of 0.8 and 1.3 µM, respectively. The presence of two ethyl groups in angiolam F may have contributed to the reduced activity; however, this substitution did not show an effect on the selectivity (SI 37 for both D and F). Unlike its antitrypanosomal activity, angiolam A showed the least antiplasmodial activity and selectivity among the tested angiolam derivatives. Conclusion and outlook This study demonstrates the prospects of a regional sampling campaign to bring forward new myxobacterial natural product producers, in combination with screening efforts that go beyond antibacterial or cytotoxic activities. The uncovering of new producing strains with unexpected bioactivities reinvigorated the interest in angiolam almost 40 years after it was first reported as an antibiotic (24, 25). This interest subsequently led to the characterization of several novel angiolam derivatives with improved bioactivities against P. falciparum. It also initiated the elucidation of the underlying biosynthesis, including a potentially rare enzymatic dehydrogenation of the starter unit. Moreover, our present data highlight the potential of the angiolam scaffold as a starting point for the development of novel drugs with anti-parasitic bioactivities. This view is supported by the promising selectivity index of most angiolam derivatives against P. falciparum in combination with the reported tolerability of angiolam A in mice as well as the availability of a total synthesis route (25, 31). Taken together, this study illustrates the opportunities of reinvestigating “old” natural products with improved analytical and computational resources at hand. Given the energetic effort that microorganisms put into the biosynthesis of these compounds, it is likely that the competitive advantage conveyed by these natural products comes with additional biological activities awaiting their future discovery through suitable bioassays.
