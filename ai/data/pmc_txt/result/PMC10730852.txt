Results and discussion Bioinformatics analysis revealing 130 Cph homologs for CMN resistance BLASTP analysis identified over 3000 Cph putative homologs in the NCBI GenBank non-redundant protein sequence database, with amino acid sequence identities ranging from 15% to 100%. Most putative Cph homologs identified through BLASTP analysis are annotated as phosphotransferases, including viomycin phosphotransferase, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH), and macrolide phosphotransferase (MPH). However, the authentic function and targeted antibiotics of these homologs are not known. To identify phosphotransferases conferring resistance to the CMN family of antibiotics, we constructed an SSN using 353 homologs from the UniProt database, which had amino acid sequence identities ranging between 20% and 70% with Cph. These Cph homologs were classified into five major clusters in the SSN at an e value threshold of 10−55 (Fig. 2a). Cph from the CMN-producing strain is located in a large cluster, cluster I, which consists of 130 Cph homologs with 36.9% to 68.9% sequence identities to Cph (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Table 1). Proteins found in the four other major clusters, II–V, share up to 33.6% sequence identities to Cph. The sequence alignments of Cph with proteins from each cluster can be found in Supplementary Figs. 1–12.Fig. 2Bioinformatics analysis of the Cph homologs.a The 353 Cph homologs are classified into five major clusters in an SSN at an e value of 10−55.

Cph consists of two domains: an N-terminal lobe domain responsible for ATP binding and a C-terminal domain divided into a core subdomain and an α-helical subdomain for CMN binding. In the complex structure of Cph with CMN, CMN is bound by the side chains of Asp186, Glu190, and Glu211 at the core subdomain and Gln259, Gln260, and Glu272 at the α-helical subdomain through hydrogen bonding. Additionally, Phe256 interacts with the amide group of CMN through π-electron interactions27. Sequence analysis of proteins in cluster I revealed conservation of the CMN-binding residues (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 1); proteins in clusters II–V do not conserve these residues (Supplementary Figs. 2–12). This implicates that the Cph homologs in cluster I contain the putative CMN-binding site and may confer resistance to CMN. Intriguingly, the Cph homologs in cluster I were found in a broad range of actinobacteria, including Mycobacterium, Mycolicibacterium, and Pseudonocardia (Fig. 2b). Cph homologs in cluster I confer resistance to CMN To confirm whether proteins in cluster I also confer resistance to CMN, three proteins, Cph001 from Streptosporangium roseum (accession number: WP_012891209), Cph002 from Streptomyces sp. SID8364 (MYT78782), and Cph003 from Streptomyces filamentosus NRRL15998 (EWS93654), were selected for disk diffusion assays. These three bacterial genomes were sequenced; notably, none of them possess the CMN or VIO BGCs. Cph001, Cph002, and Cph003 share 49.02%, 48.16%, and 45.17% amino acid sequence identities to Cph, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 13). The genes encoding these three proteins were synthesized and cloned into pET22b and used to transform E. coli BL21 Rosetta (DE3). Disk diffusion assay revealed that each of the E. coli strains harboring cph, cph001, cph002, or cph003, becomes resistant to CMN IIA at different levels (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3Disk diffusion assays and enzyme activity assays of Cph001.a Disk diffusion assays of E. coli with or without cph/cph001/cph002/cph003 gene against CMN IIA.

Activity assay and mutational analysis of Cph001 for CMN phosphorylation Cph is an O-phosphotransferase that transfers the γ-phosphate group of ATP or GTP to the hydroxyl group of CMN IIA. To further confirm their mechanism of resistance, we attempted to produce Cph001, Cph002, and Cph003 in E. coli and to purify to homogeneity for enzyme assays. However, Cph002 and Cph003 were not stable, undergoing aggregation and degradation during protein purification. Therefore, only Cph001 could be used for further biochemical characterization and structural determination (Supplementary Fig. 14). The Cph001 reaction was performed using a lactate dehydrogenase-coupled enzyme assay following the procedure previously used for Cph27. A decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for both Cph and Cph001 reactions in the presence of CMN IIA and ATP, indicating phosphorylation by Cph001 (Fig. 3b). We then performed mutagenesis on the codons coding for the conserved catalytic residue Asp189 to generate the Cph001D189A and Cph001D189N variants. Activity assays revealed that both mutations resulted in complete loss of phosphotransferase activity supporting that Asp189 in Cph001 plays a critical role for catalysis (Fig. 3b). The apparent Michaelis constant (Km) of CMN IIA and turnover number (kcat) of Cph001 with ATP as a phosphate donor were determined to be 0.88 ± 0.20 mM and 0.63 ± 0.05 min−1, respectively, under pseudo-first-order conditions (Fig. 3c, i). Furthermore, Cph001 also accepted GTP as the phosphate donor; the apparent Km of CMN IIA and kcat of Cph001 in the presence of saturating GTP were determined to be 1.40 ± 0.24 mM and 0.36 ± 0.03 min−1, respectively (Fig. 3c, ii). On the other hand, the apparent Km and kcat of ATP and GTP for Cph001 in the presence of saturating CMN IIA were determined to be 0.07 ± 0.02 mM and 0.58 ± 0.03 min-1 and 0.18 ± 0.03 mM and 0.91 ± 0.04 min-1, respectively (Fig. 3c, iii; Fig. 3c, iv). The Km for ATP was >2.5-fold tighter than the Km for GTP, indicating that Cph001 prefers ATP as a phosphate donor. Previous kinetic studies have shown that the Km value of Cph for CMN IIA with ATP as a phosphate donor (Km = 0.46 mM) is on the same level as that of Cph001, being less than twice the Km of Cph001. The environments of the CMN IIA binding sites in Cph and Cph001 are identical (the crystal structure of Cph001 will be discussed further below), leading to Km values that are on the same level. However, the kcat value of Cph for CMN IIA with ATP as a phosphate donor (kcat = 17.40 min−1) is about 27 times higher than that of Cph001. The more efficient catalysis of Cph phosphorylation stems from cph being the original self-resistance gene for CMN. Unsurprisingly, Cph001 is incapable of phosphorylating CMN IIB due to the lack of the hydroxyl group as the phosphate acceptor (Fig. 1). However, similar to cph, cph001 is capable of endowing E. coli with resistance to CMN IIB (Fig. 4a). We performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis to measure the dissociation constants (KD) of CMNs. CMN IIA and CMN IIB bind to Cph001 with KD values 1.24 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Cph001 confers cross-resistance to CMN and VIO Antibiotic resistance mediated by phosphotransferases was observed in many aminoglycoside and macrolide antibiotics32–34. All APHs, MPHs, Cph, and Cph001 belong to the phosphotransferase family. To investigate whether Cph001 confers cross-resistance to other classes of antibiotics or related antibiotics, an aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin (Kan), a macrolide antibiotic erythromycin (Ery), and VIO were subjected to the disk diffusion assay and couple enzyme assay. Based on the disk diffusion assay, E. coli harboring cph001 are resistant to VIO but not to Kan and Ery (Fig. 4). We further performed the couple enzyme assay to evaluate the phosphorylation reaction of Cph001 to VIO, Kan, and Ery using ATP as a phosphate donor. Consistently, Cph001 is only capable of phosphorylating VIO (Fig. 3b), and thus Cph001 confers cross-resistance to the CMN analogous antibiotic VIO. Structural solution and refinement of Cph001 in apo and complex forms To understand the molecular details of Cph001 catalytic mechanism and CMN- and ATP/GTP-binding sites, we performed crystallization to determine the three-dimensional structure of Cph001. Degradation bands were observed on the SDS-PAGE for the wild-type Cph001 after a week of storage at 4 °C. This might be the reason why the wild-type Cph001 could not be crystallized. After multiple attempts to obtain the crystals of the wild-type Cph001, we switched to focus on the Cph001D189N variant, which is more stable than the wild-type and can be crystallized at 4 °C. Crystals of Cph001D189N were successfully obtained in a week and the diffraction data were collected at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) on beamlines 15A, 05A, or 07A. The molecular packing of Cph001D189N belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121. The crystal structure of Cph001D189N in apo form was determined by the molecular replacement (MR) method, with the structure of Cph (PDB entry 7F0A)27 as the initial search model. Two polypeptide chains were found and built in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 5a). The final model of Cph001D189N was refined to a resolution of 2.3 Å. Furthermore, we obtained ligand complex structures by soaking CMN IIA, CMN IIB, VIO, ATP, or GTP into the crystals of Cph001D189N. Seven structures of Cph001D189N complexes were determined by the MR method using the apo protein as the search model: Cph001D189N-CMN IIA, Cph001D189N-CMN IIB, Cph001D189N-VIO, Cph001D189N-ATP, Cph001D189N-GTP, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA/ATP, and Cph001D189N-VIO/ATP. The final models of the binary complex structures, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA, Cph001D189N-CMN IIB, Cph001D189N-VIO, Cph001D189N-ATP, and Cph001D189N-GTP, were refined to resolutions between 1.95 Å to 2.26 Å, and the ternary structures, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA/ATP and Cph001D189N-VIO/ATP, were refined to resolutions between 2.00 Å and 3.00 Å, respectively. The extra electron density in the putative active site can be identified and unambiguously fitted with the molecular conformation of CMN IIA, CMN IIB, VIO, ATP, and GTP in the corresponding complex structures (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Crystal structures of Cph001 reveal molecular details for the binding sites of CMN/VIO and ATP/GTP The overall structures of Cph001 and Cph revealed an identical fold with a root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) of 0.97 Å over a superposition of 215 Cα atoms. The polypeptide chain of Cph001 is folded into two domains, an N-terminal lobe domain (Met1–Gly97) and a C-terminal domain (Ala98–Arg286). The C-terminal domain further divided into a core subdomain (Ala98–Ala140 and Thr182–Ser246) and an α-helical subdomain (Pro141–Ile181 and Asp247–Arg286) (Fig. 5b). The complex structures, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA, Cph001D189N-CMN IIB, Cph001D189N-ATP, and Cph001D189N-GTP, revealed that CMN IIA and CMN IIB bind to the C-terminal domain while ATP and GTP bind to the N-terminal lobe domain opposite to CMN (Fig. 5b). Except for the β-lysine moiety that is flexible in the binding pocket, the pentapeptide backbones of CMN IIA and CMN IIB are found in a similar conformation. The residues involved in CMN binding are conserved between Cph001 and Cph (Supplementary Fig. 13). The side chains of Glu193 and Glu214 at the core subdomain and Gln264, Gln265, and Glu277 at the α-helical subdomain interact with CMN IIA or CMN IIB through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5c). CMN IIA, compared to CMN IIB, contains an additional hydrogen bond between its hydroxyl group and Asp189 (mutated to Asn in the present structure) (Fig. 1; Fig. 5c). In addition, the side chain of Phe261 revealed a close contact with the amide group of CMN IIA or IIB through π–electron interactions (Fig. 5c). For the binding sites of ATP and GTP, the residues involved in ATP and GTP binding are highly conserved between Cph001 and Cph (Supplementary Fig. 13). The crystal structures of Cph001D189N-ATP and Cph001D189N-GTP revealed that ATP and GTP are bound in the same position, where the main-chain amides of Ser93 and Val95 interact with the base of ATP and GTP through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5d). In a comparison of the ATP-binding environments of Cph001 and Cph, the side chain imidazole group of His31 associates with the β-phosphate group of ATP in Cph001 instead of the side chain guanidinium group of Arg41 to the α-phosphate group in Cph (Fig. 5f; Supplementary Fig. 13)27. Furthermore, the main chain of Gln29–His31 in a β-hairpin structure interacts with the β-phosphate group of ATP or GTP through hydrogen bonds in Cph001; however, this β-hairpin structure is far away from ATP in the complex structure of Cph with ATP (Fig. 5d; Fig. 5f). Mg2+ is widely recognized for its role in stabilizing the transition state of the phosphate group during phosphorylation35. The crystal structure of aminoglycoside-3´-phosphotransferase-IIIa [APH(3´)-IIIa, PDB entry 1L8T], an APH linked to resistance against Kan and neomycin, reveals that Asp208 and Asn195 serve as ligands coordinating with two Mg2+ ions (Fig. 5g)36. The important role of Asp208 in stabilizing the transition state for catalytic reaction has been demonstrated37. Cph001 and APH(3´)-IIIa share a similar three-dimensional structure with an rmsd of 2.89 Å for Cα atom superposition. The Mg2+-binding residues, Asp208 and Asn195 in APH(3´)-IIIa, correspond to Asp211 and Asn194 in Cph001, respectively, located near the triphosphate group of ATP (Fig. 5g). Furthermore, these two residues are conserved across almost all the proteins in the SSN analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1–12), suggesting their potential role in Mg2+ binding. Based on the disk diffusion assay and the couple enzyme assay mentioned previously, Cph001 confers cross-resistance to CMN and VIO. We then solved the crystal structure of Cph001D189N-VIO. The complex structures Cph001D189N-CMN IIA, Cph001D189N-CMN IIB, and Cph001D189N-VIO revealed that CMN and VIO occupy the same position with a similar conformation; the pentapeptide backbones are superimposed well while the β-lysine moiety is located on the opposite position between VIO and CMN (Fig. 5c; Fig. 5e). The β-lysine moiety of VIO extends into the α-helical subdomain while that of CMN extends towards the N-terminal lobe domain. Moreover, the additional hydroxyl group at the capreomycidine moiety of VIO points towards the protein surface without any specific interaction. The complex structure Cph001D189N-VIO supports cross-resistance of Cph001 and provides molecular details of VIO-binding environment. ITC analysis revealed that VIO binds to Cph001 with a KD value 4.18 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

ATP and GTP binding and preferences in Cph001 APHs and MPHs utilize ATP or GTP as phosphate donors for phosphorylation. Previous structural analysis have shown that ATP and GTP binding sites among these phosphotransferases are highly conserved, resulting in similar binding environments. For instance, in APH(2”)-IVa, the adenine base of ATP is stabilized through two hydrogen bonds: one between N6 and the main chain oxygen atom of Thr96 and another between N1 and the main chain nitrogen atom of Ile98 (Fig. 6a)38. However, the guanine base of GTP displays a slight positional shift relative to the adenine base of ATP. O6 of the guanine base, taking the place of N1 of the adenine base, interacts with the main chain nitrogen atom of Ile98, while N1 of the guanine base interacts with the main chain oxygen atom of the same residue Ile98 (Fig. 6b)38. Notably, like APH(2”)-IVa, Cph001 can utilize both ATP and GTP as phosphate donors. Intriguingly, unlike typical APHs and MPHs, which reveal a hydrogen-bonding frameshift between ATP and GTP binding (Fig. 6a; Fig. 6b)38, the crystal structures of Cph001D189N-ATP and Cph001D189N-GTP show identical binding positions for the adenine and guanine bases (Fig. 6c; Fig. 6d). Contrary to the hydrogen bonding of O6 of the guanine base with the main chain nitrogen atom in typical APHs and MPHs (Fig. 6b), N2 of the guanine base forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen atom of Val95 in Cph001 (Fig. 6d).Fig. 6Local view of ATP- and GTP-binding sites in APH(2”)-IVa38 and Cph001.a The crystal structure of the APH(2”)-IVa-adenosine complex. b The crystal structure of the APH(2”)-IVa-guanosine complex. c The crystal structure of Cph001D189N-ATP complex. d The crystal structure of Cph001D189N-GTP complex.

ATP/adenosine and GTP/guanosine are depicted as balls and sticks in blue and gray. The protein–ligand interactions are depicted as yellow dotted lines. As mentioned earlier, enzyme kinetics reveal that Cph001 exhibits a preference for ATP as a phosphate donor. Each base of ATP and GTP bound in Cph001 respectively forms two hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone. For ATP, N6 interacts with the main chain oxygen atom of Ser93 and N1 interacts with the main chain nitrogen atom of Val95 (Fig. 6c). For GTP, N1 and N2 interact with the main chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms of Val95, respectively (Fig. 6d). There could be a variance in the strength of these hydrogen bonds when comparing adenine and guanine bases in their interactions with Cph001. In addition, the distance between O6 of the guanine base and the main chain oxygen atom of Ser93 is measured to be 3 Å (Fig. 6d). This proximity might induce a minor repulsion, potentially diminishing the binding affinity. Proposed catalytic mechanism of Cph001 In every Cph001 structures, including apo and complex forms, the two polypeptide chains within the asymmetric unit adopt distinct conformations: an open form and a closed form (Fig. 7a). The two forms implicate conformational changes during enzyme catalysis. In all Cph001 structures, CMN IIA/VIO and ATP/GTP were only observed in the open form. In the open form of the ternary complex structure, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA/ATP, the hydroxyl group of CMN IIA is ~6.3 Å away from the γ-phosphate group of ATP (Fig. 7b). The closed form reveals that the α-helical subdomain moves closer to the N-terminal lobe domain when compared to the open form (Fig. 7a). This suggests that a transition from the open to the closed form brings the two ligands together for catalysis. We propose that Cph001 undergoes a conformational change, wherein the α-helical subdomain approaches the N-terminal lobe domain, allowing the substrate CMN IIA/VIO moves closer to ATP for the catalytic process. The carboxylate group of Asp189 (mutated to Asn in the current structure) forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of CMN IIA/VIO at a distance of ~3.6 Å. Asp189 acts as a general base, deprotonating the hydroxyl group of CMN IIA/VIO to initiate the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 7c).Fig. 7Proposed catalytic mechanism of Cph001.a Superposition of the closed form and the open form of Cph001.

Asp189 acts as a general base to deprotonate the CMN IIA hydroxyl group, which subsequently attacks the γ-phosphate group of ATP for phosphorylation.

The putative CMN-resistance genes are found in a broad range of actinobacteria and distributed in human pathogens In this study, 353 homologs of Cph were found and classified into five major clusters. SSN and bioinformatics analysis revealed that the 130 homologs in cluster I have highly conserved residues for CMN binding. Disk diffusion and enzyme activity assays supported that some proteins in this cluster confer resistance to CMN by antibiotic modification, specifically phosphorylation. Intriguingly, the Cph homologs in cluster I were discovered broadly in various bacterial species from 31 countries on five continents (Supplementary Fig. 17). Most notably, the putative CMN-resistance genes are present in various Mycobacterium and Mycolicibacterium species. These species belong to the non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium (NTM) group, which is known to induce lung disease and weaken the immune system39. Furthermore, the putative CMN-resistance genes have also been found in many human pathogens, including Nocardia vulneris (which causes disseminated nocardiosis)40, Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (pulmonary infections)41, Mycobacterium septicum (associated with catheter-related bacteraemia)42, and Actinomadura bangladeshensis (A. bangladeshensis-induced foot mycetoma)43. These indicate that the putative CMN-resistance genes are distributed not only in the environmental bacteria but also human pathogens. Horizontal gene transfer from nonpathogens to pathogens, needless to say between the same genus, is known as one of the major pathways for ARGs transmission and dissemination. Our findings highlight an latent concern that the potential CMN-resistance genes may transfer to clinical TB pathogens, leading to drug resistance. We further investigated whether other ARGs or mobile genetic elements exist nearby the three CMN-resistance genes, cph001, cph002, and cph003. For this purpose, we conducted an exhaustive ARGs detection analysis using AMRfinderPlus44. Notably, our results showed no presence of additional ARGs in close vicinity to our designated target genes, even within a 3000-nucleotide radius. Subsequently, we posited the possibility of mobile genetic elements such as transposons and insertion sequences, serving as mediators for the dissemination of these target genes across different species. However, a key finding from our study was the absence of any detectable long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) or short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) in the genomic areas our three target genes. No instances of any ARGs or mobile genetic elements were identified in the proximity to or within the genomic landscape of cph001, cph002, and cph003. This observation suggests that genetic mobility mechanisms may not be operative in the case of these three genes. Several factors might contribute to this observation: new mobile genetic elements that have not yet been identified, mobile genetic elements might be located further away from the resistance genes, or the resistance genes could be transferred through other mechanisms, such as generalized transduction. The lack of known mobile genetic elements near cph001, cph002, and cph003 might be related to these resistance genes being predominantly found in actinomycetes species. Additional investigation is required to explore this intriguing question.
