RESULTS Subject recruitment and semen collection In this study, 102 participants were enrolled, including 54 men with HDFI (DFI > 30%) and 48 men with LDFI (DFI < 15%). The enrolled participants were divided into two cohorts (Fig. 1): for cohort one, cross-incubation experiments were performed on 10 participants, with another five participants who served as sperm donors; for cohort two, 16S rRNA sequencing alongside non-targeted metabolic profiling was conducted on semen samples from 87 participants, comprising 40 with LDFI and 47 with HDFI. Clinical characteristics across the HDFI and LDFI groups were carefully matched (Tables 1 and 2). Fig 1Participants enrolled in the study. Participants enrolled in the study.

Effect of seminal plasma composition on DFI To investigate the impact of seminal plasma composition on DFI, cross-incubation experiments were conducted (Fig. 2A). Notably, an increase in DFI was observed following incubation with plasma from high DFI patients, suggesting that microbiota-derived compositions within seminal plasma could modify the semen environment (Fig. 2B; Table S1).

Seminal microbiota composition Initial analyses compared overall microbiome community compositions between the HDFI and LDFI groups. However, no significant differences were found in either α-diversity (Shannon index) or β-diversity (ANOSIM: P＞0.05) (Fig. 2C and D). The subsequent analysis focused on identifying specific taxa with significant differences in abundance between the two groups, revealing notable changes in genera, including Escherichia–Shigella and Lactobacillus spp., with a significant increase in L. iners within the HDFI group (Fig. 2E and F). Relationship between seminal microbiota and level of DFI The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method identified differential bacteria at the genus level, highlighting enrichments of Peptostreptococcales–Tissierellales, Finegoldia spp., and Corynebacterium spp. in the LDFI group and Acinetobacter spp. in the HDFI group (Fig. 3A). Random forest analysis further pinpointed Finegoldia spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Lactobacillus spp. as significant contributors to the HDFI and LDFI group classifications (Fig. 3B). Through redundancy analysis, we identified key Lactobacillus spp. that correlated with the level of DFI (Fig. 3C). Subsequently, we compared the differences in various Lactobacillus species between HDFI and LDFI groups and found significant alterations in the distribution proportions of different Lactobacillus species, particularly L. iners (Fig. 3D). Additionally, L. iners was the most prevalent species in the HDFI group. Together, our results showed that microbial community structures were different between HDFI and LDFI groups.

Differential microbiota and KEGG pathways Functional analysis of the differential seminal microbiota revealed enrichment in 34 metabolic pathways (Fig. 4A), with the HDFI group showing significantly higher activity in pathways related to acetyl-CoA fermentation to butanoate II, cob(II)yrinate a,c-diamide biosynthesis I, ppGpp biosynthesis, and purine nucleobase degradation I (Fig. 4B through E). Differential microbiota in the LDFI group exhibited a pronounced enrichment in amino acid metabolism (Fig. 4F). Fig 4Functional alterations of the microbiota.

Semen microbiota alters sperm DFI by influencing metabolite composition Untargeted metabolomics analysis of seminal metabolomes from LDFI (n = 40) and HDFI (n = 47) patients identified significant alterations in metabolite profiles (Fig. 5A). A notable enrichment of 5,766 metabolites was found in HDFI samples (Fig. 5B), with a significant proportion being fatty acyls and carboxylic acids and derivatives (Fig. 5C). Further pathway analysis revealed that upregulated metabolites were significantly enriched in three KEGG pathways (Fig. 5D), whereas downregulated metabolites were associated with glutamatergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, and sphingolipid signaling pathways (Fig. 5E).

Integrated analysis of metabolites and microbiota demonstrated significant correlations, particularly between Lactobacillus spp. and specific unsaturated fatty acids, and negative correlations between Corynebacterium spp. and metabolites, including testolic acid, succinyladenosine, and 16-phenoxy tetranor prostaglandin E2, indicating a complex interaction between seminal microbiota and metabolite composition affecting sperm DFI (Fig. 6).
