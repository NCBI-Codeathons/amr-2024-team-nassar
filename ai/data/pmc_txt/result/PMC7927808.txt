RESULTS The lugdunin gene cluster includes 13 genes, many of which encode proteins of unknown functions. The recent identification of the lugdunin gene cluster comprising the biosynthetic lugABCD genes and the putative regulator lugR (8) prompted us to elucidate the boundaries of the cluster and identify additional genes potentially involved in lugdunin synthesis, export, regulation, and self-resistance. The cluster, plus some of the adjacent genes, has a significantly lower G+C content than the rest of the chromosome (26.7 versus 33.8%, respectively), and the region spanning lugH and lugR has even less than 24% G+C (Fig. 1a), suggesting that lugRABCD plus nine additional genes form the full gene cluster (Fig. 1b). lugD, coding for the starter unit in lugdunin biosynthesis, is flanked by the genes encoding LugT, a putative type II thioesterase that may repair stalled peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains (11), and LugZ, which is homologous to 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases and probably converts apo-PCP to the active holo-form by attachment of the 4-phosphopantetheine cofactor (11). Further downstream, probably forming a separate transcriptional unit, lugM encodes a putative monooxygenase, whose role in the biosynthesis process remains unclear.

Upstream of lugR, five genes (lugIEFGH) form another operon (Fig. 1b). LugI is predicted to encode a 79-amino-acid-long integral membrane protein with two transmembrane helices and no similarity to proteins of known function (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). LugE and LugG contain conserved Walker motifs probably representing the ATP-binding components of ABC transporter complexes (12). LugF and LugH are related to the integral membrane parts of putative ABC transporters of other Firmicutes, with LugF containing 6 and LugH 12 putative transmembrane segments (Fig. S1). According to the canonical architecture of ABC transporter complexes, the four proteins could form two distinct transporters, one as a LugEF homodimer and a second with a LugG homodimer linked to one LugH copy. Upstream of lugI, the gene lugJ is encoded in opposite direction, which may constitute a second regulator gene in addition to lugR. LugJ most likely belongs to the winged-helix type HTH-containing transcriptional regulators. Most antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters encode proteins conferring self-resistance to the producing strain. Usually, these are either antibiotic-insensitive variants of target proteins, enzymes for the modification of target structures (e.g., rRNAs), or antibiotic exporters (13). None of the genes in the lugdunin cluster seemed to reflect the first two types of self-resistance genes, while the putative ABC transporter genes were regarded as candidates for accomplishing lugdunin secretion and self-resistance and were analyzed further. ABC transporters encoded in the lug gene cluster mediate lugdunin release and confer resistance to lugdunin. To analyze a potential role of the ABC transporters in lugdunin export and self-resistance, different combinations of lugEFGH and the cotranscribed gene lugI were deleted in the lugdunin-producing strain S. lugdunensis IVK28. To avoid polar effects on downstream transcripts, an allelic replacement strategy with no insertion of foreign DNA fragments was used. When inhibition zones around spotted bacterial suspensions with identical diameters of the wild type and mutants on agar containing lugdunin-susceptible S. aureus cells were compared (Fig. 2a), the lugIEFGH mutant (ΔlugIEFGH) showed no inhibition, indicating that some or all of the five genes are required for lugdunin export. Deletion of only lugEFGH strongly reduced but did not abolish lugdunin release. The inhibitory distance was about 25% compared to the wild type (Fig. 2a), suggesting that LugI has a very modest but LugEFGH-independent role in lugdunin release. However, the sole inactivation of lugI caused no reduction in lugdunin release. Deletion of lugEF had a significant impact on the level of lugdunin export, which was almost as strong as in the ΔlugEFGH mutant, indicating that LugEF has a dominant role in lugdunin export. In contrast, the ΔlugGH mutant released even slightly larger amounts of lugdunin (about 38%) and exhibited a growth defect in liquid culture compared to the wild type (Fig. 2b), suggesting a role in resistance to lugdunin rather than export. Accordingly, the other lugGH-deficient mutant strains ΔlugEFGH and ΔlugIEFGH displayed similar growth defects (Fig. 2b).

To investigate the role of LugIEFGH in lugdunin self-resistance, several combinations of the genes were deleted in S. lugdunensis ΔlugD, which does not produce lugdunin (8), and the susceptibility of the resulting mutants to lugdunin was analyzed. Deletion of the entire gene set (lugIEFGH) strongly decreased the MIC to exogenous lugdunin from 10.5 μg/ml to 2.0 μg/ml, indicating that the genes are involved in producer self-resistance to lugdunin (Fig. 3a). Deletion of either lugEF or lugGH also led to reduced lugdunin MIC values, indicating that both ABC transporters play a role in lugdunin self-resistance. Deletion of lugI led to a decrease of the MIC to the identical level as the lugGH deletion. Deletion of lugEF, lugIEF, or lugIEFGH led to a stepwise MIC decrease to the lowest observed level. ΔlugEFGH, still expressing lugI, showed the same MIC level as the lugIEFGH mutant, indicating that although lugI deletion has an effect on the overall MIC level, LugI seems to rely on the presence of one of the transporters to modulate lugdunin self-resistance (Fig. 3a). The lugdunin MIC of the S. lugdunensis
lugEFGH deletion mutant was at the same level as those of a representative panel of nasal S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains (2.7 μg/ml on average; Fig. S2), suggesting that there is probably no additional self-resistance system involved.

To confirm the capacity of lugIEFGH to confer lugdunin resistance, the genes were cloned in different combinations in the pRB474 vector downstream of a constitutive promoter and introduced into S. aureus N315. lugGH expression led to a significantly increased lugdunin MIC (Fig. 3b), which confirms the important contribution of this subset of genes to lugdunin resistance. The additional expression of lugEF further raised the resistance of S. aureus to lugdunin, which supports the notion that full lugdunin resistance depends on the presence of all four ABC transporter genes. However, expression of lugEF alone did not cause a notable level of resistance. The presence of the entire operon lugIEFGH increased the lugdunin MIC to the highest observed level of 15.9 μg/ml, indicating that the small lugI also contributes to resistance. When lugI was expressed in combination with lugEF (pRB474-lugIEF), no increased MIC compared to lugEF expression alone was observed. In contrast, lugI expression with lugGH (pRB474-lugIGH) enhanced the MIC to the same level as lugEFGH expression, indicating that LugI might have a supporting effect with LugGH rather than with LugEF. Accordingly, the exclusive expression of lugI did not alter the susceptibility to lugdunin. The lugdunin MIC reached in S. aureus pRB474-lugIEFGH was identical to or even higher than that of S. lugdunensis IVK28, probably as a consequence of the high plasmid copy number (Fig. 3b). The resistance conferred by the ABC transporters LugIEFGH is largely specific for native lugdunin. While some ABC drug exporters have broad substrate specificities, others are highly selective for only certain compounds (14). The lugIEFGH genes were assessed for their capacity to protect S. aureus against lugdunin derivatives (see chemical structures 1 to 4 in Fig. S3) and other antimicrobial compounds to elucidate the transporters’ substrate range. The three derivatives enantio-lugdunin, 6-Trp-lugdunin, and 2-Ala-lugdunin were selected because they had similar activities as native lugdunin. 6-Trp-lugdunin was even slightly more active than native lugdunin. Since most other lugdunin derivatives showed no or only residual activity, we could include only the two active versions (9). The constitutive expression of LugIEFGH did not affect the susceptibility of S. aureus to the membrane-active cyclic peptide antibiotics daptomycin and gramicidin S, or to the small nonpeptide protonophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and nigericin, indicating that the resistance mechanism has a strict preference for the structure of lugdunin (Fig. 4a). LugIEFGH also conferred some degree of resistance to the lugdunin enantiomer (enantio-lugdunin), which has the same structure as regular lugdunin but an inverse d-/l-amino acid configuration (8, 9), albeit with a much lower efficacy as to native lugdunin. Similar, though even less pronounced, findings were obtained with 6-Trp-lugdunin, which contains a d-tryptophan at position 6 instead of a d-valine (9). In contrast, 2-Ala-lugdunin (d-alanine instead of d-valine at position 2) (9) had equal antimicrobial activity against S. aureus with or without LugIEFGH, implying that no resistance against the 2-Ala congener was conferred. Thus, LugIEFGH is largely specific for lugdunin in its native structure, and lugdunin alterations at position 2 are less well tolerated by the transporter than alterations at position 6.
