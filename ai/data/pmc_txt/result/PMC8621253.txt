2. Results Different experiments were designed to investigate the action of P. protegens on larvae of two common muscoid fly species, the housefly Musca domestica L. and the blow fly Lucilia caesar L. For this purpose, the recently isolated strain CO1, whose insecticidal properties against a wide range of pests was previously reported [9], was used. 2.1. Oral Toxicity To determine the ability of P. protegens to act in the gut of larvae after ingestion, insects were reared for 72 h on artificial diets incorporating different concentrations of bacterial cells. As a result, the bacterium was found to have a clear toxic action on both house fly and blow fly larvae, which confirms its ability to interact with gut barriers (i.e., peritrophic matrix, epithelium) and, eventually, cause a septicaemia. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, toxicity was concentration-dependent and a significant action with 100% mortality for the highest concentrations assayed, was achieved on both species after rearing larvae for 72 h in a treated diet (M. domestica: F3,132 = 760.74, p < 0.0001; L. caesar: F3,132 = 493.72, p < 0.0001). Significant increase in mortality was observed in samples exposed for a longer time to each assayed concentration (M. domestica: F2,132 = 258.85, p < 0.0001; L. caesar: F2,132 = 251.21, p < 0.0001). Based on the Probit analysis, M. domestica and L. caesar larvae appeared to have a similar susceptibility to P. protegens with an LC50 (CI) value of 3.6 (2.1–4.9) × 108 CFU/mL for M. domestica (Slope = 1.872 ± 0.19; χ2 = 14.16; df = 86) and 2.5 (1.1–4.1) × 108 CFU/mL for L. caesar (Slope = 2.804 ± 0.26; χ2 = 19.63; df = 86)). A bacterial septicaemia was observed in hemolymph samples collected from dead larvae and observed under a phase microscope. 2.2. Post-Injection Pathogenicity The pathogenicity of P. protegens strain CO1 was evaluated on M. domestica and L. caesar larvae by injecting two doses (high: 1000 CFU/larva; low: 100 CFU/larva) into their body and assessing their mortality during the next 48 h. As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, a significant increase in mortality percentage nearly reaching 100% in 48 h for both fly species, was observed in comparison with control larvae injected with PBS. Mortality was significantly affected by the injection dose (M. domestica: F2,47 = 469.65, p < 0.0001; L. caesar: F2,47 = 884.42, p < 0.0001), time after injection (M. domestica: F1,47 = 98.49, p < 0.0001; L. caesar: F1,47 = 171.00, p < 0.0001) and the interaction between these factors (M. domestica: F2,47 = 23.47, p < 0.0001; L. caesar: F2,47 = 65.05, p < 0.0001). In order to determine the ability of P. protegens to reproduce in the insect haemocoel, the time-course bacterial growth was determined in hemolymph samples collected from M. domestica larvae injected with 1000 CFU. A progressive and rapid increase in bacterial abundance in the larval body was observed at consecutive time intervals after injection, confirming the suitability of insect tissues for bacterial growth. A significant correlation between concentration and time was therefore observed (adjusted R2 = 0.5273, F = 44.5, p < 0.0001) (Figure 5). 2.3. In Vivo Expression of Bacterial Genes Based on the lethal effects observed in ingestion bioassays and on the ability of P. protegens to reproduce in the insect body, gene expression analyses were conducted to gain new knowledge about the mechanism of action enacted by the bacterium during the first phase of infection. For this purpose, relative time course expression of P. protegens genes associated with virulence and pathogenicity, was determined at the gut level during the first infection stage. Relative expression of selected target genes (chitinase D,
toxin HipA, toxin RelE, pesticin, cytotoxin FitD) at different time intervals (2, 6 and 12 h) after exposing house fly larvae to bacterial cells is shown in Figure 6. Target gene (F4,134 = 23.16, p < 0.0001), time after injecting the bacterial inoculum (F2,134 = 43.48, p < 0.0001), and the interaction of these two factors (F8,134 = 22.50, p < 0.0001), significantly affected gene expression level in the insect gut. A significant increase in the relative expression of these genes was observed over time, achieving a maximum at 12 h after exposure to the bacterium, (chiD: F3,29 = 56.35, p < 0.0001; hipA: F3,29 = 22.11, p < 0.0001; fitD: F3,29 = 61.90, p < 0.0001; relE: F3,29 = 38.37, p < 0.0001; pesticin: F3,29 = 49.28, p < 0.0001). Among target genes, chitinase D was the most expressed, followed by pesticin and fitD.
