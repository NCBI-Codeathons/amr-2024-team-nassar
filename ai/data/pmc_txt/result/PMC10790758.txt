RESULTS CcoN4 contributes to tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction in a cyanide-dependent manner Among the various types of terminal oxidases produced by P. aeruginosa, the cbb3 type is most important for growth under standard laboratory conditions and appears to be the only one that is produced constitutively (25–28). A minimal functional cbb3-type complex comprises two subunits, CcoN and CcoO; two additional and nonessential subunits, CcoP and CcoQ, have been implicated in assembly or electron transfer (29–31). Although cco genes (encoding cbb3-type oxidase subunits) are found in diverse bacteria, the P. aeruginosa genome is unusual in that it contains two complete and two partial cco operons (14, 19). The cco1 and cco2 operons lie adjacent to each other and are each sufficient to produce a full Cco complex (Fig. 1A and B); the ccoN3Q3 and ccoN4Q4 operons are found at independent locations in the genome and code for orphan subunits that can replace their corresponding subunits in Cco1 or Cco2 to produce hybrid complexes. A study conducted in P. aeruginosa PAO1 tested 16 possible isoforms of Cco, containing subunits encoded by different operons in distinct combinations, and demonstrated that they were all sufficient to support aerobic growth similar to that seen for the parent strain (19). However, several lines of evidence point to unique physiological roles for the CcoN4 subunit. Our prior work in P. aeruginosa PA14 has implicated ccoN4 in (i) phenazine reduction and fitness during biofilm growth and (ii) virulence in a C. elegans slow-kill assay (14). In addition, work by others has indicated that ccoN4 contributes specifically to resistance to exogenous cyanide (19, 20). These observations motivated us to test the contribution of CcoN4 to respiration in the presence of endogenously produced cyanide. To ask whether endogenous cyanide affects respiration via specific CcoN subunits, we used a TTC-based assay in which the colorless dye changes to red when reduced by cytochrome c oxidase-dependent respiration (32) (Fig. 2A). We examined TTC reduction in P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilms of single and combinatorial mutants lacking ccoN genes and/or the hcnABC operon (“hcn”), the latter of which is required for cyanide synthesis. We found that CcoN4 contributes to dye reduction in this assay, particularly in the ∆ccoN1/N2 background, as described previously (14). We also found that this contribution is dependent on the presence of hcnABC (Fig. 2A). This result is consistent with the prior observation, made in P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, that endogenous cyanide induces ccoN4Q4 expression (20). Paradoxically, the role of cyanide in ccoN4 induction appears to create a scenario where a respiratory toxin is necessary for substantial respiration in the ∆ccoN1/N2 background.

Endogenous cyanide boosts transcription of ccoN4 in P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilms Cyanide-dependent control of ccoN4Q4 expression has previously been characterized in P. aeruginosa PAO1 liquid cultures (19, 20). However, cyanide synthesis is regulated in response to cell density, and studies comparing PAO1 and PA14 have described strain-dependent differences in quorum-sensing controlled processes (33, 34). Furthermore, the condition dependence of cyanide production (10, 35) could affect its regulation in chemically heterogeneous biofilm subzones (10, 35). We, therefore, sought to directly examine the effect of endogenously produced cyanide on activity of the ccoN4 promoter in PA14 liquid cultures and biofilms. We created a reporter construct in which ccoN4’s putative promoter region drives expression of gfp (PccoN4-gfp) and moved it into a neutral chromosomal site in the WT and a ∆hcn mutant (36). Planktonic fluorescence assays indicate that ccoN4 transcription is induced at the end of the exponential growth phase and that it is not induced in the ∆hcn background (Fig. S1). This result is in line with measurements of PccoN4-lacZ reporter activity made by Hirai et al. (19). To examine the role of cyanide in ccoN4 expression in biofilms, we grew macrocolony biofilms for 3 days on 1% tryptone 1% agar medium, embedded them in paraffin, and prepared thin sections for microscopic imaging. We focused our analysis on the top 150 µm of the biofilm, which includes the transition from oxic to anoxic subzones (14), because the syntheses of cyanide and some terminal oxidases are O2 regulated (10, 26, 28). In the WT background, the ccoN4 transcriptional reporter showed high levels of expression across most of the biofilm depth, with a reproducible peak in expression at a depth of 40–50 µm (Fig. 2B). ccoN4 expression across depth was greatly reduced in the cyanide-null background. Finally, because cyanide is a volatile compound, cyanide-producing strains should be able to chemically complement cyanide-null mutants when they are grown in proximity. To test this, we grew WT and ∆hcn biofilms near, but not touching, ∆hcn PccoN4-gfp biofilms on an agar plate. We found that incubation of cyanide-null biofilms near WT (cyanide producing) biofilms was sufficient to activate ccoN4 expression (Fig. 2C). In sum, PA14 planktonic cultures and biofilms both show induction of ccoN4 expression by endogenous cyanide, with biofilms showing small but reproducible variations in expression across depth. MpaR is required for ccoN4 expression In P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, high induction by cyanide was observed not just for the ccoN4Q4 operon (ORFS PA4133-4134) but also the four genes upstream, which are ORFS PA4129-PA4132 (20). The chromosomal arrangement of the six corresponding genes in strain PA14 is shown in Fig. 1A. Transcriptional analyses indicate that the gene pairs nirA-PA14_10560 and PA14_10540-mpaR are each co-transcribed (23). nirA codes for a nitrite reductase (37), and PA14_10540 codes for an ortholog of CcoG, a cupric reductase involved in the assembly of cbb3-type oxidases (38). We were intrigued by the presence of mpaR, coding for a GntR-family transcriptional regulator, directly adjacent to ccoN4 because transcription factors are often encoded upstream of (one of) their targets. A recent RNAseq analysis using a P. aeruginosa PAO1 ∆mpaR mutant and a twofold cutoff showed that MpaR affects the expression of 275 genes and highlighted its integration into P. aeruginosa’s quorum-sensing network (Fig. S2) (39). The transcripts for ORFs PA4129-PA4134 (which includes ccoN4Q4) were among those that showed the largest decreases in abundance in ∆mpaR when compared to the WT. To directly test whether MpaR is required for ccoN4 expression in strain PA14, we created a markerless mpaR deletion (∆mpaR) and inserted the PccoN4-gfp reporter construct at a neutral chromosomal site. To test whether mpaR affects the expression of other cco genes, we also deleted mpaR in strains containing gfp reporter constructs for PccoN1 and PccoN2. Finally, to test whether Anr, an O2-sensitive transcription factor required for cco2 expression (28), is important for PccoN4 activity, we moved the PccoN4-gfp construct into the ∆anr background. We used these reporter strains to assess promoter activity during growth in liquid cultures and across depth in biofilms. We found that planktonic growth of the ∆mpaR strain is altered, relative to the WT, at the transition from exponential to stationary phase (Fig. 3A). In addition to genes that enhance cyanide resistance, the MpaR regulon includes genes that code for (i) primary metabolic and respiratory enzymes, (ii) proteins that contribute to cell density-dependent processes (i.e., quorum sensing), and (iii) sigma factors, all of which may influence exponential-to-stationary phase growth kinetics. Examining reporter fluorescence in liquid cultures, we further found that MpaR is required for expression of ccoN4 while its loss has minimal effect on cco1 expression and only a partial effect on the expression of cco2, which is a well-established target of Anr (26, 28, 40) (Fig. 3A). Complementing the mpaR deletion restored ccoN4 expression to WT levels (Fig. S3). These observations are consistent with RNAseq data from reference (39), in which the ccoN4 and ccoP2 transcripts were ~98-fold and ~2-fold, respectively, less abundant in a ∆mpaR mutant compared to its parent strain, P. aeruginosa PAO1 (39). Interestingly, in contrast to liquid culture, the loss of mpaR showed little to no effect on cco2 expression in biofilms (Fig. 3). Additionally, while we observed that deletion of anr does not affect ccoN4 expression in planktonic growth, it has a small downregulatory effect during biofilm growth which may arise from the fact that Anr promotes cyanogenesis (10). In both modes of growth, reporter data indicated that neither Anr nor MpaR contribute to cco1 expression, which is in line with prior studies (26). Finally, having observed that ccoN4 contributes to respiration in biofilms and that MpaR regulates this gene, we tested whether respiratory activity was altered in ∆mpaR biofilms relative to those formed by the WT. We found that mpaR was required for WT levels of TTC reduction specifically in the cyanide-producing background, consistent with its role in inducing ccoN4 (Fig. S4).

Identification of a palindromic motif required for ccoN4 expression We next sought to characterize features of the ccoN4 promoter that underpin MpaR-dependent expression. According to a genome-wide analysis carried out by Wurtzel et al., the transcription start site (TSS) for ccoN4 is 69 bp upstream of its start codon (Fig. 4A) (23). To identify regions of the ccoN4 promoter that are required for MpaR-dependent expression, we created a series of reporter constructs in which ccoN4 promoter sequences of varying length drove gfp expression. We found that shortening the promoter region from 263 to 138 bp decreased but did not abrogate gfp expression (Fig. 4B), indicating the involvement of additional factors that promote ccoN4 expression [in this context, a GC-rich sequence at positions 147 to 138 bp upstream of the start codon is noteworthy (39)]. However, further shortening the promoter length from 138 to 129 bp fully prevented expression of our gfp reporter (Fig. 4B) indicating that the 138–129-bp sequence is required for ccoN4 expression. Intriguingly, this stretch contains a short palindromic motif (ATCTGAT), which also appears in the promoter regions of the adjacent genes PA14_10540 and nirA—the two other targets in the vicinity that may also be under the control of MpaR (Fig. 4C) (39). We shuffled these seven base pairs (ATCTGAT to GATATCA) in the full-length promoter construct and found that they are required for gene expression (Fig. 4B).

All three contain the same short palindromic repeat 61–62 bp upstream of the TSS (highlighted in purple). Predicted −10 and −35 sites are underlined. Prior work had identified a GC-rich, putative MpaR-binding motif upstream of mvfR (pqsR), which codes for a global regulator of quorum sensing (39, 41). The GC-rich sequence at 147 to 138 bp upstream of the ccoN4 start codon, however, may contribute to but is not required for ccoN4 expression (Fig. S5). Identification of the binding motif in the mvfR promoter was carried out in vitro and with a truncated version of MpaR (39), which could contribute to differences we observed when examining MpaR-dependent PccoN4 activity in vivo. Although the GC-rich sequence in the ccoN4 promoter was not required for expression, we instead found that an adjacent palindromic (ATCTGAT) motif was required and, therefore, might constitute an alternate MpaR binding site. Constitutive mpaR expression reveals that cyanide is required for full MpaR function Transcriptomic studies have reported that (i) mpaR and its neighboring genes are simultaneously induced by cyanide and (ii) mpaR’s neighboring genes are downregulated in a ∆mpaR background (20, 39). To further characterize the effects of MpaR and cyanide, we deleted mpaR in the ∆hcn PccoN4-gfp background and found that the low level of ccoN4 expression observed in ∆hcn was eliminated (Fig. 5A). The abolishment of basal ccoN4 expression by mpaR deletion in ∆hcn hints at the possibility that MpaR has low cyanide-independent activity that is boosted by endogenous cyanide. Together, these observations also suggest two possible scenarios for the regulation of the MpaR/cyanide-controlled gene cluster. In one scenario, cyanide induces production of MpaR and MpaR, in turn, induces transcription of the rest of the gene cluster in a cyanide-independent manner. Alternatively, cyanide might activate MpaR (e.g., by stimulating a conformational change in the protein). To distinguish between these scenarios, we decoupled mpaR transcription from MpaR activity by cloning the mpaR gene after a synthetic constitutive promoter (42) and inserted this construct at the neutral glmS site in a ∆mpaR PccoN4-gfp background. Biofilms formed by this MpaR+ PccoN4-gfp strain show high levels of ccoN4 expression (Fig. 5B). Removing the capacity to produce cyanide in this strain brought fluorescence down to a level similar to that observed for ∆hcn PccoN4-gfp (Fig. 5B). These results show that cyanide is directly required for full expression of ccoN4. Fig 5Endogenous cyanide is required for MpaR-driven expression of ccoN4.

Autoregulation of the PA14_10540-mpaR operon Prior transcriptomic analysis carried out by Wurtzel et al. reveals the TSS for PA14_10540 and indicates that PA14_10540 and mpaR form a transcriptional unit (Fig. 6A) (23). The region upstream of the PA14_10540 TSS contains a palindromic ATGNCAT motif (Fig. 4C), which would suggest control by MpaR (Fig. 4B) [we note that this experimentally determined TSS is located within the predicted ORF, whose start site may therefore be misannotated in The Pseudomonas Genome Database and BioCyc (43, 44)]. To test the requirement of MpaR for PA14_10540 expression, we made a reporter construct (PPA14_10540-gfp) containing sequence spanning from 396 bp upstream to 30 bp downstream of the experimentally identified transcription start site (PA14 genomic locus: 908280) (23) (Fig. 6A). When grown as liquid cultures or biofilms, the PPA14_10540 reporter strain showed high expression that was eliminated by mpaR deletion (Fig. 6B and C). Examining the effect of the ∆hcn mutation on these reporters, we found that the PPA14_10540 reporter produced an intermediate level of cyanide-independent fluorescence (Fig. 6B and C). These results indicate that the PA14_10540-mpaR operon is autoregulated by MpaR and that it is expressed at low levels in the absence of cyanide and at high levels during cyanogenesis.

Point-mutant phenotypes suggest that MpaR is activated by binding of pyridoxal phosphate or a related cofactor MpaR is a GntR family regulator with an N-terminal, DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain and a C-terminal domain that bears homology to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferases (Fig. 7A) (45). We hypothesized that binding of PLP or a similar cofactor could affect MpaR function and examined the structures of PLP-binding proteins that had been co-crystallized with PLP to identify conserved features. PLP-binding pockets contain a conserved lysine residue that covalently binds PLP as a Schiff base and a semi-conserved tyrosine whose ring coordinates the ring of PLP (46, 47). Using an MpaR structure predicted by Alphafold (Fig. 7B) (48, 49), we identified the corresponding residues in the putative PLP binding site: K314 and Y284 (Fig. 7C, shown overlaid with solved PLP-bound structure PDB: 2Z1Z). We then created strains in which each of these two residues were changed to alanines, in the PccoN4-gfp reporter background. We found that the K314A mutation rendered PccoN4-gfp activity undetectable, while a low level of PccoN4-gfp activity remained in the Y284A mutant background (Fig. 7D). We also performed mass spectrometry analysis on extracts prepared from biofilms grown under the same conditions and found that these showed decreased abundances of MpaR mutant proteins (Fig. S7), consistent with the role of MpaR in regulating PA14_10540-mpaR (Fig. 6). MpaR’s PLP-dependent transferase domain is fold type I, and these domains generally bind PLP as homodimers with the active sites brought together (45, 50). Binding of PLP or a related cofactor may cause MpaR to dimerize in a way that promotes its activity as a transcription factor.

MpaR and CcoN4 mitigate the effects of endogenous cyanide on biofilm development The responses of mpaR and ccoN4 to endogenous cyanide production in biofilms raised the question of whether these genes play roles in biofilm development. We first tested the mpaR deletion for effects on biofilm development using a colony morphology assay (51). We observed that ∆mpaR biofilms exhibit a hyperwrinkled phenotype with a distinctive inner ring (Fig. 8A). In addition, we used thin-section images of biofilms grown on dye-free media to measure biofilm thicknesses and found that ∆mpaR biofilms consistently measured approximately ~35 µm thinner than their WT counterparts; ∆ccoN4 biofilms also showed a thinner phenotype, measuring ~25 µm thinner than those formed by the WT (Fig. 8B). Although alterations in phenazine production can affect colony biofilm morphogenesis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of phenazines produced by ∆mpaR biofilms showed only subtle changes relative to WT biofilms (Fig. S6), suggesting that ∆mpaR biofilm development phenotypes arise from other effects. Indeed, deletion of the hcnABC operon in the ∆mpaR and ∆ccoN4 backgrounds yielded colony biofilms that more closely resembled WT and increased the thicknesses of biofilms formed by ∆mpaR, ∆ccoN4, and even the WT (Fig. 8B; Fig. S8). These results indicate that stress arising from the loss of MpaR and CcoN4 can be directly mitigated by removing stress caused by cyanide.
