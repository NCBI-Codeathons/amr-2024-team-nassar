Results The strobilurin BGC Strobilurins have been reported mainly as products of Basidiomycete fungi such as Strobilurus tenacellus, but one apparent Ascomycete, Bolinea lutea, is also reported as a producer of a range of strobilurins and related compounds such as bolineol 88. In our hands S. tenacellus produced strobilurin A 1 (typically 30 mg L−1 under optimised conditions), B 6 and G 7, and B. lutea F235237 reliably produced strobilurin B 6 (ca 1 mg L−1) in shake-flask culture. We sequenced the genomes of each organism to produce draft genomes using standard Illumina paired-end methodology (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 1–3). The S. tenacellus assembly produced a draft genome of 40.5 Mb with an N50 of 121.3 kb, while the B. lutea genome had a total size of 42.6 Mb and an N50 of 63.5 kb. The data are consistent with a conclusion that the organism previously known as B. lutea is, in fact, a Basidiomycete, and sequence analysis of its internal transcribed spacer sequence showed it to be most likely a previously unreported member of the Strobilurus family (Supplementary Figure 8). We thus rename it Strobilurus lutea. Since fungal BGCs are usually relatively compact (often <50 kb) the assemblies were considered sufficient to search for genes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of 1 and its derivatives. Anti-SMASH software13 identified two potential PKS-encoding BGCs in each genome (Supplementary Figure 6). The first of these encodes the expected type I iterative PKS typical of fungi12, and nearby are genes predicted to encode proteins involved in phenylalanine metabolism (for example, a phenylalanine ammonia lyase, PAL), methylation and redox reactions. The second cluster in each fungus lacks these types of genes and was not considered further. Our initial analysis showed that the S. lutea BGC is contained on one scaffold (SL-298) of 106 kb. In contrast, the homologous PKS cluster in S. tenacellus is located on a smaller scaffold of only 30 kb (ST-273), suggesting that although this scaffold aligns well with the S. lutea cluster it may only represent a partial cluster. Data from the longer SL-298 scaffold was then used to search the S. tenacellus data for the missing genes and scaffold-195 (ST-195, ca 145 kb) was identified as containing a number of homologues. Oligonucleotide primers designed based on the terminal sequences of ST-195 and ST-273 were used in a PCR reaction with S. tenacellus genomic DNA as the template and this yielded a ca 4 kb product, which was sequenced. The sequence closed the gap between ST-273 and ST-195 demonstrating that these two scaffolds are genuinely adjacent genomic loci and represent separate parts of the same gene cluster. The total size of the combined S. tenecellus scaffold was 179.2 kb (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Map of the strobilurin biosynthetic gene clusters in S. tenacellus and S. lutea. a Annotated ca 47 kb biosynthetic gene clusters contained in the S. tenacellus and S. lutea genomes (not to scale); b domain structure of known fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases.

However, using predominantly manual methods, a total of 62 potential protein-encoding genes were identified and annotated between the overlapping scaffolds (Supplementary Table 5). In order to further clarify the data, Illumina transcriptome sequencing was performed using mRNA purified from S. tenacellus under strobilurin-producing conditions (Supplementary Figure 7). This refined the procedure of annotating the genes by confirming the transcriptional start and stop positions and the precise positions of introns, allowing correct coding sequences to be determined. Relative to the PKS, genes located downstream of the PKS are denoted l (left) and genes upstream are denoted r (right), and genes of S. tenacellus are denoted st, while genes of S. lutea are denoted sl. Thus, the gene slr11 is the eleventh identified gene to the right of the S. lutea PKS, and it encodes a PAL (Table 1).Table 1Detected genes located adjacent to pks1

We therefore set the approximate cluster boundaries as stl2 downstream of the PKS and str11 upstream of the PKS, defining a ca 47 kb sequence for more detailed analysis. Resistance to strobilurins is known to be mediated by mutations in mitochondrial cytochrome b (encoded by CYTB)14,15. Whilst no homologues of CYTB were found within the cluster, or on the larger ST-195/273 or SL-298 scaffolds, we note that the mitochondrial CYTB shows motifs characteristic of being strobilurin resistant (see Supplementary Methods). The PKS itself is encoded by a single large multi-exon coding sequence. Initial examination showed this to contain keto-synthase, acyl-transferase (AT), dehydratase (DH), C-methyltransferase (C-MeT), enoyl-reductase (ER), keto-reductase (KR) and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains, showing that it belongs to the fungal highly reducing class of PKS (hr-PKS, Fig. 2b)12. Very unusually, the ACP is followed by a partial αβ-hydrolase domain closely related to the first 100 residues of the C-terminal thiolesterase (TE) of mammalian fatty acid synthase (mFAS, 33% identical, 57% similar). This peptide sequence contains the conserved serine nucleophile (S2240) but not the cognate aspartate and histidine required by αβ-hydrolases. This sequence is followed by ca 300 residues with no significant sequence or structural homology to any known protein, although there is homology to predicted hr-PKS from other Basidiomycetes such as Stereum hirsutum (XP_007303267.1) and Gloeophyllum trabeum (XP_007863729.1, 37–41% identity, 57–61% similarity). The final 220 residues are homologous to SAM-dependent C-methyltransferases, including the CurJ C-MeT from curacin biosynthesis (32% identical, 48% similar)16. Detailed protein sequence comparisons with mFAS, the squalestatin tetraketide synthase (SQTKS)17 and tenellin synthetase (TENS)18 suggested that the C-MeT domain located between the DH and KR domains is probably inactive due to mutations in the SAM-binding motif, as is the ER, which is more similar to the inactive ER domain of TENS (Supplementary Figures 10–11). However, sequence analysis suggested that the C-terminal C-MeT domain is likely to be active, as the SAM-binding site appears to be intact. The presence of all these domains as a single peptide was confirmed from the transcriptome data that showed a single transcript encoding the entire 306 kDa protein (Supplementary Figure 12). Other genes were functionally annotated by extensive manual comparisons to known genes from fungi, and while tentative functions could be proposed for most translated proteins, the roles of the r1 and l1 gene products remain enigmatic. A hydrolytic function encoded by slr5 as a single putative gene in the S. lutea genome appears to be formed as a fusion of two separate hydrolases encoded by str5 and str6 in the S. tenacellus genome. However, all other genes are encoded in the same relative positions and orientations in each cluster. Heterologous expression of early pathway genes We investigated expression of key genes from the cluster in A. oryzae19. Since the PKS is predicted to contain 28 introns, and the Ascomycete A. oryzae is unlikely to process all of these correctly20, we amplified intron-free fragments of stpks1 from cDNA, and reconstructed the entire 8.5 kb coding region of the PKS using recombination in yeast. The recombined intron-free stpks1 was cloned into the fungal expression vector pTYGS-Arg21, which was, in turn, transformed into A. oryzae strain NSAR1, which harbours four auxotrophic lesions on its genome allowing the introduction of up to four DNA fragments in parallel22–24. The pTYGS vector contains an argB gene, which complements one of the auxotrophies, allowing selection on minimal media with appropriate supplements. The cloned gene of interest is expressed under the control of the amyB promoter (PamyB), which is induced, by starch and maltose25. In initial experiments, expression of stpks1 alone in A. oryzae led to no significant changes in the metabolite profiles of transformed vs. untransformed strains (Table 2, expt 1). However, since benzoyl CoA is likely to be the starter unit for the biosynthesis of the expected strobilurin polyketide, and it is unknown whether A. oryzae can make this intermediate, we then supplemented fermentations with either benzoic acid or the N-acetyl cysteamine thiolester of benzoic acid (benzoyl SNAC 9)26, which is a benzoyl CoA mimic. In these experiments a new compound 11 was produced in the presence of benzoyl SNAC 9 (Fig. 3a), but not benzoic acid 10 (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figures 31–33) or in its absence (Fig. 3c) or in the control (Fig. 3d).Table 2Summary of heterologous expression experiments in A. oryzae designed to probe the biosynthesis of 1Construct

StPKS1 accepts benzoyl SNAC but not benzoic acid. Summary of 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data Analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) showed that the new compound 11 had a mass (m/z 215 [M]H+) consistent with a methylated tetraketide. The compound was isolated as a yellow powder (20 mg L−1). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, 213.0915, [M-H]−) confirmed the molecular formula as C14H13O2 (calc. 213.0916). The structure was solved by analysis of one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Figure 34) that showed the presence of a monosubstituted benzene, two separate alkene spin systems with three and two protons respectively and a vinylic methyl group. Heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) analysis showed the structure to be the triene 11, and observation of nOe between H-3 and H-6 suggested the Z-configuration of the central olefin. The other two olefins were determined to be E from large vicinal coupling constants (ca 15.4 Hz). The structure and triene geometry was confirmed by total synthesis (Fig. 4). Briefly, the phenyl pyrone 1227 was reduced to the unsaturated lactone 13 that was then ring-opened by elimination to give the E,Z triketide 14. Activation to the mixed anhydride/carbonate and reduction at low temperature gave the expected primary alcohol 15, which was oxidised to the corresponding aldehyde and subjected to Horner Wadsworth Emmons homologation. The resulting E,Z,E triene methyl ester was hydrolysed to give the corresponding tetraketide acid 11, which was identical (LCMS and NMR analysis, supplementary figure 34) to the material isolated from A. oryzae. Since this compound appears to be the first isolable intermediate in strobilurin biosynthesis we name it prestrobilurin A.Fig. 4Total synthesis of prestrobilurin A 11.

RT room temperature The apparent inability of A. oryzae to produce benzoyl CoA 16, or convert benzoic acid 10 to benzoyl CoA 16 then allowed us to probe the biosynthesis of this starter unit by using the PKS as a reporter for its presence. A second series of vectors was therefore constructed exploiting the adenine auxotrophy of A. oryzae NSAR1 and which contained combinations of str10, str8 and str11, which encode a CoA ligase, a non-haem iron oxygenase and a PAL respectively (see Supplementary Methods). Co-expression of stpks1 with str10 in A. oryzae (Table 2, expt 4) once again did not produce any new compounds, but feeding benzoic acid 10 to the fermentation resulted in the restoration of prestrobilurin A 11 production (Table 2, expt 5). Next, stpks1 was co-expressed with str10 and str8 and again, in the absence of feeding this did not produce 11 (Table 2, expt 6). However, supplementation of either cinnamic acid 17 (Table 2, expt 8) or benzoic acid 10 (Table 2, expt 9), restored production of 11 (see supplementary methods). Finally, the stpks1, str10, str8 and str11 genes were co-expressed (Table 2, expt 10). In this case prestrobilurin A 11 was produced without the need to add intermediates, presumably because the PAL can convert endogenous phenylalanine 18 to cinnamate 17 (Fig. 5). Thus, the plasmid pTYGS-Ade str8 + str10 + str11 acts as an effective source of in vivo benzoyl CoA.Fig. 5Deduced biosynthetic pathway to benzoyl CoA in S. tenacellus. The pathway converts phenylalanine 18 to benzoyl CoA 16, which is then the substrate for StPKS1 to give prestrobilurin A 11 Fig. 5Deduced biosynthetic pathway to benzoyl CoA in S. tenacellus. The pathway converts phenylalanine 18 to benzoyl CoA 16, which is then the substrate for StPKS1 to give prestrobilurin A 11 Deduced biosynthetic pathway to benzoyl CoA in S. tenacellus. The pathway converts phenylalanine 18 to benzoyl CoA 16, which is then the substrate for StPKS1 to give prestrobilurin A 11 Heterologous expression of later pathway genes In order to investigate the later steps of strobilurin biosynthesis, additional genes were cloned into A. oryzae expression vectors (see supplementary methods). We reasoned that str2 and str3, which encode SAM-dependent methyltransferases, are probably responsible for the addition of the two O-methyl groups of 1. Oxidative rearrangement of 11 is required to create the skeleton of 1 and this may be achieved by either the glucose-methane-choline oxidase (GMCO) encoded by str4 or the flavin-dependent oxidase (FDO) encoded by str9. Finally, production of bolineol 8, observed in S. lutea, requires a reduction that may be achieved by the short-chain dehydrogenase (SDR) encoded by stl2. In an initial heterologous experiment the full complement of genes, including the benzoyl CoA-production system (str8, str10 and str11), were transferred to A. oryzae (Table 2, expt 11). This resulted in production of 11 and 1 (retention time [Rt] 8.4 min, 2.6 mg L−1, Fig. 6a) that was isolated and identified by full NMR analysis (Supplementary Figures 35–39). A new compound (Rt = 7.1 min, C13H15O2 [M + H]+ calc. 203.1072, measured 203.1071, Fig. 6a) was also isolated (90 mg L−1) and purified and shown to be the 5E,3Z carboxymethyldiene 21, which has been previously synthesised during the total synthesis of strobilurin A 1 (Fig. 7)28. Bolineol 8 was detected to coelute with 21 by its distinctive [M + H]+ (247.1) and [M + Na]+ (269.2) ions.Fig. 6LCMS evaporative light-scattering (ELS) chromatograms of organic extracts of A. oryzae NSAR1 expression strains (arbitrary units). a

Omission of the FDO encoded by str9 (Table 2, expt 13, Fig. 6c) led to the production of only prestrobilurin A 11. The same result was achieved if the benzoate genes were omitted and the fermentation was supplemented with benzoyl SNAC 9 (Table 2, expt 14, Fig. 6d), although 11 is produced in much lower titre in this case. Next, the methyltransferases and GMCO were omitted (Table 2, expt 15, Fig. 6e). This led to the formation of 21, and also a new compound 22 (Rt 5.9 min, 30 mg L−1), which was shown to be C14H16O3 ([M-H]− calc. 231.1021, measured 231.1021) by HRMS (Fig. 7). Isolation and full structure determination by NMR (Supplementary Figures 42–43) confirmed the new compound 22 to be desmethylbolineol. Desmethylbolineol 22 was smoothly converted to bolineol 8 by treatment with trimethylsilyldiazomethane29 and the spectroscopic data were shown to be identical. Further omission of the SDR (Table 2, expt 16, Fig. 6f) gave the same result, showing that formation of 22 does not require the SDR and must represent a shunt pathway in A. oryzae in the absence of the late-acting methyltransferases. Omission of the GMCO and SDR (Table 2, expt 17, Fig. 6g) resulted in extremely unhealthy A. oryzae cultures, which were difficult to select and grow (Supplementary Figure 55). Extraction of these cultures revealed the formation of bolineol 8 as the major compound, together with lesser amounts of 21 and 22. Strobilurin A 1 was detected by its distinctive mass spectrum, but in very low titre. Reinclusion of the SDR (Table 2, expt 18, Fig. 6h) produced 8 only, with no production of 1. No compounds were produced in the control experiment (Fig. 6i). Finally, str9 was codon-optimised and expressed in Escherichia coli in N-terminal his-tagged form and purified in soluble form. The holo-protein, containing the FAD cofactor (verified by ultraviolet spectroscopy), was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Initial in vitro assays using purified prestrobilurin 11, purified Str9 and NAD(P)H in various buffers in air were performed, but no oxidised and rearranged product 26 could be observed by LCMS analysis. We reasoned that this was most likely due to the observed insolubility of 11 in the aqueous buffer system. However, use of a system containing a high ethanol concentration, was more successful and a product corresponding to 26 was clearly observed by LCMS (Supplementary Figure 53).
