Results Comparison of the Caf1 antigen sequence heterogeneity Sequencing of caf1 genes from 119 Y. pestis strains belonging to different biovars within subsp. microtus showed that the Caf1 proteins possess three isoforms, the global allele type NT1 (Ala48 Phe117), NT2 type (Ser48 Phe117) peculiar to Transcaucasian highland and Pre-Araks natural plague foci, and a novel NT3 type (Ala48 Val117) endemic for Dagestan-highland natural plague focus. Fig 1 represents the results of multiple sequence alignment of Caf1 isoforms analyzed in this study and shows that the Caf1NT2 found in Transcaucasian highland and Pre-Araks natural plague foci is different from the major allele isoform Caf1NT1 by having an Ala48→Ser48 substitution, whereas Caf1NT3 protein isolated from the Dagestan-highland natural plague focus has a Phe117→Val117 substitution. 10.1371/journal.pone.0162308.g001Fig 1Multiple sequence alignment of the isoforms of Caf1 protein found in different Y. pestis strains. Multiple sequence alignment of the isoforms of Caf1 protein found in different Y. pestis strains. Intrinsic disorder To understand if found Caf1 polymorphism has an effect on structural and functional properties of this protein, we evaluated the disorder propensities of Caf1NT1, Caf1NT2, and Caf1NT3 isoforms and analyzed the effect of corresponding amino acid substitutions on potential disorder-based binding sites. Results of these analyses are summarized in Fig 2 that compares the disorder profiles obtained for the Caf1 isoforms by PONDR® VSL2 (Fig 2A), PONDR-FIT (Fig 2A) and PONDR® VLXT algorithms (Fig 2B). This analysis revealed that, although Caf1 is predicted to be mostly ordered protein, it has several disordered regions. Curiously, both substitutions found in Caf1 (the Ala48→Ser48 in Caf1NT2 and the Phe117→Val117 in Caf1NT3) cause noticeable increase in the local intrinsic disorder propensity of the short regions surrounding the corresponding substitutions. Importantly, Fig 2 clearly shows that although the effects of these substitutions on the intrinsic disorder propensities of the Caf1 isoforms are not very strong, there is a reasonable agreement between the results obtained by the three computational tools. 10.1371/journal.pone.0162308.g002Fig 2Evaluating intrinsic disorder propensities of different Caf1 isoforms.(A) Disorder profiles obtained for the analyzed proteins by PONDR® VSL2 (Caf1NT1 (dashed dark yellow line), Caf1NT2 (solid gray line), and Caf1NT3 (dotted dark red line)) and PONDR-FIT (Caf1NT1 (dashed yellow line), Caf1NT2 (solid black line), and Caf1NT3 (dotted red line)). Disorder scores above 0.5 correspond to the residues/regions predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Colored shades around the corresponding PONDR-FIT curves represent distributions of errors in evaluation of disorder propensity. (B) Comparison of the disorder profiles obtained for Caf1 isoforms by PONDR VLXT (Caf1NT1 (dashed dark yellow line), Caf1NT2 (solid gray line), and Caf1NT3 (dotted dark red line)) and their intrinsic disorder-based interactability (Caf1NT1 (dashed yellow line), Caf1NT2 (solid black line), and Caf1NT3 (dotted red line)) predicted using the ANCHOR algorithm [51, 52]. To simplify comparison of disorder predisposition and presence of potential disorder-based binding sites, ANCHOR data are present in the (1 –ANCHOR score form). Therefore, in PONDR® VLXT profiles, regions with scores above 0.5 are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, whereas in the ANCHOR profiles, regions with probability below 0.5 are predicted as binding regions.

Therefore, in PONDR® VLXT profiles, regions with scores above 0.5 are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, whereas in the ANCHOR profiles, regions with probability below 0.5 are predicted as binding regions. Next, we evaluated the presence of potential disorder-based binding regions in various Caf1 isoforms using the ANCHOR algorithm [51, 52] that utilizes the following criteria: (i) residues of potential disorder-based region belong to a long disordered segment and are not a part of a globular domain; (ii) residues of such a region are not able to form enough favorable contacts with its own local sequential neighbors to fold; (iii) these potential binding residues can form enough favorable interactions with globular proteins upon binding [51, 52]. This algorithm also filters out potential disorder-based regions shorter than six residues. Fig 2B represents the results of this analysis and shows that the Caf1NT1 and Caf1NT2 have a very short potential binding site (region 140–142) which was filtered out by the algorithm because of its small size. On the other hand, the Phe117→Val117 substitution found in Caf1NT3 causes an extension of this site to 4 residues (140–144). Since this length is below the length threshold utilized by ANCHOR algorithm, this potential binding site was also filtered out. Fig 2B also shows that there is some delocalization in the effects of the Phe117→Val117 substitution on the disorder propensity and on the disorder-based binding potential. Isolation and purification of Caf1 isoforms Hydrophobic chromatography allowed for isolation of highly purified Caf1NT1 Caf1NT2 isoforms as peaks at 350 mM of the ammonium sulphate gradient, while the Caf1NT3 elution was spread between 600 and 50 mM under the same elution conditions. Serologic cross-reactivity Serologic cross-reactivity has been tested by both immunochromatography and ELISA techniques. The detection limit of immunochromatography was 1.0 ng/mL with the range of 1.0 ng-1.0 μg/mL. Results obtained were identical for all the three isoforms, indicating that all of them could be readily detected by the antibody used in this method. Fig 3 shows that, after both steps of immunization, the antibody titers estimated by ELISA were 4–7 times higher in the animals immunized by the Caf1NT1 isoform, regardless of the antigen adsorbed on the plates. The antibody response to immunization with Caf1NT3 isoform was the lowest. All the three isoforms absorbed to the plastic were recognized by the sera of immunized animals. 10.1371/journal.pone.0162308.g003Fig 3Caf1 isoform cross-reactivity.Mice were immunized with NT1 (blue bars), NT2 (red bars) or NT3 (green bars) and then bled on day 29 after first (I) or day 43 after second immunization (II) and sera samples were tested in ELISA against NT1, NT2 or NT3 isoforms.

Mice were immunized with NT1 (blue bars), NT2 (red bars) or NT3 (green bars) and then bled on day 29 after first (I) or day 43 after second immunization (II) and sera samples were tested in ELISA against NT1, NT2 or NT3 isoforms. Data are means ±SEM. Interestingly, the booster immunizations resulted in a somewhat lower antibody response. Cross-protection The results of cross-protection testing are shown in Fig 4 and Table 2. Since the strain 231 was significantly more virulent than the strains C-376 and C-824, the animals were given equal numbers of corresponding LD50. The NT1 isoform that has been traditionally used in commercial and experimental vaccines proved to be the most protective one. This isoform was 100% protective in mice challenged with 2000 LD50 of the strain 231 (100%), 85% when C-376 strain was used, and 40% mice were protected when infected with the C-824 strain (Fig 4). Thus, immunization with NT1 isoform partly protected against infection induced by NT1 and NT2 carriers even at a high dose. Vaccination with NT2 protected from infection induced by NT2 and NT3, but was less effective against NT1 carriers. At the dose equal to 20 LD50 of any of the three strains tested, all animals vaccinated with Caf1NT1 survived. This data suggests that vaccination with the NT1 isoform of Caf1 provides a better protection against all the three Y. pestis variants. All the vehicle-treated mice died within a week after infection regardless of the bacterial stain (data not shown). 10.1371/journal.pone.0162308.g004Fig 4Survival of immunized mice in response to bacterial challenge.Groups of 8 BALB/c mice that were immunized with Caf1NT1 (A, D), Caf1NT2 (B, E), or Caf1NT3 (C, F) isoforms were challenged with Y. pestis strains producing different Caf1 isoforms: Caf1NT1 (circles); Caf1NT2 (squares); or Caf1NT3 (triangles)), at high (2000 LD50, panels A-C), or low (200 LD50, panels D-F) doses.

Vaccination with the Caf1NT1 isoform produced a level of protection that exceeded 5334 times that of control (vehicle-treated) mice. The other two isoforms were less potent resulting in only a 1264- to 2000-fold increase in self-resistance. Thus, calculated indices of immunity are in agreement with the data obtained from the survival curves, suggesting that Caf1NT1 vaccination is superior compared to the other two isoforms.
