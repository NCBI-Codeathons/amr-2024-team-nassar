Results Salinispora tropica has antimicrobial activity on a diverse range of marine phototrophs Unlike other heterotrophs, which usually enhance the growth of phototrophic organisms when in co‐culture (e.g. Christie‐Oleza et al., 2017; Sher et al., 2011), S. tropica showed a clear antimicrobial activity on marine phytoplankton (Fig. 1A). All three phototrophic model species tested, namely the cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. WH7803, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, showed a strong decline in the presence of S. tropica, being especially remarkable for the two former strains (Fig. 1A). While also affected, the diatom P. tricornutum was not killed by S. tropica but, instead, its cells densities were significantly maintained one order of magnitude lower than when incubated axenically. While we were able to monitor the inhibition of the phototroph, we were unable to assess the growth profile of S. tropica in the co‐culture due to its growth in dense cell aggregates preventing traditional monitoring techniques (e.g. optical density, colony‐forming unit or flow cytometry).

Photographs of representative cultures of three biological replicates are shown, 7 days after inoculation. Red pigmentation is characteristic of healthy Synechococcus cells, while cell bleaching indicates cell death. We were therefore interested in characterizing the nature of this inhibition. While members of other Salinispora species, such as Salinispora arenicola, are known to biosynthesize antibiotic molecules (Asolkar et al., 2010), no antimicrobial compound has yet been characterized in S. tropica CNB‐440. Previous studies have shown, however, that S. tropica is able to outcompete other heterotrophs in co‐culture by secreting siderophores leading to iron depletion (Patin et al., 2016). To evaluate whether iron sequestration could explain the negative interactions observed in the present phototroph‐Salinispora system, we supplemented the co‐cultures with increasing concentrations of iron (Fig. S1). The results obtained suggest that the antimicrobial phenotype was not due to siderophore activity, as saturating amounts of iron could not rescue the growth of the phototrophs. We then hypothesized that a yet unknown antimicrobial compound, to which our photosynthetic microorganisms are sensitive to, could be produced by S. tropica. To test this assumption, we set up co‐cultures in which the S. tropica and Synechococcus strains were physically separated by a porous filter, preventing direct cell to cell interactions while allowing the diffusion of small molecules (Fig. 1B). S. tropica was still able to impair Synechococcus proliferation in these experimental conditions, confirming that a secreted molecule was causing the death of the phototroph. Phototrophs elicit the production of novel cryptic metabolites in S. tropica We analysed the co‐culture supernatants using non‐targeted metabolomics to identify the pool of secondary metabolites secreted by S. tropica in response to the different phototrophs. The Synechococcus‐S. tropica co‐culture revealed eight molecular ions that were not present in the respective axenic cultures (Fig. 2A). These molecules were further characterized by high‐resolution MS/MS analysis, from which we generated empirical chemical formulae, allowing us to assign most of them to two subgroups of related compounds being: (i) ions 1, 2, 5 and 8; and (ii) ions 4, 6 and 7 (Fig. 2A; Table S1).

SUPSYN is equivalent to the ‘Synechococcus Axenic’ condition in panel A; cryptic metabolites were only detected after S. tropica incubation. Ions 1, 2, 5 and 8 were derivatives of salinosporamide; a well‐characterized molecule produced by S. tropica that presents a unique fused γ‐lactam‐β‐lactone bicyclic ring structure (Feling et al., 2003), and that is now being tested as a drug because of its anti‐cancer properties. Molecules 5 and 8 are consistent with known degradation products of salinosporamide A and B, respectively (Denora et al., 2007; Fig. S2), while molecules 1 and 2 are proposed to result from the nucleophilic addition of Tris (the buffering agent used in the ASW culture medium) to the lactone ring of salinosporamide A and B, respectively (Fig. S2). These salinosporamide sub‐products were further confirmed by their absence when (i) Tris was not added (Fig. S3), or (ii) salinosporamide mutants that no longer produced these metabolites, that is salA‐ and salL‐ (Eustáquio et al., 2009), were used (Fig. S4). In order to test the activity of salinosporamide and its derivatives on the phototrophs, we co‐cultured Synechococcus with both salinosporamide mutants. Salinosporamide and its derivatives were not responsible for the antimicrobial activity as both deficient mutants were still able to inhibit the phototroph (Fig. S5). The second group of ions, that is peaks 4, 6 and 7, were also related. Molecule 6 gave a m/z value of 435.2609 [M + H]+; based on the accuracy of this value and the isotopic pattern the empirical chemical formula C22H35N4O5 was predicted by the DataAnalysis software (Table 2). The predicted formula for molecule 4 suggests that, with a 28.9900 Da mass difference when compared to 6, the compound had lost one hydrogen and gained an atom of nitrogen and oxygen. MS/MS analyses confirmed that both molecules 4 and 6 had an identical molecular fragment (i.e. m/z 276.1600 ± 0.0001 [M + H]+, with the empirical chemical formula C16H22NO3), indicating that the two molecules share a core backbone (Table 2; Fig. S6, S7). Similarly, molecule 7 had the same chemical formula as 6 but with the addition of a methyl group (14.0155 Da mass difference; Table 2). Finally, MS/MS fragmentation of the three molecules 4, 6 and 7 resulted in the related molecular fragments m/z 171.088, 142.0979 and 156.1135, respectively, which showed differences in masses and empirical formulae identical to that observed between their corresponding parent ions (Table 2; Fig. S6, S7). Molecule 3 did not share an obvious link to any other metabolites and, therefore, was considered a new biosynthesized product of S.tropica (Table 2). Most interestingly, the search for compounds with the same molecular formulae as 3, 4, 6 or 7 in multiple databases (e.g. Reaxys, SciFinder, Dictionary of NP) returned no known natural product, suggesting that they are novel compounds. Unfortunately, despite multiple attempts, the isolation of these molecules has so far proven too challenging for their structural elucidation. Characteristics of the cryptic molecules.

ND indicates ions for which DataAnalysis was unable to generate chemical formulae. The production of these novel compounds was only triggered by the presence of the phototrophs as they were only detected in the co‐cultures of all three phototrophs (Fig. 2A and B), but not when grown in mono culture – as shown by the absence of these metabolites when S. tropica was grown alone in mineral ASW or nutrient‐rich media MB (Fig. 2C and D). Furthermore, we confirmed that the supernatant of a phototroph culture – containing the photosynthate – was enough to induce such metabolite production (Fig. 2D). Photosynthate triggers the expression of orphan gene clusters in S. tropica Having detected novel secondary metabolites produced by S. tropica in response to phototroph‐released photosynthate, we set out to investigate how it affected the induction of its BGCs. To this end, we analysed and compared the proteome of S. tropica when grown in presence of the phytoplankton photosynthate – that is in conditioned Synechococcus supernatant (SUPSYN) where the cryptic molecules are produced – and in nutrient‐rich broth – that is marine broth (MB) where the cryptic molecules are not detected. Considering that the medium SUPSYN is effectively artificial seawater with some phototroph‐released nutrients, we also incubated S. tropica in fresh artificial seawater (ASW) as a control. The rationale behind using the SUPSYN medium rather than co‐inoculating S. tropica with Synechococcus was twofold. First, it had the advantage to avoid Synechococcus proteins that may interfere with the correct detection of Salinispora proteins. Second, we reasoned that it would reduce potential variations in protein expression caused by Synechococcus‐Salinispora cell to cell interactions and/or the limitation in carbon availability that would occur early in the co‐culture in ASW. Overall, the datasets obtained contain close to 1,900 proteins (i.e. 1869, 1797 and 1831 detected proteins for the MB, ASW and SUPSYN conditions, respectively) representing about 40 % of the total expected proteome of S. tropica (Table S2; File S1). We found that 10 % of those detected proteins could be linked to BGCs (Table S2), a figure consistent with the estimated percentage of the S. tropica genome to be devoted to natural product assembly (Udwary et al., 2007). Interestingly, while the actual numbers of BGC‐related proteins were similar in all three conditions tested, we found that their cumulative abundances accounted for a significantly higher proportion of the proteomes when cells were grown in presence of the phytoplankton’s photosynthate compared to both MB and ASW (Table S2). As we believed this observation suggests that phototrophic cells prompt an increase of S. tropica secondary metabolism, we were interested in identifying which BGCs were expressed and influenced by photosynthate. Surprisingly, we were able to detect proteins encoded by almost all of S. tropica’s BGCs regardless of the incubation medium, including 10 of its 11 orphans BGCs (Fig. 3, File S1). Fig. 3Photosynthate allows the expression of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters in S. tropica.

Genes are coloured according to the relative abundance of their corresponding proteins. Those that were not detected are represented in black. Of particular interest were the orphan BGCs pks3 and nrps1, for which we detected 72% (18/25) and 42% (14/33) of their encoded proteins, respectively (Fig. 3). Moreover, the pks3 BGC was noticeably highly detected as eight of its detected proteins showed a relative abundance above 0.1% (Fig. 3; Table S3). While it has been previously suggested that pks3 may produce a spore pigment polyketide, very little experimental evidence is available in the literature, and the product of pks3 had not been confirmed (Kersten et al., 2013). On the other hand, the non‐ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster nrps1 has only been predicted to produce a non‐ribosomal dipeptide (Penn et al., 2009). Intriguingly, the most abundant proteins detected from this nrps1 BGC were the non‐ribosomal peptide synthetase (A4X2Q0), an adenylation domain‐containing protein (A4X2R4), a condensation domain‐containing protein (A4X2R5) and an ATP‐dependent Clp protease subunit (A4X2S2), with a relative abundance of 0.004%, 0.004%, 0.001% and 0.121% respectively (Table 3). While the three former are thought to direct the biosynthesis of the non‐ribosomal peptide, the later may be involved in conferring resistance to the synthesized antimicrobial compound (Kirstein et al., 2009), as further discussed below.

Protein potentially involved in self‐resistance to a proteasome inhibitor. The already characterized lom and sal BGCs were also abundantly detected with 81% (47/58) and 77% (23/30) of their encoded proteins detected, respectively, some representing high‐relative abundances within the proteome (Fig. 3). The BGC lom is linked to the cytotoxic glycoside lomaiviticin molecule (Kersten et al., 2013). However, this metabolite previously showed no antimicrobial activity on co‐cultured heterotrophic organisms (Patin et al., 2018) and, hence, it is unlikely to cause the antimicrobial phenotype observed on the phototrophs in this study. The high abundance of the sal cluster, producing the salinosporamide compound, is not surprising given the high detection of this metabolite by LC‐MS (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, although all BGCs appeared to be similarly active between conditions with regards to the detection of their proteins (i.e. the same proteins were generally present in the different proteomes, rather than being conditional to one growth medium), a thorough comparative analysis of their expression levels revealed that phototroph‐released nutrients could specifically trigger several proteins within the BGC nrps1 (Fig. 4). For instance, the orphan pks3 BGC showed an up‐regulation of pivotal enzymes for polyketide biosynthesis when cells were grown in the SUPSYN medium compared to MB. Namely, an acyl‐CoA ligase (A4X7T8), a 3‐ketoacyl‐ACP synthase (A4X7U0) and a long‐chain fatty acid‐CoA ligase (A4X7U3) were up‐regulated 3.1, 2.6 and 4.1‐fold, respectively (Fig. 4A). These variations in protein detection could not, however, be confidently attributed solely to the presence of photosynthate because they were also observed at similar levels in the ASW condition. This could indicate that the orphan pks3 cluster’s expression is regulated by nutrient availability as it is less active in a nutrient‐rich broth like MB. On the other hand, the activity of the BGC nrps1 was more clearly up‐regulated by the presence of photosynthate (Fig. 4B and C). This included three core biosynthetic enzymes, namely a non‐ribosomal peptide synthetase (12.5‐fold change increase in the SUPSYN condition compared to the MB treatment; A4X2Q0), a ketoreductase domain‐containing protein (1.6‐fold change; A4X2Q2) and an adenylation domain‐containing protein (3.4‐fold change; A4X2R4). Unlike the pks3 BGC, photosynthate did specifically trigger an increase in the expression of the BGC nrps1, as it exhibited a similar up‐regulation in the SUPSYN condition compared to the two other treatments, that is ASW and MB (Fig. 4C). Fig. 4Photosynthate increases the expression of the orphan nrps1 BGC in S. tropica. Photosynthate and other nutrients influence several proteins from the orphan BGCs pks3 (A) and nrps1 (B), in comparison with cells grown in MB.
