Results Biocontrol activity of Brevibacillus brevis HNCS-1 Br. brevis HNCS-1 was evaluated for its antifungal activity against pathogenic fungi. The results demonstrated that HNCS-1 inhibited the mycelia proliferation of five tea fungal diseases significantly (Figure 1). Br. brevis HNCS-1 was isolated from tea garden soil and demonstrated broad-spectrum antagonistic activity. The mycelial growth of Phyllosticta theaefolia, Fusarium sp., Cercospora theae, and Gloeosporium theae-sinensis was completely inhibited by 10% Br. brevis HNCS-1 supernatant. Additionally, it significantly inhibits the mycelial proliferation of Elsinoe leucospira. Br. brevis HNCS-1 is a beneficial microbe with biotechnological application potential.

General genome description of Brevibacillus brevis HNCS-1 The genome of the HNCS-1 strain consists of a single circular chromosome measuring 6,353,630 bp with a GC content of 47.15%; no plasmids were detected (GenBank CP128411). This chromosome genome consisted of 6,342 coding DNA sequences (CDS), which accounted for 87.50% of the genome. In addition, 15 sRNA, 44 rRNA, and 127 tRNA were predicted based on the chromosome sequence. In the genome, 31 Genomic Islands were identified, but no CRISPR repeat regions or prophages were found (Supplementary Figure 1). In total, 5,796 and 4,080 identified genes were annotated as NR and Swiss-port, respectively, and 2,916 and 4,714 genes were classified into functional categories based on GO and COG designations, respectively (Supplementary Figures 2, 3). Overall, 5,810 KEGG pathways have been assigned (Supplementary Figure 4). Moreover, 4,808, 2,906, 1,190, 173, and 6 genes, respectively, were annotated in Pfm, PHI, VFDB, CAZyme, and CARD (Supplementary Figures 5, 6). Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of Brevibacillus brevis The phylogenetic tree of 18 Br. brevis genomes and B. subtilis ATCC 13952 was constructed using the ML method and all orthogroups, with the ATCC 13952 strain serving as the root. It was found that HNCS-1, Br. brevis strains 17, and ATCC 13952 formed a large cluster, and different strains of Br. brevis revealed two groups (Figure 2A). In the meantime, strain HNCS-1 was a member of the same clade as strains G25-137, Ag35, ATCC 35690, GZDF3.1, NBRC100599, and LABIM17, but it was not a sister group to any other strains.

(B) Heat map of average nucleotide identity values among different strains of Br. brevis revealing five groups. To substantiate the results of the phylogenetic analysis, we also determined the ANI values of various strains. Strains with ANI values above 95% are regarded as belonging to the same species (Richter and Rossello-Mora, 2009). The results showed that the genetic relationship between ANI and phylogenetic trees was basically consistent, but ANI was more precise, dividing 18 strains of Br. brevis into 5 species (Figure 2B). According to the results, they were not distinguished by the mixed trend of geographical origin and phylogenetic clustering of strains isolated from similar environments. The genome's phylogenetic clustering differed substantially from the strains' specific habitat classification. The pan-genome features of Brevibacillus brevis The BPGA software determined a pan-genome for the strain HNCS-1 and 17 sequenced Br. brevis strains by comparing pan-genome analyses of bacterial species by utilizing protein clustering data in the total pan-genome. There were 10,359 CDS in the total pan-genome of the 18 Br. brevis strains. Among the 10,359 protein-coding genes, 3,742 core genes represented 36.12% of the genes in the pan-genome of Br. brevis. The number of accessory gene families (3,961 genes) was greater than the number of core gene families (3,742 genes). Moreover, Br. brevis HNCS-1 contains 1,586 accessory genes. In addition, the strain HNCS-1 also contained the greatest number of distinct transcripts (560 genes) and has greater potential for gene exploration. Br. brevis strains NCTC2611 and DSM30 encoded the fewest number of specific strain genes with 4 and 6, respectively (Figure 3A). Figure 3Pan-genome of 18 Br. brevis

The number of gene families is plotted in function of the genome number. The number of Br. brevis genomes was plotted against the size of the pan-genome and the core genome. The pan-genome curve exhibited an asymptotic trend, indicating that 18 genomes were inadequate to characterize the complete gene repertoire of Br. brevis. According to the curve generated for these 18 genomes based on Heap's Law and least-square fit of exponential regression decay, the number of gene families in the pan-genome increases with the addition of each additional genome (γ = 0.22), indicating that the pan-genome of Br. brevis strains is currently open but may be closed soon (Figure 3B). Analysis of genes encoding AMPs It is noteworthy that the cell-free supernatant fermentation of Br. brevis inhibited numerous bacterial and fungal diseases. Additionally, the core genome sequence of Br. brevis was mined for AMP-encoding genes. Only one gene cluster implicated in edeine NRPS was identified in the core genome after NR annotation. The gene cluster likely contributes significantly to antimicrobial activity. The sequence similarity between the genes and the predicted ede BGC of Br. brevis Vm4 was high (Westman et al., 2013). The identified ede BGC in the Br. brevis HNCS-1 genome was structured identically to the Br. brevis Vm4 genome. In brief, the ede BGC (43.57 kb) in Br. brevis HNCS-1 contained 17 open reading frames, designated edeA through edeQ based on the homologous sequences in Br. brevis Vm4 (44.12 kb) (Figure 4A).

Additionally, the genome sequence of Br. brevis HNCS-1 was mined by antiSMASH software for the presence of gene-encoding AMPs. A total of 13 putative biosynthetic gene clusters were identified by the HNCS-1 strain genome (Supplementary Figure 7). Four putative gene clusters shared a high degree of similarity (>70% of genes shared similarity) with the petrobactin, tyrocidine, bacillopaline, and gramicidin gene clusters. Three putative gene clusters displayed modest similarity (<30% of genes displayed similarity) to the previously reported zwittermicin A, aurantinin B-D, and pacidamycin (1–7, D) gene clusters. Six putative gene clusters were not conserved in comparison with known clusters. Purification and identification of AMPs The antimicrobial peptide should be edeine, according to the results of genome annotation analysis. Edeines are a class of linear pentapeptides generated by Brevibacillus, a soil bacterium. Edeines A, B, D, and F exist as two isomers of α and β; however, only the α isomer possesses remarkable antibiotic properties (Figure 4B). The antibacterial potential of eluent extracts containing antibacterial compounds was evaluated. Using an agar well diffusion assay, the antibacterial potential of eluent extracts from distinct collection tubes against G. theae-sinensis was determined. With an increase in eluent volume, the bacteriostatic activity initially increased steadily and then decreased dramatically (Figure 5A). The sample with the highest antibacterial activity was analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS for additional confirmation. According to the total ion chromatogram, the majority of the ultraviolet absorption is of short wavelength. Figure 5Purification and UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of AMPs from Brevibacillus brevis HNCS-1.

The theoretical molar masses of edeine A (C33H58N10O10), edeine B (C34H60N12O10), edeine D (C33H58N10O9), and edeine F (C34H60N12O9) are 754.4337, 796.4555, 738.4388, and 780.4606. Compound 1 (m/z 755), Compound 2 (m/z 797), Compound 3 (m/z 739), and Compound 4 (m/z 781) were extracted from the total ion current based on the ion mass spectral (m/z). Compound 1 (m/z 755) produced a [M+H]+ ion peak m/z 755.4132 (−1.7 ppm, C33H58N10O10) at a retention time of 1.182 min (Figure 5B-a). The electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry results indicated that its fragmentation pattern was identical to that of edeine A, including m/z 738, 737, 720, 667, 553, 536, 401, 390, and 203 (Figure 5C-a, Supplementary Figure 8). Compound 2 (m/z 797) produced a [M+H]+ ion peak m/z 797.4612 (−2.6 ppm, C34H60N12O10) at a retention time of 1.165 min (Figure 5B-b) with observable signals. The electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry results indicated that its fragmentation pattern was identical to that of edeine B, including m/z 780, 779, 761, 443, and 245 (Figure 5C-b, Supplementary Figure 9). Compound 3 (m/z 739) had faint signals at the retention time of 1.165 min (Figure 5B-c), but its peak value was too low to be analyzed further based on the available mass spectrum data. Compound 4 (m/z 781) produced a [M+H]+ ion peak m/z 781.4667 (−2.2 ppm, C34H60N12O9) at the retention time of 1.708 min (Figure 5B-d). The electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry results indicated that its fragmentation pattern was identical to that of edeine B, including m/z 780, 779, 761, 443, and 245 (Figure 5C-c, Supplementary Figure 10). To sum up, edeines were a class of highly polar AMPs with limited retention on reverse phase chromatography, which was consistent with the chromatographic retention property of the compounds discussed previously. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 were edeine A, B, and F, respectively. The chromatographic peak area suggested that edeine B had the maximum concentration, followed by edeine B and F had the lowest concentration. In addition, to confirm the existence of secondary metabolites predicted by antiSMASH software, we extracted relevant data from the total ion current based on the theoretical molecular weight of petrobactin, tyrocidine, bacillopaline, and gramicidin, but they were not detected (Supplementary Figures 11–14).
