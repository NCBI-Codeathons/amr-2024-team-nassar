Results Anaerobic growth Altogether eight fermentations were performed testing four different glucose concentrations as duplicates. An example is given in Figure 3, showing a fermentation of Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T using 2.5 g/L glucose as carbon source (for exemplary fermentations using 5 g/L, 7.5 g/L and 10 g/L glucose see Additional file 1: Figure S2-S4, the fermentation employing 2.5 g/L glucose is additionally presented with matching axis scaling in Additional file 1: Figure S1). All figures present the course of the CDW, CO2, phosphoric acid, nitrate, glucose and Surfactin concentrations with time. The fermentation shown in Figure 3 endured 55 h. The process was terminated because the levels of CO2 and CDW were drastically decreasing and the glucose was completely consumed. During the fermentation the CDW continually increased reaching 0.320 g/L at its maximum. The amount of CO2 (no longer solved in the medium and therefore carried on within the N2 stream in the headspace) increased simultaneously with the CDW. Meanwhile the glucose concentration consistently decreased until its depletion. In contrast, only 1 g/L nitrate was consumed during this fermentation (during fermentations with 10 g/L glucose about 5 g/L nitrate were used up, Additional file 1: Figure S4). The concentration of Surfactin in the fermentation medium started to increase after 24 h of incubation. It reached its maximum at the end of the fermentation yielding 0.09 g/L Surfactin. The amount of added phosphoric acid to adjust the mediums pH level increased significantly after 34 h of cultivation. The demand for pH regulation is caused by Bacillus subtilis anaerobic metabolism. In this pathway nitrate is used as terminal electron acceptor. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite via a nitrate reductase and the additional conversion of nitrite to ammonia via a nitrite reductase results in the production of an alkaline end product. In contrast to conventional aerobic cultivations of Bacillus subtilis, where the addition of base marks cell growth, the addition of acid represents vivid cell growth under anaerobic conditions. The amount of dissolved oxygen was monitored throughout the fermentation processes but is not shown in the figures, because values were below detection limit.Figure 3

Comparison of process parameters during anaerobic fermentation with different glucose concentrations The fermentations of Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T with various glucose concentrations were analyzed regarding product yields and substrate utilization. Table 1 presents an overview of the most interesting process parameters, such as cultivation time, maximal CDW, maximal Surfactin concentration, maximal growth rate, product yields (YP/X, YP/S, qSurfactin, vol. qSurfactin) and substrate utilization (YX/S). All illustrated values are mean values of two fermentations. The duration of the fermentation depended on the starting glucose concentration. Fermentations with 2.5 g/L glucose lasted for 55 h, whereas fermentations with 10 g/L glucose averagely endured 161 h. Fermentations with 5 g/L and 7.5 g/L glucose ran for approximately 100 h. The maximal CDW was reached during fermentations with 7.5 g/L glucose (0.856 g/L). In contrast, only 0.320 g/L CDW were yielded in fermentations with 2.5 g/L glucose. Fermentations with 5 g/L glucose or more reached at least 0.105 g/L Surfactin as maximal concentration. Fermentations with 2.5 g/L glucose earned 0.087 g/L Surfactin. The highest maximal growth rate μmax was reached by fermentations with 7.5 g/L glucose (0.118 h−1), whereas fermentations with 10 g/L glucose only reached maximal growth rates of 0.074 h−1. The values of overall YP/X differed widely between the fermentations with different glucose concentrations. Fermentations with 5 g/L or 7.5 g/L glucose earned product yields around 0.17 g/g. In contrast, fermentations with 2.5 g/L and 10 g/L reached YP/X values of 0.278 g/g and 0.259 g/g, respectively. Overall values of YX/S varied around 0.1 g/g except for fermentations with 10 g/L glucose. These cultivations led to YX/S values of 0.049 g/g. The results for YP/S show much higher values for fermentations with low glucose concentrations. Fermentations with 2.5 g/L glucose reached 0.033 g/g instead of 0.011 g/g with 10 g/L glucose in mineral salt medium. Additionally, cultivations using 2.5 g/L glucose yielded high specific production rates of 0.005 g/(g∙h). Interestingly, all other fermentations reached only 0.002 g/(g∙h). Volumetric specific production rates varied for all fermentations between 0.001 g/(L∙h) and 0.002 g/(L∙h).Table 1

Comparison of process parameters during anaerobic fermentation of Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T with different glucose concentrations. Although cultivations with 2.5 g/L glucose reached only small amounts of CDW and Surfactin, these fermentations are comparably efficient. The cultivation time is much shorter and values for μmax, YX/S and vol. qSurfactin are comparatively high. Moreover, fermentations with 2.5 g/L glucose reached excellent values for YP/X, YP/S and specific production rate qSurfactin emphasizing an outstanding conversion of substrate into product. Nevertheless, fermentations with 2.5 g/L glucose yielded only small amounts of Surfactin, due to the short cultivation time. As a consequence it would be interesting to test whether higher overall amounts of Surfactin can be reached by applying a repeated fed-batch process. Interestingly, on closer inspections Surfactin concentrations did increase simultaneously to rising initial glucose concentrations possibly due to longer cultivation times. Surprisingly, fermentations employing 10 g/L did also achieve an almost equal value for YP/X in comparison to fermentations with 2.5 g/L glucose. But this positive result is misleading as overflow metabolism (as a result of the high initial glucose concentration) leads to low values of CDW, μmax and YX/S. This means that the bacterial growth is already strongly restricted under the employment of 10 g/L glucose. As a result data for YP/S and qSurfactin are comparably low. These findings support the usage of lower initial glucose concentrations for the anaerobe fermentation of B. subtilis DSM 10T for the production of Surfactin to avoid overflow metabolism.
