3. Results 3.1. 16S rRNA Gene- and Genome-Based Phylogenies of Streptomyces sp. 21So2-11 The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain 21So2-11 (1486 bp) was aligned with the EzBioCloud database, which revealed that the strain shared the highest similarity with Streptomyces drozdowiczii NBRC 101007T (98.02%), followed by S. candidus NBRC 12846T (97.82%) and S. avidinii NBRC 13429T (97.81%). The similarity values of strain 21So2-11 with the type strains of related Streptomyces species were below the recognized threshold (98.65%) for bacterial species definition [45], indicating that 21So2-11 represents a potential novel species of the genus Streptomyces. The 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic ML tree (Figure 1) revealed that strain 21So2-11 was clustered within the genus Streptomyces but formed a distinct line separated from the other Streptomyces species. Compared to the 16S rRNA gene informing classification at and above the rank of genus, genome-based classification can afford greater resolution for delineations at the species and subspecies levels [46]. After the bacterial genome sequence was uploaded to TYGS, a total of 34 close Streptomyces reference strains were selected for phylogenetic analysis based on dDDH value showing high similarity to strain 21So2-11 (Table S1). The dDDH values between strain 21So2-11 and its most closely related species, Streptomyces altiplanensis HST21T, S. chryseus DSM 40420T and S. albidochromogenes DSM 41800T, were 28.60%, 28.20% and 27.90%, respectively, which are well below the threshold value of 70% for species delineation [47]. Moreover, the dDDH values between strains 21So2-11 and S. drozdowiczii NBRC 101007T, S. candidus NBRC 12846T, and S. avidinii NBRC 13429T were 23.30%, 23.30% and 22.70%, respectively. The genomic ANI values for strains 21So2-11 with S. altiplanensis HST21T, S. chryseus DSM 40420T and S. albidochromogenes DSM 41800T were 83.74%, 83.68% and 83.35%, respectively, which are lower than the cutoff value (95%) for species delineation [45]. The genomic ANI values between strains 21So2-11 and S. drozdowiczii NBRC 101007T, S. candidus NBRC 12846T, and S. avidinii NBRC 13429T were 82.01%, 82.11% and 81.31%, respectively. The GBDP tree (Figure 2) showed that 21So2-11 was within the cluster composed of S. altiplanensis HST21T, S. chryseus DSM 40420T and S. albidochromogenes DSM 41800T but formed a distinct line separate from the three most closely related Streptomyces relatives. These results support that strain 21So2-11 represents a novel species of the Streptomyces genus, which is consistent with the results of 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. 3.2. Genomic Features of Streptomyces sp. 21So2-11 A total of 11,306,456 paired-end reads were obtained for Streptomyces sp. 21So2-11 after processing the high-quality reads. The coverage for the genome was approximately 198×. The genome had an N50 of 58.39 Kb and an L50 of 5. A circular map of Streptomyces sp. 21So2-11 is shown in Figure 3. After assembly, the draft genome of strain 21So2-11 had a total of 8,445,049 bp with 29 scaffolds. The DNA G + C content was estimated to be 69.57 mol%. A total of 7390 protein-encoding genes and 137 RNA genes (including 14 rRNA, 67 tRNA and 56 sRNA) were predicted in the genome. In addition, 6237 (84.39%), 4908 (66.41%) and 2445 (33.09%) genes were annotated by querying the COG, GO and KEGG databases, respectively. Among the 23 functional categories based on COG annotation, the 7 most abundant genes were those with functions related to unknown (category S; 34.41%), transcription (category K; 8.69%), replication, recombination and repair (category L; 8.21%), amino acid transport and metabolism (category E; 6.45%), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (category G; 5.98%), signal transduction mechanisms (category T; 5.13%), and energy production and conversion (category C; 4.73%) (Figure S1A). 3.3. Genes Related to Environmental Adaptation and Ecological Function Cell growth of strain 21So2-11 was observed after incubation at 4–35 °C and 0–8.0% (w/v) NaCl, indicating its psychrotolerance and halotolerance. Genes related to environmental adaptation and ecological function were identified using KEGG and SwissProt annotations. A total of 36 genes related to salt and osmotic stress tolerance, including betABIT, cvrA, dnaK, ectABCD, gbsA, gdh, gltBD, kdpABCDE, mscS, otsAB, osmC, prc, proABC, surE, treS and trkA, were detected in the genome (Table S2). Furthermore, 154 genes related to membrane transport were detected based on KEGG annotation (Figure S1B). These genes may provide a protection strategy for strain 21So2-11 against salt and osmotic stress. In addition, a total of 22 cold-shock protein- and RNA helicase-related genes, including cspAC, cstA, deaD, dinG, grpE, hepA, hmgA, hrpAB, recQ, rep, rhlE, rnr and tesB, were detected in the genome of 21So2-11 (Table S2). Both cold-shock proteins and RNA helicases could play roles in the adaptation of the bacterial strain to the cold Antarctic environment. Moreover, a total of 21 genes responsible for repairing DNA damage induced by ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation, including lexA, mtcA, phr, polA, recAFORX, uvrABCD, rsr and ssb, were detected in the genome of 21So2-11 (Table S2). Different gene families, different genes of the same gene family (e.g., recAX in scaffold5 and recFOR in scaffold1), and different copies of the same gene (e.g., four copies of uvrD in three different scaffolds) were found to be distributed at different positions in the genome (Table S2), indicating that the genes related to salt tolerance, cold adaptation and UV resistance were randomly distributed in the genome. Strain 21So2-11 harbored 11 pathogenic and virulence-related genes, including IdeR, DevR, MrpA, SigEH, GroEL and AhpC. In addition, there were 33 antibiotic resistance genes, 21 antibiotic target genes and one antibiotic biosynthesis gene detected using the CARD database. A total of 291 putative CAZyme genes related to the degradation of polysaccharides, including 110 glycoside hydrolases, 68 glycosyl transferases, 57 carbohydrate esterases, 26 carbohydrate-binding modules, 22 auxiliary active enzymes and eight polysaccharide lyases, were found in the genome. These results suggest that strain 21So2-11 can compete with other bacteria and degrade polysaccharides for growth in the Antarctic terrestrial environment. Based on KEGG annotation, complete key genes involved in the reductive citrate cycle (Arnon–Buchanan cycle), including aclB, acnB, frdABCD, fumDE, korAB, mdh, ppc, ppdK, sdhABCD and sucCD, were detected in the genome of strain 21So2-11, indicating its ecological role in carbon fixation. Moreover, the 21So2-11 genome contained all genes of the complete set of dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways, including narGHI and nirBD. In addition, all genes of the complete set of assimilatory sulfate reduction pathways, including cysCDHN and sir, were detected in the bacterial genome. These results provide the genomic basis for the participation of strain 21So2-11 in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism in the local habitat. 3.4. Genome Mining of Secondary Metabolites A total of 28 putative BGCs with an average length of 38,781 base pairs were identified, including 4 polyketide synthases (PKSs), 4 lantipeptides, 4 terpenes, 4 hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides, 2 nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), 2 siderophores, 2 RiPPs, 2 melanins, 1 ectoine, 1 LAP (linear azol(in)e-containing peptides), 1 hydrogen-cyanide, and 1 redox cofactor (Table S3). Among them, six gene clusters showed high similarity (>75%) to reported gene clusters responsible for melanin, coelichelin, isorenieratene, ectoine, SapB and hopene. For the other 22 BGCs, 6 of them shared similarities between 30 and 70% with known BGCs, whereas 12 BGCs likely encode novel compounds due to very low similarity values (<30%). The most four abundant types of secondary metabolite BGCs in the 21So2-11 genome were NRPSs, PKSs, NRPS-PKS hybrids, and terpenes. These BGCs included genes responsible for the synthesis of compounds with different biological activities, such as antitumor (aborycin), antimicrobial (auroramycin, capreomycin, enteromycin, gaudimycin, kinamycin, leucomycin, naphthomycin, neomediomycin and streptolydigin) and siderophore (desferrioxamine) activities. Two BGCs responsible for moldins (i.e., naphthomycin and gaudimycin) were predicted in strain 21So2-11. The bacterium had a hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide system in cluster 9.1 (Table S3), which could be responsible for naphthomycin production. The naphthomycin biosynthesis gene cluster in strain 21So2-11 contained 60 genes, 27 of which were responsible for the production of the bioactive red pigment naphthomycin. The cluster comprised regulatory, transport-related, core, and additional genes involved in the biosynthesis of naphthomycin derivatives (Figure 4). The naphthomycin core biosynthesis gene cluster in strain 21So2-11 was identical to the red gene cluster found in Streptomyces sp. CS [48] and showed 95% similarity with that in Streptomyces sp. 11-1-2. The naphthomycin core synthesizing genes in Streptomyces sp. 11-1-2 and S. hygroscopicus XM201 were named the red gene cluster, whereas those in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121 were identified as the pig gene cluster (Figure 4). In addition, strain 21So2-11 had a type II PKS system in cluster 19.1, which was responsible for gaudimycin production. This BGC exhibited 54% similarity to the gaudimycin C gene cluster found by Kallio et al. [49]. Gaudimycin core synthesizing genes in strains 21So2-11 and Salinispora fenicalii CNT-569 B116 were both identified as fab gene clusters (Figure S2). Additional biosynthetic genes responsible for SDR family oxidoreductases, the FMN reductase family and the TetR family, which are key enzymes in natural product biosynthetic pathways, were found in the 21So2-11 gaudimycin cluster (Figure S2). The presence of these genes suggests that Streptomyces sp. 21So2-11 has the potential to produce novel actinomycin analogs. In addition, another noteworthy BGC detected in strain 21So2-11 was the desferrioxamine gene cluster, which showed 50% similarity with the desferrioxamine B/E gene cluster in S. coelicolor [50]. Desferrioxamine can be used to treat iron overload disorders in humans [51]. 3.5. Distribution of BGCs across Streptomyces Genomes Originating from Polar Regions To evaluate the secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential of Streptomyces isolated from polar environments, BGCs from 47 selected Streptomyces genomes were identified using antiSMASH, and then a network analysis was performed in BiG-SCAPE together with similar BGC sequences available in the MIBiG database. A total of 1456 BGCs falling into 48 secondary metabolite categories were detected in the 47 polar Streptomyces, and the average number of BGCs in those genomes was 30.98. The four most abundant secondary metabolite categories were those related to terpenes (16.8% of total BGCs), NRPSs (15.2%), type I polyketide synthases (T1PKSs, 8.7%), and lanthipeptides (8.3%). Biosynthetic gene cluster families (BGCFs), including terpenes, NRPSs, T1PKSs, lanthipeptides and siderophores, were shared by almost all polar Streptomyces strains (Figure 5), which is consistent with previous studies [52]. In total, more than 300 secondary metabolites (including more than 100 antimicrobials) were found in the 47 polar Streptomyces strains, providing us with the opportunity to identify novel secondary metabolites in Streptomyces species inhabiting Arctic and Antarctic environments. The BGC types and related major secondary metabolites predicted on the basis of the genomes of the 47 investigated Streptomyces strains are shown in Figure S3. The network analysis revealed that among the 28 BGCs observed in strain 21So2-11, 24 BGCs showed 6–100% similarity to known BGCs according to the MIBiG database (Table S3), including 18 BGCs from Streptomyces strains originating from polar regions (Figure 6). These findings indicate that four novel BGCs in strain 21So2-11 have not been detected in reported actinomycetes and that ten BGCs in strain 21So2-11 have not been detected in known polar Streptomyces strains.
