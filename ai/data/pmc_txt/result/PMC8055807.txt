Results Influence of different oxygen availabilities on nitrogen metabolism Varying filling volumes in shake flasks are associated with different oxygen availabilities for cells. In case of B. subtilis, altered patterns in nitrogen consumption were expected due to assimilatory and dissimilatory pathways. More precisely, low filling volumes result in highest oxygen availability (Heyman et al. 2019; Schiefelbein et al. 2013) and hence aerobic growth is predominant. In this sense, ammonium should be identified as preferred nitrogen source for biomass assimilation, when both ammonium and nitrate are present. High filling volumes result in low oxygen availability (Heyman et al. 2019; Schiefelbein et al. 2013) and nitrate consumption increases due to anaerobic nitrate respiration. To validate these theses, B. subtilis JABs24 was cultivated in 10%, 50% and 100% relative filling volume (Rv). Figure 1 displays the corresponding CDW and the concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium during the time course of cultivation. CDWmax was reached after 44 h, 48 h and 36 h with 5.85 ± 0.66 g/L, 5.12 ± 0.20 g/L and 1.21 ± 0.01 g/L at increasing cultivation volumes. Additional glucose measurements excluded carbon limitation (data not shown). Nitrate concentrations were relatively constant at 10% and 50% Rv, with a slight decrease detectable in the last-mentioned. On the contrary, nitrate limitation occurred in 100% Rv after 36 h. Hence, growth was limited by nitrate depletion. As expected, the ammonium concentration decreased during cultivation with 10% Rv. At 50% Rv, ammonium initially decreased slightly before a relatively constant concentration could be measured. A continuous increase in ammonium was detected in the cultivation using 100% Rv of the flask capacity. Nitrite, the intermediate of nitrate respiration, was not detected in cultivations using 10% Rv. Nitrite peaked to values of 4.11 ± 1.17 mmol/L and 4.95 ± 0.03 mmol/L after 20 h of cultivation in both 50% and 100% Rv, respectively. Those nitrite concentrations particularly affect a prolonged lag phase of cultivation of anaerobically growing B. subtilis cultures, while the values of maximum specific growth rates µmax remain unchanged (Hoffmann et al. 2020). However, concentrations further declined until CDWmax. Hence, the time course of nitrogen sources indicated that higher filling volumes resulted in a converged nitrogen consumption pattern. More precisely, nitrate respiration was preferred with increasing Rv and hence lower oxygen availabilities can be assumed.

Further cultivations aimed at investigating the suitability and expression of PnarG and PnasD as anaerobically inducible promoters. Therefore, strains KM1016, MG1 and MG5 carrying PsrfA-lacZ, PnarG-lacZ and PnasD-lacZ-fusions, respectively, were cultivated in shake flasks with 10%, 50% and 100% Rv. Comparable growth curves were observed as described in Fig. 1. Figure 2 displays the promoter activities as determined by Miller units (MU) during cultivations.

Data recorded until CDWmax of cultivation of strains B. subtilis KM1016 (PsrfA-lacZ), MG1 (PnarG-lacZ) and MG5 (PnasD-lacZ) in a mineral salt medium employing 40 g/L glucose, 0.1 mol/L NH4+ and 0.1 mol/L NO3− in baffled shake flasks with three different relative filling volumes (Rv) of 10%, 50% and 100% representing different oxygen availabilities The PsrfA expression was comparatively congruent amongst the different Rv values tested. Altogether, a marginal tendency to higher mean MU with increasing Rv was noticed. In general, PsrfA expression dropped from ~ 300 MU to ~ 125 MU after 8 h of cultivation. Another slight increase in expression was followed by a subsequent decline to 70–100 MU at CDWmax. For both PnarG and PnasD expressions, MU increased with increasing Rv. At 10% Rv, LacZ activity was not detectable for transcriptional fusion with PnarG and expression did not surpass 10 MU for PnasD. At 50% Rv, both expression levels of PnarG and PnasD increased to a maximum after 12 h of cultivation with ~ 40 MU and ~ 270 MU, respectively, with an ensuing decrease to ~ 15 MU and ~ 140 MU until CDWmax. Highest expression levels were monitored at 100% Rv. For PnarG, expression increased to ~ 180 MU after 12 h of cultivation before a decline to ~ 80 MU was detectable. In contrast to that, maximum expression of PnasD was ~ 10-fold higher and reached ~ 2000 MU after 20 h of cultivation. Noticeably, comparable to PnarG expression, a reduction of MU values to ~ 800 MU could be observed at CDWmax. In this context, as already described by Hoffmann et al. (2020), a strong PnasD activity is detectable, although the overflow metabolite acetate increases with higher glucose amounts in anaerobic cultivations. In summary, while PsrfA expression was relatively constant amongst the different Rv tested, both PnarG and PnasD expressions were induced at higher Rv and hence lower oxygen availabilities. More specifically, PnasD revealed the overall highest expression values. To apply PnarG and PnasD promoter systems for bioprocesses, more information about B. subtilis physiology is important. In brief, B. subtilis harbors two nitrate reductases with the genes nasBC and narGHI encoding for the assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reductase, respectively. The transcription of the latter one, narGHI, is thereby repressed in the presence of oxygen (Hoffmann et al. 1995; Nakano et al. 1996). On the contrary, nasDE encodes for both assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrite reductase and transcription is hence also feasible aerobically (Nakano et al. 1998). To demonstrate that the PnasD expression is dependent on the presence of ammonium or nitrate, respectively, B. subtilis MG5 was cultivated in media containing either NH4+ or NO3− in 10% Rv. As expected, mean MU for PnasD expression was below 10 MU in the medium containing only NH4+, whereas much higher MU values (continuously ~ 200 MU) were detected in NO3− supplemented medium (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In addition, in media supplemented with either 0.005 or 0.01 mol/L NH4+, a time-delayed expression of PnasD was monitored (Additional file 1: Fig. S1) which was triggered by depletion of NH4+ (data not shown). Hence, it can be concluded that PnasD is a strong, anaerobically inducible promoter, but the effect of anaerobic induction is dependent on the availability of NH4+ during aerobic growth. Investigation of strains B. subtilis MG12 and MG14 carrying promoter exchanges PsrfA::PnarG and PsrfA::PnasD Growth behavior and surfactin synthesis The promoter exchange strains MG12 (PsrfAA::PnarG; amyE::[PnarG-lacZ, spcR]) and MG14 (PsrfA::PnasD; amyE::[PnasD-lacZ, spcR]) were cultivated in shake flasks with 10%, 50% and 100% Rv. An overview of CDW and surfactin concentrations of these strains, as well as the reference strain JABs24, are displayed in Fig. 3a and b. In 10% Rv, strains MG12 and MG14 reached CDWmax after 24 h and 20 h with 3.93 ± 0.11 g/L and 4.45 ± 0.07 g/L, respectively. CDW remained constant until the end of cultivation. CDWmax for strain JABs24 was reached after 44 h with 5.85 ± 0.66 g/L. In 50% Rv, all strains reached CDWmax after 44 to 48 h with 5.12 ± 0.20 g/L, 5.78 ± 0.07 g/L and 5.98 ± 0.30 g/L for strains JABs24, MG12 and MG14, respectively. In contrast, CDWmax was much lower in cultivations with 100% Rv and did not surpass 1.21 ± 0.01 g/L, 1.12 ± 0.03 g/L and 0.69 ± 0.00 g/L for strains JABs24, MG12 and MG14 after 36 h, 32 h and 44 h, respectively, before the concentration of biomass dropped. In addition, cell agglutination was visible with progressive cultivation causing difficulties in OD600 measurements. However, strong induction of PnasD activity was detected, suggesting that cell agglutination does not counteract nasD expression.

For the reference strain JABs24, the maximum surfactin concentration was measured after 20 h of cultivation with 1668 ± 87 mg/L. During subsequent bacterial growth, the concentration of surfactin declined to 146 ± 118 mg/L at CDWmax. The surfactin concentration of the reference strain was even higher with 2806 ± 68 mg/L in 50% Rv. Under this condition, strain MG12 produced up to 215 ± 69 mg/L and strain MG14 up to 1189 ± 15 mg/L. In 100% Rv, lowest surfactin titer was detected for strain MG12 with 193 mg/L, surfactinmax of strain MG14 surpassed the titer of strain JABs24 by ~ 200 mg/L with 696 ± 19 mg/L. With respect to foam formation, this issue could be observed for strain JABs24 from the beginning in 10% and 50% Rv, while foam formation was time-delayed for strains MG12 and MG14. At 100% Rv, foam was not present in any cultivation due to the high fluid level and low turbulences. The corresponding Miller units of strains MG12 and MG14 are displayed in Additional file 1: Fig. S2. In sum, MU values of strain MG12 were similar to strain MG1 (Fig. 2). For strain MG14, MU values in 10% and 50% Rv were also comparable to the cultivation of strain MG5 (Fig. 2). At 100% Rv, highest MU values for MG14 did not surpass ~ 1100 MU and remained relatively constant until CDWmax. In all cultivations, glucose was not depleted. With respect to the nitrogen sources, displayed in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the patterns were similar as illustrated in Fig. 1 with one exception. In 50% Rv, nitrate consumption and hence increase in ammonium were more conspicuous in strains MG12 and MG14 than for the reference strain. After ~ 32 h of cultivation, nitrate was almost depleted and until this time point ammonium increased. Strain B. subtilis MG14 reaches remarkable YP/X values All yields and growth rates of the cultivation in 10%, 50% and 100% Rv are displayed in Table 2. B. subtilis MG12 reached highest overall and maximum growth rates in all cultivations. In 10% and 50% Rv, JABs24 had lowest overall and maximum growth rates. Using 100% Rv, however, lowest growth rates were monitored for strain MG14. A trend amongst the strains for the YX/S was not identified. Highest Rv and hence lowest oxygen availability resulted in lowest YX/S. As no surfactin was produced in 10% Rv for strain MG12 and MG14, no data could be calculated for YP/X, YP/S and q. In accordance with surfactin concentrations, strain JABs24 was superior with respect to YP/X, YP/S and q in cultivations using 50% Rv. Noticeable, strain MG14 reached an overall YP/X of 1.007 ± 0.028 g/g in 100% Rv, representing an excellent result. In addition, the overall and maximum productivity q was the highest for strain MG14 in 100% Rv with 0.023 ± 0.001 g/(g h) and 0.209 ± 0.012 g/(g h), even surpassing the productivities of strain JABs24 in 10% and 50% Rv.

Bioreactor cultivations As a rule of thumb, filling volume in shake flasks should not exceed 10% (Rv = 0.1 mL/mL) of flask nominal volume to ensure sufficient oxygen supply. However, the previous shake flask cultivations have demonstrated that reference strain JABs24 reached highest surfactin titer at a 50% Rv, and even at 100% Rv both YP/X and q were promising. In the latter condition, B. subtilis MG14 with PsrfA::PnasD even surpassed the surfactin titers, YP/X and q of the reference strain. Consequently, the next step aimed at transferring these results to bioreactor scale. Reference process and preliminary pO2 strategies CDW, surfactin and pO2 levels of different processes employing B. subtilis JABs24 or MG1 are given in Fig. S4. A conventional batch process with foam centrifuge employing 20 g/kg glucose was performed as control with an initial agitation and aeration rate of 300 rpm and 2.0 L/min and a pO2 set-point of 20% (Additional file 1: Fig. S4a). CDWmax was reached after 24 h with 77.51 g prior to glucose depletion. Simultaneously, surfactinmax was reached with 57.43 g. Nitrate was almost constant throughout cultivation, while ammonium was reduced by ~ 50%. In addition, slight persistent foaming occurred which was accompanied by an increase in the pressure due to blocked exhaust air filters. In a subsequent fed-batch approach, the aeration rate was stopped after 21 h of cultivation and switched to N2 based ventilation (Additional file 1: Fig. S4b). At this time point, the pO2 was already at 20% for ~ 5 h. When the process air was stopped, the pO2 dropped to 0% within seconds. However, also the CDW dropped from 50.27 g to 3.67 g within 4.5 h. Surfactin reached 29.48 g prior to the change in pO2 and was reduced slightly when CDW dropped. However, cells restored the growth and after 41.5 h of cultivation, a biomass of 24.1 g was obtained with a slight increase in surfactin to 32 g. In a next approach, the pO2 was decreased stepwise to ideally avoid the observed drop of CDW by cell adaptation (Fig. S4c). Each pO2 level of 20%, 10%, 5% and 0% was kept for 3 h before aeration was switched to N2. In this approach, the CDW as well as surfactin still dropped, but to a much lower extent, from 80.74 g to 61.75 g, and 39.84 g to 34.80 g, respectively. Both CDW and surfactin increased afterwards and reached maximum values of 73.26 g and 41.91 g. Comparison of strains B. subtilis KM1016 and MG14 with 1.2 L/min aeration rate employing a self-regulated HNO3 feed Due to the observed drops in CDW and the concomitant stagnating surfactin production, another approach was tested employing a constant aeration and agitation rate throughout the cultivation. This should result in a decline of available oxygen per cell and hence an adaptation of cells to microaerobic conditions. First, a fed-batch cultivation was performed with a constant aeration rate of 2 L/min employing the reporter strain MG1 to monitor PnarG expression, which is exclusively activated anaerobically. Cells grew without drop and reached a CDWmax of 196 g after 40 h. Surfactin values increased constantly during growth to a maximum of 104 g (Fig. S4d). Miller units revealed that only a small portion of cells adapted to anaerobic conditions. During Miller Assay, the yellow color as indicator to stop the reaction was visible in less than 3 min, but calculation revealed 5 MU, as the high OD600 of 30 is included in the calculation. Hence, it can be assumed that a high expression level of the promoter is present, but most cells did not grow by nitrate respiration. A cultivation with 1.2 L/min and strain MG1, which actually represents the lowest aeration rate that could be set with the given technical equipment, resulted in Miller units up to 35 for PnarG and was hence used as process to compare B. subtilis KM1016 and MG14 with PsrfA::PnasD. Figure 4 exemplarily illustrates the CDW, glucose, surfactin, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium values of a cultivation with B. subtilis KM1016 (Fig. 4a) and B. subtilis MG14 (Fig. 4b). In addition, OD600 in correlation to Miller units and pO2 are given in Fig. 4c and d for strains KM1016 and MG14, respectively. Comparable CDWmax values were reached for strain KM1016 and MG14 after 46 h with 140 g and 147 g, respectively, whereas the growth was terminated by glucose depletion. In contrast, different surfactinmax were reached at CDWmax with 81 g for KM1016 and 35 g for MG14. Strain KM1016 consumed a total of 5.6 mol nitrate until CDWmax. Nitrate addition by HNO3 was higher than consumption, resulting in a nitrate accumulation to 2.7 mol in the medium. Strain MG14 showed a similar behavior but consumed less nitrate. At CDWmax, total nitrate consumption was 4.5 mol and another 4.2 mol were detectable in the medium.

Nitrite concentrations increased until 22 h in both cultivations. After a subsequent decrease until ~ 30 h, nitrite again increased steadily and reached values of ~ 0.21 mol at CDWmax. The pO2 declined faster in the cultivation of strain MG14 which correlated to higher growth rates (Fig. 4d). For strain KM1016, a pO2 of ~ 14% was reached after ~ 15 h, and mean pO2 of ~ 1.8% was measured after 25 h of cultivation (Fig. 4c). On the contrary, the pO2 of strain MG14 fell to ~ 2% after 7 h of cultivation, and a mean pO2 of ~ 1.2% was reached after ~ 15 h of cultivation. For both strains, the pO2 increased drastically when cell growth was terminated. In terms of foaming, the foam centrifuge was activated right from the beginning for strain KM1016 and after ~ 6 h for strain MG14. With respect to the Miller units, PsrfA expression was detectable as soon as cells grew after a short lag-phase. A maximum of 250 MU was determined after 24 h of cultivation and values slightly decreased afterwards (Fig. 4c). For PnasD, induction levels were below 5 MU until 6 h of cultivation. In accordance with the pO2, induction increased to 180 MU after 8 h when the pO2 was < 2%. Highest expression was detected after 12 h with 320 MU before expression declined slightly (Fig. 4d). Table 3 summarizes the main parameters and overall yields of the cultivations with strains KM1016 and MG14 employing an aeration rate of 1.2 L/min. For comparison, data of the reference process with B. subtilis JABs24 and the processes employing a constant aeration rate of 2 L/min with strain MG1 are included. Corresponding calculated Δtmax yields and growth rates are listed in Additional file 1: Table S3. For fed-batch processes and for better comparison to the reference batch cultivation, results are displayed as “after batch glucose consumption” calculations and “end of process” calculations. The fed-batch process employing the reference strain and 1.2 L/min reached only 82.14 g of surfactin, which resulted in a productivity q of 0.012 g/(g h). This value is similar to the 2 L/min fed-batch process with 0.013 g/(g h), where 104.57 g of surfactin were produced, but with biomass of 196.97 g. Comparing batch data, the reference batch process had a productivity q of 0.031 g/(g h). Here, the 2 L/min process was inferior with 0.022 g/(g h) and the 1.2 L/min process performed similar with 0.030 g/(g h). Comparing strains KM1016 and MG14, both processes reached comparable CDW of 147.52 g and 150.18 g, but the surfactin produced with strain MG14 with 31.56 g was ~ 2.5-fold lower. Hence, both productivities and yields were inferior for strain MG14 and solely the growth rates during the batch phase were superior.
