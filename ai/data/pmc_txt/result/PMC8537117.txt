3. Results A single IMPDH protein was identified within each of the two available P. jirovecii proteomes by a search of homology with the IMPDH protein of P. carinii. The two P. jirovecii impdh gene sequences were identical, except two synonymous SNPs at positions 1850 and 1952 (Figure S2). The P. jirovecii impdh gene is 2070 bp long, encompassing eight introns. The six fragments of the impdh gene were successfully amplified using the six designed primer pairs and afterward sequenced in all 26 patients. Consensus sequences of the P. jirovecii impdh gene were compared to the impdh gene sequence from P. jirovecii genome assembly version Pneu-jiro_RU7_V2 (T551_00631 locus), which was used as a reference sequence to identify SNPs [17]. Nine SNPs were identified at positions 76 (G76T), 914 (G914A), 1020 (G1020A), 1269 (C1269T), 1329 (A1329T), 1737 (G1737A), 1754 (C1754T), 1850 (T1850C) and 1952 (G1952A) (Figure S2; Figure S3; Table 3). SNP at positions 1020, 1269, 1329, 1737, 1754, 1850 and 1952 were found in at least two patients each (Table 3). SNP at positions 76 and 914 were found in only one patient each (G76T in C10 and G914A in C13) and were confirmed with a second PCR-sequencing experiment. Eight putative IMPDH alleles were defined based on these polymorphisms (Table 4). The sequence of the impdh gene from Ma and colleagues (T551_00631 locus) [17] corresponds to allele IMPDH-1. This allele was identified in two SOT recipients (T3 and T9) and four control patients (C1, C8, C14 and C15). The sequence of the impdh gene from Cissé and colleagues (PNEJI1_002926 locus) [18] corresponds to allele IMPDH-2. This allele was only identified in six control patients (C3, C4, C7, C9, C12 and C15). Interestingly, allele IMPDH-3 was only identified in the 10 SOT recipients. Allele IMPDH-4 was only identified in three control patients (C6, C14 and C16). Allele IMPDH-5 was only identified in nine control patients (C2, C5, C7, C8, C10, C11, C12, C13, C16). Alleles IMPDH-6, IMPDH-7 and IMPDH-8 were only identified in one patient each (respectively, C2, C10 and C13). To sum up, allele IMPDH-3 was only identified in SOT recipients (10/10 vs. 0/16, p < 0.0001). Only two alleles, IMPDH-1 and IMPDH-3 were identified in the SOT group, whereas seven alleles, IMPDH-1, IMPDH-2, IMPDH-4, IMPDH-5, IMPDH-6, IMPDH-7 and IMPDH-8, were identified in the control group. IMPDH-1 was the sole common allele found in both SOT and control group. Mixed infections were observed in 2 out of 10 SOT recipients and 9 out of 16 control patients (p = 0.11). An overall lower diversity of alleles in SOT recipients than in control patients was observed (2 alleles in 10 patients vs. 7 alleles in 16 patients). Consensus sequences of P. jirovecii impdh gene in each patient were also aligned with the coding DNA sequences (CDS) of the two reference impdh genes (T551_00631 and PNEJI1_002926 loci) [17,18]. SNP at positions 1269 and 1329 were located within introns (Figure S2). SNP at position 76, 914, 1020, 1737, 1754, 1850 and 1952 were located within exons. Deduced protein sequences were compared to the reference protein sequences (UniProt ID A0A0W4ZU90 and L0P7N3) [17,18]. Four synonymous mutations and 3 missense mutations were identified. Missense mutations were observed at nucleotide positions 76, 1020 and 1737. The first mutation corresponds to a transversion from G to T (G76T) and an amino acid substitution from alanine (Ala) to serine (Ser) at codon 26 (Ala26Ser) (Figure S2; Figure 1). This change characterising the allele IMPDH-7 was found in one control patient (C10). The second mutation corresponds to a transition from G to A (G1020A) and an amino acid substitution from alanine to threonine (Thr) at codon 261 (Ala261Thr) (Figure S2; Figure 1). It is noteworthy that this change characterising the allele IMPDH-3 was exclusively found in the SOT recipients and in all of those. The third mutation, found in three control patients (C6, C14 and C16) but not in SOT recipients, corresponds to a transition from G to A (G1737A) and an amino acid substitution from glycine to serine at codon 439 (Gly439Ser) (Figure S2; Figure 1). This change characterising the allele IMPDH-4 was found in three control patients (C6, C14 and C16) and was not found in SOT recipients. P. jirovecii IMPDH protein sequences were aligned with available IMPDH proteins from relevant fungi, i.e., the IMPDH of other species of the Pneumocystis genus (P. carinii, P. murina) [17], C. albicans [21], M. guilliermondii [22], S. cerevisiae [23], P. brevicompactum [24] and A. nidulans [24] (Table S2) (Figure 1). The two IMPDHs of P. jirovecii that were retrieved from the two available proteomes (one from Ma and colleagues, the other from Cissé and colleagues) are identical and can be considered as the wild type of IMPDH [17,18]. Among the three aforementioned missense mutations identified in the present study, the mutations Ala26Ser and Gly439Ser are located within non-conserved regions (Figure 1) [24,25]. Conversely, mutation Ala261Thr is located in a strongly conserved region, Ala261 being itself a strongly conserved residue (Figure 1) [24]. Indeed, an Ala was observed at the analogous positions within the IMPDHs of P. jirovecii (wild type), P. carinii (Ala256), P. murina (Ala256), C. albicans (CaIMPDH-MPAS; Ala251), A. nidulans (Ala267) and the MPA-sensitive IMPDHs of M. guilliermondii (MgIMPDH1-MPAS; Ala251) and S. cerevisiae (ScIMPDH2-MPAS; Ala253) (Figure 1). Conversely, a Thr was observed at the analogous position within the IMPDH of an MPA-resistant C. albicans strain (CaIMPDH-MPAR; Thr251) and a Ser was observed at the analogous position within the MPA-resistant IMPDHs of M. guilliermondii (MgIMPDH2-MPAR; Ser251), S. cerevisiae (ScIMPDH2-MPAR; Ser253) and P. brevicompactum (Ala267).
