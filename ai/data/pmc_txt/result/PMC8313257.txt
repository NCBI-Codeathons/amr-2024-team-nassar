Results To test our first hypothesis that phenazine reduction can take place in the periplasm, we evaluated the interaction of the phenazines with the first enzyme of the periplasmic glucose oxidation pathway in vitro and in vivo. Membrane‐bound glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) of Pseudomonas reduces phenazines in vitro We first tested, if phenazines could interact with the membrane‐bound glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) of Pseudomonas and as such mediate the electrons generated through the oxidation of glucose in the periplasmic space to extracellular terminal electron acceptors. The gcd genes of P. aeruginosa PA14 (PA14_34970) and P. putida KT2440 (PP_1444) were cloned and expressed in E. coli. Both proteins, each made up of 803 amino acid residues, are PQQ‐dependent and require divalent ions such as calcium ions as an enhancing co‐factor. The initial 138 to 140 amino acids at the N‐terminus form a membrane anchor with five transmembrane helices, while the remaining part of the protein, including the catalytic site, flanks the periplasmic space. The final construct of the Gcds used for protein expression contained C‐ and N‐terminal His‐tag sequences and excluded the first 8 native amino acids, since the construct with the full native sequence showed retarded growth and a low protein expression. The membrane proteins were purified for the enzyme assay using affinity and size permeation chromatography (Fig. S1). If the Gcds can interact with phenazines, they should be able to reduce these mediators by transferring electrons from the glucose oxidation through the PQQ co‐factor to the phenazines (Fig. 1). An enzyme assay was performed with the purified proteins using PCA and PYO as prospective electron acceptors. The standard electron acceptors of an established dehydrogenase enzyme assay (Jahn et al., 2020), phenazine methanosulfate (PMS) and dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), were used as control reaction to verify activity of the enzyme. When either PCA or PYO was used as electron acceptor in this reaction, the Gcd of P. aeruginosa PA14 was able to catalyse the transfer of electrons from glucose to these phenazines, which resulted in their measurable reduction (Fig. 2A and B). A control in which water was used to replace either the substrate or the enzyme did not show any phenazine reduction. We also performed the same assay with Gcd obtained from P. putida KT2440, a prospective organism for limited‐oxygen BES processes (Askitosari et al., 2019). Comparison of the Gcds of P. aeruginosa PA14 and P. putida KT2440 showed 81.64% and 78.93% sequence identities in their nucleotide and amino acid sequences respectively. The enzyme assay with the Gcd of P. putida KT2440 equally showed reduction of PCA and PYO utilizing electrons from glucose oxidation (Fig. 2C and D). No reduction of the phenazines was observed for both enzymes when PQQ or calcium ions were excluded from the reaction (results not shown). The reduction rate of PYO was about 60 times faster than that of PCA for both Gcds (Fig. 2). The experiments clearly confirmed the membrane‐bound glucose dehydrogenases of P. aeruginosa and P. putida as potential phenazine reducing enzymes.

Confirming Gcd‐phenazine reduction in vivo using bioelectrochemical system (BES) Having established that a periplasmic enzyme can interact with phenazines, we tested if this is a major pathway for phenazine reduction in vivo. To ascertain the proportion of electrons generated from the periplasmic glucose oxidation pathway versus downstream cytoplasmic pathways, a BES was set up using three Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strains: a wild‐type strain (KT2440 wt), a glucose dehydrogenase deletion mutant (KT2440 Δgcd), in which the native Gcd was removed, and an overexpression strain, which was supplied with a plasmid for expressing the glucose dehydrogenase of P. aeruginosa PA14 (KT2440 Δgcd–PA14gcd). The Gcd of PA14 was used for the overexpression because PA14 is a natural producer of phenazines and had an overall better performance in the enzyme assay (Fig. 2). The wild‐type and overexpression strains are able to metabolize glucose using the periplasmic as well as the cytoplasmic pathways, while the Gcd mutant strain can only use the cytoplasmic pathway. PCA (80 mg l‐1) or PYO (18 mg l‐1) were added to the system 23 h after inoculation (time point ‘a’ in Fig. 3A and B). A higher concentration of PCA was used because it showed a lower Gcd reduction rate (Fig. 2) and to be in consistency with the amounts typically produced by Pseudomonas in a BES (Askitosari et al., 2019). As expected, no electrons were discharged to the anode during the active aeration growth period (first 31 h) as electrons from glucose oxidation were preferably moved to oxygen (Fig. 3A and B). Fig. 3Electrical current generation in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) of P. putida KT2440 using glucose as substrate and phenazines as electron mediators to the anode. Wild type (KT2440 wt), glucose dehydrogenase deletion mutant (KT2440 Δgcd) and a glucose dehydrogenase overexpression strains of P. putida KT2440 (KT2440 Δgcd –PA14 gcd) were cultivated over a period of 10 days. a: phenazines were added after 23 h of cultivation; b: active supply of oxygen was turned off after 31 h allowing only a limited amount of oxygen through a 0.2 µm sterile filter (passive aeration).A.

Wild type (KT2440 wt), glucose dehydrogenase deletion mutant (KT2440 Δgcd) and a glucose dehydrogenase overexpression strains of P. putida KT2440 (KT2440 Δgcd –PA14 gcd) were cultivated over a period of 10 days. a: phenazines were added after 23 h of cultivation; b: active supply of oxygen was turned off after 31 h allowing only a limited amount of oxygen through a 0.2 µm sterile filter (passive aeration). A. Current density produced using 80 mg l‐1 PCA as electron mediator; (B) current density produced using 18 mg l‐1 PYO as electron mediator. Results are the average of three replicates; errors bar are the SD. The current, however, increased for the three strains once the supply of oxygen was turned off (passive aeration, time point ‘b’ in Fig. 3A and B), indicating that phenazines mediated electrons to the anode (Fig. 3A and B). The KT2440 Δgcd–PA14 gcd strain attained the highest maximum current density (25.9 µA cm‐2) in the PCA‐BES, which was a 55% and 63% increase compared to the KT2440 wt and the KT2440 Δgcd respectively (Fig. 3A). Similarly, in the PYO‐BES, KT2440 Δgcd–PA14 gcd had a peak current density of 12.2 µA cm‐2, while the KT2440 wt and KT2440 Δgcd showed a maximum of 8.5 µA cm‐2 (~ 70% of former) and 4.9 µA cm‐2 (~ 40% of former) respectively (Fig. 3B). Thus, the current density increase for the overexpression strain was somewhat lower in the PCA‐BES, which supports our earlier finding that the PYO enzymatic reduction was faster and more efficient than that with PCA (Fig. 2). The decrease in current density observed in all the BES after the peak current was reached, was primarily due to a slower substrate conversion rate (Table 1) under sustained passive aeration, but also for PYO because of degradation of this phenazine over time. PCA with a half‐life of more than 10 days appeared more stable than PYO, which half‐life was about one day (Fig. 4).

More detailed analyses of glucose metabolism and the products of the direct glucose oxidation showed a correlation with the peak currents. The specific glucose consumption was highest for the first two days of active aeration, with rates being the lowest for the Gcd mutant and highest for the overexpression strain (Table 1). The initial higher glucose conversion rate especially for the overexpression but also the wild‐type strains in both PCA‐ and PYO‐BES could be linked to the utilization of the periplasmic pathway for glucose oxidation. This was confirmed by the presence of gluconate and 2‐ketogluconic acids in the supernatant (Fig 4). The amount of gluconate and 2‐ketogluconic acids were expectedly low (about 0.2 g l‐1) in the wild type (Fig. 4A and B), since the rate of gluconate uptake in P. putida KT2440 is well matched to glucose oxidation with a negligible amount going all the way to 2‐ketogluconate (Nikel et al., 2015). The initial difference in the current density (after turning down the aeration) for both phenazines between the wild type and the mutant confirmed a contribution of the periplasmic pathway (Fig. 4C and D). It seems like phenazines can only access electrons and enable current production with a delay in the absence of Gcd. Meanwhile, the products of the periplasmic pathway were found accumulated in a high amount in the overexpression strain (Fig. 4E and F). In the PCA‐BES, almost 95% of the glucose converted by the overexpression strain was found as gluconate and 2‐ketogluconic acid after 2 days, showing that the sugar oxidation pathway was greatly accelerated by the overexpression; however, sugar acid uptake into the cytosol could not match their production. The effect was similar for this strain in the PYO‐BES, although only 42% of the glucose was found as intermediate products of direct glucose oxidation. The correlation between the metabolic flux increase of the overexpression strain in the glucose oxidation pathway and the increased electron discharge with this strain to the BES anode strongly suggests that the direct glucose oxidation pathway indeed is an important interaction point for phenazines to mediate electrons to the anode. However, if electrons are discharged at this point, no energetic gain for the cell is possible, since the electrons will be diverted away from the electron transport chain, which drives ATP‐production. To quantitatively compare the efficiency of the electron discharge via phenazines, the coulombic efficiency was calculated for the three strains. It gives the fraction of the electrons from glucose oxidation, which was mediated to the anode for current generation via the phenazines. For the PCA‐BES, this value is 4.1%, 5.0% and 8.8% for the wild‐type; Gcd mutant, and the overexpression strain, respectively, while it was expectedly lower in PYO‐BES with 0.8%, 0.8% and 1.3%, because the current was not sustained due to the instability of PYO. A higher columbic efficiency of the overexpression strain is in agreement to the high current density obtained for this strain in comparison with the other strains and to the less complete oxidation of the glucose with accumulated intermediates (Fig. 4E and F). It should be highlighted that a coulombic efficiency of almost 9% is the highest ever observed for phenazine‐based electron discharge with Pseudomonas (Askitosari et al., 2019). Assessing the transfer capacity of phenazines across the cell membrane into the cytosol The finding that the Gcd mutant could still generate current using the phenazines, even though it is not able to utilize the periplasmic direct glucose oxidation pathway, made it likely that phenazines also have access to electrons released in cytoplasmic metabolic pathways. Therefore, we developed two molecular biosensors to ascertain if phenazines, after initial release when synthesized or when externally added to the cell, could (re‐)enter the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). The first biosensor was made to track PCA and was based on the two reaction steps that modify PCA to PYO catalysed by the two enzymes PhzM, a methyltransferase, and PhzS, a monoxygenase (Mavrodi et al., 2001). The genes encoding PhzM and PhzS were expressed via a plasmid in KT2440 and a PA14 mutant strain, lacking the PCA biosynthetic genes (P. aeruginosa PA14 Δphz1,2) (Schmitz and Rosenbaum, 2020). Since neither organism can produce phenazines, but now house the cytosolic enzymes PhzM and PhzS, it is expected that externally added PCA would be transformed to PYO, only if PCA has access to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). Both biosensors (PA14 Δphz1,2‐MS and KT2440‐MS) converted externally added PCA (40 mg l‐1) to about 8 mg l‐1 PYO after 3 h (Fig. 6A). Less than 2 mg l‐1 PYO was detected in an in vitro PCA reduction assay using just the supernatant of the biosensor culture, which had been induced but was never supplied with PCA. This confirmed that majority of PCA conversion occurred in the cytoplasm and was not a result of secreted enzymes or lysed cells.

P. aeruginosa PA14 ∆phz1,2‐pMexG‐gfp (biosensor) and P. putida KT2440‐pMexG‐gfp (biosensor) and their respective controls were induced after 3 h for the expression of Gfp with 4 mg l‐1 (20 µM) PYO or 9 mg l‐1 (40 µM) PCA and cultivated for 16 h. The fluorescence of the control strains shows the auto‐fluorescence of the organism.

P. aeruginosa PA14 ∆phz1,2‐pMexG‐gfp (biosensor) and P. putida KT2440‐pMexG‐gfp (biosensor) and their respective controls were induced after 3 h for the expression of Gfp with 4 mg l‐1 (20 µM) PYO or 9 mg l‐1 (40 µM) PCA and cultivated for 16 h. The fluorescence of the control strains shows the auto‐fluorescence of the organism. Fluorescence of the Gfp construct without phenazine addition shows untargeted induction of the pMexG promotor, for example by other redox‐active compounds. Unpaired t‐test was used to compare the fluorescence of Gfp and is represented as (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 and n.s.‐no statistical significance‐P > 0.05). Results are average of three replicates, and error bars represent the SD. Next, we designed a biosensor, which could enable us to evaluate whether PYO has access to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). PYO has been shown to activate the constitutively expressed transcription factor SoxR by a reversible one‐electron oxidation of its [2Fe‐2S] cluster (Dietrich et al., 2006; Sheplock et al., 2013; Tschirhart et al., 2017). This activation in P. aeruginosa induces the expression of proteins including the MexGHI‐OpmD efflux pump operon, which likely is involved in phenazine export (Palma et al., 2005). We constructed the promoter of this operon (pMexG) from PA14, which preceded a gfp reporter gene in a plasmid and transformed it to PA14 Δphz1,2 and KT2440 to generate biosensors (PA14 Δphz1,2‐pMexG Gfp and KT2440‐pMexG Gfp) in which the respective native SoxR can serve as a redox‐sensing regulator for gfp expression (Fig. 5B). Biosensors induced with PYO showed more Gfp fluorescence as compared to the un‐induced or those induced with PCA (Fig. 6B). Un‐induced biosensors, however, showed some fluorescence (Figs 6B and 7), which might be a result of superoxide ions generated during aerobic growth, which are able to activate SoxR although such oxidation is less effective in P. aeruginosa (Fujikawa et al., 2012). Inability of PCA to yield significant fluorescence compared to the un‐induced biosensor could be a result of its low redox potential, since SoxR is only activated by phenazines of high redox potential (Sheplock et al.,
2013; Sakhtah et al., 2016). Although SoxR in P. aeruginosa and P. putida have a similar DNA binding domain (Park et al., 2006; Sheplock et al., 2013), the PYO‐induced KT2440 biosensor shows a comparatively lower fluorescence in respect to its PA14 counterpart. This may be due to the fact that KT2440 SoxR was unable to completely activate the pMexG promoter, since the respective operon is not part of its native target regulon (Park et al., 2006).

Overall, both biosensors independently show that PCA and PYO, once released from the cell after synthesis, are able to re‐enter the cytoplasm and therefore are able to access the diverse enzymatic reactions, for which an interaction with phenazines has already been described in vitro (Glasser et al., 2017; Jo et al., 2020).
