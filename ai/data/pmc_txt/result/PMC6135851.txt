Results DNA cytosine methylation varies during development of Streptomycetes Genomic DNA was extracted from different developmental stages of S. coelicolor M145, S. avermitilis ATCC 31267, S. griseus NBRC 102592 and S. lividans 1326 and analyzed by dot blot assay using the antibody against 5-MeC (Fig. 1). To our surprise, this analysis showed that cytosine methylation is higher at the MI stage than at the MII stages in all the conditions (solid GYM cultures and sucrose-free R5A liquid medium) and species analysed (Fig. 1). Aerial hyphae (MII48h) showed to have the lowest levels of methylated DNA in S. coelicolor development in solid GYM cultures (Fig. 1a), while MII hyphae (MII55h) showed the lowest methylation levels in liquid sucrose-free R5A cultures (Fig. 1b).Figure 1Methylation levels along the different growth phases of S. coelicolor, S. lividans, S. griseus and S. avermitilis.

S. coelicolor M145, S. griseus and S. avermitilis degrade exogenous methylated DNA, while S. lividans does not38,39. S. lividans 1326 and S. coelicolor M145 are different in accepting methylated DNA, but they have a very similar genome and a similar development40. Despite of that, DNA cytosine methylation during development is comparable in all the Streptomyces species in all the growth phases analyzed (higher at the MI stage), indicating that (i) the cytosine methylation is conserved in the Streptomycetaceae family, (ii) has a broader role on Streptomyces differentiation and (iii) is not only a tag to recognize and degrade exogenous DNA. Effect of cytosine demethylation using 5-aza-dC on S. coelicolor M145 differentiation Thus, to assess whether the modulation of cytosine methylation could have a role on morphological and physiological differentiation, a treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was performed. Experiments for the set-up of the cytosine DNA demethylation treatment were carried out, as described in the methods. Streptomyces coelicolor M145 cultures were treated with 5 µM of the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-dC every 12 h. Analysis under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) after SYTO 9 and PI staining demonstrated that 5-aza-dC reduced spore germination up to 65% in respect to the 95% of the untreated culture after 9 h of growth. After 12 h, the spores of the treated culture were germinated as those of the untreated culture (Fig. 2a–c). Growth curves on solid medium of the untreated and the 5-aza-dC treated S. coelicolor M145 cultures revealed that there was little effect of 5-aza-dC on bacterial growth for the first 63 h; after 63 h, the treated culture grew very slowly and remained in stationary phase (Fig. 2d). At 72 h and 96 h the 5-aza-dC treated samples showed the multinucleated secondary mycelium (MII) characterized by non-septate branching non-sporulating hyphae (Fig. 2f), while the untreated culture presented spore chains and single spores (Fig. 2e). In the 5-aza-dC treated culture, the undecylprodigiosin (red pigment) and actinorhodin (blue pigment) production was decreased compared to the untreated culture (Fig. 2g,h).Figure 2Effect of 5-aza-dC treatment on S. coelicolor morphological and physiological differentiation on solid GYM.

In liquid sucrose-free R5A cultures, the addition of 5-aza-dC decreased growth rate (Fig. 3a) and delayed spore germination; indeed, ungerminated spores were still present at 20 h in the treated culture, as visualized by CLSM (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the 5-aza-dC treated liquid culture, undecylprodigiosin production started later in the treated culture, but after 100 h, the yields were similar (Fig. 3b), while actinorhodin production was 4-fold lower and started later compared to the untreated culture (Fig. 3c).Figure 3Effect of 5-aza-dC treatment in sucrose-free liquid R5A cultures.

Taken together, these experiments revealed that 5-aza-dC induces a delay in morphological differentiation both in liquid and solid medium, influencing spore germination, mycelium development and sporulation; in addition, actinorhodin yield was impaired. Construction of a mutant in the putative DNA methyltransferase SCO1731 gene Bioinformatics analysis revealed that S. coelicolor M145 encodes 38 putative DNA methyltransferases (Table 1). The expression profile of these putative DNA methyltransferases was compared to the transcriptomic data, previously obtained using the same growth media29. This search revealed that SCO1731 displayed the highest transcription level among the putative methyltransferase genes in MI and has orthologs in S. lividans 1326 genome (100% identity), S. avermitilis ATCC 31267 (79%) and S. griseus strain NBRC 102592 (64%).Table 1List of putative methyltransferases annotated in S. coelicolor genome (StrepDB - The Streptomyces Annotation Server).Putative methyltransferaseLog 2 Ratio MII24h/MIExpression phase

A negative ratio indicates that the gene is more transcribed in MI, a positive one that is more transcribed in MII 24 h. The ratios were taken from Yagüe et al.29. Thus, since methylation levels were found higher in MI we evaluated if this gene is important for cytosine methylation by generating a mutant using a cosmid containing the gene interrupted by the transposon Tn506241. In liquid sucrose-free R5A cultures, disruption of SCO1731 did not significantly alter the growth kinetics (Fig. 4a) and spore germination (Supplementary Fig. S1) of the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain, indicating that this gene is not critical for bacterial growth under the used conditions.Figure 4Growth and cytosine methylation of the S. coelicolor wild-type strain, the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant and the complemented SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant, in sucrose-free R5A cultures.

(b) cytosine methylation levels at 20-hours (MI). AU indicate arbitrary units of methylation levels. The full length blots are included as Supplementary Fig. S9. Dot blot analysis demonstrated that the cytosine methylation levels were strongly reduced in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain at 20 h (MI) (from 44, 38 × 105 ± 2 × 105 to 9, 8 × 105 ± 1, 6 × 105) (Fig. 4b). Conversely, the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant had a slight effect on cytosine methylation after 55 h of growth (MII) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Actinorhodin (blue pigment) was not observed in the SCO1731 mutant strain in liquid sucrose-free R5A even after 96 h of growth (Fig. 5), revealing that the mutant is impaired in actinorhodin production. SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant cultures produced undecylprodigiosin (red color) (Fig. 5).Figure 5Actinorhodin production in sucrose-free R5A cultures of the S. coelicolor wild-type strain, the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant and the SCO1731::Tn5062 complemented strain.

Macroscopic view of laboratory flasks is shown at different developmental time points (48 h, 72 h and 96 h). Blue color corresponds to actinorhodin; red colour corresponds to undecylprodigiosin. Likewise, the inactivation of SCO1731 caused a marked delay in morphological and physiological differentiation on solid GYM (Fig. 6): aerial mycelium formation started at 96 h in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain compared to the 48 h in the wild-type strain; spore chains were not formed up to 96 h in the mutant strain compared to 72 h in the wild-type strain; actinorhodin (blue color) and undecylprodigiosin (red color) were strongly reduced in the mutant strain.Figure 6Morphological differentiation of the S. coelicolor wild-type strain, the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant and the SCO1731::Tn5062 complemented strain on GYM plates.

These results indicate that SCO1731 is responsible for methylation of cytosine in MI and it is involved in the regulation of actinorhodin production and morphological differentiation. A complemented strain harboring a copy of the SCO1731 ORF and its upstream region large enough to include the promoter region, was generated. In the SCO1731_compl strain, the methylation levels were restored to 70% of the wild-type methylation level (Fig. 4b), the morphological development (aerial mycelium and sporulation) was fully restored (Fig. 6), and actinorhodin production was reestablished at 96 h, but not at 72 h (Fig. 5). The control strain, containing a copy of the empty integrative vector used for complementation (S. coelicolor + pNG3), showed a normal antibiotic production profile (Fig. 5) and development (Fig. 6), excluding an effect of pNG3 integration on the phenotypes observed in the SCO1731_compl strain.
