2. Results 2.1. Characteristics of Multiphage-Resistant Strains More than 200 P. aeruginosa strains from our collection originating from cystic fibrosis (CF) and burn patients were tested for their susceptibility to ten phages belonging to different genera and which use as primary receptors eitherT4P, LPS or specifically O-antigen (Table S1). The phage collection included LeviOr01, a Levivirus [48], and PhiKZ, a giant phage [49]. Serial dilutions of the phage were spotted on bacterial lawns. Nineteen strains were not lysed by any phage (9.5%), whereas at the opposite of the spectrum, 15 strains were susceptible to six phages or more (7.5%). To test whether the resistant bacteria were expressing common phage receptors, absorption assays were performed with six virulent phages (Ab01, Ab05, Ab09, Ab17, Ab22 and Ab27, belonging to different genera and which used either LPS or T4P as receptors), and none of them attached to the MPhR strains, suggesting that the receptors were absent or hidden. Next, the LPS of five MPhR strains (PAC2-18, PAC7-25, PAC8-15, PcyII-29 and PcyII-40) and three susceptible strains (PAO1, PcyII-10 and PcyII-57) were extracted and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Figure 1). In PAO1, short and long O-antigen B chains were observed, whereas PcyII-10 and PcyII-57 apparently lacked short B chains but possessed very long B chains. All the resistant strains lacked long and very long B chains while possibly possessing short B chains, which migrate like A chains. Consequently, they were O-antigen-defective, explaining why these cells were not typable. Concerning the core on which the O-antigen is attached, PcyII-29 possessed only inner core species, whereas PAC2-18, PAC7-25 and PAC8-15 produced mostly uncapped cores. The core +1 band in PcyII-40 was very abundant. PcyII-10 (serotype O6), a highly susceptible strain, and four nontypable MPhR strains (PAC7-25, PAC8-15, PcyII-29 and PcyII-40) were selected for additional analyses. Multiple locus Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) genotyping of these strains suggested that they belonged to different genetic clusters (data not shown) [3]. PcyII-29 and PcyII-40 formed rough colonies with sharp edges and displayed autolysis, whereas PAC7-25 formed small round colonies and PAC8-15 was mucoid (Figure S1). Upon overnight culture in Luria broth (LB) medium, floating cell aggregates were observed with PAC7-25 and PcyII-29. We then analyzed the motility of the bacteria, a complex behavior mediated by different extracellular structures. Type IV pili are essential for twitching and are involved in biofilm formation [51,52]. All phage-resistant strains showed reduced capacities to twitch (Figure 2A), suggesting that they were deficient in pili synthesis. Interestingly, the biofilm formation was high with PcyII-29 and PcyII-40 as compared to the other strains (Figure 2B). The capacity to swarm was altered in PAC8-15 and PcyII-40 as compared to PcyII-10 and was absent in PcyII-29 and PAC7-25 (Figure S2), suggesting a defect in the biosynthesis of pili, flagella or surfactant molecules, as previously reported [53]. 2.2. Genome Sequence Characteristics The genomes of three MPhR strains (PcyII-29, PcyII-40 and PAC7-25) and one sensitive strain (PcyII-10), all susceptible to antibiotics, were sequenced by a combination of PacBio and Illumina technologies, allowing the chromosome assembly into a single molecule. The size and some characteristics of the genomes sequenced in this work are indicated in Table 1. The three MPhR strains had genomes significantly larger than those of PcyII-10 and PAO1 (AE004091 size 6,264,404 bp). Alignment of the four genomes with MAUVE showed a similar architecture with locally collinear blocks (internally free from genome rearrangement [54]), except for an inversion of two regions shown with light blue and purple in Figure S3. The MLVA (Table S2) and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (Table S3) codes were deduced from the sequences, and clustering analyses were performed, confirming that the strains were genetically clearly distinct. Interestingly, in PAC7-25, four IS elements were present in VNTR loci used in the MLVA assay, which prevented amplification by PCR, as previously reported [3,55]. Coding sequence identification and annotation of the four genomes were performed, making use of data from published genomes. To question the mechanisms of resistance to phages, and since tens of genes may potentially be involved, we focused our analyses on regions known to possess genes responsible for the biosynthesis of primary receptors. We also investigated the accessory genomes encompassing prophages, genomic islands and other MGEs possibly associated with defense mechanisms. We compared the genome of the three resistant bacteria to that of PcyII-10 and to reference strains and investigated sequences presenting important differences. 2.3. The LPS and O-antigen Biosynthesis Genes Biosynthesis of the three LPS domains, the lipid A, the core and the O polysaccharide A and B chains requires the expression of a large number of gene products [56]. The MPhR strains were nontypable and presented a deficiency in LPS production. In an attempt at finding the basis for this deficiency, we first analyzed genes responsible for the synthesis of the O-antigen, as described in [57] (Figure S4). A cluster of genes responsible for serotype O:6 O-antigen biosynthesis similar to that of strain LESB58 (NC_011770) [18] was found in both PcyII-10 and PAC7-25. The cluster was intact in PcyII-10, whereas in PAC7-25, one of the genes (PLES-19151 in LESB58) encoding a glycosyltransferase was interrupted by the insertion of a 1201 bp IS element (position 2,017,419). In strain PcyII-29, which possessed a cluster corresponding to serotype O:4, a 1239 bp IS was inserted into the same gene as in PAC7-25. In PcyII-40, the cluster corresponding to serotype O:11 appeared intact as compared to that of the reference serogroup O:11 strain PA103 [58]. We previously analyzed in detail the constitution of LPS in reference strain PAO1 and variants resisting different bacteriophages to uncover the effects of various mutations [39]. The structure of LPS in PcyII-40 as observed by PAGE analysis (Figure 1) was similar to that of a PAO1 mutant defective in Wzy, the glycosyltransferase responsible for linking groups of three sugars to form B-chains [39]. Such mutants lack long B chains and show the presence of high amounts of the core+ 1 subunit. However, the LPS defect in PcyII-40 could not be attributed to the Wzy protein, as it was identical to that of PA103 (Figure S5). Similarly, the wzz1 and wzz2 genes, both essential for very long B chain synthesis in strain PA103 [59], did not show modifications in PcyII-40 as compared to PA103 (PcyII-40 open reading frame (ORF) 4661 in genome LR739069 is equivalent to Wzz2 PAO10938). LPS analysis previously revealed that PcyII-10 produced very long B chains and little long and medium chains, such as observed in strain PA14 and attributed in this strain to mutations in migA [60]. The mutation R92Q was found in PcyII-10 and in PA14 but not the second mutation, V170M, and there was no defect in production of the uncapped core in PcyII-10. PcyII-29 also showed the R92Q substitution. Little variation was seen in the cluster of genes involved in core oligosaccharide gene synthesis, as described by Liebens et al. [61]. In PAC7-25 and PcyII-10, a gene encoding an Aspargine synthetase (PcyII10_5205 in genome LT673656) was found upstream of this cluster that was absent in the other two strains, but its role is not known. 2.4. Pili and Flagella Over 40 genes distributed into several clusters at different locations in the genome are known to be involved in the T4P biosynthesis [62,63,64]. These genes were investigated in search for characteristics or mutations that could explain the apparent absence of functional T4P in the MPhR strains. In the pilMNOPQ cluster, a phase-variation mutation in PcyII-29 pilN predicted the production of a shorter protein. PilN and PilO dimerize and anchor the complex in the periplasmic membrane, where it becomes associated with other proteins to produce a transenvelope complex that interacts with PilA [65]. A group of three genes involved in the synthesis of fimbriae (two fimbrial proteins and a pilus assembly chaperone, ORFs 0499, 0500 and 0501 respectively in PcyII-10 genome LT673656) showed differences between PcyII-10 and the MPhR strains. The chaperone gene fimC was very different between PAC7-25 and PcyII-10, and one of the fimbrial protein (PcyII10_0500 in genome LT673656) was absent in PAC7-25 and PcyII-29, whereas the cluster of three genes was absent in PcyII-40 [66]. Minor differences were observed in the other genes, such as a 18-bp insertion in chpA in PcyII-40. This gene encodes a large chemosensory protein involved in motility [67]. 2.5. The Accessory Genome: Regions of Genome Plasticity Mathee et al. defined an RGP as any region of at least four contiguous ORFs that is missing in at least one other P. aeruginosa genome [11]. Using this definition, we identified genomic regions that were variably present in the analyzed strains. They corresponded mostly to MGEs (prophages, R-M systems and GIs), but a few clusters of genes were also differentially distributed. The three MPhR strains displayed numerous MGEs, the majority of which were absent in the phage-susceptible strains PAO1 and PcyII-10, which explained the difference in genome sizes. In addition to the presence of MGEs at known RGPs, we identified three insertion sites that were not previously described (RGP95, 96 and 97). 2.6. Prophages and Genomic Islands We used IslandViewer to identify regions that most probably were MGEs [18]. We also searched specifically for prophages using PHASTER and combined the results of the two analyses in Table S4 (the major component of the island is indicated in the column “element”). Each region is called using the strain name and an MGE number. Among common features found in the four strains was the presence of a gene cluster at RGP 3+4 encoding a R2-type pyocin [68,69]. The locus was inside a group of genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, in between trpE and trpG [70]. Several other common sites (shown with the same color on Table S4) were shown to harbor different MGEs. One or two copies of Pf1-like phages were inserted at different positions in the PcyII-10, PAC7-25 and PcyII-29 genomes (Table S4). The genome of these prophages varied in size, as previously observed in other P. aeruginosa strains [71]. Similarly, phages with genomes close to that of the F10 siphovirus [72] were observed in PcyII-29 and PcyII-40, with noticeable differences. At the same position in the three F10-like phage genomes, before genes encoding a holin and an endolysin, PCYII-40_MGE3 possessed a HicAB-type toxin-antitoxin system (ORF PCYII40_0891 and PCYII40_0892 showing similarities with antitoxin YncN) [73], whereas PCYII-40_MGE4 had Asn-tRNA and thr-tRNA genes, and PCYII-29_MGE2, a group of genes of unknown function and an integrase. PAC7-25_MGE1 contained a type I R-M system inserted together with a phi3-like (KT887559) prophage (PAC7-25_MGE2) adjacent to the Met tRNA gene. In PAC7-25_MGE4, a type II and a type III R-M system were found in a 24-kb island also containing several mobile elements. PAC7-25_MGE5 was a genomic island found in its wholeness in a single P. aeruginosa strain, LW (CP022478), and partially in a few other Pseudomonas species. PAC7-25_MGE6 corresponded to the 64-kb Pf725A prophage that we previously characterized as belonging to the F116-family of transposable phages (Genbank LT603684) [74]. PAC7-25_MGE7 contained a RelBE TA (toxin/antitoxin) addiction module. PAC7-25_MGE8 was a Pf1-like phage at position 5,564,441-5,574,343, a previously undescribed insertion site near the tRNASec gene. We called this new site RGP95, corresponding to position 4802/4803 in PAO1. Nine MGEs were found in PcyII-29 of which three were intact prophages: PCYII-29_MGE2, PCYII-29_MGE5 and PCYII-29_MGE8. PCYII-29_MGE3 was a 30-kb island including two phage integrases, a transposase, a reverse transcriptase and a type I R-M system (RGP96). No repeated sequences were identified at the junctions of these elements. PCYII-29_MGE4 corresponded to a genomic island observed in LESB58 (LESGI-2) and containing the naringenin-chalcone synthase gene followed by the cluster of genes for pyoluteorin biosynthesis, a polyketide antibiotic with a strong bactericide and fungicide activity [75]. It included the regulatory gene pltZ, previously found in P. fluorescens, and an ABC transporter, as in Pseudomonas sp. M18, which plays a role in self-resistance against the toxic effect of pyoluteorin [76]. It was previously found in P. aeruginosa strain LESB58 at the same position. PCYII-29_MGE6 was a 78-kb island encompassing a prophage tail biosynthesis gene cluster, and PCYII-29_MGE7 was a 56-kb genomic island encompassing a type I R-M system, helicases, kinases and genes of unknown functions, with several phage integrases and transposases. PCYII-29_MGE8 combined the PAGI-6 genomic island and a copy of a phiCTX-like phage. Finally PCYII-29_MGE9 corresponded to a 103-kb pKLC102-like ICE originally described in clone C strains [77,78]. It is inserted next to the lys tRNA structural gene, as previously observed in other P. aeruginosa isolates [78,79]. Among its 110 ORFs, this ICE possessed a cluster of T4P genes and the ndvB gene conferring biofilm-specific antibiotic resistance. In PcyII-40, 15 MGEs could be observed, including seven intact prophages and an R-plasmid. PCYII-40_MGE13 corresponded to the insertion of a mu-like phage (phage PfII40a) at RGP 97 that we previously described [80]. Among the other prophages, two were F10-like, one was phiCTX-like and one was pf1-like. Two phages were completely new, PCYII-40_MGE5 and PCYII-40_MGE8. The PCYII-40_MGE8 genome showed some similarities with phage AF and Ab31 [25] and had 83% similarity over some part of its genome with phage ctdb7, a putative podovirus with a 42,196-bp-long genome identified in an animal virosphere by a metagenomics approach (MH593831). Two type I R-M systems were present at PCYII-40_MGE1 and PCYII-40_MGE12. PCYII-40_MGE6 held a cluster of genes responsible for conjugative transfer and cation efflux system genes. PCYII-40_MGE7 possessed genes responsible for the transport and efflux of different molecules and an S2 pyocin (ORF 3128 in genome LR739069). PCYII-40_MGE9 possessed another cluster of genes responsible for conjugative transfer, as well as genes encoding efflux transporters. In addition to the regions found by IslandViewer, we detected a cluster of four genes (located at positions 1,273,527 to 1,278,865) encoding a pyocin-S2-associated to the DNA recombinase e14, an integrase and an exeA-like protein. Another pyocin-S2 (ORF 4429) and its immunity protein (ORF 4428) were found at positions 4,731689 to 4,734023 [81]. By Blast, the pyocin matched HNH nucleases of the colicin family. 2.7. CRISPR-Cas Systems In PcyII-10, three Type I-F CRISPR arrays with the same 28-bp repeat were identified using CRISPRCasFinder [82]. CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 were clustered at RGP12, at positions 2,784,771–2,785,758 (20 repeats) and 2,794,282–2,795,509 (23 repeats), respectively, separated by a group of six cas genes, as previously observed [34], whereas CRISPR3 was at position 1,488,702–1,490,109 (24 repeats). No CRISPR-Cas system was observed in PAC7-25 and PcyII-40. PcyII-29 possessed a single CRISPR array, with sixteen repeats at position 1,522,234–1,523,041 (corresponding to CRISPR3 of PcyII-10). The 28-bp consensus repeat was that of the P. aeruginosa type I-F system. In this strain, CRISPR1, CRISPR2 and the cas genes were absent, and there was no other deleted sequence at this position. 2.8. Transposases and IS We used IS saga and MicroScope to identify regions encoding transposases. A large number of transposases and IS elements often associated with RGPs were found in the three MPhR strains and were absent in PcyII-10 (Table S5). Members of the IS3 and IS9 families were found in the four genomes, whereas each strain possessed a particular family of IS, sometimes in high copy numbers. In PAC7-25, 14 copies of a 1017-bp IS110 element (related to ISPa11) were present, but none were detected in the other strains. IS110 copies were inserted into four VNTRs (ms142, ms211, ms212 and ms216), as observed by an in silico MLVA analysis. PAC7-25 also specifically possessed an IS5-like element and an IS200-like element. Five copies of an IS3-like element (detected in two consecutive fragments) were observed, three of them being associated with a genomic island. IS3-like elements were also found in the other strains, some inserted at the same site. In PcyII-29, a large number of IS3-like sequences with homologies to IS222, a 1234-bp P. aeruginosa IS, were found [83,84]. Several of them were present together with other IS and with an R-M system at RGP6 and RGP96. Tn3 elements were detected at RGP23 in PCYII-29_MGE6. PcyII-40 also held multiple IS3-like elements, as well as ISL3 and IS481. These elements were associated with R-M systems, with a plasmid and with pyocin-S2. Tn3 were present with plasmid Rms148 (PCYII-40_MGE7). 2.9. Activation of Prophages and Phage Tail Pyocins In order to identify viable prophages in the three MPhR strains, bacterial cultures were treated with mitomycin C (MitC) during exponential growth, resulting in rapid and massive lysis. The culture supernatant was enriched in phage particles for electron microscopy (EM) examination and for DNA purification and sequencing. Upon EM examination of the PAC7-25 supernatant, large amounts of phages with large heads (~77–78 nm) and what appeared to be thin tails (shown with an arrow) and R-type pyocins were observed (Figure 3A). The PcyII-29 supernatant contained siphoviruses with a ~68-nm head and a ~150-nm flexible tail, as well as R-type pyocins (Figure 3B). For PcyII-40, at least two different tailed phages were observed by EM with large amounts of vesicles, R type pyocins and ~50-nm tubes attached in groups of two to four (Figure 3C). The presence of vesicles could be related to explosive cell lysis mediated by the endolysin of R pyocins, as previously described [85]. Such vesicles are vectors for multiple molecules and DNA. The viral particles were digested with DNase 1 to eliminate contaminating cellular DNA followed by lysis, DNA purification and sequencing. For each sample, the Illumina sequencing reads were mapped onto the corresponding bacterial sequenced genomes, revealing the existence of peaks of activated prophages. For PAC7-25, a single phage was activated corresponding to Pf725A. Figure 4 shows the mapping of the reads from the PcyII-29 and PcyII-40 MitC-activated virions along the genome of their host (PcyII-29 and PcyII-40, respectively). For PcyII-29, peaks of reads were observed for phages inserted at PCYII-29_MGE2 (F10-like) and PCYII-29_MGE8 (phiCTX-like), corresponding to 97% and 0.8% of total reads, respectively (Table S6). Some bacterial DNA was present and aligned over the whole genome sequence. For PcyII-40, five peaks corresponded to prophages PCYII-40_MGE3, PCYII-40_MGE4, PCYII-40_MGE5, PCYII-40_MGE8 and PCYII-40_MGE13 with, respectively, 52%, 6.6%, 0.1%, 35.5% and 0.026% of reads (Table S7). We could assemble the reads to a single contig for these different activated phages, and they allowed defining the precise insertion site in the bacterial chromosome. Interestingly, 2% of bacterial reads present in the MitC-induced phage particles appeared to map mostly on one side of the phage PCYII-40_MGE8 insertion site (ATCACCATGCAGTT), extending over 170,000 bp. We then mapped the reads onto the PAO1Or genome (Genbank LN871187), which lacks the PCYII-40_MGE8 prophage (Figure 5). It allowed distinguishing a high peak covering 30kb and starting at the precise position of attB (3,367,309) and, on its left side, three additional peaks of decreasing intensity, each extending over 46kb, the size of the phage genome. A small proportion of reads was present on the other side of the prophage insertion site. The existence of these bacterial sequences in MitC-activated virions is compatible with the packaging of DNA of the phage size, starting at a viral pac site localized about 16kb from the insertion site during the process of full-head packaging. At this position, we found the motif GCTAAA at the end of the gene encoding the terminase, similarly to the pac site described for SaPi in Staphylococcus aureus [86]. In order to try and recover the activated prophages, the supernatant of the MitC-induced cells was tested by spot assay on a large collection of strains. Pf725A, the F116-like phage spontaneously released from PAC7-25, could grow on PcyII-10 and PAO1Or [74]. For PcyII-29, a single phage called PfII29a producing very small clear plaques could be obtained on strain PcyII-36 and corresponded to a F10-like phage (PCYII-29_MGE2), as confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Attempts to isolate the phiCTX-like phage (PCYII_29_MGE8) failed. Although four phages appeared to be highly activated in MitC-induced PCYII-40, as shown by the peaks of reads in Figure 4, only three different phages were obtained from the supernatant. We identified a mu-like phage (PfII40a) growing on reference strain PA14 and on PcyII-10 (small, clear plaques with a halo) and two F10-like phages, PfII40b (PCYII-40_MGE3) and PfII40c (PCYII-40_MGE4), growing on PAO1 and PcyII-33 respectively. PfII-40c also grew on strain PAC9-6, making turbid plaques after 24 h that enlarged and became clear 48 h after infection. PfII40a (PCYII-40_MGE13) was previously isolated from spontaneous induction (Genbank LT608331). The integration of the PfII40a genome into the bacterial chromosome during the productive replication cycle is described in more detailed in [80]. The phage PCYII-40_MGE8 appeared to be highly induced based on the number of reads, but we failed to recover this phage following the infection of 20 different P. aeruginosa strains.
