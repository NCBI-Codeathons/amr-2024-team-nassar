["2. Results", "The main goals of this work were to test if Tei3 acts as a non-inducible phosphorylase and to investigate which ligand could be sensed by Tei3. Considering A. teichomyceticus a challenging microorganism for gene-engineering manipulations, a series of genetic experiments were designed and performed in heterologous hosts such as S. coelicolor M512 [38] and S. coelicolor J3200 [31]. As anticipated in the introduction, S. coelicolor has a full set of van genes conferring vancomycin resistance, although it does not produce any GPAs [39]. S. coelicolor M512 does not produce the pigmented antibiotics actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin [38], permitting the use of a \u03b2-glucuronidase (GusA)-based reporter assay, as described below. The second strain\u2014J3200\u2014is the \u0394vanSSc mutant, in which the host vanS gene was knocked out [31]. Thus, the experimental steps described below aimed: (1) to test if the heterologous Tei3 can cross-phosphorylate the host VanRSc; (2) to build a gusA-based reporter S. coelicolor strain, able to convert X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-glucuronide) to 5,5\u2032-dibromo-4,4\u2032-dichloro-indigo following GPA induction; (3) to utilize the created reporter strain to show if Tei3 needs the presence of GPAs or not; (4) to replace the SD of the host VanSSc with its counterpart from Tei3 and test which GPAs may act as ligands for Tei3 SD.", "2.1. Heterologous Expression of Tei3 SHK Leads to Teicoplanin and A40926 Resistance in S. coelicolor M512", "VanRS-like two-component regulatory pairs are conserved enough among actinobacteria to show a certain degree of cross-talking [33,40]. For example, it was shown that VanRSc (coming from S. coelicolor) could be phosphorylated in vivo by VanSSt (from A47934 producer S. toyocaensis), but not vice versa, implying that VanRSc is accessible for non-cognate SHKs [33]. In this case, SHKs and RRs both came from Streptomyces spp. Instead, it was necessary to check if Tei3 SHK from A. teichomyceticus (order Micromonosporales) could phosphorylate VanRSc. Overall, Tei2 and Tei3 share a high percentage of aa sequence identity with VanRSc and VanSSc: 91% and 67%, respectively. Tei3 and VanSSc are collinear, sharing highly similar transmembrane helix (TMHs) regions and conserved putative autophosphorylation sites (Figure 1a). The most divergent region between Tei3 and VanSSc is the extracytoplasmic sensory loop (ESL), implying that quite different ligands should be recognized by the two proteins (Figure 1a). At the same time, Tei2 and VanRSc were almost identical (Figure 1b). Thus, it seems plausible that Tei3 would be able to phosphorylate VanRSc in vivo.", "To test if Tei3 can phosphorylate the non-cognate RR\u2014VanRSc, tei3 was cloned into the pSET152A vector, giving pGP101, and then transferred into S. coelicolor M512. The obtained recombinant strain\u2014S. coelicolor M101\u2014gained teicoplanin and A40926 resistance, in addition to the endogenous vancomycin resistance (Figure 2). Consequently, it could be concluded that Tei3 phosphorylates VanRSc in vivo. However, this experiment did not clarify whether Tei3 acts as a constitutive phosphorylase, considering that teicoplanin and A40926 added to the plates could serve as its activators.", "2.2. Tei3 Acts as a Non-Inducible Phosphorylase", "Expression of tei2-3-4 and tei7-6-5 operons remains stable throughout the life cycle of A. teichomyceticus, independently from the teicoplanin concentration [35,37], pathway-specific regulation [36], and growth phase [37]. Previous papers speculated about the need of a strong constitutive promoter driving tei2-3-4 expression [37] or of the presence of specific mutations in Tei3 that might explain its function as a constitutive phosphorylase, working independently from the presence of any extracellular GPA [35]. Protein sequence comparison indicated that Tei3 carries single aa substitutions in two sites where analogous mutations transform the vancomycin-inducible VanSSc into a constitutive phosphorylase [35]. Specifically, these are L216P and G271V substitutions [31]. Homologous sites in Tei3 are N215 and R270 (Figure 1a). However, there are multiple other sites within the putative ATPase domain (ATPaseD) of Tei3, which significantly diverged from VanSSc (see Figure 1a).", "To experimentally verify the GPA inducibility of Tei3, a bioassay responding to the inducers of van genes was first developed in S. coelicolor. Other authors previously described a reporter S. coelicolor strain, where the endogenous vanJ promoter (vanJp) was cloned into a multicopy plasmid, fused with the kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene\u2014neo\u2014in a way that induction of vanJp by vancomycin conferred resistance to both neomycin and kanamycin [39]. Using this experience, either vanJp or the other endogenous vancomycin-responsive S. coelicolor vanHAX promoter (vanHp) was fused with the gusA gene, coding for a \u03b2-glucuronidase in the pGUS chassis [44]. vanJp or vanHp activation by GPAs in the reporter strain should activate the chromogenic conversion of the X-Gluc substrate into the green-colored 5,5\u2032-dibromo-4,4\u2032-dichloro-indigo [44]. Thus, plasmids pGHp (carrying vanHp-gusA) and pGJp (carrying vanJp-gusA) were transferred to S. coelicolor M512 by means of intergeneric conjugation with Escherichia coli ET12567 pUZ8002+. The inducibility of the two generated reporter strains S. coelicolor pGHp+ and pGJp+ was first tested in liquid medium and then in solid plates. When vancomycin was added at 10 \u00b5g/mL to 50 h old cultures in TSB liquid medium, the basal glucuronidase activity of the mycelia was increased by, ca., twenty- and forty-fold, in S. coelicolor pGHp+ and pGJp+, respectively (Figure S1), indicating that vanJp seems more responsive to vancomycin than vanHp. In solid media containing 25 \u00b5g/mL of X-Gluc, the presence of vancomycin induced vanJp-mediated glucuronidase activity in recombinant strains, yielding green halos around the Whatman discs soaked in antibiotic solution (Figure 3 and Figure S2). S. coelicolor pGJp+ acted very well as a reporter, giving a detectable chromogenic conversion in response to very low concentrations of vancomycin (250 ng, Figure S2), whereas S. coelicolor pGHp+ resulted as much less responsive to vancomycin (data not shown) and, thus, it was not further used.", "The next step was transferring Tei3 into S. coelicolor pGJp+ to test if its activity is inducible by GPAs. As either pGJp or pGP101 is a distant derivative of pSET152 [45], both plasmids use the \u03c6C31 attB site for integration and are not compatible. To solve this issue, the pRT801 plasmid [46] was used to create a \u03c6BT1-based derivative of pGP101, named pGP111. The M512 derivative carrying pGP111 (carrying tei3) was named M111, while the strain carrying both pGP111 and pGJp was named M1J. It was expected that if Tei3 functions as a constitutive phosphorylase, M1J would express a constitutive glucuronidase activity in the presence of X-Gluc, not depending on the presence or absence of GPAs. This assumption was correct as M1J converted X-Gluc independently from the presence of any GPA (Figure 3), confirming in vivo that Tei3 functions as a constitutive phosphorylase. As a control, it was shown that no induction was observed in those strains not carrying vanJp-gusA (M512 and M111), whereas the GPA induction was observed in S. coelicolor pGJp+ due to the action of the endogenous VanSSc.", "2.3. Loss of Extracytoplasmic Sensory Loop and Transmembrane Helices Renders Tei3 and VanSSc Nonfunctional", "Considering the non-inducible properties of Tei3, we were wondering whether TMHs and ESL are still necessary for its function, or whether ATPaseD would be the only required domain. To answer this question, a series of plasmids was created carrying truncated versions of tei3 or of vanSSc lacking (i) TMH1 and ESL (tei3\u2032, vanSSc\u2032); (ii) TMH1, ESL, and TMH2 (tei3\u2033, vanSSc\u2033) (Figure S3). These plasmids were named pGP104 (tei3\u2032), pGP105 (vanSSc\u2032), pGP106 (tei3\u2033), and pGP107 (vanSSc\u2033). Plasmids were transferred into S. coelicolor M512 (resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin and A40926) and S. coelicolor J3200 (this last one\u2014\u0394vanSSc\u2014is constitutively resistant to all GPAs), generating M104-107 and J104-107 strains. It was expected that if ATPaseD of Tei3 would be able to function alone, the expression of tei3\u2032 and tei3\u2033 might lead to constitutive GPA resistance in M512. On the contrary, the absence of the SD in VanSSc might render J3200 constitutively sensitive to GPAs. However, the obtained results indicated that ATPaseDs of neither Tei3 nor VanSSc can function alone: the phenotypes of M104-107 and J104-107 strains in the presence of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and A40926 were the same as the parental M512 and J3200 strains, respectively (Figure 4).", "2.4. Tei3 Sensor Domain Is Sensitive to A40926 but Not to Teicoplanin and Vancomycin", "Logically, teicoplanin should be the original ligand for Tei3. However, direct experimental verification of this assumption is impossible due to the non-inducible properties of Tei3. It is possible that maybe Tei3 became a constitutive phosphorylase in the course of the evolution, but clues for Tei3 sensitivity might have remained \u201cfossilized\u201d within its SD. To answer this question, a hybrid gene coding for a chimeric SHK combining the SD of Tei3 with the ATPaseD of VanSSc was created. vanSSc and tei3 (Figure S4) were collinear, facilitating such an exchange. Luckily, a unique PaeI recognition site was found only 4 bp after the vanSSc region coding for SD. This allowed us to use this site for replacing the vanSSc region coding for the SD with the corresponding one from tei3 (see Section 4 for details). The obtained hybrid gene\u2014tei3-vanSSc (Figure S4)\u2014was cloned into the pSET152A plasmid generating pGP103. Next, pGP103 was transferred into M512 and J3200 generating the recombinant strains M103 and J103, respectively. In the first case, a merodiploid strain was generated, carrying the native vanSSc together with the hybrid tei3-vanSSc allele, while in J3200, the knockout of vanSSc was complemented by the added tei3-vanSSc. GPA resistance phenotypes of these recombinants showed that both M103 and J103 became sensitive to vancomycin, implying that this GPA is not an inducer for the Tei3 SD (Figure 5).", "Surprisingly, M103 and J103 were also sensitive to teicoplanin, excluding its possible role as a ligand for the Tei3 SD. Adding a final detail to these puzzling results, both M103 and J103 were resistant to A40926, implying that the Tei3 SD recognizes A40926 as a ligand.", "2.5. Establishing a Link between the Evolution of Glycosylation Pattern of Teicoplanin and Properties of Tei3 SD", "Teicoplanin and A40926 are chemically similar GPAs that likely emerged in the course of convergent evolution (Figure S5) [47,48,49]. Differences lie in the chlorination and methylation pattern; notably, A40926 also lacks a N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety attached to the aglycone of teicoplanin at the aa position 6 (AA6) (Figure S5). The glycosylation pattern might be important for binding VanS, in accordance with previous results reporting that VanS from S. toyocaensis was unable to recognize vancomycin, sensing only the non-glycosylated A47934 [33]. Hence, it could be speculated that the responsiveness of Tei3 to a GPA lacking a GlcNAc residue might be an ancient property from the times when the ancestral teicoplanin BGC did not carry a gene for the attachment of the GlcNAc moiety at aglycone AA6. To understand this better, the phylogeny of glycosyl transferases (GTFs) coming from experimentally studied GPA BGCs was reconstructed (Figure 6).", "Five clades (A\u2013D) might be delineated on the obtained tree (Figure 6) and they seem to correspond to the regiospecificity of GTFs well. The regiospecificity of clades (A\u2013C) GTFs could be predicted with high confidence as, for many members of these clades, experimental evidence exists. Thus, clade (A) comprehended GTFs attaching either d-glucose or GlcNAc to AA4 of the GPA aglycone (see [50] for the review of such GTFs); clade (B) GTFs are responsible for the attachment of l-aminosugars to AA4 d-glucose [50]; clade (C) included GTFs from ristocetin BGCs likely attaching d-arabinose to AA4 d-mannosyl-d-glucose [51] (Figure 6). The substrate- and regiospecificity of GTFs from clades (D) and (E) were dubious: clade (D) GTFs probably attach l-rhamnose to the AA4 d-glucose, while clade (E) GTFs may attach l-aminosugars to aglycone AA6. To our surprise, Tei1\u2014known to attach the GlcNAc moiety at the teicoplanin aglycone AA6 [52]\u2014was found deep in clade (A), being a sister branch to Tei10* (known to attach GlcNAc at AA4). One other GPA\u2014GP1416 from Amycolatopsis sp. WAC01416 [53]\u2014is known to closely resemble the teicoplanin structure, bearing the GlcNAc moiety at AA6. However, the GTF that is likely responsible for this did not belong to any of the clades and was located far from either Tei1 or Tei10* (Figure 6). The presence of the GlcNAc moiety at AA6 of teicoplanin and GP1416 could, thus, be considered an example of the convergent evolution of GPAs. Considering all mentioned above, one could reasonably assume that Tei1 is a recent product of the Tei10* duplication/divergence event. In the course of evolution, it is likely that Tei1 changed its regiospecificity but retained the substrate specificity. A direct ancestor of teicoplanin BGC likely coded the biosynthesis of des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin, which structurally resembles A40926 and was recognized by the Tei3 SD (see Figure 7 and the discussion below for a possible reconstruction of co-evolution of GTFs encoded in teicoplanin BGC and Tei3)."]
