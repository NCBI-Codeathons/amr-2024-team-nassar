3 Results 3.1 Identification of endophytic fungi All culturable endophytic strains were sequenced and used for multigene phylogenetic analyses. 54 strains belonging to Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Agaricomycetes were successfully isolated and identified from tissue segments of R. roxburghii. The largest number of endophytes was found in root tissues (20 isolates), followed by the stem (14 isolates), leaf (9 isolates), fruit (6 isolates), seed (4 isolates), and flower (one isolate). Of these isolates, 51 strains were identified at the species level, covering 28 confirmed species. The remaining genus-level isolates, including two unidentified species, may belong to new taxa. The phylogenetic relationship was constructed with combined ITS, LSU, TUB, and RPB2, as illustrated in

. In this study, the antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi was superior to the antifungal activity. The antimicrobial activity may be strain-specific owing to significant differences observed among strains of the same endophytic species, such as Alternaria tenuissima, Emmia latemarginata, and Neofusicoccum sp. Most endophytes exhibited broad-spectrum activities, whereas another small group did not display any antimicrobial activity, e.g., Macrophomina phaseolina and Paraphoma vinacea. Concretely, endophytes showed stronger antibacterial activity against Ba. Subtilis, and hardly any activity were observed against Py. oryzae. Although generally described as pathogens, some species as endophytic fungi also demonstrated potential antimicrobial activity, e.g., Al. tenuissima HGUP191067. In general, 15 endophytes were selected for subsequent experiments based on molecular identification and the strength of inhibition activity (

. These extracellular and intracellular metabolites, which were prepared from the preliminary screened-out strains, showed broad-spectrum antifungal activity against at least one phytopathogenic fungus. However, most metabolites exhibited less than 20% inhibition against the six tested fungi. Fortunately, endophytic strains Epicoccum latusicollum HGUP191049, Neofusicoccum sp. HGUP191080, and Setophoma terrestris HGUP190028 displayed potential as antifungal agents since their metabolites displayed over 30% inhibition rate against at least one of the tested fungi. Of these, the extracellular metabolites of HGUP191049 and HGUP190028 were highly effective against L. theobromae with inhibition rates was 58.5 ± 3.4% and 51.4 ± 3.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, the inhibition rate of HGUP191049 also reaches 58.0 ± 2.2% against Botryo. dothidea and 45.3 ± 1.3% against C. capsici. Accordingly, Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 holds good promise for developing antifungal agents. Figure 2Results of re-screening for antifungal activity.

 and 
Supplementary Table 1
, most secondary metabolites showed sub-moderate inhibition intensity (d < 10 mm). However, the extracellular metabolite of Ep. Latusicollum HGUP191049 was shown to have potent antibacterial activity against both tested Gram-positive (St. aureus and Ba. subtilis) and Gram-negative (Ps. syringae pv. actinidiae, Es. coli, and Ps. aeruginosa) bacteria, since inhibition zone diameters ranging from 15.3 ± 1.5 mm to 20.3 ± 2.5 mm. So the strain HGUP191049 was considered to be well antagonistic. Figure 3Results of re-screening for antibacterial activity.

To evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the extracellular metabolites of the two isolates, in which MIC values were determined. As shown in

, Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 presented MIC values of 1.25 mg/mL, 2.50 mg/mL, and 1.25 mg/mL against L. theobromae, Botryo. Dothidea, and R. solani, respectively, whereas MIC values ranged from 0.31 mg/mL to 5.00 mg/mL against six tested bacteria.

Material examined: China, Guizhou Province, Guiyang City, from healthy stems of R. roxburghii (Rosaceae), 22 April 2020, H. Zhang (HGUP191049); living cultures were deposited in the Culture Collection at the Department of Plant Pathology, College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, China, No. GUCC 191049.1 and China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center, No. CGMCC 40110. Notes: The screened strain HGUP191049 and the type of Ep. latusicollum are phylogenetically similar as they cluster together with well support (
Supplementary Figure 1
). Our collection resembles the type CGMCC 3.18346 in having a pycnidial wall, conidiogenous cells, and conidia. However, our collection slightly differs from the type in having aggregated conidiomata rather than solitary conidiomata (Chen et al., 2017). Therefore, the examined morphology overlaps and is phylogenetically identical to Ep. latusicollum. We report our collection as a new host record of Ep. latusicollum from the stem of R. roxburghii. 3.5 Genome sequencing and annotation Genome sequencing of Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 was conducted using a combination of single molecule real-time (SMRT) and Illumina sequencing technologies. The obtained genome of HGUP191049 was assembled into 22 scaffolds, about 33.24 megabase pairs (Mbp), and 10,500 genes (
Figure 5
; 
Table 2
). The estimated genome size of HGUP191049 is broadly congruent with other estimates of genome size in Epicoccum, 33–35 Mbp (
Supplementary Figure 2
) (Fokin et al., 2017; Oliveira et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2021). The N50 and N90 length of the scaffolds were 1,859,063 bp and 1,112,482 bp, respectively. The GC content was 52.06% for the genome and 54.82%% for the coding sequences. In total, 10,310 protein-encoding genes were predicted from the genome assembly. Among them, 10,197, 9,523, 5,981, and 4,530 genes have functional annotations in the Nr, KEGG, SwissProt, and KOG databases, respectively. In this study, 325 genes (3.10%) were associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, or catabolism in the KOG database (

The BGCs were analyzed using antiSMASH, and a total of 24 putative natural product BGCs of HGUP191049 were yielded, including three NRPSs, nine T1PKSs, four terpene synthases, one NRPS-T1PKS, one Indole-T1PKS, and six NRPS-like gene clusters (
Supplementary Table 4
). Of the 24 annotated BGCs, eight BGCs were found to share similarities in gene content with previously identified, while the remaining showed no significant similarities with currently known. These unknown BGCs could potentially shed light on the search for novel compounds. The antiSMASH and BLAST bioinformatics analyses identified three complete BGCs encoding dimethylcoprogen, (-)-mellein, and melanin. Other annotated potential products were squalestatin S1 (40% similarity), phomasetin (40%), oxyjavanicin (25%), patulin (20%), and azanigerone A (26%), respectively. Among these putative natural products, oxyjavanicin (
Supplementary Figure 3
), squalestatin S1 (
Supplementary Figure 4
), and patulin (
Figure 6
) have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial activity (Nicolaou et al., 1994; Paytubi et al., 2017; Kato et al., 2020). In this study, the putative patulin BGC is cluster 16 (T1PKS), sharing only 20% similarity to BGC0000120. We detected this compound in the secondary metabolites of Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 (

Latusicollum HGUP191049 might produce a large number of new compounds. It was determined by conducting a literature search whether known metabolites had antimicrobial activity. The results revealed about 120 compounds with antimicrobial activity, 7.9% of the known compounds (
Supplementary Table 5
). Specifically, some antimicrobial compounds with different structures were illustrated in 
Figure 7
, including polyketide (e.g., kendomycin), alkaloids (e.g., berberine), terpenoids (e.g., geniposidic acid), flavonoids (e.g., nevadensin), steroids (e.g., fluticasone propionate), naphthoquinone compounds (e.g., atovaquone), anthraquinones (e.g., hypericin), phenolic compounds (e.g., mangostine), coumarin compounds (e.g., 6-methylcoumarin), fatty acid compounds (e.g., phenyllactic acid), carbamates (e.g., geldanamycin), amides (e.g., benzamide), heterocyclic compounds (e.g., kojic acid), antibiotic compounds (e.g., norfloxacin), and other antimicrobial compounds (e.g., (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid, (S)-(-)-citronellic acid, and azadirachtin A). Within this, flavonoids are one of the most abundant groups of antimicrobial secondary metabolites. The highly structural diversity demonstrated that Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 is a talented producer of antimicrobial compounds.

Some different structural types of antimicrobial secondary metabolites from Epicoccum latusicollum HGUP191049. 3.7 Comparative genomics analyses results 3.7.1 Prediction and comparative analyses of pathogenicity-related genes To identify and compare potential protein-coding genes related to pathogenicity and virulence in the genomes, whole genome blast analyses were performed against the pathogen-host interaction (PHI) gene database v. 4.13 at E<1*10−20 and identity≥70% (Prasad et al., 2015; Urban et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2020). Screening of PHI annotated phenotypes showed that most genes belonged to “reduced virulence”, “unaffected pathogenicity”, and “loss of pathogenicity”. In contrast, few genes were associated with the “effector (plant avirulence determinant)” (one gene), “enhanced antagonism” (one gene), and “chemistry target sensitivity to chemical” (none) phenotypes (
Figure 8
). Genes of the “increased pathogenicity (Hypervirulence)” type are key pathogenic ones. As illustrated in 
Figure 8
 and 
Supplementary Figure 2
, strains with different nutrient modes of the same Epicoccum species may possess the same gene numbers of “increased pathogenicity (hypervirulence)” type, such as Ep. latusicollum (HGUP191049 and T41), Ep. nigrum (cf0051 and ICMP 19927), and Ep. sorghinum (BS2-1 and USPMTOX48), having 8, 7, 8 genes of this type for them, respectively. Of this phenotypic gene, the seven genomes in this study shared seven identical genes of this type, whereas Ep. latusicollum (HGUP191049 and T41) and Ep. sorghinum (BS2-1 and USPMTOX48) had one more of this type gene than the other genomes, namely PHI:5494, which may be a vital contributor to the difference in pathogenicity between species. In addition, an endophyte of the same species may contain more “loss of pathogenicity phenotypic genes” than a pathogen, e.g. endophytic strain HGUP191049 has two more genes of this type than pathogenic strain T41, and endophytic cf0051 has four more genes than pathogenic ICMP 19927. Moreover, for Ep. latusicollum, endophytic HGUP191049 had six “loss of pathogenicity” phenotypic genes (PHI: 2145, PHI: 4095, PHI: 10527, PHI: 9899, and PHI: 8875) different from the pathogenic T41 (PHI: 8734, PHI: 5232, and PHI: 9357), which may be one of the factors contributing to their differences in pathogenicity within species.

CAZymes are responsible for degrading host plant cells and establishing colonization for plant pathogenic and endophytic fungi. As biocontrol fungi, CAZymes can be used to destroy the cell walls of pathogens and nematodes (Yang et al., 2019). The CAZymes involved in the degradation of plant cell walls were further classified into the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, and those involved in the degradation of fungal cell walls were grouped into the degradation of chitin and β-1,3-glucan (Zhao et al., 2013; Kubicek et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2019). As can be derived from 
Figure 9
, the main CAZyme gene families that differ significantly between Epicoccum and Didymella are GH10, GH28, GH43, and PL1. In this study, 41.5% (17/41) of the families are identical among and within species in Epicoccum, such as GH6, all of which are 3 in number. Other families differ in the number of characteristics by 1–2, with a few 3, as in GH43. However, it is significantly different for GH18, which belongs to a family associated with chitin degradation, with numbers ranging from 9 to 15, which may be an important factor influencing the difference in the antifungal potential of Epicoccum spp. Of Ep. latusicollum, the biological activity of strain HGUP191049 distinguished from T41 in having different amounts of GH3 and GH45, GH43, GH78 and PL3, and GH18, for the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and chitin, respectively.

Figure 10
), which suggests that Epicoccum is a promising source of terpenes besides the traditional PKS- and NRPS-encoded compounds. Figure 10Phylogenetic analyses of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).

Phylogenetic relationships of BGCs from six Epicoccum strains and evolutionarily adjacent species D. exigua were analyzed to investigate differences among secondary metabolites of Epicoccum spp. (
Figure 10
). The result showed that BGCs could be grouped into 26 clades. The same types of BGCs with high identity may encode the same secondary metabolites, while the corresponding BGCs of a compound may be in different evolutionary branches. Notably, Epicoccum species have BGCs encoding the same compounds. The same branch of Ep. latusicollum (Contig0006.1 and JACCMO010000004.1) and Ep. sorghinum (VXJJ01000017.1 and MIEO01000350.1) (Clade 18), which all encode oxyjavanicin, where Ep. nigrum, the BGC JAASLF010000044.1, which encodes this compound, belongs to Clade 8. Similarly, squalestatin S1 is also encoded by BGCs from six different Epicoccum genomes. Consequently, it is presumed that oxyjavanicin and squalestatin S1, both of which have been reported as antimicrobial agents, are secondary metabolites shared by Epicoccum spp.
