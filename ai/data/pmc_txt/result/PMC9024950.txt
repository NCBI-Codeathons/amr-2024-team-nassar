3. Results 3.1. Identification of Algicidal Bacterium A total of 15 bacterial isolates were obtained from Jiaozhou Bay, China, of which 4 strains were found to exert algicidal activity against A. pacificum. Among the 4 strains, Y1 had an apparent negative effect on the growth of A. pacificum and was used for further investigation. A unique amplicon, with 1455 bp in length after trimming the primers and ambiguous sites at both ends (GenBank accession number OL966960), was obtained from the bacterial isolate Y1 from Jiaozhou Bay, China. The bacterial isolate Y1 was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing to belong to the Class γ-p, genus Shewanella, and was 97% similar to a Shewanella carassii LZ2016-166 isolated from sediments of China. All the Shewanella sequences joined together forming a monophyletic clade with 100% bootstrapping support and formed two sister sub-clades. One well-defined sub-clade included sequences from India, Nigeria, South Korea, and China, and the other comprised those sequences from USA and China (Figure 1). Two Shewanella strains, Shewanella IRI-160 and Shewanella Lzh-2, were proven to possess algicidal activity [43,44]. Strain Y1 and strain IRI-160/Lzh-2 separately developed into independent branches, indicating Shewanella Y1 was not same strain as Shewanella IRI-160/Lzh-2. 3.2. Algicidal Mode of Algicidal Strain Y1 For the bacterial cultures and filtrate-added cultures, the algicidal rates showed a similar pattern of variation, and no significant difference was observed between the two treatments (p > 0.05). The algicidal rates of the bacterial cultures and filtrate-added cultures began to increase from 0.5 h inoculation and reached 30.14 ± 9.05% and 29.24 ± 3.49% at 4 h respectively. After 24 h inoculation, the algicidal rates of the bacterial cultures and filtrate-added cultures reached a stable level, lysing 86.64 ± 5.04% and 89.95 ± 4.35% of the algal cells respectively, then increased to 90.66 ± 4.65% and 95.14 ± 4.24% at 48 h (Figure 2). In the washed bacterial pellets cultures, the algicidal rate exhibited a significant difference from the bacterial cultures and filtrate-added cultures (p < 0.05), which ranged from −12 ± 0.04% to 19.74 ± 1.77% (Figure 2). These findings suggested strain Y1 secreted algicidal substances to attack A. pacificum, thus bacterial filtrate was used for further analysis as the potential active compound. 3.3. Effects of Y1 Filtrate on A. pacificum In the control cultures, A. pacificum showed steady growth during the experiment, reaching 1.45 ± 0.01 × 104 cells mL−1 by 48 h. In the bacterial filtrate-added cultures, the growth of A. pacificum was significantly affected by introduction of Y1 filtrate. The cell density of A. pacificum decreased dramatically after 6 h inoculation, and the final density was 46 ± 12 cells mL−1 (Figure 3). Compared with the control cultures, the bacterial filtrate-added cultures exhibited significant morphological differences and even structural damage. The normal A. pacificum cell was brownish yellow and swam fast. The cellular structures were intact with two distinct carapaces and dense cytoplasm (Figure 4a). However, the structural integrity of the algal cells was lost, and plasmolysis and vacuolization, and even degradation, of the cytoplasm were observed in the treated cells after 6 h (Figure 4b), and the percentage of plasmolysis cells was 38.22 ± 3.73 (Figure 5b). With extended exposure (12 h), the cytoplasm became completely divorced from the cell well, and began to degrade into small, irregular debris particles (Figure 4c), with the percentage of broken cells at 41.22 ± 0.1 (Figure 5c). At 24 h, the algal cell was thoroughly disintegrated, and only the remaining cell well was observed in the culture (Figure 4d), and the percentage of remaining cell walls was 53.48 ± 3.37 (Figure 5d). 3.4. Variation of Photosynthetic Activity of A. pacificum under the Action of Y1 Filtrate Photosynthesis is an important determinant of the ability of marine microalgae to survive biotic stresses, and the Fv/Fm is widely used to evaluate photosynthetic activity of microalgae. The photosynthetic activities of A. pacificum were overtly impacted by Y1 filtrate (Figure 6a). The Fv/Fm of A. pacificum remained steady in the control cultures, with near-optimal quantum yield values (Fv/Fm = 0.5) over the experimental period. Fv/Fm values in the filtrate-added cultures ranged from 0.56 ± 0.03 to 0.13 ± 0.03, significantly lower than that of the control cultures (0.53 ± 0.03 to 0.48 ± 0.01, p < 0.05). Alpha (α) is one of the key photosynthetic parameters indicating photosynthetic activity. In the control cultures, alpha value was maintained at 0.20 ± 0.01. Alpha value in the filtrate-added cultures decreased to 0.05 ± 0.01 by 2 h, which was significantly lower than that of the control cultures over the experimental period (p < 0.05) (Figure 6b). The maximum relative electron transfer rate (rETRmax) of A. pacificum showed a similar pattern to Fv/Fm and the alpha (Figure 6c). In the control cultures, the ETRmax value ranged from 306.47 ± 17.51 to 347.8 ± 38.91, while the ETRmax value significantly decreased in the filtrate-added cultures after 0.5 h inoculation (p < 0.05), which ranged from 37.83 ± 9.42 to 330.73 ± 30.02. 3.5. Physiological and Biochemical Responses of A. pacificum under the Action of Y1 Filtrate In the control cultures, the ROS level increased briefly at 1 h, reaching the peak (17.44 ± 2.67). Beyond that, the ROS level was maintained at 11.58 ± 0.49. Compared with the control cultures, the ROS level was significantly increased in the filtrate-added cultures (p < 0.05), which ranged from 11.44 ± 1.54 to 26.48 ± 1.59. The ROS levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 h in the filtrate-added cultures were 1.56-fold, 1.52-fold, 1.85-fold, and 1.55-fold those of the control cultures, respectively (Figure 7). In the control cultures, the CAT activity of A. pacificum remained steady (18.67 ± 2.31 U/mgprot) throughout the experiment (Figure 8a). Within first 0.5 h inoculation, no significant difference was observed between the two treatments (p > 0.05). With longer exposure time, the CAT activity of A. pacificum in the filtrate-added cultures increased continuously, peaking at 4 h (23.9 ± 0.92 U/mgprot). The CAT activities of 1, 2, 4 h treatment with filtrate were 1.15-fold, 1.24-fold, and 1.31-fold those of the control cultures, respectively. The SOD activities of A. pacificum were overtly impacted by Y1 filtrate (Figure 8b). The SOD activity in the filtrate-added cultures ranged from 79.4 ± 6.4 to 183.44 ± 14.89, which was a significant difference from that of the control cultures (83.38 ± 6.28 to 104.5 ± 14.14 U/mgprot). At 2 h inoculation, SOD activity in the filtrate-added cultures reached the peak (188.44 ± 14.89 U/mgprot), which was 1.8-fold that of the control cultures, then sharply decreased to 79.4 ± 6.4 U/mgprot, while no significant difference was observed in the SOD activities between the two groups after 2 h inoculation (p > 0.05). The GSH content showed similar pattern to CAT activity (Figure 8c). There was a significant difference between the two cultures after 0.5 h inoculation (p < 0.05). The GSH content remained steady in the control cultures, ranging from 7.1 ± 1.06 to 8.62 ± 0.37 mgGSH/gprot over the whole experimental period. The contents of GSH in the filtrate-added cultures began to increase after 0.5 h and the maximum values (11.11 ± 1.11 mgGSH/gprot) were 1.36-fold that of the control cultures at 4 h inoculation (p < 0.05). In the control cultures, MDA value ranged from 1.44 ± 0.09 to 1.66 ± 0.01 nmol/mgprot. While MDA value significantly increased in the filtrate-added cultures after 1 h inoculation (p < 0.05), which ranged from 2.54 ± 0.11 to 3.61 ± 0.24 nmol/mgprot. In the filtrate-added cultures, the MDA content reached maximum value at 2 h inoculation, which was 2.9-fold that of control cultures. Although the MDA contents in filtrate-added cultures declined slightly after 2 h, the content was still much higher than that of the control cultures (Figure 8d). 3.6. Algicidal Activity of Y1 Filtrate toward Several HABs Species Various effects were observed among the six tested species (Figure 9). Within 24 h incubation, Y1 filtrate showed the strongest algicidal activity on A. tamarense (66.45 ± 0.3%), a slight negative effect on Prorocentrum donghaiense (20.36 ± 0.65%), Karenia mikimotoi (11.96 ± 1.03%), and Heterosigma akashiwo (7.27 ± 1.37%), a slight stimulatory effects on the growth of diatoms, Chaetoceros catenaria (−10.23 ± 0.83%) and Skeletonema costatum (−18.82 ± 2.33%).
