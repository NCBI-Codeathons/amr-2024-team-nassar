Results Antibiotic supplementation in the SCNA media reduced the load of colonies on the isolation plates In this study, two antibiotics namely, azithromycin and meropenem were used separately to isolate drug-resistant actinomycetes with potential of producing antibiotics to which they possess self-resistance mechanisms. It was found that the antibiotic supplementation killed the susceptible bacterial species present in the sample and reduced the number of bacteria on the isolation plates by 4–6 folds compared to the control plates where no antibiotics were added. This allowed only the drug-resistant actinomycetes to grow, especially the actinomycetes which are difficult to grow on the crowded plates. For instance, in SCNA plate containing 0.5 µg/mL azithromycin where 100 µL of sediment sample (1:100 dilution) of Padma river was plated and the number of CFU/gram of soil was counted after 4 days of incubation at 32 °C, the number of CFU/gram of soil was 2.6 × 105, however, in the control SCNA plates where no antibiotic was added, the CFU/gram of soil was 1.12 × 106 (Fig. 1). When the antibiotic concentration in the SCNA plates was increased, the number of CFU/gram of soil also decreased proportionately. For example, the CFU/gram of soil in the plates supplemented with 2, 4 and 16 µg/mL of azithromycin, the values for CFU/gram of soil were 1.9 × 105, 1.1 × 105 and 4 × 104, respectively.

For instance, on the plating of the 1:100 diluted river sediments of Padma river on SCNA plates supplemented with 4 µg/mL, the number of CFU/gram of sediment was counted as 2.9 × 105, whereas on the control plates where the number of CFU/gram of sediment was 1.12 × 106 which is around four-fold higher than the meropenem supplemented plates (Fig. 2).

Among them, three were from azithromycin supplemented plates and nine were from meropenem supplemented plates (Table 1). Most of the isolates represented the morphological characteristics of Streptomyces as they showed good sporulation with compact, chalk-like colonies of different colours. The separately appeared colonies having the morphology of actinomycetes especially the Streptomyces were picked randomly from the SCNA plates and inoculated on the fresh yeast-extract glucose agar (YEGA) plates supplemented with the same concentration of antibiotics. To confirm that the isolates were pure and no contaminant bacteria or fungi were present, the isolates were transferred to fresh plates for at least two times. By analysing the aerial mycelial views of the pure isolates (Fig. 3.), they were classified into different colour groups. The white and grey-coloured isolates were predominant. All the isolates obtained from azithromycin-supplemented plates were grouped into grey series. Among the nine isolates purified from meropenem supplemented plates, six were grouped to white series (NM1, NM2, NM3, NM4, NM6 and NMF10) and two were grouped to grey series (NMF8 and NMF9). The isolate NMF7 was grouped into red series. Only one isolate (NM1) was found to produce red-coloured diffusible pigments into the media.

Padma, Rajshahi (24.3614252 N,88.5991637E) Most of the pure isolates obtained from azithromycin and meropenem selection were active against the test bacteria To screen the capability of the isolates obtained from the resistance-guided isolation process using azithromycin and meropenem as a screening filter, the cross-streaking method was applied. We found that all the three isolates obtained from azithromycin selection were active and exhibited moderate to high antibacterial activity (Table 2; Fig. 4). The isolate NAr4 inhibited only the Gram-negative bacteria including S. brodie, E. coli, Pseudomonas and Proteus sp. with a distance of inhibition (DOI) ranging from 20 to 38 mm. Both NAr5 and NAr6 exhibited strong antagonistic activity against almost all test bacteria with the exception that NAr6 could not inhibit B. cereus (Table 2; Fig. 4).

Only the activities of the active isolates are shown Among the nine isolates obtained by meropenem selection, five exhibited moderate to high broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (Table 2; Fig. 4). The isolate NM1 which produced diffusible red pigments could not inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas sp. however, it inhibited S. brodie, Proteus sp. and B. cereus strongly. The antagonictic activities of NM1 against E. coli and S. aureus were not good. The isolates NM2, NM3, NM4 and NM6 exhibited very strong antagonistic activity against Gram-negative bacteria with moderate activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Table 2; Fig. 4). NAr5 and NAr6 were selected for further characterisation and identification based on on their highest antibacterial activity in preliminary antibacterial screening. Biochemical characteristics of NAr5 and NAr6 The biochemical characteristics of NAr5 and NAr6 including salt tolerance, pH tolerance, utilization of carbohydrate sources and cross-resistance to other antibiotics were also studied. It was found that both the strains could tolerate a salt concentration up to 8%, however, they grew well when the NaCl concentration was in the range of 3–5%. A pH range of 5–10 was tested and it was found that both the strains could also tolerate this wide range of pH. They also grew well when different carbohydrate sources were used including lactose, maltose, glucose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, fructose and xylose. Both of the strains could grow well in absence of carbon source (starch) of the SCNA medium supplemented with either meropenem or azithromycin. This suggests that they either utilize environmental CO2 or the supplied antibiotic as a source of carbon. When the SCNA medium was depleted with nitrogen source (casein and potassium nitrate), the strains could also grow well, thus, there is a possibility that the strains used the supplied antibiotic as nitrogen source. The strains also exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. Along with azithromycin (the antibiotic used as selection filter for both NAr5 and NAr6), both of the strains could tolerate clindamycin and meropenem.

The partial 16S rDNA sequence (1283 bp) of the gene of NAr5 shared 100% sequence similarity with five strains of Streptomyces including S. griseoincarnatus LMG 19316, S. erythrogriseus LMG 19406, S. variabilis NBRC 12825, S. griseorubens NBRC 12780 and S. labedae NBRC 15864. Four strains including S. althioticus NRRL B-3981 (99.76%), S. griseoflavus LMG 19344 (99.69%), S. tunisiensis CN-207 (99.69%), S. matensis NBRC 12889 (99.69%) showed > 99.5% sequence similarity with the NAr5. In the phylogenetic tree of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of NAr5 with its closely related strains, it formed a separate clade with S. tunisiensis CN-207 (Fig.5).

Other closely related strains were S. exfoliates NRRL B-2924 (99.68%), S. venezuelae ATCC 10,712 (99.60%), S. wedmorensis NRRL 3426 (99.60%), S. omiyaensis NBRC 13449 (99.60%), and S. lateritius LMG 19372 (99.60%). In the phylogenetic tree of the 16S rDNA sequences of the closely related strains, NAr6 appeared on a separate branch in the tree, thus it has the potential to be a new species of Streptomyces, however, further studies are needed to be performed to confirm this (Fig. 5).
