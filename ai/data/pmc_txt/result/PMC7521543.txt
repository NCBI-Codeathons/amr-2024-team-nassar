RESULTS JMT alleviated peripheral neuropathy phenotypes in DPN rats Twelve weeks after the induction of diabetes, STZ-injected rats displayed the peripheral neuropathy phenotypes characterized by increased non-fasting blood glucose level (Figure 1A, p<0.0001), decreased body weight (Figure 1B, p<0.0001), reduced Mechanical Withdraw Threshold (MWT) (Figure 1C, p<0.0001), and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers in the hind paw (Figure 1D, E, p<0.0001). Both JMT and NTP treatment increased MWT (Figure 1C, p<0.0001) without affecting non-fasting blood glucose level and body weight in DPN rats (Figure 1A, 1B, p>0.05). In addition, JMT, but not NTP, improved intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in DPN rats (p<0.05) compared to distilled water-treated DPN rats (Figure 1D, 1E, p>0.05). In summary, both JMT and NTP alleviated some peripheral neuropathy symptoms in DPN rats, with NTP showing no predominance than JMT.

JMT improved the neurological morphology of sciatic nerves in DPN rats Both hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (Figure 1F, 1G) and ultrastructural evaluation using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Figure 2A, 2B) showed that sciatic nerves from normal control rats contained myelinated fibers of varying diameters, regular contours, intact myelin sheaths, and thickness proportional to the diameter of their axons, which were uniformly distributed. In the distilled water-treated DPN group, myelinated fibers with axonal atrophy and myelin sheath deformation were observed and were sparsely distributed under the light microscopy (Figure 1F, 1G). Meanwhile, ultrastructure examinations revealed that myelin destruction had occurred as evidenced by onion-bulb and bubble form protrusions on the myelin sheath and axolemma border of myelinated axons. The most striking ultrastructural alterations of axonal myelin were vacuolization and lamellar separation, which consists of separated myelin fibers with large spaces between the axon and myelin sheath. Shrunken and swollen axons were also commonly observed, and both total damage and axonal deformations were present (Figure 2A, 2B). Qualitative assessment of ultrastructural characteristics revealed that the number of myelinated axons per 5000 μm2 (Figure 2C) decreased, while the percentage of abnormal myelin fibers with morphological alterations, including myelin infoldings, vacuolization, and uneven thickness increased in distilled water-treated DPN rats (Figure 2D).

Red arrows indicate lamellar separation between the axon and myelin sheath and demyelination. Morphological abnormalities were ameliorated in both JMT-treated and NTP-treated DPN rats. The sciatic nerves of JMT-treated DPN rats contained myelin fibers of various sizes and with more proportional caliber sheaths surrounding the axon. Under light microscopy, myelin sheaths showed more regular contours with homogeneous distribution in JMT- and NTP-treated DPN rats compared with the distilled water-treated DPN rats (Figure 1F, 1G). JMT and NTP improved pathological ultrastructure features in myelin and axons to different degrees. Vacuolization and lamellar separation of axonal myelin were reduced to a greater extent after JMT treatment. Morphologic alterations and myelin breakdown were also reduced specifically in JMT-treated DPN rats, and deranged myelin sheath cells recovered after treatment (Figure 2A, 2B). Qualitative assessment of ultrastructural characteristics revealed that the number of myelinated axons per 5000 μm2 increased (Figure 2C, p < 0.05) and the percentage of abnormal myelin fibers decreased (Figure 2D, p < 0.001) in JMT-treated DPN rats, but not in NTP-treated DPN rats (Figure 2C, 2D, p > 0.05), compared to distilled water-treated DPN rats. Axons g ratios did not differ among different groups (Figure 2E, p > 0.05) [24], indicating that atrophy of myelinated fibers occurred to the same degree in both axons and myelin sheaths [25]. The observed g ratio around 0.6 may explain, at least in part, the preservation of baroreceptor function in the DPN rats [26]. JMT prevented myelin and axonal damage and increased serum neuregulin 1 (NRG1) level in DPN rats Demyelination and axonal degeneration are two key pathologic features of DPN. Myelin pathology is usually measured by paranodal architecture, while axonal damage is usually evaluated by measuring acute axonal damage indicator amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels [27, 28]. Immunolabeling for contactin-associated protein (Caspr) at the paranodes is often used to quantify symmetrical paranodal densities and asymmetrical heminode densities, which are key indicators of structural damage and paranodal demyelination in peripheral nerves [29]. Here, immunostaining revealed that the number (Figure 3A, 3D, p < 0.001) and percentage (Figure 3A, 3B, p < 0.01) of Caspr-expressing paranodes were decreased, while heminode percentage was increased (Figure 3A, 3C, p < 0.01) in the sciatic nerves of distilled water-treated DPN rats compared to normal control rats. These changes were reversed by JMT treatment (Figure 3A–3D, p < 0.05), further suggesting that JMT protects myelin and paranodal architecture in DPN rats. In contrast, no differences were observed in these measures between NTP-treated and distilled water-treated DPN rats (Figure 3A–3D, p > 0.05). No significant differences in number of heminodes were observed among all the different groups (Figure 3E, p > 0.05), perhaps indicating that symmetrical paranodes were more severely damaged than asymmetrical heminodes in DPN rats.

APP+ axonal spheroids were clearly visible in longitudinal sections of sciatic nerves from distilled water-treated DPN rats, but not in normal control rats (Figure 4A, 4B, p < 0.01). The percentage of APP+ axonal spheroids was reduced in JMT-treated DPN rats compared to those treated with distilled water (Figure 4A, 4B, p < 0.05).

NRG1, a key promoter of neuronal survival, Schwann cell proliferation [30], and myelination [31], is crucial for peripheral nerve growth and development [32]. ELISA results showed that NRG1 level decreased in the serum of distilled water-treated DPN rats (Figure 4C, p < 0.0001), and JMT treatment reversed this effect (Figure 4C, p< 0.01). Together, these data suggest that JMT exerted a neuroprotective effect against paranodal and axonal pathology with increased serum NRG1 level in DPN rats. JMT modulated microbiota composition in DPN rats In order to further explore the mechanisms of JMT’s neuroprotective effects, fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing and correlation analysis were used to identify differences in gut microbiota composition among normal control rats, distilled water-treated DPN rats, and JMT-treated DPN rats. As shown in Figure 5, the rarefaction curves of the alpha diversity indexes achieved stability which means the sequencing sample size for gut microbiota analysis is sufficient. Besides, the goods coverage index is very close to 1, which means the sequencing depth has basically covered all the species in the sample.

All of the alpha diversity indexes achieved stability in different groups, which means the sequencing sample size for gut microbiota analysis is sufficient and the sequencing depth is enough. The observed species diversity index (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.00092, Figure 6A), Shannon diversity index (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.00016, Figure 6B) and Simpson diversity index (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.00016, Figure 6C) analyses revealed the richness of bacterial colonies and community diversity was reduced in the fecal samples of distilled water-treated DPN rats, compared to normal control rats. However, no significant differences in these alpha diversity indexes were observed between distilled water-treated and JMT-treated DPN rats (Kruskal-Wallis, p > 0.05, Figure 6). Both unweighted (Adonis p=0.001, R2=0.287) and weighted (Adonis p=0.001, R2=0.583) UniFrac-based principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) revealed different microbiota composition clusters in normal control rats, distilled water-treated DPN rats, and JMT-treated DPN rats (Figure 6D, 6E), indicating significantly different beta diversities. Together, these alpha and beta diversity results suggest that JMT might regulate microbiota composition by increasing species diversity among taxa rather than within individual taxa.

Clustering significance by body site was determined by Adonis (p < 0.001). Linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size (LEfSe) analysis was performed to identify the specific bacterial taxa differentially represented in normal control rats vs. distilled water-treated DPN rats (Figure 7A) and in distilled water-treated vs. JMT-treated DPN rats (Figure 7B). Compared with normal control rats, distilled water-treated DPN rats were enriched in Bacteroidetes at the phylum level, Bacteroidia at the class level, Bacteroidales at the order level, Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae at the family level, and Klebsiella, Coprococcus, Prevotella, and Oxalobacter at the genus level, which might be related to the pathogenesis of DPN (Figure 7A). However, we found that JMT treatment could counteract DPN-induced gut dysbiosis by enriching nine species which were also dominant in normal control rats (Figure 7). We therefore speculated that JMT ameliorated gut dysbiosis in distilled water-treated DPN rats by increasing the abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria at the phylum level, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Epsilonproteobacteria at the class level, Burkholderiales and Campylobacterales at the order level, Helicobacteraceae at the family level, and Helicobacter at the genus level (Figure 7).

LDA: linear discriminant analysis, n=8/group. Association between gut microbiota abundance, DPN phenotypes, and serum NRG1 level In order to verify the relationship between DPN pathogenesis and gut microbiota, we examined the Spearman’s correlations between alterations in microbiota composition and DPN phenotypes, such as body weight, non-fasting blood glucose level, mechanical withdraw threshold, intraepidermal nerve fiber density, and serum NRG1 level. As shown in Figure 8, all of the ten species that were enriched in distilled water-treated DPN rats were positively correlated with non-fasting blood glucose level (r > 0.45, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with body weight (r < -0.45, p < 0.05). Besides, nine of them were also negatively correlated with serum NRG1 level (r < -0.40, p < 0.05); f_Prevotellaceae was not correlated with serum NRG1 level (r > -0.40, p > 0.05). Among the nine species, f_Porphyromonadaceae and g_Prevotella were also negatively correlated with mechanical withdraw threshold (r < -0.40, p < 0.05) and intraepidermal nerve fiber density (r < -0.40, p < 0.05), indicating that these two species might also promote the pathogenesis of DPN. R- and p-values for these correlations are shown in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5. In contrast, the nine species enriched in both JMT-treated DPN rats and normal control rats were all positively correlated with serum NRG1 level (r > 0.40, p < 0.05). In addition, seven of those nine species were positively correlated with mechanical withdraw threshold (r > 0.50, p < 0.05) and intraepidermal nerve fiber density (r > 0.45, p < 0.05); c_Betaproteobacteria and o_Burkholderiales were not correlated with those measures (r <0.35, p > 0.05). Interestingly, among the seven species, p_Actinobacteria, p_Proteobacteria, and c_Actinobacteria were also positively correlated with body weight (r > 0.50, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with non-fasting blood glucose level (r < -0.55, p < 0.01). These three species might therefore have contributed to JMT induced improvements in DPN phenotypes and symptoms of hyperglycemia and weight loss associated with increased serum NRG1 level (Figure 8, Supplementary Tables 4, 5).
