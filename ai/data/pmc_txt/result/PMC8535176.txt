Results Discovery of an antimycobacterial inhibitor against M. abscessus To identify compounds with antimycobacterial activity, we first engineered a luminescent M. abscessus ATCC 19977 strain which constitutively expressed the luxCDABE operon [15] (M. abscessus lux). We then screened the 176 compound open-library provided by GlaxoSmithKline (S1A–S1C Fig) and the 400 compound Pathogen and Pandemic Response Boxes from MMV (S1D–S1F Fig) using a threshold ≥ 90% reduction in luminescence compared to non-treated bacteria at 10 μM. Primary hits (20 compounds) were tested in a secondary screen using the resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) at 10 μM on the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 strain. Secondary hits (9 compounds) were then tested in a dose-response assay on M. abscessus ATCC 19977 from a fresh solid compound to determine MIC90. The HepG2 (human hepatocytes) cell line was used to assess the toxicity of hits. Among three compounds (0.3% positive hits of 976 compounds) from the pandemic response box that satisfied primary and secondary criteria, we identified EPT (Fig 1A) as having the most potent antimycobacterial activity and highest therapeutic index (Table 1, MIC90 0.23 μM (0.063 μg/mL), TI (TD50/MIC90) EPT > 330). It was previously reported in M. tuberculosis that potent in vitro growth inhibitors could display carbon-source-dependent effects, which leads to a loss of activity when advanced into in vivo models [16]. We thus measured the MIC90 of EPT on different carbon sources (glycerol vs acetate), in the presence or absence of the detergent Tween-80, and in different nutrient bases (Middlebrook 7H9 vs cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton). EPT was active in all assayed growth conditions but lost potency in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton (CaMH) media (S1 Table). Lower activity of EPT in CaMH media is unsurprising as it was previously shown that rifamycins [17] as well as other antimicrobials [18] lose activity in CaMH media (0.5mg/L Ca2+ and 0.05mg/L Mg2+ in 7H9; 20-25mg/L Ca2+ and 10–12.5mg/L Mg2+ in CaMH). It is thought that some antimicrobials may chelate divalent metal ions, thus limiting their uptake in cells. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g001Fig 1EPT in vitro activity against M. abscessus.A Structure of EPT.

Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2018 Next, we tested the in vitro activity of EPT against a panel of M. abscessus clinical isolates belonging to the three subspecies of the M. abscessus complex (M. abscessus, M. massiliense, and M. bolletii) with smooth and rough colony morphologies and with different drug susceptibility profiles to various antibiotics. There was no loss in activity against clinical isolates (range of 0.014–0.046 μg/mL) nor different morphologies (S2 Table). To determine the spectrum of activity of EPT, we curated a panel of various mycobacteria and representative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, EPT appears to be more selective for M. abscessus with lower activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv (S3 Table). In vitro growth kill kinetics indicated that EPT is bacteriostatic against M. abscessus as previously demonstrated against M. tuberculosis [19], while 10% of CFUs were lost at 24 hours with AMK and rifampicin (RIF) at 20X MIC90. Interestingly, these two antimycobacterial agents with bactericidal action against other mycobacteria lose this ability when targeting M. abscessus (Fig 1B) [20]. Clinical considerations for EPT Macrolides represent the cornerstone of M. abscessus therapy. However, macrolide susceptibility in vitro does not correlate with clinical outcome success due to point mutations at positions 2058 or 2059 in the 23S rRNA rrl gene (E. coli numbering), and inducible macrolide resistance conferred from the recently identified ribosomal methyltransferase erm(41) [21,22]. Nash et al (2009) discovered that M. abscessus exhibited an inducible resistant phenotype to macrolides, like clarithromycin (CLR), during a 14-day incubation. To this extent, we asked if EPT induced self-resistance or cross-resistance to macrolides. To answer this question, we performed the inducible macrolide resistance assay where M. abscessus was cultured with a subinhibitory concentration of CLR (0.016 μg/mL) or EPT (0.016 μg/mL) for 14 days. At 24 hours and 14 days, aliquots of culture were collected, and the MIC90 of CLR and EPT was determined using REMA. Relative to drug-free conditions, M. abscessus cultured with CLR displayed an increased MIC90 to CLR while the EPT MIC90 for bacteria exposed to EPT remained unchanged up to 14 days (Fig 1C solid bars). To ensure the increased MIC90 resulted from inducible resistance rather than the selection of spontaneous CLR and EPT resistant mutants, the cultures were passaged in antibiotic-free media for 6 additional days and the MIC90 measurements were repeated. In the case of CLR resistance, the MIC90 returned to baseline after the antibiotics were removed (Fig 1C dotted bars). In addition, EPT stimulation did not result in cross-resistance to CLR, and CLR induction did not result in cross-resistance to EPT. The latter is an important finding with clinical significance because CLR is known to impart resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics [23]. Because M. abscessus infections require 18–24 months of antibiotic courses, multidrug treatments are standard practice [2,3]. To ensure EPT would not hamper a multidrug regimen, we performed checkerboard assays with common antimycobacterial drugs. In the checkerboard assays, we used RIF/CLR and CLR/AMK as the synergy and antagonism controls, respectively [23,24]. We did not observe antagonism between EPT and various antimycobacterial agents that target a range of cellular processes (S2 Fig). Whether EPT should be included in a multidrug regimen remains to be determined. EPT protects zebrafish from M. abscessus infection In order to investigate the in vivo activity of EPT, we used the embryonic zebrafish model of M. abscessus infection, which has been developed to test the in vivo efficacy of drugs against M. abscessus [25–27]. Initial experiments indicated that EPT concentrations up to 40 μg/mL (final concentration in fish water) did not interfere with larval development and was well tolerated in embryos when treatment was applied for up to 5 days with daily drug renewal (Fig 2A). Green fluorescent wasabi-expressing M. abscessus (R variant) was microinjected in the caudal vein of embryos at 30 hours post-fertilization. EPT was directly added at 1 day post-infection to the water containing the infected embryos, with EPT-supplemented water changed on a daily basis for 5 days. Embryo survival was monitored and recorded daily for 11 days. While a slight increase in the survival rate was observed with 10 μg/mL EPT, this effect was significantly improved with 40 μg/mL EPT with a delay in larval mortality, as compared to the untreated group (Fig 2B). The protection provided by EPT is maintained throughout the 5-day treatment course and was correlated with decreased bacterial burdens beginning 4 dpi demonstrated by fluorescent pixel counting (Fig 2C and 2D). These results clearly indicate that EPT protects zebrafish from M. abscessus infection. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g002Fig 2EPT in vivo activity against M. abscessus.A EPT toxicity against zebrafish embryos.

Scale bar, 200 μm. EPT targets LeuRS in M. abscessus Benzoxaboroles were shown to inhibit LeuRS in fungi, gram-negative pathogens and most recently M. tuberculosis [11,19,28]. To determine the target of EPT in M. abscessus, 109 CFUs were plated on solid media with 10X, 20X, or 40X MIC90 of EPT to select EPT-resistant mutants. Control mutants were also selected on 40X MIC of AMK. Unlike the EPT resistance frequency of 4.8 x 10−8 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the resistance frequency was 10-fold lower in M. abscessus (S4 Table, 2 x 10−9) [28]. The low in vitro resistance frequency to EPT is highlighted when compared to the control mutants against AMK (1.3 x 10−8). In order to confirm that isolated resistant mutants were true mutants to EPT, we performed REMA using a panel of antimycobacterial agents on the four mutants (one selected on 10X, one on 20X, and two on 40X MIC90 of EPT). We also screened one AMK mutant. As illustrated in S3 Fig, the four EPT mutants were resistant up to 2.7 μg/mL EPT, while maintaining susceptibility to AMK, bedaquiline (BDQ), and RIF. Likewise, the AMK control mutant was only resistant to AMK. Since benzoxaboroles are known to target LeuRSs, we used a focused approach to identify the mutation(s) in leuS that could be responsible for the observed EPT resistance. leuS was PCR amplified from gDNA from the four EPT mutants, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using Sanger sequencing (S5 Table). In all four mutants, a G to C transversion at position 1306 was identified, which resulted in the conserved D436 residue critical for the catalysis of editing misaminoacylated tRNALeu substituted for H436 (Fig 3A and 3B) [29]. This was further supported with whole-genome sequencing of the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 reference strain, one mutant isolated at 20X MIC, and one mutant isolated at 40X MIC. When compared to the reference strain, five variants were identified in the 20X mutant including a T to G transition at position 1261 in leuS which resulted in a Y421D substitution. Furthermore, the G to C transversion at position 1306 which lead to the D436H substitution was confirmed in the 40X mutant (S6 Table). This contrasts with LeuRS variants identified in P. aeruginosa such as T323P, T327P, and V429M from Hernandez et al. or LeuRS variants such as T322I, D326N, A414V, and R435H identified in a phase 2 clinical trial for complicated urinary tract infections caused by E. coli from O’Dwyer et al. [28,30]. However, the phase 2 clinical trial did identify E. coli isolates with a LeuRS D436A variant. (M. abscessus numbering). To verify the functional significance of the D436H substitution, the leuS genes from M. abscessus ATCC 19977 wildtype (EPT sensitive) and M. abscessus containing the G1306C substitution (EPT-resistant) were cloned into the mycobacterial integrative vector pMV306 under the control of the constitutive hsp60 promoter, yielding pMVhsp60_leuSD and pMVhsp60_leuSD436H. EPT-sensitive M. abscessus was electroporated with pMVhsp60_leuSD, pMVhsp60_leuSD436H, or empty vector control. Only EPT sensitive M. abscessus complemented with the mutant leuS (pMVhsp60_leuSD436H) and not the wildtype leuS (pMVhsp60_leuSD) had increased resistance to EPT (Fig 3C). The integrative complement system using pMVhsp60 may not have provided a complete phenocopy of the true mutant when compared to the episomal equivalent. Also, M. abscessus may not use the hsp60 promoter from M. bovis with optimal efficiency. Lastly, the hsp60 promoter may not operate with the same strength as the leuS promoter. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g003Fig 3EPT targets the editing domain of LeuRS in M. abscessus.A Domains of M. abscessus LeuRS.

Data shown is mean ± SD from three biological replicates. We showed that LeuRSD436H confers high-level resistance to EPT and that complementing the resistant allele into a wildtype background imparts resistance. As a complementary means of verifying the target, we adapted a CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) system for gene knockdown in M. abscessus [31]. CRISPRi facilitates gene knockdown using a guide RNA and catalytically inactive Cas9 endonuclease to sterically prevent transcription of a gene of interest when induced with anhydrotetracycline (ATc). We used CRISPRi to knockdown leuS which resulted in hyper susceptibility to EPT. Since leuS is an essential gene in M. abscessus (Fig 3D), we used 10-fold and 20-fold less ATc than required for complete growth suppression when targeting an essential gene. The EPT MIC99 of the strain induced with 0.1 μg/mL ATc decreased 10-fold compared to uninduced conditions, while induction did not affect the rifabutin (RFB) MIC99 (Fig 3E). These results provide further evidence that EPT targets LeuRS in M. abscessus. EPT binds the editing active site of LeuRS Although EPT is active against M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis, the MIC90 for M. abscessus whole-cell activity is 7-fold lower (MIC90Mabs 0.063 μg/mL vs MIC90Mtb 0.46 μg/mL). We hypothesized that EPT had a higher affinity for the M. abscessus LeuRS editing active site. We therefore performed binding studies between EPT and the editing domains of LeuRS from M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (S4 Fig). M. abscessus LeuRS and M. tuberculosis LeuRS contain a single binding site for EPT, and we obtained similar equilibrium dissociation constants and Gibbs free energies (Table 2). The EPT—M. abscessus LeuRS binding has a higher enthalpic contribution (1.1 to 3.2 kcal mol-1), while the EPT—M. abscessus LeuRS binding has a lower entropic contribution (5.5 to 3.3 kcal mol-1).

ΔG, change in Gibbs free energy; ΔH, change in enthalpy; ΔS, change in entropy; T, temperature (303K) Kd, dissociation constant To gain insight into the interactions between EPT and LeuRS, we solved the crystal structure of the M. abscessus editing domain (LeuRS303-498). We obtained the crystal structures of the LeuRS editing domain unliganded 2.1 Å resolution (PDB 7N11) and in complex with the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) adduct with EPT at 1.7 Å resolution (PDB 7N12, S7 Table). AMP acts as a surrogate for the 3’ end of the tRNA acceptor stem. In concordance with the binding mode of action of benzoxaboroles [19], we detected strong electron density in the active site corresponding to the EPT-AMP adduct formed through covalent interactions between the boron atom of EPT and the 2’ and 3’ hydroxyl groups on the ribose ring of AMP (Figs 4A and S5A). Comparing unliganded and liganded residues in M. abscessus editing domain structures shows a sizable shift of residues 416–422, located around the adenosine pocket, upon drug binding, including ordering of Y421 to interact with the EPT-AMP adduct phosphate, and a decrease of B factors in the neighbouring residues (S5B Fig). This increase in order could explain the relatively lower entropic contribution to binding observed in ITC, although an unliganded M. tuberculosis structure is not available for comparison. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g004Fig 4Similar binding of benzoxaboroles to the editing domain of LeuRS.EPT-AMP (blue) bound in the active site of M. abscessus LeuRS (cyan) and a similar benzoxaborole-AMP (brown) bound in active site of M. tuberculosis LeuRS (PDB 5AGR) (orange).

A Critical arginine and aspartic acid residues make similar interactions with benzoxaboroles. B Phosphate from AMP pivots towards threonine residue in M. abscessus LeuRS. Conformer 1 of T323 points OH towards EPT, while conformer 2 orients OH towards the phosphate. Once bound with benzoxaborole-AMP adduct, the active sites of M. tuberculosis (PDB: 5AGR) [19] and M. abscessus LeuRS, and mode of adduct binding are very similar (Figs 4A and S5C). Both proteins make critical contacts with the primary amine side chain through D433 (D447 in M. tuberculosis) and the universally conserved D436 (D450 in M. tuberculosis) (Fig 4A). In addition, R435 (R449 in M. tuberculosis) hydrogen bonds with the ethoxy oxygen of EPT and packed with the ribose of AMP (Fig 4A). The packing interaction on the ribose of AMP is underscored from E. coli mutants with R435H variants that lead to resistance early in the phase 2 clinical trial for complicated urinary tract infections. EPT has a hydroxypropyl ether moiety, rather than the ethyl ether in the benzoxaborole bound to M. tuberculosis LeuRS, but the extension shows very weak electron density and likely does not contribute to binding. The only notable difference is a ~1 Å shift in phosphate group of the EPT-AMP adduct (Fig 4B). In both complexes, the phosphate is pinned between Y421 (Y435) and T323 (T337). The electron density indicates that there are multiple rotomeric conformations of T323, meaning its hydroxyl could hydrogen bond with the phosphate or with the 3’ O and ether oxygen of the adduct (Fig 4B). M. tuberculosis LeuRS T337 is modelled in the latter position, but inspection of deposited maps also indicates multiple rotomeric conformations. Variants at T322, T323 and T327 were identified in P. aeruginosa and E. coli mutants resistant to benzoxaboroles, which supports the importance of the threonine rich region for editing activity [32]. From the structural data, we propose that EPT binds LeuRS from M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis in a similar manner with similar affinity, providing a shared pathway for future structure-activity relationship analysis. Norvaline is toxic to editing-deficient EPT mutants Since resistance to EPT was shown in a phase 2 clinical trial of complicated urinary tract infections from E. coli, we sought a way to minimize the emergence of resistance in M. abscessus pulmonary infections [30]. We hypothesized that norvaline, a non-proteinogenic amino acid absent from extant proteins [33], would be toxic to M. abscessus editing-deficient mutants that acquired EPT resistance. When challenged with 59 μg/mL norvaline, the D436H editing-deficient mutant was significantly reduced in growth, while the wild-type strain was not inhibited (Fig 5A). The mutant strain complemented with wild-type leuS (D436H::leuSD) displayed a two-day lag before significant growth. As controls, leucine and isoleucine were not toxic to the D436H mutant. There was however a minor reduction in mutant growth in 59 μg/mL valine, but no growth difference between the D436H and D436H::leuSD strains. Thus, we cannot conclude that valine exerts some toxicity to editing-deficient strains. Next, we asked if norvaline toxicity could be rescued with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The D436H mutant was grown in 59 μg/mL norvaline with varying concentrations of BCAAs. Leucine but not isoleucine or valine rescued growth (Fig 5B). These observations corroborate the results that LeuRSs contain natural selectivity with their aminoacylation site for leucine and can discriminate against isoleucine and valine, but to a lesser extent against norvaline as non-cognate amino acids [34]. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g005Fig 5Norvaline is toxic to M. abscessus D436H editing deficient mutants.A ATCC 19977, D436H mutant, and D436H:leuSD complement strains were grown in Sauton media with 59 μg/mL norvaline (top left), 66 μg/mL leucine (top right), 59 μg/mL valine (lower left), or 66 μg/mL isoleucine (lower right).

Norvalination of the proteome induces the heat shock response To provide a mechanism of norvaline toxicity, we analyzed the proteomes of wild-type, D436H mutant, and D436H:leuSD grown in norvaline or valine as control. We analyzed ~2500 proteins from whole-cell lysates after 12 hours or 3 days of incubation in 59 μg/mL norvaline or valine using reverse-phase HPLC/MS. Proteins filtered for leucine residues 14 Da lighter (14 Da corresponds to missing methylene group on norvaline) were enumerated using spectral counting. The wild-type maintained preferential incorporation of leucine into proteins, while the D436H mutant had a median norvaline misincorporation in 6% of the proteome after 12 hours. However, the amount of norvaline misincorporation between the D436H mutant and the D436H::leuSD strain was not significantly different (Fig 6A). Given that there was a two-day delay when the complemented strain was grown in norvaline (Fig 5A), we hypothesized that the effects of gene complementation would be seen at a later time point when grown in 59 μg/mL norvaline. The experiments were repeated, and the strains were incubated for 3 days. Again, the median norvalination increased in the D436H mutant relative to wild-type, but the level of misincorporated norvaline increased to 20% of the proteome. At this time point, the complemented strain partially rescued the level of norvalination after 3 days (Fig 6B). In all conditions tested, we measured background misaminoacylation of valine in the proteome (Fig 6A and 6B). 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g006Fig 6Norvaline misaminoacylation in editing deficient mutants alters the proteomic landscape.A-B

C-F Protein fold abundance shown as D436H mutant relative to M. abscessus ATCC 19977. Dashed red lines indicate 0.5x and 2x fold abundance thresholds for biologically relevant changes. Next, we asked how the cell responded to stress caused by norvaline misincorporation in the proteome. Using total spectral counting, we determined the fold change in protein abundance from D436H mutant relative to wild-type. There was a distinct increase in proteins when challenged with norvaline that was absent from the valine control (Fig 6C-F). We used the protein-protein interaction (PPI) mapping tool STRING to identify upregulated proteins with common functions. When 130 of the most highly abundant proteins after norvaline stress were mapped for PPIs (Fig 7A), proteins belonging to the Clp protease family (ClpP1, ClpP2, ClpX) and GroEL chaperonin family (GroEL, GroL2, GroS) were identified (False discovery rate 7.2x10-4 at 12 h, 2.1x10-5 at 3 d) (Fig 7C). As a control, 130 randomly selected proteins from the norvaline dataset were not enriched for chaperonins and proteases when analyzed for PPIs (Fig 7B). We also observed a temporal change in chaperonin and protease levels where early stress from norvaline at 12 hours upregulated chaperonins followed by protease upregulation at 3 days (Fig 7D). This data suggests that norvaline misincorporation into the proteome results in toxicity from misfolded proteins [14,33,35–40]. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g007Fig 7Norvaline stress induces the heat shock response in editing deficient mutants.A Protein-protein interaction network from the 130 most abundant proteins in D436H mutant when challenged with 59 μg/mL norvaline for 12 hours. 942 PPIs identified with PPI enrichment p-value < 1.0x10-16.

Norvaline reduces resistance to EPT in vitro and potentiates EPT activity in vivo Knowing that norvaline targets LeuRS editing domain, we asked if norvaline could prevent escape mutants to EPT in vitro. We observed a 23-fold reduction in escape mutant frequency when M. abscessus ATCC 19977 was plated on 7H10 plates containing 10X MIC90 EPT and 590 μg/mL norvaline (1.89 x 10−10) over EPT alone (4.28 x 10−9) (Fig 8A); as a control, RFB did not benefit from norvaline supplementation. To test whether this effect would be observed in other mycobacteria, we repeated with M. tuberculosis, again observing a suppression of EPT mutants with norvaline exposure (Fig 8A). Next, the MIC90 of EPT against M. abscessus ATCC 19977 was measured with differing doses of norvaline (Fig 8B). Norvaline had no effect on the MIC90 even up to 590 μg/mL. These results suggest norvaline does not act as a traditional adjuvant to EPT. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g008Fig 8Norvaline improves epetraborole efficacy in vitro and in vivo.A Mutant frequency to 10X MIC90 EPT (0.63 μg/mL) or 10X MIC90 EPT + 10X MIC90 norvaline (590 μg/mL) in M. abscessus ATCC 19977 and M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

We evaluated EPT and norvaline combination therapy for in vivo activity in a NOD.SCID mouse model of M. abscessus infection [41]. Mice were infected intranasally with a high inoculum of M. abscessus (~106 CFU). Treatment was started 1-day post-infection with once-daily oral vehicle (carboxymethylcellulose), RFB as positive control (10 mg/kg), EPT (10 mg/kg), EPT + norvaline (10 mg/kg + 3.3 mg/kg), or norvaline (3.3 mg/kg). Norvaline was dosed at 3.3 mg/kg (5 mM) which represents ~10X MIC90
in vitro against the editing deficient D436H mutant. Previously, norvaline had been shown to be an effective in vivo neuroprotective agent as an arginase inhibitor at 2 mM in a triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease [42]. Compared to vehicle-treated mice, we measured a 1 log10 decrease in bacterial burden in the lungs from RFB or EPT treatment. Furthermore, the addition of norvaline to the EPT group was significantly more active than EPT alone with an additional ~1 log10 decrease in bacterial burden in the lungs while norvaline alone had no significant effect (Fig 8C).
