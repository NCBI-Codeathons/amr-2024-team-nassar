["2. Results and Discussion", "2.1. The Resistance-Gene Database", "Table 1 shows the number of resistance genes collected from four major data repositories. Among these four databases, the resistance genes collected from CARD have detailed annotation information. Therefore, they are directly used in our database without the need for further modification or additional annotation. MIBiG records valuable BGC data, including well-characterized product information [26]. The mechanisms of most resistance genes were determined manually from annotations in the database and subsequently validated by comparison with the CARD database. A total of 629 hidden Markov model profiles of resistance genes were collected from NCBIAMR, and each of them was manually annotated with their involved resistance mechanism and compound. The functional annotation of the resistance genes found in the Uniprot database is less than that given by the other three databases. Except in the case of the efflux pump, most of the annotation is completed by comparing these genes with resistance genes recorded in the other three libraries by transferring the annotation obtained on the linkage to the query Uniprot genes. Table 1 also provides statistics on the annotated resistance mechanisms in the database, showing that product inactivation is the most frequent among the five resistance mechanisms, followed by the efflux pump, while the target modification mechanism is the least frequent. Supplementary Table S1 lists all 7297 entries of resistance gene sequences and 629 HMM models of resistance gene profiles in the database.", "As a demonstration of the application of the RGDB database, it is interesting to study the distribution of resistance genes inside the recently disclosed marine bacterial genomes and, in particular, to analyze their relationship with the natural products that may be synthesized by the gene clusters of these bacteria.", "2.2. The BGCs in the Bacterial Genomes of MarRef", "The marine microbial genome is considered one of the richest resources for natural products due to the diverse environmental conditions in which marine microorganisms live; the genome has proven extremely valuable in discovering new natural products with different structures and biological activities. An important reason for the diversity of marine natural products may be that microbial populations compete to win by synthesizing complex, biologically active, and diverse compounds to inhibit the growth of other similar populations in survival competition. We applied the RGDB to analyze a recently published marine microbial genome dataset, i.e., the MarRef dataset. A total of 1403 genomic sequences were downloaded from GenBank [42] for the MarRef dataset, 13 of which could not be processed with antiSMASH 6.0 due to formatting errors, resulting in a total of 1390 genomes being analyzed in this study. The detailed species taxonomy of the selected organism is listed in Supplementary Table S2, which is summarized in Figure 1A. Parsing these genomes with antiSMASH yielded 7432 BGCs, ranging from 5 to 670 kb. Figure 1B shows the distribution of the broad classes of BGC products detected, with the most abundant being RiPPs (22%), followed by terpenoids (14%) and NRPS (12%). Note that antiSMASH could not even determine, for the remaining 40% of the BGC products, which class of compounds they belonged to, let alone their specific compound structures and activities. Statistical analysis by species origin of BGCs showed that the three major bacterial producers of secondary metabolites are Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, which together contributed more than 80% of the BGCs, and the archaeal producer Euryarchaeota, which contributed 2% of the BGCs (Figure S1). BGCs from other clades contribute much less and are therefore not shown. As previously observed, the number of BGCs per genome varies considerably among bacteria.", "2.3. Preliminary Product Annotation of BGCs by Organizing Gene Clusters into Gene Cluster Families", "Identifying BGCs with known metabolites is essential to genome mining, allowing researchers to prioritize known and unknown biosynthetic pathways for new natural product discovery [43]. Gene cluster family (GCF) analysis enables the large-scale annotation of query BGCs based on their similarity to the reference BGCs in MIBiG with well-characterized product and derivative information. After GCF analysis, these marine BGCs were first grouped into families using BiG-SCAPE, yielding the gene cluster families (GCFs). BiG-SCAPE [39] analysis showed that the studied BGCs were mainly clustered together within orders, resulting in a set of 5803 GCFs (of which, only 518 families had more than three members) organized into a network based on their genetic components and arraignment within the reference BGCs (Figure 2). The analysis resulted in 5803 GCFs, of which, only 208 GCFs, i.e., 3.6% of the total, had a corresponding 327 reference BGCs in their family. The product information of these GCFs was then predicted based on that of the reference BGCs, resulting in 23 RiPPs, 10 terpenes, 94 NRPS, 102 PKS, 31 PKS-NRPS, and 67 other products. Note that hybrid BGCs, such as those of PKS-NRPS, might be presented in more than one family; a similar scenario was found in previous GCF analyses [38].", "2.4. Identifying Resistance Genes in MarRef BGCs Using RGDB", "The identification of resistance genes in MarRef BGCs is straightforward using the newly constructed RGDB, which gives 7079 putative resistance genes distributed in 3878 BGCs (see Table S3 for details; also see http://www.mingbioinfo.online/rga/marrefdata (accessed on 23 February 2023)). These identified resistance genes were classified according to their resistance mechanisms, the most common being efflux pumps, with a total of 4183. Most efflux pumps are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. Some efflux pumps have narrow substrate specificity, such as tetracycline efflux, while others are relatively broad. As the most typical mechanisms of product inactivation, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, and glyoxylate/bleomycin resistance proteins repeatedly appear in these MarRef BGCs. Vancomycin resistance genes were found to be the most frequently occurring genes for target-related mechanisms. It is worth mentioning that the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase used for fatty acid biosynthesis is present in many BGCs. Previous studies have found that copy number can be increased by self-replication and mutation, thus providing resistance to the host [44,45]. The analysis of these putative resistance genes showed that 118 of these 3878 BGCs detected to have resistance genes did carry multiple resistance genes of different types and mechanisms, without considering the efflux pump mechanism (see the two cases in Table 2). Thus, resistance mechanisms may not be unique for each bacterium, and multiple resistance mechanisms may evolve depending on the compound, which supports previous findings.", "2.5. The Self-Resistance Gene-Directed Natural-Product Discovery", "As an application of the RGDB database, self-resistance gene-directed screening may lead to the identification of BGCs from a vast number of microbial genomes, whose encoded natural products might have potentially higher biological activity due to the resistance. In the Marref genome database, BGCs containing self-resistant genes were first collected through RGDB screening and then analyzed via the GCF [34] method to determine the type of products encoded. Specifically, if a GCF containing a MarRef BGC also includes known BGCs from the MIBiG database, then the known compounds encoded by MIBiG BGCs can be used to predict the types of the natural product encoded by the MarRef BGC, including the chemical scaffolds and their possible interactions with the involved self-resistance genes. The annotation of the resistance mechanisms provides insights into the biological activities of the encoded natural products. Supplementary Table S4 records 51 GCFs that were screened using this method, including 164 MarRef BGCs and encoded natural product frameworks.", "Table 3 lists three typical examples from the self-resistance gene-directed natural-product discoveries. As the first example, the MarRef BGC was detected with a resistance gene tetB(P), which encodes a tetracycline ribosome protection protein. This gene cluster was assigned to the GCF_01148 family and listed along with the known MIBiG BGC0000853, identified to synthesize the compound ectoine. Therefore, based on the GCF evolutionary relationship, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the product of CP018047.1.region026 may have a chemical scaffold similar to ectoine, which is a potential inhibitor to protein synthesis, thereby exhibiting antibacterial bioactivity. The second example involves five MarRef gene clusters, all containing the ABC-F resistance gene and belonging to the GCF_05426 family. Through the MIBiG gene cluster BGC0001502 in this GCF, it is inferred that these BGCs synthesize an NRP-type compound called amonabactin P 750. The evolutionary analysis thus suggests that these MarRef BGCs can produce similar amonabactin P 750, which should have inhibitory effects on ribosomal protein synthesis. In the final example, the MarRef BGC was assigned to the GCF_07814 family that contains the typical resistance gene aac(3), which encodes an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. The evolutionary analysis indicates that the product scaffold of CP043317.1.region037 is similar to lobophorin A/B, a macrocyclic lactone with antibacterial bioactivity. The bacterium can acquire resistance to this natural product by modifying the transferred aminoglycoside acetyl group.", "2.6. Analysis of Resistance Genes in Terpene-Producing BGCs", "As a diverse class of natural products with a wide range of biological activities produced by microorganisms, it is of great interest to study the coding of terpenoids in marine microbial BGCs and the role they may play in self-resistance. Of the 3878 BGCs screened that contained putative resistance genes, 553 were terpene-producing BGCs. Table 4 shows the selected 4 typical terpenoid BGCs for which resistance genes and products were identified, and details of the 553 BGCs are also listed in Table S3. Figure 3 shows the location of the resistance genes in the gene cluster for these four BGCs, indicating that the location of the resistance genes could occur anywhere in the BGC map. Figure 4 compares the structure of resistance gene proteins with their corresponding reference resistance gene proteins. The RMSD values calculated based on structural comparison ranged from 0.1 to 2 \u00c5, indicating that their structural similarity is very high, verifying that the queried resistance protein may be functionally identical to the reference protein, and the functional annotation of the corresponding resistance gene should also be reliable."]
