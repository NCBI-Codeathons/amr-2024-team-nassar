3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Sequencing, Assembly Data and Genomic Characteristics General data related to the draft genome of A. affinis strain CMG 70 is presented in Table 2. Briefly, the CMG 70 genome size was estimated at 37.6 Mp, assembled in 421 contigs, with 11,763 predicted coding sequences from which 13.7% encode for hypothetical proteins, and a GC content of 50.21%. The A. affinis CMG 70 genome size is larger (0.8%), has a slightly higher GC content (0.2%) and has 5.2% fewer genes than ATCC MYA-4773T. 3.2. Repetitive Sequences and Prediction of tRNAs Repetitive sequences are classified in Dispersed Repeats (DRs) and Tandem Repeats (TRs). The total length of the 12,411 DRs in the A. affinis CMG 70 genome amounts to 570,106 bp, covering 1.52% of the genome. With respect to the TRs, there are 4491 sequences with a total length of 262,036 bp covering 0.70% of the genome. 251 tRNAs were also predicted, with a total length of 22,032 bp covering 0.06% of the genome (Table 3). Among the tRNAs, 11 are possible pseudogenes and the remaining 240 anti-codon tRNAs correspond to the 20 common amino acid codons. 3.3. Gene Annotation The genome of A. affinis CMG 70 has 11,584 genes annotated according to the NCBI’s nonredundant protein (Nr), UniProt/Swiss-Prot, EggNOG, KEGG, GO, and Pfam databases (Table S1). There are 10,726 (91.2%) cellular proteins and approximately 1037 secreted proteins (8.8%) (Tables S1 and S3). The number of predicted proteins of CMG 70 is similar to that of ATCC MYA-4773T, as well as to what has been reported for other Aspergillus species, which vary from 9078 in A. coremiiformis to 14,216 in A. transmontanensis [34]. Functional analysis (GO, Biological Processes) showed that most genes are involved in cellular (43%) and metabolic process (36%), cellular localization (12%), and biological regulation (9%) (Figure 1, Table S1). Genes classified within the “cellular process” category were mainly classified as being involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (32%); intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport (28%); signal transduction (16%); cell wall and cell cycle control (13%); cytoskeleton (6%); and others (5%), which include defense mechanisms and extracellular structures. Within the “metabolic process” category, A. affinis genes are involved in the metabolism and transport of carbohydrates (21%), amino acids (18%), lipids (10%) and inorganic ions (8%); in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (19%); and in energy production and conversion (13%). In GO, Molecular Functions, genes are involved in catalytic (51%), binding (39%), and transport (10%) activities (Figure 1, Table S1). These values are in agreement with what has been described in the literature for fungi. 3.4. Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZymes) There are 566 genes encoding putative CAZymes, from which 295 carry signal peptides, that were annotated using the HMMER database (Table S2). Among these genes, 279 encode for glycoside hydrolases (GH), 22 for carbohydrate binding modules (CBM), 96 for glycosyltransferases (GT), 107 for oxidoreductases (AA), 39 for carbohydrate esterases (CE), and 23 for pectate lyases (PL) comprising 146 distinct CAZymes families. The main GH family includes β-glucosidades (GH3), chitinases (GH18), cellulases (GH5), β-xylosidades (GH43), polygalaturonases (GH28), and amylases (GH13). Regarding GT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (GT1), cellulose/chitin synthases (GT2), and xylanase (GT90) were the most abundant. Carbohydrate binding modules 67, which is a lrhamnose-binding present in pectin and hemicellulose [35] and CBM20 associated with starch binding [36], were the most CBM abundant. All these enzymes have an important role in the degradation of polysaccharides, such as fucoidan, chitin, pectin, hemicellulose, and starch [37]. This may reveal a certain adaptation for the fungus to obtain carbon sources from different marine substrates, such as the algal fucoidan, pectin, cellulose, and chitin present in some algae and crab and shrimp shells. Glucooligosaccharide/chitooligosaccharide oxidases (AA7), cellobiose dehydrogenase (AA3), and copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (AA9), which belong to auxiliary activity (AA) family were the most predominant. Carbohydrate esterase families are classified in 18 sub-families and catalyze the de-O or de-N-acylation of substituted saccharides. In A. affinis, 11 CEs are present with CE4, the most abundant. CE4 participates in the deacetylation of polysaccharides, such as xylan, chitin, and peptidoglycan [38]. Enzymes acting in the deacetylation of peptidoglycan may be involved in the degradation of bacterial cell wall, being attractive for drug design with potential application in biomedical industry. Aspergillus affinis genome encodes PL genes such as pectate lyase (PL1) and rhamnogalacturonan endolyase (PL4). This family is known to be involved in the breakdown of pectin that is synthesized in abundance by terrestrial plants but is not known as a marine polysaccharide [39]. However, pectin-like polysaccharides have been reported in red and green algae, microalgae and in seagrasses [40]. 3.5. Transporter Proteins We observed transporters from all protein classification (TC) classes: channels and pores (TC 1), electrochemical potential-driven transporters (TC 2), primary active transporters (TC 3), group translocators (TC 4), transmembrane electron carriers (TC 5), accessory factors involved in transport (TC 8), and incompletely characterized transport systems (TC 9). There were 3005 predicted genes annotated as transporters against TC database, accounting for 25.6% of the total predicted genes for A. affinis (Table 4 and Table S4). Genes from the TC 2 class are the most abundant transporters of A. affinis CMG 70 genome (32.7%), followed by genes from the classes TC 1 (19.6%), TC 9 (16.1%), and TC 3 (15.3%). The A. affinis genome encodes transporters involved in the transport of zinc, sugar/H+, florfenicol, pantothenate, and various MFS (Major Facilitator Superfamily) transporters. It is known that MFS transporters in fungi play an important role in multidrug resistance [41] and are required for fungal growth under stress conditions [42]. Furthermore, we identified several genes coding for glycerol, inositol, sodium, and chloride transporters. By increasing these compounds’ production and accumulation and others such as erythritol, arabitol, xylitol, mannitol, mycosporines and nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., glycine, betaine, and free amino acids), the cell is able to maintain a positive turgor pressure [43]. Two mechanisms explain how fungi tolerate high salinity levels: their high affinity transport systems and osmoregulatory capacity. Marine fungi produce and accumulate specific solutes that allow them to function in saltwater [44]. For example, in the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, the myo-inositol and its transporters play a major role in the tolerance to salt stress [45]. Moreover, Kogej et al. [43] and Plemenitaš et al. [46] also showed the production of glycerol, erythritol, arabitol, and mannitol and the involvement of alkali metal transporters (K+/Na+) by the halophilic fungus Hortaea werneckii as osmoadaptation. All four polyols have also been detected in A. flavus and A. parasiticus in response to osmotic stress [47]. We annotated many genes involved in glycerol, mannitol, inositol, trehalose, sorbitol, glycine, and betaine biosynthetic process, suggesting that A. affinis has adaptability mechanisms to thrive in saltwater. Furthermore, genes essential for the MAPK high osmolarity (Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1-Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1 and Sho1-Cdc42-Ste20(or Cla4)-Ste11-Pbs2-Hog1) and cell wall stress cascades (Wsc1-Rom2-Rho1-Pkc1-Bck1-Mkk1-Slt2) were identified, resulting in glycerol accumulation to reduce the osmotic pressure and in cell wall remodeling. Gladfelter et al. [48] suggests that the high-osmolarity-glycerol signaling pathway seems in part to be linked to the water balance, cell stability and turgor in fungi. Also, transporters associated to ionic homeostasis (TC 1) encoding for calcium channels, nucleoporins, and heat shock 70 proteins’ transporters were also detected, allowing rapid changes in the cell physiology of A. affinis. 3.6. Biosynthetic Gene Clusters Seventy-two biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) involved in the secondary metabolism of A. affinis CMG 70 were predicted (Table S5). Biosynthetic gene clusters encode a form of machinery that produce bioactive compounds. In addition to biosynthetic genes, BGC typically include genes for expression control, self-resistance, and export of the compounds they encode [49]. The BGCs identified encode 7 terpenes, 5 indoles, 23 t1PKs (type 1 polyketide synthases), 8 NRPS (non-ribosomal peptide synthase), 7 NRPS-t1PKs, 14 NRPS-like, 3 NRPS-like-t1PKs, 1 NRPS-like-indole, 3 NRPS-indole, and 1 betalactone. From the BGCs identified, 9 BGCs have 100% similarity with known BGCs, such as asperlactone (anti-fungal), serinocyclin A (anti-insect), UNII-YC2Q1O94PT (ACR toxin I), pyranonigrin E (antimicrobial), biotin (vitamin), clavaric acid (antitumor), pseurotin (antibacterial), 6-methylsalicyclic acid (mammal-toxic) and AbT1 (anti-fungal). Other BGCs, such as cluster 33, shared 75% gene similarity with nidulanin A BGC, cluster 61 is likely to be an ochratoxin A BGC (60% of genes show similarity), and cluster 41 acts as aspergillic acid coding BGC (57% of genes show similarity). Cluster 14, 22 and 34 have 50% similarity with notoamide A, hexadehydroastechrome and asperphenamate, respectively. Other genes probably involved in BGC of squalestatin S1, ankaflavin, patulin, shearinine D, NG-391 and ochrindole A, were also detected. 3.7. Phylogenetic Analyses Recently, Houbraken et al. [50] created three series within the section Circumdati to distinguish the species, namely Circumdati, Sclerotiorum, and Steyniorum. As can be seen in Figure 2, A. affinis CMG 70 groups in the same clade as the type species of A. affinis strain ATCC MYA-4773 (=CBS 129190), which belongs to ser. Circumdati. This series forms a sister clade with ser. Steyniorum, which is phylogenetic related with ser. Sclerotiorum. 3.8. Comparative Analyses 3.8.1. General Features The analysis showed that the genomic features of A. affinis strain CMG 70 and of ATCC MYA-4773T are similar, regarding genome size, GC content and number of predicted genes. The average size of all genomes from the section Circumdati is 37.08 Mb. Aspergillus muricatus CBS 112808 has the smallest genome, i.e., 1.5% smaller than A. westlandensis CBS 123905. Moreover, Circumdati species genomes have a moderate GC content around 49.37% (Figure 2, Table S6). 3.8.2. CAZymes Differences in the number of CAZymes between both strains of A. affinis were observed with more 8.6% CAZymes in ATCC MYA-4773T (Figure 2, Table S7). In addition, some CAZymes appeared to be strain-specific, such as those from families AA2, CBM46, CBM67, CBM87, CE2, CE18, GH146, GH 109, and GT109 for strain CMG 70, while AA5, CBM1, CBM13, CBM18, CBM 32, CBM35, CBM48, CBM50, GH23, GH74, GH115, GH133, GT31, and GT41 for strain ATCC MYA-4773T (Table S7). These differences may be related to the availability and type of carbohydrates in the environment where the strains where isolated from. An average of 568 CAZymes per species was predicted (Figure 2, with the exception of A. melleus CBS 546.65 and A. ochraceus AO.MF010 since no information is available at the Mycocosm portal). This is similar to what has been reported for 23 species of the section Flavi (598/species) [34]. Within the section Circumdati, there is a clear difference between the type and number of CAZymes among the three series of this section (Figure 3A). Within this section, the ser. Steyniorum showed the lower abundance of CAZymes, while series Sclerotiorum showed the highest. Carbohydrate esterases, GT, PL and GH were more prevalent in ser. Sclerotiorum, in opposition to ser. Circumdati in which AA and CBM are more prevalent. 3.8.3. Transporter Proteins The genome of A. affinis CMG 70 contains 57.2% more transporters compared with ATCC MYA-4773T (Figure 2, Table S6). The highest number of transporters predicted in A. affinis CMG 70 might be associated with to the salinity control, since this strain was isolated from a marine environment. A total of 20,387 transporters were predicted for the 15 Circumdati strains analyzed (approximately 1360 transporters per strain) (Table S6, Figure 2). The number of predicted transporters is similar in most species. Exceptions are A. melleus CBS 546.65 and A. ochraceus AO.MF010 with no annotated transporters and A. affinis CMG 70, with 2.2 times the number of transporters than the rest of the genomes analyzed. TC2 transporters’ family is the most represented in all Circumdati species although slightly more abundant in ser. Steyniorum (Figure 3B). The second most abundant class in the section Circumdati was the TC 3. According to our analyses, there is no difference in the distribution of this transporter family among the three series of this section (Figure 3B). No variation was also observed for TC 1, TC 4 and TC 5. In contrast, TC 8 and TC 9 are the most prevalent in the ser. Circumdati, followed by ser. Steyniorum and ser. Sclerotiorum (Figure 3B). 3.8.4. BGCs Aspergillus affinis CMG 70 contains 8.9% fewer BGCs than A. affinis ATCC MYA-4773T (Figure 2, Table S6). Overall, genomes of Aspergillus species from the section Circumdati are rich in gene clusters involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites (average 73/species). Type 1 polyketide synthases were the most abundant type of gene clusters, followed by NRPS and NRPS-like, PKs-NRPS hybrid clusters, terpenes, and indoles (Figure 2). Aspergillus elegans and A. subramanianii have the highest number of BGCs (80), while A. ostianus has the lowest (64). Figure 4 shows the list and similarity of known secondary metabolite BGCs of Circumdati species genomes. The pyranonigrin E and UNII-YC2Q1O94PT (ACR toxin I) BGCs were detected in all genomes with 100% similarity showing a high degree of conservation in this section. Pyranonigrin E is a PKs-NRPS hybrid metabolite from A. niger isolated from a marine source. Pyranonigrins are of considerable interest as potent antioxidants [51]. ACR toxin I is responsible for brown spot of rough lemon disease by the rough lemon pathotype of Alternaria alternata [52]. This suggests that Circumdati species may be able to also cause lemon leaf spot disease, but more studies are needed to understand the effect of this toxin in other plants. Additionally, aspergillic acid, asperphenamate, and hexadehydroastechrome/terezine-D/astechrome BGCs were detected in all genomes but with similarity above 28%, 50%, and 37%, respectively, suggesting that some genes may be partially incomplete or lost. Nidulanin A, sequalestatin S1, notoamide A and ochrindole A were also detected in all genomes with exception of A. ostianus, A. elegans, A. pulvericola/A. roseoglobulosus, and A. subramanianii/A. sclerotiorum respectively (Figure 4). Interestingly, bikaverin and chaetoglobosins BGCs were detected exclusively in Aspergillus series Sclerotiorum (with the exception of A. roseoglobulosus). On the other hand, asperlactone BGC were detected in all species of series Circumdati and Steyniorum and curiously only in A. roseoglobulosus, which belong to series Sclerotiorum (Figure 4). Asperlactone belongs to methylsalicylic acid (MSA) type polyketide group and is produced by A. westerdijkiae. It has been reported that asperlactone has strong antibacterial and antifungal activities [53,54]. Aspergillic acid is a hydroxamic acid-containing pyrazinone isolated from A. flavus that exhibits antibiotic properties and toxicity for mammals [55]. Lebar et al. [56] reported that Circumdati species do not produce aspergillic acid, but neoaspergillic acid and its hydroxylated analog neohydroxyaspergillic acid, indicating that the cluster responsible for these is a homolog of aspergillic acid BGC. This six-gene cluster is constituted by AsaA (ankyrin domain protein), AsaB (GA4 desaturase family protein), AsaC (NRPS-like), AsaD (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase), AsaR (C6 transcription factor) and AsaE (MFS transporter). This gene architecture was found in both strains of A. affinis, with the AsaR gene incomplete. However, the C6 transcription factor is not essential for the synthesis of aspergillic acid and its derivatives [56]. Nidulanin A is a cyclic tetrapeptide isolated from A. nidulans. The nidulanin A gene cluster is conserved in all Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. and its biological functions are not yet known [57]. Recently, Raffa and Keller [58] mentioned that this compound is being tested for antimicrobial or virulence-related properties. The presence of the four genes encoding nidulanin A (MFS and ABC multidrug transporter, NRPS and conserved hypothetical protein) was observed in both strains of A. affinis. Although we did not detect nidulanin in its metabolome, we cannot overrule the hypothesis of nidulanin being produced—or another very similar compound—by Circumdati species. Notoamides are alkaloids with the pyranoindole ring common to stephacidins (antitumor alkaloids) found in A. ochraceus and in several members of the paraherquamide family. These prenylated indole alkaloids were obtained and characterized from a culture of a marine Aspergillus sp. isolated from the mussel Mytilus edulis [59]. Currently, there is no well-known property or function for notoamides, although some studies showed cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, insecticidal, antibiotic and antiparasitic activities [60,61,62]. The genetic architecture of a notoamide BGC comprises 18 genes (notA–R). It was not possible to detect notK–R genes in both strains of A. affinis (Figure 5A). The cluster is identical only in 10 not genes (notA–J) and the pattern of the exon/intron arrangement in the corresponding genes is also highly similar between strains, including the 2 genes that were not described in the not gene cluster—the cold shock protein and the ubiquitin carbon terminal hydrolase genes. Li et al. [63] stated that the sequence similarity from notK to notR is quite reduced, and that the gene architecture differs drastically, suggesting that the previously assigned not gene cluster probably ends at notJ and the other not genes are unlikely involved in notoamide biosynthesis. Since notK–R genes were not also detected and considering the hypothesis of the notK–R not being involved in notoamide synthesis, it is possible that Circumdati species produce notoamide or a notoamide related compound. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a problematic toxic metabolite that is widely distributed in food products, such as cereals, rice, soya, coffee, cocoa, beans, peas, peanuts, fresh grapes, and dry fruits, posing risks to human and animal health [2]. It was first reported in A. ochraceus, but many other Aspergillus and Penicillium species and other molds have been reported as OTA-producing species. Recently, Gil-Serna et al. [2] showed that the genomic regions that encode for OTA widely differ in Circumdati species. Some species, including A. affinis, contain a potentially functional OTA biosynthetic cluster suggesting that these species have the potential to synthetize the toxin, and others contain partial regions which might be related to their inability to produce OTA. In A. affinis CMG 70 we found the cluster region containing five genes known to be involved in OTA biosynthesis: halogenase, bZIP transcription factor, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, NRPS, and a PKs. In fact, when we analyzed the dried crude extracts of A. affinis CMG 70 (see Section 3.9), ochratoxin A was detected as one of the most expressed compounds. Ochrindoles (A–D) are prenylated bis-indolyl benzoid/quinone and ochrindole A is the most common of the four ochrindole compounds known [64]. Ochrindoles are known for their anti-insect properties, making ochrindoles (or derivatives)-producing species, of interest for the pesticide industry. Kjærbølling et al. [34] already identified candidate-genes for the ochrindole cluster in A. steynii, a member of the section Circumdati. Both strains of A. affinis shared 12 genes within ochrindole A BGC which is comprised of 17 genes (Figure 5B). The lack of the five genes (hypothetical protein, fructosyl amino acid oxidase, allantoate permease and 5-oxoprolinase coding genes) might (or not!) compromise the synthesis of ochrindole A. A deeper investigation on this subject is needed. Patulin is a carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by several species found in fruit and vegetable-based products, posing a serious health risk to consumers [65]. Patulin production has been doubtfully reported in several species, including some Penicillium and Aspergillus spp., such as A. ochraceus [66]. Confirmed and efficient production of patulin has been found only in A. clavatus, A. giganteus and A. longivesica (section Clavati). The biosynthesis of patulin and its gene cluster are well known. We identified 3 of the 15 pat genes: patC (MFS transporter), patD (dehydrogenase) and patE (oxidoreductase), in both strains of A. affinis, suggesting that this species and probably all the others Circumdati species do not produce patulin. In fact, we did not detect patulin in the extracts of A. affinis. Nielsen et al. [67] showed that although Penicillium roqueforti has most of the pat genes needed for production of patulin, some genes are lacking and therefore it is unable to produce it. Squalestatin S1 (also known as zaragozic acid) is a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase, an important enzyme for sterol biosynthesis [68]. Squalestatin S1 exhibits antifungal activity [69] and was found in some ascomycetes [70,71]. More recently the squalestatin S1 producing BGC from Aspergillus sp. Z5 was reported in Paecilomyces penicillatus [72] and halophilic marine fungus Eurotium rubrum [73]. The cluster of both A. affinis strains shared three out of four genes of squalestatin S1 BGC: the core enzyme farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (squalene synthase), a DnaJ domain protein and other one conserved hypothetical protein. When observing the predicted BGCs of the two strains of A. affinis (CMG 70 and ATCC MYA-4773T) (Figure 4) we were able to detect some differences in the diversity of the BGCs present: the AbT1, biotin and epipyriculol BGCs were detected only in CMG 70, while curvupallide-B, neurosporin A, solanapyrone D and ucs1025a in ATCC MYA-4773T. Furthermore, we found that the NG-391 BGC was exclusive of A. affinis suggesting that this cluster region is species specific. NG-391 was firstly identified in an insect pathogen Metarhizium robertsii [74] with similar structure to the mutagenic and carcinogenic mycotoxin fusarin C [75]. However, Donzelli et al. [74] reported that NG-391 does not contribute significantly to M. robertsii virulence. Recently, Kato et al. [76] isolated a lucilactaene compound from Fusarium sp. RK97-94 which is structurally related to NG-391. The same authors reported that lucilactaene and NG-391 do not have the 7-methyl group present in fusarins and show antimalarial activity and moderate growth inhibitory activity against cancer cells. With a similar core biosynthetic gene and the MFS transporter, the NG-391 cluster in A. affinis also has a cytochrome P450, a terpenoid synthase, a DNA repair protein, an alcohol dehydrogenase, and a farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (Figure 5C). 3.9. Metabolome Analysis We profiled the metabolomes of A. affinis CMG 70 grown with and without sea salt. Quintuplicate profiles were combined for each condition for comparative analysis. The full list of ions is given in Table S8. Despite the presence of unknown compounds, the major classes identified were polyketides, phenolic compounds, terpenes, amino acids, drugs, mycotoxins, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, fatty acids, alkaloids, and indoles. The scores of PCA on all filtered ions clearly revealed dissimilarities in the metabolome of the salted and non-salted extracts of A. affinis (Figure 6). These results show that A. affinis produces different compounds in response to osmotic stress and may adapt to salinity oscillations. Subsequently, statistical testing on the filtered ions was conducted using a t-test. Computed p-values were adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. 749 ions (FDR < 0.01 and a log2 fold change (FC) > 2 or <−2) were significantly more (523) or less (226) abundant when the fungus was grown with sea salt (Table S9, Figure 7). Due to the lack of information, many of the predicted compounds of A. affinis CMG 70 remain unidentified. From the identified compounds, the most abundant in both conditions were, for example, ochratoxin A, daunomycinone, maltose, maltotriose, laminaritetraose, 3,5-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, methyldopa, 2-hydroxypentyl glucosinolate, 2-Chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine, N-Fructosyl pyroglutamate, and lecanoric acid. Gonçalves et al. [13] reported different biological activities of A. affinis CMG 70 under salted and non-salted conditions, suggesting that salt induces an alteration to the metabolic profile. Compounds such as 19R-Hydroxy-PGF2alpha, catechin, ferulic acid sulfate, 9S,11R-Dihydroxy-15-oxo-13E-prostenoic acid, N-Caffeoyl-O-methyltyramine, 7-(2-Cyclopentylidenehydrazinyl)-7-oxoheptanoic acid, and d-myo-Inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentaphosphate, and hydroxyferulic acid were most abundant under salted conditions, while 4-O-β-Galactopyranosyl-d-mannopyranose, lactobionic acid, (−)-Gallocatechin 3-gallate, quercetin-3-O-xyloside, 1,6-Anhydro-β-d-glucose, kelampayoside A, (+)-Fluprostenol, maltotetraose, isoreserpin, daunomycinone, (−)-Catechin gallate, aleuritic acid, maltose, palatinose, maltotriose, and laminaritetraose under non-salted conditions. As demonstrated by Overy et al. [77] media supplemented with sea salt applies a selective pressure on the metabolic profile of the fungus, regardless of the marine or terrestrial origin of the isolates. It is noteworthy that salt induces an increase of lipids, peptides, polyketides, and phenolic compounds in A. affinis. This suggests possible physiological mechanisms due to the accumulation of osmolytes and mechanical strengthening of the cells to adapt and tolerate different salinity levels. At this point, it should be stressed that, as stated by Drabinska et al. [78], the presence of salt changes the nature of the molecular interactions between compounds. It might affect the quality of the extraction and induce the decrease of the intensity of the detected ions. Though some differences might be due to the presence of salts and not to differential expression by the fungus grown in the presence of salt, the water–cyclohexane extraction step should ensure that the amount of salt in the sample is reduced to a non-significant level. Analysis of A. affinis extracts by LC-MS proved effective in detecting bioactive compounds that have been reported for their multiple activities, such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and pesticides (Table 5). Despite significant efforts, new drugs are required to combat the increase in drug-resistance and the emergence of new viral infections. In this regard, we identified 3,5-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, that has been reported recently as a precursor of anti-viral compounds [79]. In addition, epigallocatechin, which has been associated with anti-viral properties [80], was also found in our crude extracts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these bioactive compounds in a fungus. The dissemination of antibiotic resistance in clinical and non-clinical environments is a serious, difficult to control problem, and a risk to public health [81]. Therefore, the discovery and production of new anti-bacterial compounds is crucial and constitutes a breakthrough for medicine. In the present study, we identified anti-bacterial compounds, such as 3-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol, lPyroglutamic acid, and lecanoric acid. 3-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol was detected for the first time in A. nidulans isolated from a forest soil sample (India) [82]. We also identified genes involved in the biosynthesis of carbapenem, streptomycin, novobiocin, penicillin, and cephalosporin (Table S1). Apart from anti-viral and anti-bacterial compounds, we also detected antifungal compounds, such as 9,12,13-Trihydroxyoctadec-10-enoic, hydroxyferulic acid, lpyroglutamic acid, lecanoric acid, scopoletin and 4,6-dihydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)-3,4a,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8a-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-one. This last compound was also identified in the marine-derived fungus A. insuetus, which was isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Psammocinia sp. [83] and in Pleosporales sp. from marine sediments of Bohai Sea [84]. Furthermore, lecanoric acid has been detected in a marine strain of A. versicolor [85]. Although marine fungi are less explored compared to terrestrial fungi, some marine species have yielded a wide range of diverse compounds with anti-cancer properties [7]. In this context, some known chemotherapeutic metabolites, such as daunomycinone and mitoxantrone, were also found in the crude extract of A. affinis. To our knowledge, this is first report of these compounds in fungi.
