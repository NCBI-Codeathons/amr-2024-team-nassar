["RESULTS", "Determination of the lexQSABC operon.", "The organization of the lexABC cluster and the gene lexR were described in our previous study (17). There are two other genes located closely upstream of lexABC; here, we have named them lexQ and lexS, respectively. The lexS gene overlaps lexA by 4\u2009bp and is 8\u2009bp immediately downstream of lexQ (Fig.\u00a01A). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized using RNA from L. antibioticus OH13 to assess the coexpression of lexQ, lexS, lexA, lexB, and lexC genes. Fragments 1, 2, 3, and 4 from the two adjacent genes were amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) but not from RNA or the negative control (Fig.\u00a01B). Thus, the genes from lexQ to lexA formed an operon, designated lexQSABC.", "FIG\u00a01Determination of the lexQSABC operon.

Hence, we hypothesized that LexR directly regulates these genes. A putative promoter region found by the online promoter prediction tools BPROM may drive this coexpression (Fig.\u00a02A; see also the supplemental material). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to determine if LexR directly activates lexABC expression by binding to the promoter upstream of lexQ. A 165-bp DNA probe (lex probe) was amplified with primers labeled with biotin at the 5\u2032 end. LexR with a His tag was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified using affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed a single protein band with a molecular mass of ~53.1\u2009kDa, indicating that LexR was successfully expressed and purified for subsequent EMSA (Fig.\u00a02B). EMSA results indicated that purified LexR bound to the biotin-labeled lex probe, which reduced its mobility (Fig.\u00a02C). Moreover, DNA-protein-binding bands were enhanced with increasing concentrations of LexR. This phenomenon was greatly inhibited by unlabeled promoter (Fig.\u00a02C). We used a 158-bp promoter region (control probe) from another RND efflux pump operon to perform the control experiment. The result showed that LexR did not bind a probe of similar length from an unrelated promoter region (Fig. S1). Thus, the regulator LexR specifically binds to the promoter region of the lexQSABC operon.", "FIG\u00a02LexR directly regulates LexABC expression.

Thus, we used 58-bp (probe 1) and 50-bp (probe 2) biotin-labeled probes with and without this site, respectively, to examine the need of this site for LexR binding. Subsequently, EMSA was carried out with purified LexR and probes 1 and 2, which showed that LexR bound to probe 1 but not to probe 2 (Fig.\u00a03). To further confirm that the predicted binding sequence for LexR is necessary or sufficient, we performed another experiment. Probe 3 (58\u2009bp from the control probe in Fig. S1) and probe 4 (which replaced the predicted binding sequence to probe 3) were synthesized and then incubated with LexR in an EMSA (Fig. S2). The result showed that addition of the putative binding sequence to probe 3 could not sufficiently induce its binding to LexR (Fig. S2). Thus, the 8-bp putative binding sequence is necessary but not sufficient for LexR binding to the promoter region.", "FIG\u00a03Confirmation of the necessary sequence in the promoter region of lexQSABC for LexR binding.

So, we next examined whether lexABC transcriptional activation by myxin via enhancing LexR-DNA binding. An EMSA in the presence of myxin, LexR protein, and lex probe was performed. The result showed increased intensity in the LexR-DNA binding complex with myxin compared to LexR and probe alone but not affecting LexR-DNA migration in the gel. Increasing the myxin concentration resulted in more LexR-DNA complex formation, indicating that myxin enhanced LexR-DNA binding in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a04). Control assays were conducted with various concentrations of myxin added to the probes without LexR, which suggested that myxin did not damage the DNA probe under this condition (Fig.\u00a04).", "FIG\u00a04Myxin enhanced the binding of LexR to the lexQSABC promoter region.

The concentrations of LexR and myxin are shown. Myxin was incubated with DNA probe as a control.", "LexR displays a binding site for myxin.", "The three-dimensional structure of LexR predicted by AlphaFold was downloaded from UniProt. Domain prediction and molecular docking showed that the valine residue at position 146 (V146) and lysine at 195 (K195) were likely myxin binding sites (Fig.\u00a05A and B). This docking agrees with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Myxin was immobilized on the chip surface, and different LexR concentrations were run over the chip surface. LexR bound myxin with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.28\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129 M, indicating efficient binding (Fig.\u00a06A). Subsequently, we obtained residue mutants LexR-V146A, LexR-K195A, and LexR-V146A-K195A, to which myxin bound weakly, with KD values of 8.04\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, 3.01\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123, and 8.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 M, respectively (Fig.\u00a06B to D). Amino acid residues V146 and K195 are therefore essential for LexR binding by myxin, and K195 was more important for strong interaction. To further quantify the different effect of LexR and LexR-myxin complex on lexABC transcription, we constructed LexR site-directed mutants of V146A and K195A in vivo and detected the expression level of lexA in the mutants via quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene complementation of lexR partially restored lexA transcription compared to the lexR mutant, and V146A mutant acted identically to the complemented strain, whereas the K195A mutant showed a lower lexA expression level than the lexR complemented strain (Fig.\u00a07). The results indicated that the LexR-myxin complex contributes to lexABC transcription.", "FIG\u00a05Predicted binding sites of LexR to myxin. (A) Domain structure of LexR.
