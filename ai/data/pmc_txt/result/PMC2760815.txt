RESULTS Phylogenetic relatedness of aminoglycoside resistance 16S rRNA methyltransferases Aminoglycoside resistance MTs form a distinct group within the SAM-dependent RNA methyltransferase superfamily. Based on sequence similarity, all MTs proposed to methylate G1405 on 16S rRNA are grouped in the Pfam database as 16S rRNA MT with FmrO domain (29). Within this group, MTs originating from both G+C-rich and G+C-low bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) are clustered together irrespective of their phylogenetic relationships. To date, in addition to nine distinct sequences from the actinomycetes, five unique enzymes have been identified in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp (30), and together are classified as the Arm MTs (rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD and armA). We analysed amino acid sequence relatedness across this group of enzymes and identified a general division between G1405 MTs from the actinomycetes producers and those found in pathogens (Figure 1A). However, two enzymes from the actinomycetes Micromonospora and Frankia genera, FmrO and Krm, respectively, were found to cluster with MTs originating in pathogenic Gram-negative species. This observation supports the previous suggestion that pathogens may have acquired their resistance MTs from unidentified Gram-positive micro-organisms via horizontal gene transfer (31,32). In contrast, only a single example of a plasmid-mediated A1408 MT resistance enzyme (NpmA) from clinically isolated E. coli (14) has been identified in addition to the three distinct Kam MTs from the actinomycetes (5,9) (Figure 1B), although it is highly likely that further examples of this group will be identified in the future. Since the evolutionary relationship of MT enzymes from producers and pathogens in both groups is not clear, we previously proposed classification into four distinct subfamilies based on their origin and target (31): ‘Kgm’ family (kanamycin–gentamicin MTs) in producers and ‘Arm’ family (aminoglycoside resistance MTs) in pathogens methylating G1405, and ‘Kam’ family (kanamycin–apramycin MTs) in producers and ‘Pam’ family (pan-aminoglycoside resistance MTs) in pathogens methylating A1408 residue. This classification is supported by our maximum likelihood analysis of sequence phylogenies (Figure 1A and B). Two Kam MTs, CmnU and Kmr, belong to the same clade as NpmA originating from the pathogenic bacteria (Figure 1B), suggesting a possible acquisition route for Pam MTs in pathogens. However, for these two Kam MTs methylation sites are currently unknown (33,34). Identification of the Sgm target nucleoside in 16S rRNA Unmethylated and in vivo methylated 16S rRNA was isolated from E. coli 30S ribosomal subunits and analysed by MALDI-ToF MS to detect changes in methylation patterns. MALDI-ToF MS can measure masses of small RNAs with accuracy well below 150 p.p.m., and thus the presence or absence of a methyl group can be readily identified by a mass difference of 14.02 Da. The preferred RNA size for analysis is in the trinucleotide to dodecanucleotide range. Therefore, molecules as large as 16S and 23S rRNAs require prior digestion with specific RNases to yield fragments of suitable sizes (28). Fragmentation was achieved by hybridization of a complementary deoxyoligonucleotide to the 55 nt sequence from C1378 to G1432 in 16S rRNA, digestion with nucleases and denaturing PAGE isolation of the resulting 55-nt RNA. This was followed by digestion of the purified RNA fragment with RNase T1 to generate the final short fragments for analysis. Comparison of RNase T1 fragment m/z signals from unmethylated and in vivo Sgm methylated 16S rRNAs reveals that the spectra are very similar, with only two specific differences. Peaks at m/z 1307.22 and 3197.41, that correspond to fragments 1402-C2mCCG-1405 and 1406-UmCACACCAUG-1415, respectively, are observed in the unmethylated RNA spectrum but are completely absent for the methylated sample (Figure 2A and B). In contrast, the methylated RNA spectrum contains a peak at m/z 4487.57 that is not observed in the unmethylated RNA (Figures 2 and 3). These observations are entirely consistent with methylation of G1405 by Sgm. The introduction of the methyl group on G1405 would render this position resistant to RNase T1 cleavage (35), resulting in a composite fragment for nts 1402–1415. This sequence from 16S rRNA has three methyl groups originating from ‘house-keeping’ MTs that are located on C1402 (dimethylated) and C1407 (36) (Figure 1C). These methylations are also observed in the RNA from E. coli not transformed with Sgm-encoding plasmid, and no RNA unmethylated at these positions is observed (see peak 3′, 3 and 8 in Figure 2A). Thus, expression of Sgm results in the sequence 1402-C2mCCG(m)UCmACACCAUG-1415, where the additional methylation in parenthesis is the confirmed modification by Sgm. The measured m/z of 4501.73 for the largest ion correlates very well with the theoretical m/z of 4501.80 for a tetramethylated sequence (Figures 2A and 3C). Our data therefore confirm both these E. coli modifications and that Sgm methylates G1405.

Values indicated are monoisotopic, monoisotopic +1, and average masses in panels (A) to (C) respectively. The major peak in the spectrum does not, however, correspond to this most heavily modified fragment but has an m/z of 4487.57, corresponding to a trimethylated RNA (theoretical m/z 4487.78). This ion could result from the loss of any one of the four methyl groups during the MALDI process and is typical for measurements in the reflectron ToF mode (36). Indeed, in addition to the minor peak corresponding to four methylations at m/z 4501.73, the major peak is accompanied by an additional minor peak (Figure 3C) that corresponds to a dimethylated fragment (m/z 4473.67), i.e. the loss of two methyl groups (theoretical m/z 4473.76). To examine whether the triply and doubly methylated RNAs might be formed during the measurement from a 4-fold methylated precursor, we examined the loss of methyl groups from the fully methylated composite 1402-1415 RNA fragment (m/z 4501.73) in a post-source decay (PSD) experiment (Figure 4). The ion gate was set to allow only ions from m/z 4500–4560 (shaded region in the spectra of Figure 4) into the field-free drift region of the ToF tube with the laser intensity increased to cause a higher degree of laser-induced dissociation (LID). As expected, the parent ion was measured at m/z 4501.46 and, in this mode of operation, all smaller ions must be fragments derived from this ion. A strong fragment measured at m/z 4445.55, resulting from the loss of all four methyl groups from the composite 1402–1415 RNA fragment was observed (Figure 4B). This supports our hypothesis that the heterogeneity in the data for the composite RNA fragment results from the loss of methyl group(s) during the measurement and that the fragment with the largest mass is methylated at four different sites, including by Sgm at G1405 (Figures 2B and 3C). We do not observe any signals for the RNA fragments resulting from RNase T1 cleavage at nt 1405 in E. coli expressing Sgm and no signal for the composite 1402–1415 RNase T1 fragment in untransformed E. coli (Figure 3). Taken together with the PSD data, we conclude therefore that the methylation of G1405 in E. coli expressing Sgm is stoichiometric.

Analysis of in vitro methylation of 16S rRNA by other members of the Kgm family and KamB Our analysis of 16S rRNA fragments methylated in vivo by Sgm confirmed that this enzyme, like Kgm (5,7), methylates G1405. To extend this analysis across the Kgm family we selected two further G1405 MTs, including the previously uncharacterized ‘Krm’ from Frankia sp. CcI3. Although originating in a producer strain, this MT aligns more closely with the group of G1405 MTs from pathogenic bacteria in our sequence phylogeny analysis (Figure 1A). Purified small ribosomal subunits were incubated in vitro with recombinant Sgm, GrmA and Krm MTs in the presence of SAM, and isolated 16S rRNA fragments were subjected to MALDI-ToF MS analysis as before. Again, a composite fragment of nts 1402–1415 was detected due to the inability of RNase T1 to cut at m7G1405 producing peaks at m/z ∼4487 and/or ∼4501 that correspond to tri- and tetramethylated fragments respectively (Figure 5). We note that for Sgm the trimethylated composite fragment is again predominant, while for GrmA and Krm the tetramethylated RNA is observed. Since we would expect all samples to be similarly affected by loss of methyl groups in the instrument, this casts some doubt on the idea that this mechanism leads to the trimethylated fragments for Sgm. An alternative explanation that Sgm can somehow alter the methylation pattern in this region other than at G1405, while GrmA and Krm cannot, would require further investigation. Most importantly, however, for each enzyme the composite fragment can only be observed following methylation at G1405 making the site resistant to RNase T1. Thus, we present experimental confirmation that each of these MTs, together with KgmB, originating from different actinomycetes genera, constitute a family of 16S rRNA G1405 MTs. Signals at m/z 1307 (fragment 1402–1405) and m/z 3198 (fragment 1406–1415) corresponding to the individual fragments without G1405 modification were also observed in all in vitro (Figure 5) but not in vivo (Figures 2 and 4) methylated samples. This indicates that 30S subunits were only partially modified at the target residue under the in vitro conditions used.

The measured average mass is indicated for each peak. Finally, we examined one member of the Kam family, KamB from S. tenebrarius, for which a modification to the originally suggested open reading frame was recently proposed based upon in silico protein fold-recognition analysis and modelling (37). The model indicated that the Streptoalloteichus hindustanus KamB (CAI47641) lacked a significant part of the SAM-binding domain and therefore could not be a functional methyltransferase enzyme. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of all kam genes revealed a conserved region upstream of the start codon originally suggested by Holmes et al. (9). Choosing an alternative upstream translation initiation site within the published gene sequence added 60 amino acids to the deduced protein N-terminus and completed the expected SAM-binding fold in the model (37). The KamB protein expressed here contained this additional sequence at its N-terminus. MALDI-ToF MS analysis of RNA fragments from KamB methylated 16S rRNA identified an additional fragment of m/z 3211.49 (Figure 6). This corresponds well with the predicted m/z 3211.47 for the dimethylated RNA fragment that results from an additional methylation of 1406-UmCACACCAUG-1415 (theoretical m/z 3197.45) at A1408 by KamB. This site of methylation is further supported by the complete absence of any signal for the monomethylated form of this prominent RNA fragment (compare Figures 3A, 3B and 6B). Although the precise methylation site was not determined here, a study on the closely related KamA from S. tenjimariensis (Figure 1B) showed that methylation occurs at the N1 position of A1408 (5). Strikingly, in contrast to the incomplete in vitro methylation by Kgm family MTs, close to 100% efficiency was achieved under the same conditions by KamB. We can only speculate on the differences between the Kgm and Kam family MTs tested that might cause this disparity though differing enzyme processivity or activity of purified enzymes are the most obvious candidates since the 30S subunits used in both experiments were from single preparation and therefore of identical quality.

Resistance profiles conferred by the Kgm and Kam family MTs The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aminoglycosides were measured using E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants containing Kgm family and KamB MT-encoding plasmids (Table 1). In liquid culture, all Kgm family MTs conferred high-level resistance to 4,6-DOS aminoglycosides tested (kanamycin and gentamicin), with a MIC exceeding 1000 μg/ml. A 3-fold increase in resistance to hygromycin B was also observed (MIC 150 μg/ml) (Table 1). However, susceptibilities to the 4,5-DOS aminoglycosides neomycin and paromomycin, and also to apramycin and streptomycin were unaffected. In contrast, E. coli BL21(DE3) containing KamB-expressing plasmid had ∼40 times increased resistance to neomycin in addition to high-level resistance to kanamycin and apramycin (Table 1). Unlike the Kgm family MTs, KamB MT did not confer resistance to gentamicin. Growth on hygromycin B was comparable and yielded a MIC value similar to that observed for Kgm MTs (Table 1).
