Results S. chromogenes ATCC43764 inhibits S. aureus by secreting 6-TG To identify CoNS that antagonize the community-acquired MRSA strain S. aureus USA300-LAC (hereafter termed S. aureus), we screened a number of CoNS using the simultaneous antagonism assay3 (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1a). Among the species and strains screened, we found that S. chromogenes strain ATCC43764, the type strain for the species, inhibited S. aureus growth on tryptic soy agar (TSA). We next demonstrated that the inhibitory molecule was secreted as spent culture supernatant (hereafter termed supernatant) of S. chromogenes also inhibited growth of S. aureus in liquid culture (Fig. 1b). The secreted molecule with inhibitory activity was found to be <3 kDa and resistant to heat and proteases (Supplementary Fig. 1A–D). For identification, the active molecule in S. chromogenes supernatant was enriched using sequential steps of centricon filtration, FPLC, and, finally, HPLC. Following HPLC, several contiguous fractions antagonized S. aureus growth equally (Supplementary Fig. 2A). These fractions were then analyzed by mass spectrometry in three independent experiments (Supplementary Table 2) to identify molecules present. We calculated a “score ratio” of these molecules to determine the relative abundance of these compounds across contiguous fractions within each experiment and found three molecules present in relatively equal abundance in biologically active fractions between experiments. Using these criteria, 6-TG (tioguanine; thioguanine), cinnamic acid, and indoleacrylic acid were the best candidate molecules (Supplementary Table 2). Indoleacrylic acid exerts anti-inflammatory activity and promotes intestinal barrier function18 and, based on this, we surmised it was unlikely to antagonize S. aureus growth. Interestingly, 6-TG and cinnamic acid have previously been shown to inhibit bacterial growth19–21. While cinnamic acid had no inhibitory effect on S. aureus, 6-TG impaired S. aureus growth on TSA (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Taken together these data suggest that the inhibitory molecule secreted by S. chromogenes is 6-TG (Fig. 2a).Fig. 1S. chromogenes secretes a molecule that inhibits S. aureus growth.a Simultaneous antagonism assay of selected representative CoNS on TSA. b

Identification of the 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes ATCC43764 Next we sought to determine the genetic basis of 6-TG biosynthesis in S. chromogenes ATCC43764. To date, only Erwinia amylovora, a Gram-negative plant pathogen, has been shown to synthesize 6-TG, attributable to the four-gene ycf operon22,23. Hence, we sequenced and annotated the S. chromogenes ATCC43764 genome to mine for encoded proteins with predicted functional domains similar to YcfA and YcfB from E. amylovora, which are necessary and sufficient for 6-TG biosynthesis23. Using InterPro to predict functional protein domains, we identified Rossman-like alpha/beta/alpha folds and an adenine nucleotide hydrolase-like domain in YcfA and NADH pyrophosphatase and NUDIX hydrolase domains in YcfB. Interestingly, we found two gene products with identical functional domains within a predicted six-gene operon in the S. chromogenes ATCC43764 genome (Fig. 2b). Examination of the predicted products of each of the six genes within the operon (see Table 1) suggest roles in sulfur transfer, nucleotide metabolism, and secretion/efflux.Table 1Putative function of gene products in the S. chromogenes 6-TG biosynthetic cluster.ProteinPredicted functione.g., homolog; organismConfidence (%)Coverage (%)TgsAPLP-dependent cysteine desulfuraseSufS; Bacillus subtilis10096TgsBNucleotide alpha hydrolase; sulfur transferaseTtuA; Thermus thermophilus10097TgsCNUDIX hydrolase family protein; DNA mismatch repair; pyrophosphataseMutT; Bacillus halodurans99.9100TgsDMembrane protein; effluxEmrE; E. coli10095TgsENUDIX hydrolase family protein; DNA mismatch repair; 8-oxo-dGTP diphosphataseMutT; Mycobacterium smegmatis99.989TgsFHaloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase; phosphataseYfnB; Bacillus subtilis10092Phyre2, the protein homology/analogy Recognition Engine v.2.0, web portal was used to search the protein structure databases for predicting protein structure and function.

Phyre2, the protein homology/analogy Recognition Engine v.2.0, web portal was used to search the protein structure databases for predicting protein structure and function. To prove this operon in S. chromogenes was responsible for synthesizing 6-TG, we attempted to delete it from the S. chromogenes genome. Unfortunately, we were unable to transform the bacterium using existing plasmids and thus we were unable to genetically modify S. chromogenes using traditional molecular genetic methodologies. In lieu of this, we thus amplified and then cloned the genes from S. chromogenes into a plasmid and introduced this recombinant plasmid into S. aureus RN4220, creating a strain termed RN4220 ptgs. Remarkably, we showed that RN4220 ptgs inhibited S. aureus growth on TSA while RN4220 carrying an empty vector (termed RN4220 pEmpty) did not impair S. aureus growth (Fig. 2c). Moreover, supernatant from RN4220 ptgs inhibited S. aureus growth whereas supernatant from RN4220 pEmpty did not (Fig. 2d). Mass spectrometry was used to confirm that supernatants from RN4220 ptgs, but not RN4220 pEmpty, contained 6-TG (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data identify the genetic basis of 6-TG biosynthesis in S. chromogenes ATCC43764 and confirm that the expression of these genes by this species is detrimental to the growth of S. aureus. The six-gene operon was thus designated tgsA-F, for thioguanine synthesis. Identification of the tgs operon in other staphylococcal species Next, we assessed the diversity of the tgs operon and its homologs in publicly available genomes of Staphylococcus species. We surveyed 1388 genomes across seven different species of Staphylococcus and discovered that the operon and its homologs can be found in genomes from S. capitis, S. chromogenes, S. epidermidis, and S. pseudintermedius (Table 2 and Supplementary Data 1). A phylogenetic analysis of these sequences showed that the tgs operon grouped into species-specific clades, suggesting that the operon was acquired by a common ancestor of each species and was then passed down via vertical inheritance (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, in S. chromogenes strain 1401, the operon is present on a plasmid, suggesting that it has the potential to be passed between different strains and species via horizontal gene transfer.Table 2The tgs operon among staphylococcal species.SpeciesTotal analyzedTotal tgs-positive% total positiveStaphylococcus capitis848196.43Staphylococcus caprae1000.00Staphylococcus chromogenes10665.66Staphylococcus epidermidis80460.75Staphylococcus hominis11600.00Staphylococcus lugdunensis3400.00Staphylococcus pseudintermedius2346527.75Totals138815811.38Distribution of isolates surveyed for the tgs operon and its homologs using tBLASTn.Fig. 3The tgs operon is present in other staphylococcal species and functional.a Phylogenetic analysis of the 6-TG operon using completed and draft Staphylococcus genomes.

Results are pooled from two independent experiments, each with n = 3 replicates per condition. Data are shown as mean ± SD (**p ≤ 0.01. Two-sided unpaired t-test). To determine whether other CoNS that encode the tgs operon inhibit S. aureus growth in vitro, we tested both tgs-negative and -positive strains that were identified in our bioinformatic analyses using the simultaneous antagonism assay. As expected, the tgs-positive S. epidermidis M23864:W2 strain inhibited growth of S. aureus while the tgs-negative strains did not. However, both tgs-positive S. capitis strains did not inhibit S. aureus growth in our assay conditions (Fig. 3b). This result led us to hypothesize that expression of the tgs operon in these strains was repressed. Thus, to test this hypothesis, we amplified and cloned the tgs operon from one of the S. capitis strains (VCU116) into a plasmid, and introduced this recombinant plasmid into S. aureus RN4220, creating a strain termed RN4220 pVCU116 tgs. Of note, RN4220 pVCU116 tgs inhibited S. aureus growth while RN4220 pEmpty did not (Fig. 3c, d). Mass spectrometry confirmed that both RN4220 pVCU116 tgs and S. epidermidis M23864:W2 produce 6-TG. Moreover, supernatants from both tgs-positive S. capitis strains had detectable levels of 6-TG, although ~20-fold less than that of RN4220 pVCU116 tgs or the other tgs-positive species that showed growth-inhibitory effects on S. aureus (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Therefore, it is likely that the S. capitis strains did not inhibit S. aureus growth due to low amounts of secreted 6-TG. Next, we assessed whether expression of the tgs operon from both S. chromogenes and S. capitis is detrimental to RN4220, a S. aureus cloning strain. Both RN4220 ptgs and RN4220 pVCU116 tgs show a growth defect compared to RN4220 pEmpty, revealing that 6-TG production is detrimental to the growth of the producing S. aureus strain RN4220 (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Expression of tgs genes ameliorates S. aureus virulence in vivo Our results demonstrated that staphylococci that express the tgs operon inhibit S. aureus growth in vitro. To determine whether these strains can offer protection to the host and antagonize S. aureus in vivo, we performed co-infection experiments using S. aureus USA300 and tgs-negative or -positive S. epidermidis strains in a subcutaneous infection model, as these species are known to co-colonize on human skin11,24. We mixed S. aureus with either a tgs-negative or -positive S. epidermidis strain in a 1:1 ratio and measured the size of lesions over time. Importantly, we observed that co-infections with a tgs-positive S. epidermidis strain reduced skin damage caused by S. aureus compared to co-infections with a tgs-negative S. epidermidis strain (Fig. 4a, b). Admittedly, these experiments using different S. epidermidis strains were correlative. However, to demonstrate a causative effect of tgs genes, we repeated these co-infection experiments by combining S. aureus USA300 (produces necrotic lesions) with S. aureus RN4220 (does not produce necrotic lesions) carrying either pEmpty or ptgs. Remarkably, we observed that co-infections with RN4220 ptgs resulted in significantly smaller lesions compared to co-infections with RN4220 pEmpty (Fig. 4c, d). These data show that staphylococci that express the tgs operon can protect the host against necrotic skin infections caused by S. aureus.Fig. 4tgs expressing staphylococci reduce skin damage caused by S. aureus during co-infection.a Representative images showing necrotic skin lesions 4 days post infection with S. aureus + tgs-negative S. epidermidis str.

Two-sided unpaired t-test). 6-TG inhibits tissue necrosis during subcutaneous S. aureus infection Although co-infections with tgs-positive strains can protect the host against skin damage caused by S. aureus, it is unlikely that these strains can be administered as a probiotic to combat S. aureus infections as these bacteria may also cause infections on their own. Therefore, we sought to assess the therapeutic effect of 6-TG on formation of necrotic skin lesions in a subcutaneous S. aureus infection. To do this, we prophylactically administered 6-TG subcutaneously and measured the size of lesions throughout infection. Strikingly, we observed that the necrotic lesions of treated mice were significantly smaller than the lesions on mice injected with vehicle control (Fig. 5a, b). Moreover, we observed a reduction in bacterial load when we excised the lesions of mice treated with 6-TG relative to the mice given the vehicle control (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, in additional and in subsequent experiments, and irrespective of lesion size, if we excised similar areas of skin from both the vehicle and 6-TG-treated mice we found that, despite significant differences in lesion size between treated vs. untreated groups, similar bacterial burdens were present at 4 days post infection (Fig. 5c). The discrepancy in the measured bacterial load using these two methods suggest that quantification of CFUs is more accurate when a large section of the skin is excised, irrespective of the lesion size. Taken together, these data demonstrate that prophylactic treatment with 6-TG significantly reduces necrotic lesion formation caused by S. aureus.Fig. 5Prophylactic treatment with 6-TG reduces necrotic lesion size in subcutaneous infection.a Representative images showing necrotic skin lesions 4 days post infection with S. aureus ± prophylactic 6-TG treatment. b Quantitation of necrotic skin lesion size 4 days post infection with S. aureus ± prophylactic 6-TG (20 µg) treatment.

Data are shown as mean ± SD (two-sided unpaired t-test). 6-TG blocks toxin production in S. aureus in a purine-dependent and -independent manner 6-TG is a guanine analog that is known to inhibit purine biosynthesis20,25. In support of the notion that 6-TG inhibits S. aureus growth by interfering with purine biosynthesis, we show that a S. aureus purK mutant, with a disrupted purine biosynthesis pathway26, was largely resistant to 6-TG-mediated growth inhibition on TSA (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Furthermore, 6-TG is more potent against S. aureus grown on purine-deplete RPMI than on TSA (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). Indeed, S. aureus growth was partially rescued by addition of guanine in RPMI (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Interestingly, 6-TG is also active against strains representing other S. aureus clonal lineages, although to varying degrees (Supplementary Fig. 6). Taken together, these data indicate that 6-TG primarily impairs S. aureus growth by inhibiting purine biosynthesis. Since 6-TG abrogated necrosis in the S. aureus subcutaneous infection model, we questioned whether the compound could curtail production of S. aureus secreted toxins, which are required for tissue necrosis in this model27. Interestingly, several studies demonstrate a link between purine biosynthesis and S. aureus virulence20,26,28–31. To determine whether 6-TG, a purine biosynthesis inhibitor, reduces toxin production, we cultured S. aureus in tryptic soy broth (TSB) with 6-TG or a vehicle control to stationary phase (OD600 = 7.0), collected supernatants and analyzed the secreted protein profile using SDS-PAGE. We observed that supernatants from bacteria grown with 6-TG had less overall protein, including several toxins, compared to vehicle treated cultures (Fig. 6a). Next, we chose Hla as a representative S. aureus toxin and evaluated the effects of 6-TG on its levels in S. aureus cultures. Importantly, this toxin is known to be important for S. aureus pathogenesis in skin infections27,32,33. Here, we used an anti-Hla antibody to confirm that Hla levels were dramatically reduced when S. aureus was exposed to 6-TG (Fig. 6b), and demonstrated that this reduction in Hla was dose-dependent and correlated with its effect on growth (Supplementary Fig. 7A–C).Fig. 66-TG reduces S. aureus toxin production in a purine-dependent and -independent manner.a

To determine whether toxin production was abrogated by 6-TG due to its effect on purine biosynthesis, we performed SDS-PAGE on culture supernatants from S. aureus and purK::ΦΝΣ grown in TSB with 6-TG or a vehicle control. Interestingly, we observed that purK::ΦΝΣ secretes less overall protein compared to its wild-type counterpart in the absence of 6-TG, confirming that purine biosynthesis is linked to toxin production in S. aureus. However, purK::ΦΝΣ secretes less overall protein when cultured with 6-TG despite already being deficient in purine biosynthesis (Fig. 6c). A western blot analysis demonstrated that these findings also extend to Hla protein levels in cell culture supernatants (Fig. 6d). We confirmed that the effects of 6-TG on purK::ΦΝΣ were not due to an effect on growth, as the compound does not affect the mutant’s growth kinetics (Supplementary Fig. 8). Overall, these results suggest that 6-TG affects toxin production in both a purine-dependent and -independent manner. Next, we evaluated the importance of S. aureus purine biosynthesis for necrotic lesion formation in a subcutaneous infection. Here, we prophylactically treated mice with 6-TG or a vehicle control before subcutaneously infecting them with S. aureus or purK::ΦΝΣ. As expected, purK::ΦΝΣ caused smaller necrotic lesions compared to wild-type S. aureus in mice given a vehicle control (Fig. 6e). However, the lesion size caused by this mutant was unaffected by 6-TG, suggesting that a very-low amount of Hla is required for lesion formation and a significant increase in Hla levels is required to increase lesion size (i.e., the relationship between Hla levels and lesion size is not completely linear). Interestingly, purK::ΦΝΣ treated with 6-TG had a slight increase in bacterial burden relative to the control without treatment (Fig. 6f). These data reveal the importance of purine biosynthesis for the regulation of toxin production in S. aureus in a subcutaneous infection model. 6-TG abolishes transcription of ribosomal genes and genes of the pur and agr operons Next, we wanted to determine the exact changes that 6-TG exerts on S. aureus and to understand how it affects toxin production in both a purine-dependent and -independent manner. To accomplish this, we cultured both wild-type S. aureus and its purK::ΦΝΣ derivative to exponential phase (OD600 = 1.0) and exposed them to 6-TG for 1 h before collecting the cells and extracting the RNA to perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Some of the most upregulated genes upon exposure to 6-TG were CodY-regulated genes, such as branched chain amino acid synthesis genes. We attribute this to the effects 6-TG has on repressing guanine levels and, thus, guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is an effector molecule of CodY DNA binding and thus its transcriptional repression34. However, to understand how 6-TG inhibits toxin production in S. aureus, we focused our analyses on transcripts that were repressed by 6-TG. As expected, transcripts from the pur operon were significantly downregulated in wild-type cells treated with 6-TG, owing to the drug’s effect on purine biosynthesis. Surprisingly, transcripts from the agr operon and over 40 genes that encode for ribosomal proteins were also significantly reduced by 6-TG in wild-type cells (Fig. 7a). These results suggest that 6-TG abrogates toxin production in S. aureus in two ways; it downregulates transcription from the global virulence regulator agr and it globally reduces protein synthesis by preventing ribosomal proteins from being synthesized, which consequently impedes toxin production. Indeed, 1-h treatment with 6-TG already reduces the expression of hla by 1.65-fold (40%) (Supplementary Data 2). To determine which effects are purine-dependent or -independent, we compared transcript levels between WT and purK::ΦΝΣ in cultures treated and untreated with 6-TG (Fig. 7b). Strikingly, there was a strong overlap in genes that were affected by the purK mutation in S. aureus (Fig. 7b), versus WT treated with 6-TG (Fig. 7a). Indeed, there was a significant reduction in transcripts from the pur operon because purK::ΦΝΣ is inherently deficient in purine synthesis. However, the number of transcripts from genes that encode for many ribosomal proteins was also reduced compared to wild-type cells, suggesting a link between purine biosynthesis and ribosome synthesis. Interestingly, transcripts from the agr operon are reduced to a lesser extent in the purine biosynthesis mutant compared with WT that has been treated with 6-TG (Fig. 7b, c.f. a), suggesting that the effects 6-TG has on agr are not fully purine-dependent. In support of this, transcripts from agr are reduced further when the purK::ΦΝΣ culture is treated with 6-TG relative to the untreated purK::ΦΝΣ culture (Fig. 7c). No significant differences in the number of transcripts were found when comparing the transcriptome of the purK::ΦΝΣ mutant and wild-type cells when both cultures were treated with 6-TG (Fig. 7d). Altogether, these data show that 6-TG drastically reduces ribosome synthesis in a purine-dependent manner and blocks agr activation in both a purine-dependent and -independent manner. As a result, production of proteinaceous toxins will be significantly diminished as translation is blocked by 6-TG.Fig. 76-TG abrogates toxin production by reducing transcription from the agr locus and from genes encoding for ribosomal proteins.a RNA-seq analysis of wild-type S. aureus cultures treated with a vehicle control or 6-TG (10 µg/mL) in TSB.
