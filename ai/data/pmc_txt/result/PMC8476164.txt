Results Genomic Structure of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels We used targeted sequence capture to characterize Nav sequences from the genomes of five salamander species (order Urodela), including three TTX-bearing newts (family Salamandridae, subfamily Pleurodelinae, tribe Molgini), Notophthalmus viridescens, Taricha torosa, and Taricha granulosa (n = 3 diploid individuals of each species), and two salamanders that do not possess TTX, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis (Crypotobranchidae) and Plethodon cinereus (Plethodontidae, n = 2 each). We also identified Nav sequences within two publicly available salamander genome sequences: Ambystoma mexicanum (Ambystomatidae; Smith et al. 2019; AmexG.v6 assembly) and Pleurodeles waltl (Salamandridae; Elewa et al. 2017) and a full-body transcriptome from the fire salamander Salamandra salamandra (Salamandridae; Goedbloed et al. 2017; BioProject accession number PRJNA607429), all three of which appear to lack TTX (Hanifin 2010). The split between Cryptobranchus (suborder Cryptobranchoidea) and all the other salamanders in our study (members of suborder Salamandroidea) represents the most ancient division in the phylogeny of extant salamanders (∼160 Ma; Hime et al. 2021). We identified six Nav genes in the genomes of all salamander species, which is consistent with observations in other amphibians (Zakon et al. 2011). Hereafter, we use the exon delineation introduced in Widmark et al. (2011), where domain I (DI) is encoded by exons 2-9, domain II (DII) is encoded by exons 13-16, domain III (DIII) is encoded by exons 18-23, and domain IV (DIV) is encoded by exons 25-26. We obtained near full-length assemblies for all paralogs (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online); however, a few exons containing TTX-binding sites, including exon 15 (encoding the DII P-loop) of Nav1.2 from N. viridescens and exon 22 (encoding part of the DIII P-loop) of Nav1.2 for several newt species, were missing from our assemblies. Polymorphism was rare in our assemblies and we observed few nonsynonymous mutations within the newt genomes, but we found slightly elevated polymorphism in N. viridescens relative to other species (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). No heterozygosity or nonsynonymous polymorphisms were observed in any of the known TTX-binding P-loop regions within any of the species sequenced for this study. Synteny of Nav genes in A. mexicanum is conserved relative to other tetrapods (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), which allowed us to use the A. mexicanum sequences as a baseline to confidently identify Nav paralogs in all species. Three of the paralogs, Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 are arrayed in tandem on A. mexicanum chromosome 9, with Nav1.2 inverted relative to its neighboring paralogs (table 2 and supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). The additional three paralogs, Nav1.4, Nav1.5, and Nav1.6, are each located on separate chromosomes (table 2). In the gene family tree built from amino acid sequences, all salamander Nav proteins formed a monophyletic clade (bootstrap support >98%) with the corresponding orthologs from the genomes of the frogs Xenopus tropicalis and Nanorana parkeri, which we included as outgroups (fig. 1). The gene family tree constructed from the nucleotide-coding sequences of these genes yielded a similar topology, with each salamander Nav ortholog forming a monophyletic clade. However, in the nucleotide gene family tree, the three X. tropicalis nerve channels Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 formed a monophyletic clade that is distinct from the salamander sequences (bootstrap support 86%; supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). The same tree topology was resolved when partitioning for the third codon position (see Supplementary Material online on Dryad).

Partial Duplication of Nav1.4 and Evolution of TTX Resistance in Duplicated Domains Our search of the A. mexicanum genome revealed a partial tandem duplication of the 3′ end of the Nav1.4 gene, including the full coding region of exon 26, located ∼180,000 base pairs downstream of the full-length Nav1.4 gene on the same DNA strand (table 2). Both exon 26 copies are similar in length to each other and to exon 26 of other paralogs, encoding open reading frames of approximately 390 amino acids without introduced stop codons. Exon 26 is the 3′-terminal exon of the Nav1.4 gene and encodes the TTX-binding P-loop region of DIV. Hereafter, we refer to the duplicate exons as 26a (more proximal to exon 25) and 26b (more distal to exon 25) and duplicate P-loop regions as DIVa (more proximal to exon 25) and DIVb (more distal to exon 25). We also found this duplicated exon in Nav1.4 orthologs within the genomes of salamanders P. cinereus, Ple. waltl, N. viridescens, T. torosa, and T. granulosa and in published transcriptomes of Tylototriton wenxianensis and Bolitoglossa vallecula, but not in the transcriptome of Hynobius retardatus or in the genomes of C. alleganiensis or the frogs X. tropicalis or Nan. parkeri. This pattern suggests that the duplication event likely took place after the split of Cryptobranchoidea and Salamandroidea (fig. 2). Within the S. salamandra transcriptome, we found four unique RNA sequences transcribed from the Nav1.4 locus, with alternative splicing of exon 17 and alternative encoding of either exon 26a or 26b. Genome-mapped reads of multitissue transcriptomes of A. mexicanum (Bryant et al. 2017; Caballero-Pérez et al. 2018; Nowoshilow et al. 2018) indicate that these alternative transcripts have similar expression profiles across various tissues. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that the duplication of exon 26 led to the creation of functional splice variants in these salamanders.

Black circles indicate node bootstrap support >95%. “R” at tips indicates the presence of substitutions conferring extreme (orange) and moderate (blue) TTX resistance. The same tree topology was resolved using an alignment of amino acids translations of these sequences. Although numerous nonsynonymous substitutions differentiated the duplicated Nav1.4 exon 26 sequences relative to the original sequences within each genome, we found that identical substitutions conferring extreme TTX-resistance to toxic newts (Hanifin and Gilly 2015) were present in both exons from the genomes of all three TTX-bearing newts but not in other, less toxic salamander species (fig. 2). Also consistent with the results of Hanifin and Gilly (2015), we found resistant substitutions conferring moderate TTX resistance in exon 26a of Ple. waltl, Tyl. wenxianensis, and S. salamandra; however, we observed no resistant substitutions in exon 26b outside of the toxic newt clade. Evolution of TTX Resistance in Salamanders We characterized levels of TTX resistance in each Nav paralog as extreme, moderate, and TTX-sensitive based on previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments in which substitutions were introduced to TTX-sensitive Nav channels and cross-membrane Na+ current was measured in vitro in the presence and absence of TTX (table 3). Our results confirm that T. granulosa has six paralogs with extreme TTX resistance (table 3 and fig. 3). Our findings are consistent with those reported by Vaelli et al. (2020) with one exception: we associate DIV (encoded by exon 26) substitutions A1529G, G1533V, and G1533A with Nav1.1 and Q1524E, G1533R, and G1533Q with Nav1.2 based on synteny mapping (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), gene trees (fig. 1 and supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online), and a phylogeny created from a coding sequence alignment of exon 26 (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online), whereas the previous study reversed these assignments. We also show that substitutions with extreme TTX resistance are present in all six Nav paralogs in two other species of highly toxic newt, T. torosa and N. viridescens, indicating that the common ancestor of these three species possessed extreme TTX resistance. Many of the substitutions in toxic newts parallel those found in TTX-bearing fish and in snakes that consume tetrodotoxic amphibians (table 3).

Parallel substitutions in Nav channels of TTX-bearing pufferfish and in snakes that consume TTX-bearing prey. Resistance category determined from action potentials recorded from salamander muscle fibers. No salamander species outside the clade of highly toxic newts possessed a full complement of TTX-resistant Nav paralogs, indicating that the evolution of full physiological resistance coincided with the origin of extreme toxicity. However, we found at least three paralogs with moderate or extreme TTX resistance in all salamander species we examined, indicating that the evolution of TTX resistance in newts built upon more ancient changes that first appeared in their nonnewt relatives. Substitutions conferring moderate or extreme resistance were observed within the heart channel Nav1.5 and brain/nerve channels Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 of all salamander species, with additional resistance-conferring substitutions evolving within TTX-bearing newts. As first shown by Hanifin and Gilly (2015), moderate resistance was present in the skeletal muscle channel Nav1.4 of S. salamandra and Ple. waltl, but not in the three other salamander species we examined. Although our outgroup, the frog X. tropicalis, also contained a highly resistant substitution in Nav1.2, we found no evidence for resistance in this paralog in any salamanders outside of tetrodotoxic newts. Based on our ancestral sequence reconstructions, the most recent common ancestor of all salamanders had three TTX-resistant sodium channels: Nav1.1 (brain, moderately resistant), Nav1.5 (heart, highly resistant), and Nav1.6 (brain/peripheral nerves, moderately resistant; fig. 3 and supplementary figs. S4–S9, Supplementary Material online). Moderate resistance in the muscle channel Nav1.4 appeared between 75 and 130 Ma, after the divergence of Ambystomatidae and Salamandridae (the family consisting of true salamanders and newts; Hanifin and Gilly 2015). This gain in muscle resistance coincided with the appearance of two highly resistant substitutions in DI of Nav1.5, which are present in all Salamandridae. Extreme TTX resistance across all Nav paralogs evolved more recently, occurring approximately 30 Ma, after the split between primitive newts, which include Pleurodeles, and modern newts (Hime et al. 2021), which include all TTX-bearing species. Over this time period, TTX resistance evolved in Nav1.2 and Nav1.3, and multiple additional resistant mutations appeared and became fixed in Nav1.1, Nav1.4, and Nav1.6. Selective Regimes and Evolutionary Rates In order to characterize the selective regimes acting on Nav genes, we used the codeml program in PAML (Yang 2007) to fit models of selection to Nav codon alignments and compared nested models using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). We tested for site-specific positive selection within all amphibians by comparing two sets of nested models: one set using a discrete distribution of ω values either with or without positive selection (M1a vs. M2a; Yang et al. 2005); and another set fitting a continuous distribution of ω values under purifying selection only, or adding categories of unconstrained evolution and positive selection (M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs. M8; Yang et al. 2000). Parameter estimates and LRT results for site models are summarized in supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online. To test for selection within toxic newts, we fit branch (Yang 1998) and branch-site models (Zhang et al. 2005) to our data sets, which allowed ω to vary both among codon sites and between toxic newts and other amphibians (summarized in supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). All models estimated relatively low ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution (dN/dS, or ω ratios) for all Nav paralogs (average ω ratios from branch models ranged from 0.05 to 0.23), indicating pervasive purifying selection. Based on LRTs comparing one ω-value models (which allow only for one ω value across the entire phylogeny) to branch models (allowing for a different ω ratio in the toxic newt clade relative to other amphibians), we found that ω ratios were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in toxic newts for Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.4 and nonsignificant (P > 0.01) for Nav1.2, Nav1.5, and Nav1.6 (fig. 4A and supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). The largest difference in ω ratios in the branch test was observed for the muscle channel Nav1.4 (newt ω = 0.23; all salamanders ω = 0.10), which appears to be due to both an increase in the proportion of unconstrained sites as well as a larger number of estimated sites undergoing positive selection (fig. 4B). However, the posterior probability support for positive selection at many of these sites was low, and LRTs from branch-site models indicated significant evidence for a shift in positive selection only in paralog Nav1.3 (supplementary tables S4 and S5, Supplementary Material online). Fig. 4.Tests for shifts in selective pressure on salamander voltage-gated sodium channels. (A) PAML branch models comparing estimates of gene-wide ω (dN/dS) within TTX-bearing newts (black circles) and other salamanders (gray circles). (B) PAML site and branch-site model estimates of proportions of sites under purifying selection (0 < ω < 0.05 in both lineages), unconstrained evolution (ω = 1 in both lineages), and positive selection or relaxed purifying selection (0 < ω < 0.05 in salamanders and ω ≥ 1 in TTX-bearing newts). Significant differences based on likelihood ratio tests are indicated with * (P < 0.05) and ** (P < 0.01). Although likelihood-ratio tests were nonsignificant for NaV1.1 and NaV1.4 (supplementary tables S3 and S4, Supplementary Material online), PAML identified a large proportion of amino acid coding sites within these paralogs with elevated dN/dS ratios in toxic newts.

Significant differences based on likelihood ratio tests are indicated with * (P < 0.05) and ** (P < 0.01). Although likelihood-ratio tests were nonsignificant for NaV1.1 and NaV1.4 (supplementary tables S3 and S4, Supplementary Material online), PAML identified a large proportion of amino acid coding sites within these paralogs with elevated dN/dS ratios in toxic newts. Our site and branch-site models identified a number of TTX-binding sites with elevated ω ratios (table 4 and supplementary tables S5 and S6, Supplementary Material online). Because of the small number of species in our study, we had low power to detect statistically significant positive selection (Yang et al. 2000; Anisimova et al. 2001; Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005), and the posterior probabilities provided low-to-moderate support for positive selection at most sites. We also note that the false positive rates of site selection models can be inflated due to gene conversion events (Casola and Hahn 2009), among-site variation in dS (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005), and multinucleotide mutations (Venkat et al. 2018). However, results were consistent between the M2a and M8 models, and the codons that were identified suggest that positive selection may have been important for observed substitutions in TTX-binding regions.

Nonconservative amino acid substitutions associated with TTX resistance in toxic newts. Sites identified with branch-site models using empirical Bayes method (posterior probability >0.50). Empirical Bayes posterior probability >0.95. Within the brain channels Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6, putative positive selection was detected by site models at site 401 within the DI P-loop, indicating selection acting across all salamanders rather than specifically within toxic newts (table 4). Replacement of the aromatic amino acid at site 401 with a nonaromatic amino acid can substantially impact TTX-binding capacity (Leffler et al. 2005; Venkatesh et al. 2005; Vaelli et al. 2020), and we observed nonaromatic substitutions at this site within all brain channels of highly toxic newts (fig. 3 and table 3). The codon sequence for site 401 was variable across many salamanders lacking TTX; however, almost all of the nonsynonymous changes observed outside of TTX-bearing newts were biochemically conservative (both phenylalanine and tyrosine are aromatic and do not affect TTX binding; Sunami et al. 2000), with the exception of the 401A observed in P. cinereus Nav1.1. This conservative variation likely contributes to the signal of diversifying selection acting on this codon in less toxic salamander lineages. Site models also suggested positive selection acting on site 1533 in DIV of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 (table 4). Although the substitutions present at site 1533 in these newt paralogs have not been tested experimentally for their effects on TTX binding, Maruta et al. (2008) showed that a G1533T substitution at this site led to a moderate (∼2- to 3-fold) decrease in TTX-binding affinity, and substitutions at this site are common in TTX-resistant channels (Geffeney et al. 2005; Jost et al. 2008; Feldman et al. 2012; McGlothlin et al. 2016), suggesting that these nonsynonymous changes likely also reduce TTX-binding affinity in newts. Within the toxic newt lineage, we identified putative positive selection acting on three known TTX-binding sites: 1240 and 1532 in DIII and DIV of muscle channel Nav1.4 and 1529 in DIV of brain channel Nav1.1 (table 4). In Nav1.4, sites 1240 and 1532 contain resistance-conferring substitutions exclusively within toxic newts and these substitutions have been associated with extreme TTX resistance in Taricha muscle fibers (Hanifin and Gilly 2015). In Nav1.1, site 1529 encodes part of the Na+ selectivity filter (comprised interacting amino acids DEKA—sites 400, 755, 1237, and 1529), which is highly conserved across Nav paralogs. An A1529G substitution (resulting in a DEKG filter) is present in Nav1.1 of A. mexicanum and all members of the toxic newt clade. Although this substitution does not appear to affect Na+ selectivity or to be sufficient in preventing TTX from binding (Jost et al. 2008), it may alter channel firing properties, as this A1529G substitution resulted in substantially higher Na+ currents relative to the wild-type when introduced into a mammalian Nav1.4 channel (Jost et al. 2008). The same alanine to glycine substitution has been observed in Nav channels of TTX-bearing flatworms (Jeziorski et al. 1997) and pufferfish (Jost et al. 2008), which suggests that it may play a role in TTX resistance in these organisms. Outside of TTX-binding regions, we found evidence for putative positive selection in similar regions across multiple Nav paralogs (supplementary tables S5 and S6, Supplementary Material online). For Nav1.4, the majority of sites under positive selection reside in terminal exon 26a that encodes the DIVa P-loop (exon 26b was excluded from this analysis due to its absence in some species). For most other paralogs, the largest clusters of sites with elevated dN/dS ratios were within the DI L5 turret (the extracellular loop upstream of the DI P-loop, encoded by exons 6 and 7) and the DIII L5 turret upstream of the DIII P-loop encoded by exon 21. These sites may facilitate interaction with other proteins, or alternatively, some of these sites identified by the branch-site model may be selected to compensate for biochemical changes produced by TTX-resistant mutations. Gene Conversion Events We also tested for evidence of nonallelic gene conversion as a mechanism of sequence evolution contributing to adaptive evolution in Nav genes using the program GENECONV. Nonallelic or ectopic gene conversion results from an interlocus exchange of DNA that can occur between closely related sequences during double-stranded break repair (Hansen et al. 2000). GENECONV uses the information in a multiple sequence alignment to identify regions of similarity shared between two sequences that is higher than expected by chance based on comparisons to permuted alignments (Sawyer 1989). We selected this program to detect gene conversion because of its low false positive rates and robustness to shifts in selective pressure (Posada and Crandall 2001; Bay and Bielawski 2011). Because nonallelic gene conversion is more likely to occur between paralogs residing on the same chromosome (Semple and Wolfe 1999; Drouin 2002; Benovoy and Drouin 2009), we limited our search to events between the tandem duplicates Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 and between exons 26a and 26b of Nav1.4 within each salamander genome. Although few gene conversion events were detected within each species by GENECONV, all of the regions that were detected within Taricha newts contain TTX-binding sites with substitutions associated with TTX resistance, including the DIVa and DIVb P-loops of Nav1.4 (fig. 5 and table 5). We observed three TTX-resistant amino acids (I1525S, D1532S, G1533D) within the DIVa and DIVb P-loops of Nav1.4 in toxic newt genomes. In contrast, Ple. waltl, a closely related but nontetrodotoxic newt, contains one moderately TTX-resistant amino acid (I1525S) in the DIVa P-loop and no resistant amino acids in the DIVb P-loop (fig. 5A). These differences involve four identical nucleotide changes at homologous sites in both exon duplicates. Our short reads from the genomes of N. viridescens and Taricha newts mapped onto each of these exon assemblies across putative recombination break points with high (>50-fold) coverage, lending support for sequence convergence rather than an assembly error. We did not detect gene conversion between these exons within the genomes of T. granulosa or N. viridescens; however, this may be due to the low power of GENECONV to detect conversion (Bay and Bielawski 2011), particularly in the presence of low sequence diversity and when the conversion tract is shorter than ∼100 bp (Posada and Crandall 2001; McGrath et al. 2009). Together, these results suggest that the three resistant amino acids accumulated together in one exon copy followed by conversion of the other exon ∼30 Ma in a toxic newt ancestor. Fig. 5.Gene conversion within TTX-binding regions. (A) Gene conversion was detected between DIVa and DIVb P-loops within duplicate exons 26a and 26b of Nav1.4 in Taricha torosa. Substitutions conferring TTX resistance are highlighted in yellow and blue. Although one moderately resistant substitution is present in DIVa of less toxic salamanders (1,525 T/S), three identical substitutions are present in both DIVa and DIVb of highly toxic newts. (B) Gene conversion was also detected between the DI P-loops of paralogs Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 in both T. torosa and T. granulosa. In Notophthalmus, both paralogs have different resistant substitutions (401C in Nav1.1, highlighted in green; 401A in Nav1.3, highlighted in orange). This putative gene conversion may have homogenized TTX-resistant substitutions among these paralogs within Taricha newts. Site numbers are in reference to amino acids of rat Nav1.4 (accession number AAA41682). Stars at branches indicate the inferred transfer of substitutions associated with moderate resistance (blue text) or extreme resistance (orange text) via nonallelic gene conversion.

Putative gene conversion events associated with the loss of TTX resistance. Putative gene conversion events associated with the gain of TTX resistance. We also detected gene conversion between the DI P-loops of paralogs Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 within the genomes of both Taricha species (fig. 5B and table 5). TTX-resistant substitutions are identical in the DI P-loops of Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 in both Taricha species (401A, encoded by a GCT codon), whereas Nav1.1 of N. viridescens contains a different codon at this position (TGC, encoding 401C), consistent with gene conversion occurring at this locus in Taricha. Both Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 of nontetrodotoxic Ple. waltl newts encode a TTX-sensitive tyrosine at this locus. It is unclear whether putative gene conversion event(s) occurred before or after resistance evolved in both paralogs. Gene conversion may have converted a nonresistant channel to a resistant channel in an ancestral Taricha, whereas N. viridescens independently acquired a Y401A substitution, or it may have homogenized substitutions within two channels that had previously evolved resistance in an ancestor of all toxic newts. In Taricha newts, the transition from either tyrosine or cysteine to alanine required multiple nucleotide substitutions in both paralogs, making gene conversion a likely explanation for the observed substitution patterns. We detected additional gene conversion events that may have involved a nonresistant paralog acting as a donor to a resistant paralog, leading to the loss of TTX resistance in A. mexicanum and C. alleganiensis paralogs. A resistant substitution is present in the DIII P-loop of Nav1.1 in most salamanders but is absent in Nav1.1 of A. mexicanum (fig. 3), and we detected gene conversion in an adjacent region between Nav1.1 and the nonresistant Nav1.2 paralog within the A. mexicanum genome (table 5 and supplementary fig. S10A, Supplementary Material online). Similarly, C. alleganiensis Nav1.2 contains a nonresistant 1533G within DIV of all six paralogs, whereas Nav1.2 of X. tropicalis frogs encodes a putatively TTX-resistant 1533L, and gene conversion between paralogs Nav1.2 and Nav1.3 may have facilitated the loss of this substitution in salamanders (supplementary fig. S10B, Supplementary Material online).
