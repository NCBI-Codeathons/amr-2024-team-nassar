Results Identification of the ART biosynthetic gene cluster Two polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters were found in the genome of B. subtilis fmb60 (accession: NZ_LYMC01000002)18. A trans-AT polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster6,7 was proposed as the ART biosynthetic gene cluster (Fig. 1b) by in silico analyses of the PKS domains, and was validated by the fact that disruption of art11, a key PKS gene, totally abolished ART production (Fig. 1c). The boundaries of the art gene cluster were then determined by sequential inactivation of the flanking genes. The right boundary of the art gene cluster was assigned between the genes art28 and orf(+1) because ART production was completely blocked by in-frame deletion of the former gene but was not obviously influenced by knocking-out the latter. The left boundary of the art gene cluster was assigned between art1 and orf(−1) similarly according to their gene inactivation results. The transcription anti-terminator Art1 was proposed to be a positive regulator based on the fact that no ART production was detected in the B. subtilis ∆art1 mutant (Fig. 1c). Thus, the art gene cluster was narrowed down to an 80.3-kb region of DNA containing 28 genes, with 17 of them PKS-related (Supplementary Table 1). Investigation of the C-methyl incorporation patterns of ARTs In silico analysis results of the art gene cluster using bioinformatic tools like TransATor10 were informative but provided few clues regarding the two-polyketide chain assembly model and the unusual starter units of the polyketide chains. We therefore sought to begin elucidating the biosynthetic pathway by first dissecting C-methyl incorporation patterns of ART. The ART B aglycone contains seven C-methyl groups, five of which are derived from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) and two from the C-2 of acetate17 (Fig. 1a). Our analysis of the art gene cluster revealed ten genes putatively involved in methyl incorporations including two standalone MT genes (art4 and art28), four genes (art11, art13, art14, and art17) encoding PKSs with a MT domain, and five genes (art7, art18, art19, art20, and art21) encoding proteins of the β-branching system (Supplementary Table 1). MTs generally use SAM as a precursor19; in contrast, the β-branching system appends the C-2 of an acetate unit to the β-position of a polyketide chain to form a C-methyl appendage by sequential condensation, decarboxylation, and dehydration reactions20,21. Each of the four PKS-MT domains was inactivated by a point mutation at its conserved active site His residue (His → Ala). All four mutants lost the capacity to produce ART A-D, and three of them, except B. subtilis Δart17MT, accumulated ART congeners (Fig. 1c) with MS and NMR profiles consistent with demethyl-ART A or B (Supplementary Figs. 1–4 and Supplementary Tables 2–4). Specifically, B. subtilis Δart11MT accumulated ART 11B lacking the C-2 methyl; B. subtilis Δart13MT accumulated ART 13B without the C-14 methyl; B. subtilis Δart14MT accumulated aglycone ART 14A devoid of the C-18 methyl, indicating that C-18 methylation is required for glycosylation (Fig. 2). Productions of all the demethylated ART congeners were reduced dramatically in those mutant strains with PKS mutagenesis. These results allowed us to propose that PKSs Art10-15 assembles the long polyketide chain following the co-linearity rule9 (Fig. 2). This was also supported by the analyses of the five β-branching genes art7, art18, art19, art20, and art21. Loss of ART production when any one of four genes (art18-art21) was in-frame deleted indicated that the β-branching system is necessary for ART biosynthesis. In silico analyses revealed that all three ACP domains of modules 3 and 4 in Art11 possess the conserved Trp residues diagnostic of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase of the β-branching system22 (Supplementary Fig. 5), implying that the methyl groups at C-5 and C-7 are incorporated into the intermediates generated on Art11 by the β-branching enzymes together.Fig. 2The proposed biosynthetic pathway of ARTs based on the two-polyketide-chain assembly model.The inset depicts the process that methyl groups are appended to C-5 and C-7 of the ACP-bound intermediates by β-branching system.

The short ART polyketide chain was hypothesized to be assembled by the remnant PKS Art17 (Fig. 2). The art gene cluster contains two acyltransferase genes art2 and art6. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that Art6 is a typical malonyl-ACP acyltransferase of trans-AT PKS; while Art2 fell into the same clade with EtnB and GdnB (Supplementary Fig. 6), two putative succinyl-ACP transferases involved in the biosynthesis of etnangien23 and gladiolin24, respectively. We hypothesized that Art2 initiates the short chain biosynthesis by loading an uncommon starter unit succinyl to the first ACP of Art17. After a methylation by the MT domain of Art17 (adding the C-26 methyl of ARTs), it is elongated twice by modules I and II to afford the short polyketide chain. The two standalone MT genes were then studied to inspect the C-30 methylation mechanism. Although Art4 and Art28 share only 15.2% identity, they both display significant similarities with proteins annotated as UbiE, a large family of MTs governing the C-methylation of ubiquinone or menaquinone25. In-frame deletion of art4 abolished production of ART A and B but yielded more ART D (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 7, and Supplementary Table 5), implying that Art4 catalyzes C-30 methylation. Overall, the incorporation of all seven C-methyl groups of ART B could be reasonably assigned leaving Art28 as a ‘redundant’ MT. However, this was inconsistent with our finding during gene cluster boundary assignment that the art28 gene is necessary for ART biosynthesis. Unfortunately, the absence of any accumulated ART congener from B. subtilis ∆art28 did not provide insight regarding the function of Art28. Characterization of Art9 as an esterase exposing the terminal carboxyl group Previous feeding experiments showed that that the terminal free carboxylic acid of ART is derived from the C-1 of a cleaved acetate unit17, suggesting a possible origin for the free terminal carboxylic acid group by oxidative C–C bond cleavage of the polyketide chain and subsequent hydrolysis. Such oxidative cleavages have been observed in oocydin A and viriditoxin produced by Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 and Paecilomyces variotii, respectively, where the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMO) OocK and VdtE inserted an oxygen into the polyketide chain between the two carbons of one acetate unit26,27. The ester bonds can be further hydrolyzed by putative esterases to expose the terminal carboxyl group. Interestingly, although no oxygenase gene could be found in the art gene cluster, there is an esterase gene art9 that encodes a protein sharing 33% identity with BioH, a methyl esterase exposing the ω-carboxyl group of pimeloyl-ACP during biotin biosynthesis28. The art9 gene in-frame deletion mutant B. subtilis ∆art9 was incapable of synthesizing ART A-D but produced ART 9B (Figs. 1c and 3a), the C-1 methyl ester derivative of ART B (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 6), which implied that Art9 is the esterase hydrolyzing ART 9B to afford ART B. The N-His6-Art9 was then expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and incubated with ART 9B. It could hydrolyze ART 9B to ART B efficiently, verifying that Art9 is the esterase liberating the terminal carboxyl groups of ARTs (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3Characterization of Art9 as an esterase and Art28 as an O-MT.a The isotope labeling pattern of ART 9B with different 13C-labeled precursors.

If the terminal methyl ester structure of ART 9B is formed by the insertion of an oxygen as occurs in occydin A and viriditoxin biosynthesis, the terminal O-methyl group (1a position of ART 9B) should be derived from the C-2 of an acetate unit. However, when we fed B. subtilis ∆art9 with [2-13C] acetate, the isolated ART 9B shared the same labeling pattern as ART B, but its terminal O-methyl was not 13C labeled as predicted, which is not in agreement with the BVMO-catalyzed oxygen insertion mechanism. Further isotope labeling feeding experiments showed that the 13C NMR signal of C-1 was not obviously enriched by [1-13C] acetate, while the C-1a signal of the terminal O-methyl was clearly enriched by [13CH3]-methionine (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 7). To confirm this, we carried out [1-13C] acetate feeding experiment of B. subtilis fmb60 and observed that ART B was 13C labeled at positions as reported previously17, except that C-1 was not clearly enriched by [1-13C] acetate (Supplementary Fig. 11). Overall, these results suggested that the terminal methyl ester of ART 9B is not derived from inserting an oxygen in an acetate unit but is more likely established by a MT using SAM as a substrate, which prompted us to revisit the role of the ‘redundant’ MT Art28 in the art gene cluster. Characterization of Art28 as a malonyl-ACP O-MT Careful reanalysis of Art28 revealed that, besides UbiE proteins, it is also similar to proteins annotated as BioC such as the well-characterized Bc-BioC (19.2% identity) from Bacillus cereus ATCC1098729, which acts as an O-MT that catalyzes the methyl esterification of malonyl-ACP to initiate biotin biosynthesis. To probe the function of art28, B. subtilis ∆art28 was complemented by expressing art28 or the Bc-bioC gene in trans. Although Bc-bioC was not as efficient as art28, both genes restored production of ARTs (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 12), suggesting that Art28 has the same function as Bc-BioC. We therefore proposed Art28 as a malonyl-ACP O-MT initiating chain extension of the long polyketide by forming a malonyl-ACP methyl ester. The substrate of Art28 could be the malonyl-ACP of protein Art10, which has an N-terminal ACP domain. Both Art28 and the truncated apo-ACPArt10 (residues 1–87) were expressed as N-His6 tagged proteins in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 9a). A phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp30 with high substrate promiscuity was used to convert apo-ACPArt10 to malonyl-ACPArt10 using malonyl-CoA as a substrate. When Art28 was incubated with malonyl-ACPArt10 and SAM, efficient formation of malonyl-ACPArt10 methyl ester and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) could be detected by HPLC and LC-MS, respectively (Fig. 3c, d). If the assay was performed without SAM, no malonyl-ACPArt10 methyl ester was formed. To test whether malonyl-CoA can be recognized by Art28, it was used to replace malonyl-ACPArt10 in the Art28 assay, and no malonyl-CoA methyl ester and SAH were detected by LC-MS (Supplementary Fig. 13). These results verified that Art28 is a malonyl-ACP O-MT. Taken together, Art28 and Art9 form an enzyme pair that catalyzed two ‘cryptic’ reactions to shape the rare terminal carboxyl group of ARTs. Moreover, Art28 represents an unusualinitiation strategy of polyketide biosynthesis, in which polyketide chain extension is triggered by the on-line methyl esterification of malonyl-ACP. Distribution of the Art28 homologs To find out that whether the on-line methyl esterification initiation strategy is adopted by other PKSs, we performed a ClusterBlast against the antiSMASH database31 using Art28 as a probe, which yielded 12 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) containing genes encoding Art28 homolog proteins (Fig. 4a). The art gene cluster and the 12 resultant BGCs are widely distributed in bacteria including Firmicutes (7), Proteobacteria (3), Actinobacteria (2), and Chloroflexi (1). Among the 13 BGCs, 9 are trans-AT PKS gene clusters, 2 are hybrid cis-AT PKS/NRPS (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase) gene clusters, and the other 2 are hybrid trans-AT PKS/NRPS gene clusters. Significantly, the genes encoding Art9 homologs were observed in 11 of the 12 BGCs, indicating that the methyl ester bond is hydrolyzed to expose the carboxyl terminus in most cases. The hybrid PKS/NRPS cluster in Teredinibacter turnerae T7902 may generate products with a methyl ester terminus like ART 9B, since no art9 ortholog was observed in this BGC.Fig. 4Distribution and phylogenetic analysis of the Art28 homologs.a Schematic representatives of the biosynthetic gene clusters containing genes encoding Art28 homolog proteins.

A phylogenetic analysis revealed that Art28 and its 12 homologs were clustered in one clade clearly separated from the other MTs (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 8), indicating they have similar and distinctive functions. To test the malonyl-ACP O-MT activity of the Art28 homologs, 5 of them (Thd235 from Thermoactinomyces daqus H-18, Bac390 from Bacillus cereus BAG5X1-1, Pas675 from Paenibacillus sp. Mc5Re-14, Brf335 from Brevibacillus formosus DSM 9885, and Clp905 from Clostridium papyrosolvens DSM 2782) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified as N-His6-tagged proteins (Supplementary Fig. 9b), and assayed along with Art28. All five proteins could efficiently convert malonyl-ACPArt10 to its methyl ester (Supplementary Fig. 14), implying that they play the same role as Art28 in natural product biosynthesis. Overall, the widespread occurrence of Art28 homologs suggests that malonyl-ACP methyl esterification is a polyketide biosynthesis initiation strategy adopted by various bacteria. Antibacterial activities of the ART congeners Finally, the antibiotic activities of the ART congeners were tested against different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Table 1). The obtained data clearly showed that ARTs only inhibit growth of Gram-positive bacteria and the antibacterial activities of demethyl-ART congeners are reduced. Intriguingly, ART 9B did not show any antibacterial activity revealing that exposing the terminal carboxyl group is critical to the antibacterial activities of ARTs. When the cell membrane permeability of S. aureus ATCC 6538 was evaluated using propidium iodide, a fluorescent dye binding nucleic acid, it was showed that ART B could damage the cell membrane in a dose-dependent manner and displayed good activity at a concentration as low as 4 μM. In comparison, ART 9B, with its terminal carboxyl group methyl esterified, had little effect on the cell membrane permeability of S. aureus ATCC 6538 even at a concentration as high as 100 μM (Supplementary Fig. 15).Table 1Antibacterial activities of ARTs.SamplesMIC values (μM)BSBCSAMRSASMPAECART B3.123.121.561.563.12100>100ART 11B12.512.56.253.1212.5>100>100ART 13B12.512.56.253.1212.5>100>100ART D252512.56.2512.5>100>100ART 9B>100>100>100>100>100>100>100ART A12.512.512.56.2512.5>100>100ART 14A50505050100>100>100Erm0.780.781.56>1000.2100100BS
