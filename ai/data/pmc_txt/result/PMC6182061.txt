Results Characterization of SfTop1 The open reading frame (ORF) of the Top1 gene consists of 2,787 base pairs, and the deduced Top1 polypeptide has 929 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 108.04 kDa and an estimated pI of 8.91. Multiple sequence alignment was performed to explore the similarities and differences of the protein amongst nine species. It exhibited high homology (58.6% identity) with all of the species mentioned in Figure 1. In particular, it shared an extremely high homology level (98 and 84% identity) with the Lepidoptera insect S. exigua and Papilio machaon, and also showed more than 51% identity with Homo sapiens and other insects. It is noteworthy that Sf Top1 has a junior homology level (34 and 35% identity, respectively) with C. acuminate and O. pumila presenting strong resistance to its product camptothecin through mutants of their amino acid residues. Mutants such as Q421K, L530I, L617G, E710G, and N722S, numbered according to HsTop1, are involved in the camptothecin direct/indirect binding and have been reported to be responsible for the production of anti-camptothecins in plants (Sirikantaramas et al., 2008, 2015). Interestingly, some tumor cells mutate themselves to adapt the oppression of anti-tumor drugs such as camptothecin, and some frequent mutations, such as F361, G363, R364, G503, D533, G717, N722, T729, give them significant resistance (Gongora et al., 2008). In general, insect cells and normal human cells are more sensitive to camptothecin, and we did not find any of the reported mutations leading to camptothecin resistance in their sequences, which may explain why the insect cells are more sensitive to camptothecin derivatives.

Consistent with other eukaryotes, the Sf Top1 protein is composed of four different structural domains (Figure 1): the NH2-terminal region, the core domains contained three subdomains I~III, the linker domain and the COOH-terminal region (Redinbo et al., 1998). Similar to H. sapiens, the core domains and the COOH-terminal region, which contains all of the catalytic residues (R488, K532, R590, H632 and Y723; numbered according to HsTop1) presenting a crucial role in catalytic activity, are highly conserved in SfTop1. In addition, two other regions (NH2-terminal and linker domain) are poorly conserved and not strictly required for the catalytic and relaxation functions, while the short linker domain has a function of connecting the core and COOH-terminal domains (Redinbo et al., 1998). Building a 3D model of SfTop1 with nucleic acid Based on the information mentioned above, the crystal structure of HsTop1 (PDB: 1K4T) was employed as the reference to building the corresponding three-dimensional structure via a homology modeling module MODELER in DS 2017 with standard parameters. The sequence similarity of Sf Top1 catalytic regions with H. sapiens reached 84.6%, which implied that a reasonable model could be built by this template. The model with the lowest PDF, and having a total energy (Sali and Blundell, 1993) of 2169.6 and a DOPE score (Shen and Sali, 2006) of −60429.9 was selected and optimized. The final structure was further assessed via the Verify Protein (Profiles-3D) and the Ramachandran Plot protocol to measure the compatibility of an amino acid sequence with a 3D protein structure and verify the predicted torsion angles in the protein (Lüthy et al., 1992; Lovell et al., 2003). The verify score of this model reached a value of 236.2, which approximated to the Verify Expected High Score of 257.5. The line plot of the per-residue Verify scores and the graphic of the Ramachandran Plot (Figure 2) showed that more than 99% of amino acid residues in the model were reasonable. When matched to the corresponding sequence, the 3D structure of Sf Top1 has three core subdomains (Domain I~III), a linker region and COOH-terminal as shown in Figure 3, and the cavity that appears to be adequate space to accommodate seemingly possible inhibitors. These results suggested that the model would be appropriate for further study.

Designing camptothecin derivatives The molecular docking process was performed through a standard CDOCKER protocol, which is a classical method using a CHARMm-based molecular dynamics (MD) scheme to dock ligands into a receptor binding site (Wu et al., 2003). The binding mode (Figure 4A) of Sf Top1-DNA-camptothecin indicated that the skeleton of camptothecin is likely to interact with the Sf Top1-DNA complex by a combination of π-π stacked interactions with the upstream and downstream base pairs (A965, T940, C964, and G941) in the nucleic acid. The two fundamental hydrogen bond interactions between the 20- hydroxyl and the 1-nitrogen atom with the Arg530 and Asp698 residue, respectively, are also shown in the figure. This combination mode has a strong resemblance to the binding mechanism of human topoisomerase 1 for TPT, and π-π stacked and hydrogen-bond interactions provide a significant contribution to the stability of the ternary complex (Staker et al., 2002). The pharmacophore around the 7-site of camptothecin (Figure 4B) displayed a big cavity and showed several chemical features such as hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD), which are closest to position 7 of camptothecin and have two bases (A965 and G941) that can be defined as HBA and HBD. This results implied that a group containing both HBA and HBD has the potential to interact with the bases via hydrogen-bond interactions. Therefore, by considering the synthesis feasibility, the acylamino, an assumed group which is plausibly a perfect match as shown in Figure 4C, was designed on position 7. To test the idea computationally, the two simplest compounds (4a and 4b, mentioned in Figure 4C), as well as the control camptothecin, were initially designed, prepared and docked into the Sf Top1-DNA binding site. The docking results (Figure 4D) showed that compound 4b and camptothecin bound similarly in the cavity with their rigid rings inserting into the cleaved gap and forming H-bonds interactions with Asp698 and Arg530. Intriguingly, the rigid rings of compound 4a showed a slight shift compared with compound 4b and camptothecin, thus resulting in the 1-nitrogen atom instead of forming an H-bond interaction with the residue Arg530. It is noteworthy that the amide group on the compound 4b has a srong H-bond interaction with the base G941, but it was not found in compound 4a. Although the designed carbonyl group does not interact with the intended base, the free hydrogen atom on the amide of CPT may form a strong H-bond interaction with the nucleic acid bases and stabilize the ternary complex. These results implied that this type of 7-amide camptothecin could be used as a novel backbone structure, and other groups could be introduced onto the amide.

In the past five decades, a large number of camptothecin derivatives have been synthesized and applied in the anti-tumor field, and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of CPTs was clear (Liu et al., 2015; Martino et al., 2017). Generally, substitutions at 7 with some liposolubility groups, such as alkyl, aryl, and alkynyl, could effectively improve the stability of CPTs (Li et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011, 2012; Zhu et al., 2012). Hence, the synthesis strategy of CPTs was mainly to consider the stability and the combining capacity of compounds with the Top1-DNA complex. Therefore, by considering the size of the protein cavity, a series of compounds (4a–f) containing lipophilic groups such as alkyl and aromatic rings were subsequently designed. Moreover, to explore and exploit more substituents which could extend to the lumen of the Sf Top1-DNA complex and have a potential to stabilize the complex, the amine acid residues around 7-C of camptothecin in the cavity were subsequently analyzed. Two hydrophilic amino acids, Asn518 and Lys602 residues, which were closest to the position, and several hydrophobic residues (Met594 and Pro597) were exposed to the modification site of camptothecin (Figure 4B). Accordingly, a series of compounds (4g–q) listed in Figure 5 consisting of groups with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating capabilities were considered for potential combination with the Sf Top1-DNA complex. Figure 5The structures of designed target compounds. The structures of designed target compounds. Chemistry The main strategy for synthesizing different amide compounds is the condensation reaction of carboxylic acids with various kinds of amines. Compound 3 was accumulated via an entire oxidizing system (Scheme 1) in three steps according to the material and methods section, and it has a reasonably impressive yield (42% in three steps). Compound 3 was dissolved in DMF, and EDCI and HOBt were then added to form a stable activated ester, while the target compounds were obtained by nucleophilic substitution of different amines with the activated ester in a decent yield between 39 and 60%.

In vitro toxicity assay The MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of these CPTs against Sf9 cells for 24 h. The results shown in Table 1 indicated that camptothecin had a strong effect on Sf9 cells with an IC50 of 29.47 μM. As compared with camptothecin, the anti-proliferative activity of 3 (14.32 μM) had a specific extent increasing after the incorporation of a carboxyl group on the position 7 of CPT. Interestingly, compounds 4a (IC50 > 50.00 μM) and 4b (IC50 6.26 μM) exhibited diametrically opposite cytotoxicity, and these experimental results also further validated the reasonability of the conjecture mentioned above. It is satisfying to note that all of the target compounds, except compound 4a and 4q, showed significant cytotoxic activities (the values of IC50 were between 2.01 and 6.78 μM) against the Sf9 cells. Amongst all the tested compounds, compound 4j exhibited the most substantial anti-proliferative activity (2.01 μM), being 15-fold more potent than the positive control camptothecin. However, as illustrated by the results of the antiproliferative activity, compound 4q showed less popular cytotoxic activity (IC50 > 50.00 μM) compared with that of other analogous. In an additional in vitro test, to confirm whether CPTs could specifically reduce the activity of sf Top1 as expected, pre-mixed purified protein and supercoiled DNA PBR322 were incubated with camptothecin and its derivatives, respectively. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, the purified protein completely abolished the supercoiled form of PBR322 to the relaxation state, and CPT could significantly inhibit the relaxation activity of the enzyme. Most of the derivatives are also equivalent to the effects of CPT, meaning that CPTs are able to specifically influence the function of insect cell topoisomerase 1.

Among these compounds, some of the lipophilic alkyl groups, methyl (4b), propyl (4c), cyclopropyl (4e), and pentyl (4d), were respectively introduced onto the amide linkage, and these corresponding compounds not only presented considerable cytotoxicity, but also enhanced with the increasing length of the alkyl chain. In addition, compound 4f, which links the lipophilic aromatic ring, also exhibited appreciable cytotoxicity. These results, similar to the structure-activity relationship in terms of the anti-tumor field, revealed that introduction of lipophilic groups might be beneficial to its activities (Liu et al., 2015). Furthermore, the compound (4j) that was connected with the electronegative halogen atom fluorine also displayed excellent antiproliferative activity as compared with compounds (4g–i) possessing similar substituents. Moreover, the compounds which contained different types of amino acid ester groups, except for 4q that bore a large volume group in the side chain of the substituent, showed significant antiproliferative activity as well. These compounds with some small ester groups have the potential to combine with the protein and promote the activity, but a bulky group, generally would be hinder the formation of ternary complexes (Liu et al., 2015) even decrease the activity. Molecular docking study Due to the target compounds exhibiting excellent activity against Sf9 cells, and aiming to explore the interaction between the derivatives with the protein-DNA complex, two compounds (4j and 4m) consisted of two different groups with excellent activity, were selected for molecular docking studies. The binding modes of compounds 4j, 4m, and camptothecin are shown in Figure 6. The rigid rings of the three compounds were inserted into the four bases (T940, G941, C964, and A965) of DNA in parallel, and overlaid well with each other. Similar to the mode of camptothecin, the backbone of the derivatives could also form ternary complexes via π-π stacking, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions with DNA-protein complex. Moreover, the amide on the compounds 4j and 4m presented a strong hydrogen bond interaction with the base G941, and these interactions presented a respectively short distance of 2.29 and 2.00 Å. The difference in the binding modes of compounds 4j and 4m is mainly caused by the different groups attached to the amide, which could form non-covalent interactions with different amino acid residues of the protein. The 4-fluorobenzyl group on the 4j might be extended to the cavity of the protein and could form a strong H-bond interaction with the residue Lys602. However, the type of ester group on the 4m forms a strong H-bond with the other residue Asn518. Despite the discrepancy, the two compounds bound to the DNA-protein complex presented a high affinity with the binding free energy of −61.78 kcal/mol (4j) and −76.50 kcal/mol (4m) as compared to that of camptothecin (−31.43 kcal/mol), which means that these groups have contributed to the stability of the complex.

Molecular dynamics simulation To better observation that the contribution of compound 4j to the stability of the complex, we have carried out a 50 ns molecular dynamical simulation of the system. The RMSD value, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2, for residues indicated that the system tends to be stable after 10 ns. Analysis of the per-residue root mean square fluctuation, RMSF, indicated that linker domain (residue: 801–876) being the most fluctuating region in the protein in Supplementary Figure 3. In contrast, the fluctuations in amino acid residues associated with the ligand binding were not severe, meaning that the protein system has greater stability upon binding to the compound. During the dynamical equilibrium process in Supplementary Figure 4, compound 4j was always in the middle of the binding pocket without major shifts, and the six-membered ring structure remained strongly interacting with the amino acid residues, which is consistent with the docking results. In addition, it can be noted that the designed amide groups in this process often formed hydrogen bonds with the upper or lower bases (A965 and G941, respectively), which contributes to the stable ternary complex. However, the side chain group of 4j fluctuated greatly during the simulation, but formed weak interactions with different amino acids, which may also play a role in the stability of the complex. Bioassay The results of the IR of the larvae weight increase are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that the increasing inhibition is in a time-dependent manner. All of the treatments presented less pronounced inhibitory effects (IR: 5.29~18.91%) on the 2rd S. litura larvae after 2 days of exposure (Figure 7A). However, with continuous exposure, the IR was significantly enhanced after treatment for 4 and 8 days (Figures 7B,C). Most of the tested compounds exhibited a good inhibitory activity (IR from 24.57 to 41.33%), superior or comparable to that of camptothecin (IR 30.35%) after 4 days. Some of them, 4d, 4j, 4m, even showed a significantly higher activity than CPT (Figure 7B, P < 0.05). Furthermore, compounds 4a and 4q, presenting a similar insignificant inhibitory activity (IR 20.80 and 19.42%, respectively) in larvae, showed unsatisfactory cytotoxic activities in Sf9 cells. As the results illustrated in Figure 7C, almost all of the tested compounds could strongly inhibit the growth of insect larvae (IR from 50.20 to 79.05%) except compounds 4a, 4g, and 4q (IR 30.54%, 43.27%, and 26.09%, respectively) after 8 days of exposure. In particular, four compounds (4c, 4d, 4f, and 4j) exhibited a sturdy inhibition activity (more than 70%) that was significantly higher than camptothecin (IR 55.69%).
