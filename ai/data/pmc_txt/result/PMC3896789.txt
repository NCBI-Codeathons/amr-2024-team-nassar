Results Characterization of bortezomib-sensitive and bortezomib-resistant hematologic tumor cell lines Cell lines were of multiple myeloma (8226), T-cell leukemia (CCRF-CEM) and myelomonocytic leukemia (THP1) origin and their bortezomib-resistant sublines displayed 40-150 fold bortezomib resistance upon cell growth inhibition [8,9]. When studying the absolute protein expression in ng subunit/μg total protein of the catalytically active subunits in wild type (WT) and bortezomib-resistant sublines, all WT tumor cell lines harbored a lower amount of immunoproteasomes (β1i + β2i + β5i) than constitutive proteasomes (β1 + β2 + β5) (8226/WT: 24% vs. 76%, THP1/WT: 43% vs. 57%, and CEM/WT: 37% vs. 63%, respectively). All three bortezomib-resistant sublines displayed a decrease in immunoproteasome expression while an increase in constitutive subunits was observed (8226/BTZ100: 16% vs. 84%, THP1/BTZ200: 18% vs. 82%, and CEM/BTZ200: 16% vs. 84%, respectively) (Figure 1). Additionally, total proteasome content per μg total protein was increased in CEM/BTZ200 and THP1/BTZ200 cells compared to their WT counterparts (19.8 ng/μg vs. 27.3 ng/μg for CEM/BTZ200 and 16.5 ng/μg vs. 31.7 ng/μg for THP1/BTZ200 cells), whereas the proteasome content in 8226/BTZ100 was similar to that of 8226/WT (21.2 ng/μg vs. 23.7 ng/μg) (Figure 1). Figure 1Proteasome subunit expression in bortezomib-resistant and bortezomib-sensitive 8226 (MM), THP1 (AML) and CEM (ALL) cells. Protein expression levels of constitutive proteasome subunits (β5, β1, and β2) and immunoproteasome subunits (β5i, β1i, and β2i) were determined by ProCISE and expressed in ng/μg total protein for 8226/WT, CEM/WT, THP1/WT, 8226/BTZ100, THP1/BTZ200 and CEM/BTZ200 cells. Percentages of individual subunits are given. Results depicted represent the mean (± SD) of 3 separate experiments.

Protein expression levels of constitutive proteasome subunits (β5, β1, and β2) and immunoproteasome subunits (β5i, β1i, and β2i) were determined by ProCISE and expressed in ng/μg total protein for 8226/WT, CEM/WT, THP1/WT, 8226/BTZ100, THP1/BTZ200 and CEM/BTZ200 cells. Percentages of individual subunits are given. Results depicted represent the mean (± SD) of 3 separate experiments. IFN-y exposure tips balances from constitutive proteasomes to immunoproteasomes Since low levels of immunoproteasome expression appeared to be a characteristic feature of bortezomib-resistant tumor cell lines, we aimed at increasing immunoproteasome levels by exposing cell lines to IFN-γ (100 U/ml) for 6-72 h. Indeed, IFN-γ transiently increased (peaks between 24-48 hours) mRNA levels of β5i, β1i, and β2i up to 8-fold, 30-fold and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, constitutive subunits slightly decreased after 24 h (Figure 2A). For comparison, parental cells essentially showed a similar pattern of immunoproteasome mRNA induction, except that the degree of induction was markedly lower than in bortezomib-resistant cells; only THP1/WT cells displayed a higher induction compared to THP1/BTZ200 (Figure 2B). These findings were corroborated at the protein level using Western blot analysis (Figure 2C-D) and the ELISA-based ProCISE assay (Additional file 2), illustrating an increase in β5i β1i, and β2i subunit expression along with a decreased expression of constitutive subunits after IFN-γ exposure. To determine whether or not the mutated and/or wild type allele of PSMB5 was downregulated, mutation-specific primers (for Ala49Thr), wild type-specific primers, and primers for total exon 2 of PSMB5 were developed to quantify the contribution of the mutated allele in 8226/BTZ100 and THP1/BTZ200 before and after 48 hours of IFN-γ exposure. First, amplification curves showed that 8226/BTZ100 cells harbored about 3-fold lower expression of unmutated PSMB5 mRNA compared to parental 8226/WT cells. However, the expression of total exon 2 of PSMB5 was about 3-fold higher in 8226/BTZ100 cells compared to 8226/WT cells, which implies that mutated Ala49Thr in the resistant cells outweighs unmutated PSMB5 (Additional file 3). Similar results were observed for THP1 cells, although THP1/BTZ200 cells expressed slightly higher levels of unmutated PSMB5 compared to THP1/WT (Additional file 3). Furthermore, expression of these PSMB5 variants was determined in the resistant cell lines exposed to IFN-γ. Of note, total PSMB5 expression was decreased in cells exposed to IFN-γ compared to unexposed cells (8226/BTZ100; 24% decrease, and for THP1/BTZ200; 42% decrease). Moreover, unmutated as well as mutated PSMB5 expression decreased after exposure to IFN-γ. Specifically, unmutated PSMB5 expression decreased 23% in 8226/BTZ100 cells and 48% in THP1/BTZ200 cells. Mutated PSMB5 expression decreased 14% in 8226/BTZ100 and 30% in THP1/BTZ200 cells. Accordingly, both mutated and unmutated PSMB5 expression declined after IFN-γ exposure, with dominance for unmutated PSMB5 (Additional file 3).

One representative example of 3 experiments is shown. Collectively, bortezomib-resistant hematologic tumor cells possess the capacity to markedly induce immunoproteasome levels upon IFN-γ stimulation, thereby outweighing mutated and unmutated constitutive proteasome levels. IFN-γ stimulation confers increased proteasome catalytic activity and HLA Class-I molecule expression To determine whether increased immunoproteasome expression also impacts proteasome catalytic activity, an intact cell-based assay was used to measure the three catalytic proteasome activities in the three bortezomib-resistant cell lines before and after 6-72 h incubation with IFN-γ. Following IFN-γ exposure, chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity increased up to 2.5-fold compared to unstimulated controls, and trypsin-like activity increased up to 1.5-fold, whereas caspase-like activity was slightly decreased (Figure 3A). WT cell lines exposed to IFN-γ displayed only modest increments in chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like proteasomal activities, whereas caspase-like activity decreased by 50-65% in 8226 and THP1 cells, but not in CEM/WT cells (Figure 3B). Subdividing the chymotrypsin-like activity into β5 and β5i catalytic activities with subunit-specific probes showed that β5 activity did not change in cell extracts of 8226/BTZ100 and CEM/BTZ200 cells upon stimulation with IFN-γ, whereas in THP1/BTZ200 cells the β5 activity declined after 48 h of IFN-γ exposure. For all three parental and bortezomib-resistant cell lines, β5i and β1i activities increased upon stimulation with IFN-γ (Figure 3C). Consistent with increased proteasome catalytic activity, increased expression of cell surface HLA Class I was also observed, particularly in 8226/BTZ100 cells (2-fold) and CEM/BTZ200 and THP1/BTZ200 cells (1.5-fold increase). HLA Class I expression in WT cells was increased moderately (up to 50%) (Additional file 4).

IFN-γ promotes sensitization of bortezomib-resistant cell lines to cell death by proteasome inhibitors As we have recently shown that mutated constitutive β5 subunit is a critical factor in conferring resistance to bortezomib [8,9], we hypothesized that IFN-γ-induced upregulation of non-mutated immunoproteasome in bortezomib-resistant cells may re-introduce the targeting capacity of bortezomib and other selective immunoproteasome inhibitors, thereby restoring drug sensitivity. Indeed, cell growth inhibition assays demonstrated that pre-exposure to IFN-γ sensitized 8226/BTZ100 cells 4-fold for bortezomib (Figure 4A), 2-fold for Carfilzomib (CFZ; Figure 4B) and 7-fold for the immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914 (Figure 4C). Similar profiles were observed for THP1/BTZ200 after IFN-γ exposure, though with slightly lower sensitization factors than for 8226/BTZ100 cells (Figure 4A-C). Sensitization factors for bortezomib and carfilzomib were the lowest for CEM/BTZ200 cells, but still 3-fold sensitization for ONX 0914 (Figure 4A-C). IC50 values were found to differ significantly between experiments without and with IFN-γ for all high bortezomib-resistant cell lines and drugs. Sensitization impact induced by IFN-γ was further explored in 8226 cells with low levels of bortezomib resistance (8226/BTZ7). Herein, IFN-γ significantly restored parental cell sensitivity to ONX 0914 (p = 0.03) (Figure 4D). For comparison, parental 8226, THP1 and CEM cells were not sensitized or only marginally sensitized to bortezomib, carfilzomib or ONX 0914 after IFN-γ exposure (Additional file 5). Consistently, when PBMCs from healthy individuals were exposed for 24 hours to a concentration range of IFN-γ, they also upregulated immunoproteasome subunits, but did not became sensitized for bortezomib (Additional file 6). A composite summary of the impact of IFN-γ-induced upregulation of immunoproteasomes on the sensitivity of bortezomib-resistant cells to bortezomib, carfilzomib and ONX 0914 is depicted in Additional file 7.

P-values indicate differences between BTZ-resistant cells exposed or unexposed to IFN-γ. Restoration of drug sensitivity to (immuno)proteasome inhibitor after IFN-γ exposure was further confirmed by apoptosis induction and activation of PARP cleavage. Western blot analysis revealed a marked increase in cleaved PARP and NOXA expression in bortezomib-resistant cells when bortezomib exposure was preceded by IFN-γ as compared to bortezomib alone (Figure 5). Next, we examined the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins as a hallmark of proteasome inhibition in bortezomib-resistant cells upon pre-exposure to IFN-γ followed by incubation with the bortezomib concentration they were stably growing in. Exposure to bortezomib or IFN-γ alone showed a minimal accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in bortezomib-resistant cells. In contrast, pre-exposure to IFN-γ in combination with bortezomib introduced a major accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins pointing to restoration of proteasome inhibitory activity of bortezomib and subsequent induction of apoptosis (Figure 5). Similar results were noted with cells pre-exposed to IFN-γ and subsequently to ONX 0914 for 24 hours (Additional file 8).

Immunoproteasome subunit β5i is responsible for the sensitization of bortezomib-resistant cell lines To provide evidence that upregulation of β5i and/or β1i by IFN-γ was responsible for the observed sensitization to proteasome inhibitor, siRNA-dependent downregulation of PSMB8 (β5i) and PSMB9 (β1i) was applied in THP1/BTZ200 cells prior to exposure to IFN-γ. Under these conditions, mRNA levels of PSMB8 and PSMB9 remained significantly (P = 0.03) suppressed for approximately 80%, even after exposure to IFN-γ, compared to non-target siRNA (Figure 6A-B). Expression of β5i and β1i protein was suppressed for 58% and 78% after 48 h of PSMB8 and PSMB9 silencing respectively, compared to non-target control siRNA (Figure 6C). Consistently, after siRNA downregulation of PSMB8, but not PSMB9, chymotrypsin-like proteasome catalytic activity significantly (P = 0.03) declined to 50% of its control and remained suppressed after exposure to IFN-γ (Figure 6D). Lastly, we determined sensitivity to ONX 0914 and bortezomib with 4-day MTT cytotoxicity assays after PSMB8 and PSMB9 silencing with or without IFN-γ pre-exposure. After the sole silencing of PSMB8, THP1/BTZ200 cells became slightly more resistant to bortezomib and ONX 0914, while PSMB9 silencing did not exert any effect (Figure 7A-B). When cells were exposed to IFN-γ after PSMB8 silencing, bortezomib and ONX 0914 sensitization was attenuated. In contrast, exposure to IFN-γ after silencing of PSMB9 expression had less effect on bortezomib and ONX 0914 sensitization (Figure 7C-D), indicating that β5i represents the major determinant in exerting apoptosis and growth inhibitory effects of bortezomib and ONX 0914 after exposure to IFN-γ.
