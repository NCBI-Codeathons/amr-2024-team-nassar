["Results", "PIS mass spectrometry to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates", "PHTs were detected in the cultural supernatants of wild type strain P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A by High resolution mass spectrometry (HR MS) and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The 31P chemical shift of PHTs was 10.94 ppm (Figure S1). Tandem mass spectra (MS2) indicated that species with m/z ratio at 452, 374 and 189 are the characteristic daughter ions of PHTs (m/z ratio at 532) (Fig. 1B). Daughter ions with m/z ratio at 374 and 189 were also observed in the MS3 spectra when desulfonated PHTs (m/z ratio at 452) were further fragmented (Fig. 1C).", "PHTs characteristic daughter ions with m/z ratio at 374 and 189 were used as queries to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates by PIS mass spectrometry. Novel ion with m/z ratio at 417 was detected and tandem mass spectra were further recorded on HR-FT-MS instrument (Fig. 1D,E). Ions with m/z ratio at 417, desulfonated PHTs and PHTs shared two identical daughter ions, m/z ratio at 374 and 189 (Fig. 1F), which are corresponding to the exact mass of tripeptides Orn-Ala-hArg and hArg residues respectively. It indicated that the novel ion with m/z ratio at 417 is a derivate of PHT peptide scaffold Orn-Ala-hArg. Based on exact mass of 417.2568 (Fig. 1E), the side functional group was deduced to be carbamoyl. Carbamylation of Orn-Ala-hArg produced Cit-Ala-hArg, which was a deduced chemical structure of the newly detected ions with m/z ratio at 417.", "Tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg were by-products of PHT biosynthetic pathway", "To determine the biosynthetic relationship between tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg and PHTs, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A genes phtU, phtQ and phtL were in-frame deleted (Figure S2). Neither Cit-Ala-hArg nor PHT was detected from the culture supernatants of phtU- mutant CL001 strain. Gene phtU complementation strain CL004 regained the ability to produce PHTs (Figure S3). Authentic L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg standards feeding restored phtU- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs at 18\u2009\u00b0C, which is the temperature permissive for PHTs synthesis in wild type producers (Fig. 2B). Simultaneously, feeding of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Ala- L-hArg restored phtU- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs as well (Figure S3). To the phtQ in-frame deletion, neither Cit-Ala-hArg nor PHT was detected from the culture supernatants of phtQ- mutant strain CL002. Surprisingly, PSOrn was detected from the culture supernatants of phtQ- mutants. HR tandem MS spectra of PSOrn were shown in Fig. 3. None of the authentic oligopeptides described here restored phtQ- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs (Fig. 2C). Meanwhile, gene phtQ complementation strain CL005 regained the ability to produce PHTs (Figure S3). Gene phtL knockout did not abolish phtL- mutant strain CL003 the ability to produce tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg at 18\u2009\u00b0C (Fig. 2D). PhtL is necessary for PHTs biosynthesis since phtL- mutants did not produce any PHT. The accumulated amounts of Cit-Ala-hArg were increased when PHT biosynthesis pathway was blocked in P. syringae pv. phaseolicola phtL- mutants (Fig. 2D).", "Gene deletion and feeding experiments results described here showed that tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg were by-products accumulated during PHTs biosynthetic process. Dipeptide L-Ala- L-hArg was a joint precursor for the synthesis of both PHT and Cit-Ala-hArg (Fig. 4). Nonspecific aminopeptidase catalyzed hydrolysis of L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg would release L-Ala- L-hArg. Incorporation of L-Ala- L-hArg into PHT biosynthetic pathway restored phtU- mutants with PHTs producing ability (Fig. 4). Detection of precursor PSOrn from the culture supernatant of phtQ- showed that PhtQ involved in the biosynthesis of PHTs with PSOrn and L-Ala- L-hArg as substrates. Accumulation of by-products Orn-Ala-hArg and Cit-Ala-hArg from the culture supernatants of wild type strains and certain gene in frame deletion mutants might be attributed to the substrate tolerance of PhtQ. We can not rule out the possibility that there are certain uncharacterized peptide ligases participated in the formation of Orn-Ala-hArg and/or Cit-Ala-hArg. PhtL might be involved in the biosynthetic steps of PSOrn with L-Orn as a close precursor. Based on the fact that there is a phtL gene homologous (agnD1 and agnD2) in the biosynthetic gene cluster of another phosphoramidate natural product Agrocin 84282930, we assume that phtL is related to the N-P bonds formation of PHTs.", "ArgK catalyzed the formation of Tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg", "To extend our understanding about why such a great amount of by-products were accumulated, it is necessary to address the question concerning formation of tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg. Two possible mechanisms could be involved to account for this phenomenon. First, PhtQ enzyme is a substrate tolerant peptide ligase and capable of catalyzing the synthesis of Cit-Ala-hArg with Citrulline and dipeptide Ala-hArg as substrates. Second, a potential transcarbamylase catalyzes the carbamylation of Orn-Ala-hArg to form Cit-Ala-hArg. To the PHTs producing Pseudomonas cells, it suffers from Citrulline shortage since the Citrulline formation reaction kcat catalyzed by ArgK reduced to between 1% and 2% of that catalyzed by typical OTCase, such as ArgF31. It is not an economical strategy to produce a great amount of by-product Cit-Ala-hArg by consuming limited Citrulline source. In addition, by-products Cit-Ala-hArg were detected from the cultural supernatants of phtU- as well as phtQ- mutants when Orn-Ala-hArg was added as substrate respectively (Figure S4). Therefore, the OTCase ArgK was suspected to be a main contributor for the formation of by-product Cit-Ala-hArg in vivo.", "Enzyme assay showed that purified ArgK catalyzed the formation of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg with L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and carbamyl phosphates as substrates at 28\u2009\u00b0C in vitro (Fig. 5). The tripeptides L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg production was positively correlated with reaction time, while no detectable amount was observed from the negative control reaction in which ArgK was absent (Fig. 5B). On the contrary, ArgK did not catalyze the reverse reaction in which the system was set up with L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg and orthophosphate as substrate.", "It indicated that ArgK played dual roles for PHT producers\u2019 self-defense, which the first one was providing alternative Arginine source by acting as functional replacement of ArgF as documented previously131415, and the second one was reducing PHTs production by modifying L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg to produce by-products L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg. Exogenous L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg with a concentration range from 1 to 10\u2009mM did not affect the growth of PHTs producer P. syringae 1448A (Fig. 6). Tripeptides L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg were partially consumed by P. syringae cells in the tested conditions.", "Besides anabolic OTCase ArgF, another catabolic OTCase ArcB has been detected from P. aeruginosa3233. ArcB is involved in the Arginine deiminase pathway and catalyzes the phosphorolysis of Citrulline to produce Ornithine and carbamyl phosphate3435. It is exactly the reverse reaction of that one involved in the Arginine biosynthesis pathway catalyzed by ArgF. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArgK is more closely related to ArcB of P. aeruginosa PA01 than ArgF of P. syringae (Fig. 7). Comparing with typical anabolic OTCases, amino acid residue substitutions of ArgK were observed in the conserved sites around ornithine binding \u201cSMG\u201d loop31. The newly identified ArgK function announced here accords well with the alteration of substrate binding pocket. PHT resistant and substrate tolerant characters of OTCase ArgK challenge the current paradigm for OTCase."]
