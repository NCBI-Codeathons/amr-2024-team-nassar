Results The T6SS gene cluster harbours self-resistance determinants and candidate secreted effectors The T6SS gene cluster of S. marcescens Db10, SMA2244–2281, contains 38 genes, including many with no known function (Murdoch et al., 2011). We speculated that encoded within this cluster might be T6-secreted effectors and/or self-resistance determinants, the latter preventing the T6SS-expressing cell from harming itself or being harmed by its isogenic (sibling) neighbours. In order to determine whether the cluster did indeed contain self-resistance determinants (such as specific immunity proteins analogous to the Tsi proteins), we generated a mutant lacking the entire T6SS gene cluster (ΔT6SS) and examined whether it was fully resistant to the T6SS of the wild type strain. Co-culture of two target strains, wild type Db10 and the ΔT6SS mutant, each with a wild type and a ΔclpV attacker, showed that the ΔT6SS mutant had lost resistance to T6SS-mediated inhibition or killing by the wild type strain (Fig. 1A, left). Recovery of ΔT6SS was decreased 100-fold when it was co-cultured with the wild type strain, compared with when the wild type strain was co-cultured with itself. This effect was dependent on a functional T6SS in the attacker as there was no loss of ΔT6SS when it was co-cultured with a ΔclpV mutant. The ATPase ClpV is one of the core, structural components of the T6SS and we have shown previously that it is essential for Hcp secretion and T6-mediated antibacterial killing activity of S. marcescens Db10 (Murdoch et al., 2011). To simplify the analysis of multiple mutants, we defined the ‘resistance index’ of a strain as the difference between recovery when co-cultured with the wild type strain and recovery when co-cultured with the ΔclpV mutant, specifically log2[recovery vs. wild type/recovery vs. ΔclpV]. The wild type or other resistant strain will show no difference and have a resistance index of 0. A target strain with reduced ability to resist harm caused by the T6SS will have a negative resistance index, exemplified by the ΔT6SS mutant with a resistance index of −7.6 (Fig. 1A, right). Self-resistance did not depend on an active T6SS, as a ΔclpV mutant had a resistance index of 0. Similarly, mutants in other essential core T6SS components, Δlip, ΔicmH and ΔtssK (Murdoch et al., 2011) also showed no loss of self-resistance (data not shown). Therefore, genes other than those encoding the core conserved T6SS components were implicated in self-resistance. Our attention was particularly caught by a locus in the middle of the gene cluster, where six non-conserved genes, SMA2260–2262, SMA2264–2266, are flanked by conserved T6SS components. A mutant lacking all of these genes (but maintaining intact SMA2263, encoding Hcp1) was also tested and found to have a negative resistance index (Fig. 1A). Hence, one or more of these genes contributes to self-resistance and may encode immunity protein(s).

Closer examination of the proteins encoded by SMA2260–2262 and SMA2264–2266 revealed two classes of small proteins (Fig. 1B). SMA2261 and SMA2264 were basic proteins with detectable sequence similarity between them, no discernable cellular localization signals and no predicted function. We hypothesized that they might be secreted substrates, and, given subsequent results, named them Ssp1 and Ssp2 (Secreted small protein). SMA2260, SMA2262, SMA2265 and SMA2266 were proteins with classical Sec-dependent N-terminal signal peptides, identified using SignalP (Petersen et al., 2011), and thus predicted to be periplasmic. They also had no predicted function but shared detectable sequence similarity with each other. We hypothesized that they would represent specific immunity proteins or other self-resistance determinants, and named them Rap1a, Rap1b, Rap2a and Rap2b (Resistance associated protein). The genes encoding all these small proteins fall into two sets, either side of hcp1 and within genes encoding T6SS structural proteins, vipB and fha (Fig. 1B). Homologues of the Ssp and Rap proteins are encoded within T6SS gene clusters in many other bacterial species (and in at least one case apart from the T6SS) and appear to always co-occur (see representative examples in Fig. 1C). We speculated that the S. marcescens Ssp and Rap proteins represented previously unknown combinations of T6-secreted effectors and cognate immunity proteins. Importantly, mutants lacking one, some or all of the small proteins exhibited wild type levels of Hcp secretion (Figs 1D and S1). Thus, none of the Ssp or Rap proteins is required for Hcp secretion, i.e. they play no structural role in the T6SS. Ssp1 and Ssp2 are Type VI-secreted effectors Ssp1 and Ssp2 were shown to be secreted substrates of the T6SS by immunoblotting secreted fractions from the wild type strain, two T6SS mutants, ΔclpV and ΔtssE, and the corresponding complemented strains, using specific anti-Ssp1 and anti-Ssp2 antibodies. Both proteins were detected in the culture supernatant, entirely dependent on a functional T6SS (Fig. 2A). Neither protein was detectable in the cellular fraction, implying they were rapidly turned over if not secreted (data not shown). Secretion of Ssp2 was also independent of Ssp1, and vice versa, again confirming they have no structural or accessory role in the secretion machinery (Fig. 2A). In order to establish if the Ssp proteins were antibacterial toxins contributing to the killing or inhibition of the susceptible ΔT6SS mutant by the wild type strain, the recovery of ΔT6SS in the presence of different mutants was determined. Recovery of the ΔT6SS target was increased fivefold with the Δssp2 mutant, or any multiple mutant lacking ssp2, as attacker, compared with the wild type attacker (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in this assay, loss of Ssp1 did not cause a statistically significant impairment in killing of ΔT6SS. None of the Rap proteins was required for targeting of ΔT6SS (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2Proteins Ssp1 and Ssp2 are secreted by the Type VI secretion system and self-harm is mediated by Ssp2.A.

Self-resistance against the Ssp1 and Ssp2 toxins is mediated by their cognate Rap partners In order to assess the contribution of each of the rap (and ssp) genes to self-resistance, single mutants were constructed. It rapidly became apparent that single mutants in rap1a and rap2a had severe fitness defects on solid media, both on rich (Fig. 3A) and minimal media (Fig. S2), and particularly Δrap2a. Culture spots and single colonies of each mutant were ‘thinner’, smaller (in the case of Δrap2a), and with altered surface morphology. Examination of single cells showed that the Δrap1a cells appeared bigger and less uniformly shaped than wild type cells and the Δrap2a cells had striking phenotypes, being either markedly distended or highly elongated (Figs 3A and S2). These phenotypes could be complemented by expression of the corresponding gene in trans (indeed, the additional stress of the selective antibiotic made the phenotypes of Δrap1a and Δrap2a mutants carrying vector control plasmids even more pronounced; Fig. 3A). In contrast, when Δrap1a was constructed in combination with Δssp1, or Δrap2a in combination with Δssp2, the double mutants were readily made and were of normal appearance and fitness on solid media (Figs 3A and S2). These observations are entirely consistent with Rap2a serving as the immunity protein against the Ssp2 toxin and Rap1a being the cognate immunity protein alleviating toxicity mediated by Ssp1. Similarly, when Δrap1a or Δrap2a mutants were constructed in combination with the ΔclpV mutation, the double mutants were again apparently healthy on solid media (Figs 3A and S2). Hence, self-toxicity depended on a functional T6SS, implying it was caused by T6SS-mediated injection of the toxin into a susceptible cell by its neighbours (further supported by the observation that Δrap1a and Δrap2a did not display comparable growth defects in liquid culture, where contact-dependent targeting is unlikely to occur efficiently; Fig. S2).

In (B) and (C), bars show mean ± SEM (n ≥ 4); *** indicates a significant difference compared with the wild type strain (P < 0.001). An immunity function for Rap2a was directly demonstrated in co-culture (antibacterial competition assay): target strains containing a Δrap2a mutation all showed a negative resistance index (Fig. 3B; the single Δrap2a mutant was not tested because of its severe sickness). Strains containing a Δrap1a mutation did not have a negative resistance index, consistent with the lack of significant contribution of Ssp1 to self-killing under the conditions of these assays (Fig. 2B). To confirm that Ssp2 was directly and entirely responsible for the inhibitory effect of a wild type attacker strain on Δrap2a, we showed that a Δrap2a target strain is completely resistant to attack by a Δssp2 mutant, with recovery of Δrap2a in the presence of a Δssp2 attacker being the same as its recovery in the presence of a ΔclpV attacker (Fig. 3C). Additionally, inhibition of Δrap2a target was restored to wild type levels when the Δssp2 mutant attacker was complemented by expression of Ssp2 in trans. The susceptibility of Δrap2a to killing by the wild type strain could also be fully complemented (Fig. S2). Hence, Ssp2 and Rap2a represent a specific, cognate toxin and immunity protein pair. Biochemical studies confirm a strong interaction between cognate secreted toxins and immunity proteins Each of the Ssp and Rap proteins was overproduced and purified (in the case of the Rap proteins, without their N-terminal signal peptides). Complex formation was demonstrated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. All Rap proteins were dimeric in solution, whereas Ssp1 and Ssp2 were monomeric (Fig. 4A and B). When equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a were mixed, all of the protein was detected in a higher molecular weight complex (Fig. 4A) and the same was also observed on mixing Ssp2 and Rap2a (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no complex formation between Ssp1 and Rap1b or between Ssp2 and Rap2b, no additional three-way complexes and no ‘cross’ interactions between Ssp2 and Rap1a or between Ssp1 and Rap2a were observed (Figs 4B and S3). As mixing equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a resulted in detection of only the complexed species, with no unbound form of either protein detectable, this implied a 1:1 molar complex. The 1:1 molar stoichiometry of the Rap1a–Ssp1 complex was confirmed by quantitative analysis of the composition of the higher molecular weight peak using in-gel SYPRO Orange staining (Rickman et al., 2004) (Fig. 4C). Given the dimeric nature of Rap1a and an apparent complex mass by SEC of around 55 kDa [predicted Mw of 1:1 molar complexes are 34.6 kDa (1:1), 69.2 kDa (2:2), 104 kDa (3:3) or 138 kDa (4:4)], this is most consistent with a heterotetrameric Rap1a2–Ssp12 complex. Similar logic supported a Rap2a2–Ssp22 complex (Fig. 4A and C). The SEC analyses suggested stable complexes were formed between the cognate Ssp and Rap proteins. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis of complex formation between Ssp1 and the Rap1a dimer and between Ssp2 and the Rap2a dimer (Fig. 4D) showed that, in both cases, binding was clearly exothermic and tight, at least in the low nanomolar Kd range. Although apparent Kd values of 4–8 nM were obtained, this is approaching the limit of accuracy for conventional ITC (Wiseman et al., 1989). Finally, we took advantage of the tight Rap–Ssp interactions to utilize immobilized Rap2a and Rap1a to affinity-purify secreted Ssp2 or Ssp1, respectively, from culture supernatant (Figs 4E and S3). Mass spectrometry not only confirmed the identity of Ssp1 and Ssp2 but also showed that Ssp2 is not processed on secretion, as almost complete sequence coverage revealed intact N- and C-termini (Fig. S3). For Ssp1, we observed an intact C-terminus but the sequence of the very N-terminus corresponds to several tryptic peptides too small to be detectable by standard mass spectrometry, so we were unable to definitively confirm lack of processing at this end (data not shown).

The secreted small proteins, Ssp1 and Ssp2, exert distinct harmful effects when targeted to the periplasm in Escherichia coli and are neutralized by coexpression of the cognate immunity protein In order to confirm the antibacterial toxin function of Ssp1 and Ssp2 and establish in which cellular compartment they exerted their effect, each protein was produced in E. coli, either in the cytoplasm or artificially targeted to the periplasm (by the N-terminal fusion of the Sec-dependent OmpA signal peptide: sp-Ssp2 or sp-Ssp1). The presence of Ssp2 in the periplasm, but not the cytoplasm, prevented growth of E. coli on LB and minimal media; this toxicity was alleviated by the co-production of Rap2ab (Fig. 5A). Periplasmic Ssp1 was also toxic and its effect alleviated by co-production of Rap1ab (Fig. 5A). However Ssp1 toxicity was only observed at higher expression levels and on minimal media. The periplasmic localization of the Rap proteins in S. marcescens was confirmed by fractionation and immunoblotting of epitope-tagged versions of the protein (Fig. 5B, data not shown).

Next, we also determined whether Ssp2 and/or Ssp1 were essential for the observed antibacterial activity of the S. marcescens T6SS against other bacterial species (Murdoch et al., 2011). Neither protein was required for T6SS-dependent killing of other bacteria (Fig. S4). This implies redundancy of effector function, in other words that other T6SS-secreted toxins are still able to cause killing in the absence of Ssp1 and Ssp2. The Rap family of proteins display a new fold Bioinformatic analysis of the Rap protein sequences predicted similarities between them, despite relatively low sequence conservation, e.g. mature Rap1b and Rap2b share around 20% identity, as do mature Rap2a and Rap2b. All four Rap proteins appeared to be highly acidic, to carry an N-terminal periplasmic targeting signal sequence of about 24 residues, and were predicted to have similar α-helical structures (using PSIPRED). In addition, a cysteine pairing appeared to be conserved. Intriguingly, no structural relative of the Rap proteins could be identified; hence, we sought to obtain three-dimensional models using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Soluble recombinant Rap proteins were only obtained in high yield from E. coli Rosetta-gami (DE3), a strain engineered to support disulphide bond formation, and were dimeric in solution (Fig. 4). Well-ordered crystals of Rap1b and Rap2b were obtained and the structures were elucidated at 1.9 Å and 2.0 Å resolution respectively (Fig. 6, Table 1). A search for structural relatives using PDBeFold (pdbe.org/fold) and ProFunc (Laskowski et al., 2005) was performed using monomers and dimers of Rap1b and Rap2b as templates. The only matches were to short segments of α-helices with Z-scores (< 3) indicating low statistical significance. The lack of any convincing structural relationships indicates that the fold observed in both Rap1b and Rap2b is previously uncharacterized. Fig. 6Structural features of Rap1b and Rap2b dimers.

The PDB accession codes are 4AX2 (Rap1b) and 4B6I (Rap2b). The asymmetric unit of the Rap1b structure consists of a single subunit and crystallographic symmetry generates the dimer. Rap2b has two dimers, formed by subunits A : B and C : D, in the asymmetric unit. The four subunits are similar, with the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between superimposed Cα atoms ranging from 0.5 Å (subunit B and D) to 0.7 Å (subunits A and C). The two proteins display obvious similarities in terms of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (Figs 6 and S5). An overlay of Rap1b and Rap2b subunits matches 71 Cα atoms with a r.m.s.d. of 1.4 Å. Of note is the conservation of the disulphide bond, a key structural feature, likely critical to the stable folding of the subunit and subsequent dimerization of the Rap proteins. The Rap subunit is constructed around a helical bundle of five helices (α2–α6). A disulphide linkage (Cys54–Cys120 in Rap1b, Cys41–Cys101 in Rap2b) tethers α2 and α5 together. This association in turn supports formation of a hydrophobic core that is primarily aliphatic with residues contributed from α2, α4, α5 and α6. Three helices (α2, α3, α5) form a concave surface on one side of the monomer. A series of hydrogen bonding interactions also helps to stabilize the arrangement of α2 and α4. By virtue of being longer than Rap2b, Rap1b has an extension of five residues at the N-terminus and 13 at the C-terminus, the latter of which form a short helix α7. These segments of Rap1b are on the surface of the molecules at opposite ends of the dimer (Fig. 6). The Rap proteins display an extensive dimerization interface (Fig. 6), consistent with the observation that each Rap protein exists as a stable dimer in solution (Fig. 4A and B). The Rap1b dimer uses almost 24% of the accessible surface area of a subunit in formation of the dimer. In the case of Rap2b the value is 20%. Such percentages are indicative of highly stable oligomers (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). The dimer is stabilized by extensive van der Vaals interactions primarily involving aliphatic residues, in conjunction with hydrogen bonding interactions and solvent mediated bridging associations. The most important contributions are from side-chains on the concave surface, formed by α2, α3 and α5, interacting with the partner across the molecular twofold axis of symmetry. Additional interactions involve a self-association of the loop that links α2 and α3, together with the N-terminus α1 and α5. Helices α2 and α5 are thus not only critical for the fold of the Rap subunits but also to creating a suitable interface that leads to a highly stable dimer. This observation, together with the conserved disulphide bond (Fig. 7), ties in with the localization of Rap proteins to the oxidative environment of the periplasm where correct folding to support anti-toxin activity must occur. Fig. 7Conservation of the Rap protein fold. Sequence alignment of S. marcescens Rap2b and Rap2a with homologous proteins from Erwinia amylovora (GenBank CBA22869.1), Enterobacter cloacae (NCBI Reference Sequence YP_003612051.1), Cronobacter sakazakii (NCBI Reference Sequence YP_001439955.1), Salmonella Typhimurium (NCBI Reference Sequence NP_459276.1) and Pseudomonas syringae (NCBI Reference Sequence YP_237109.1). The secondary structure of Rap2b (blue cylinders) and the predicted secondary structure of the P. syringae protein (purple cylinders) are shown. All proteins had similar predicted secondary structures (PSIPRED); the one shown is representative. Cysteine residues involved in disulphide bond formation are coloured yellow. Alignment was generated using T-Coffee and annotated using ALINE, using the mature proteins (i.e. without N-terminal signal peptides; numbering refers to the full-length proteins).

Importantly, sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions for the other Rap proteins, in S. marcescens and other organisms, suggest strongly that the novel fold revealed by our crystallographic analyses is generic for this entire family of proteins (Fig. 7). Not only are the main α-helices observed in both crystal structures closely mimicked by the structural predictions of the other members of the family, the Cys residues contributing to the structural disulphide bond are also conserved. Additionally, Rap2b shares slightly higher sequence identity with Rap2a (23% identity for the mature proteins) than it does with Rap1b (20% identity). Given the similarity of the Rap1b and 2b crystal structures, discussed above (Fig. S5), then this provides confidence that Rap2a shares this new fold and indeed that the Rap fold is a defining characteristic of this protein family, many members of which are likely to represent T6SS immunity proteins.
