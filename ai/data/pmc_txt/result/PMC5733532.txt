Results In silico analysis of the expressed secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes during germination of S. coelicolor Genes that are expressed in the consecutive time points of germination have been reported by Strakova (Strakova et al., 2013). From their dataset we selected genes whose products are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by S. coelicolor, according to the StrepDB database (http://strepdb.streptomyces.org.uk), where the annotated S. coelicolor genes are categorized into metabolic groups. We updated the list of secondary metabolites with regard to newly published findings (Zhao et al., 2009; van Keulen and Dyson, 2014). The resulting list of genes is summarized in Table 1. Predicted secondary metabolites, whose respective genes are expressed during germination, include polyketides, pyrones, peptides, siderophores, terpenoids, oligopyrroles, and fatty acids.

Secondary metabolites produced by S. coelicolor during germination and/or in the stationary phase The fact that genes whose products are involved in the secondary metabolite biosynthesis were transcribed during germination encouraged us to investigate whether germinating spores produce respective compounds up to the 6th hour of their development. For this purpose, we performed an LC-MS analysis of the culture supernatants. In order to ensure that any detected compound is synthesized de novo during germination, we included dormant spores (non-activated) as negative control samples in the analysis. As a positive control that tests effectiveness of our detection method, samples from the sporulation phase were included too. The compounds detected only in the sporulation phase (after 48 h of cultivation) but absent from the germination are listed in Table 2.

Our LC-MS measurements revealed, however, that the S. coelicolor's germlings produce three different compounds with masses corresponding to the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic albaflavenone, the polyketide germicidin A, and chalcone (Table 3; Figures 1–3, respectively). Furthermore, the identity of germicidin A was confirmed by comparing the actual retention time with the original standard obtained from Cayman Pharma (Figure 2).

Actinorhodin production Actinorhodin compounds (actinorhodinic acid and γ-actinorhodin) were detected in both dormant and germinating spores, as well as in samples from the stationary phase of growth (Table 2). Streptomycetes produced these compounds after 48 h of cultivation in R3, AM, and NMMP medium, regardless of carbon source (glucose, glycerol, or mannitol). Although the suspensions of dormant spores were washed in distilled water, we found that dormant spores also contained these blue pigments. We also found actinorhodinic acid and γ-actinorhodin in the cell-free supernatant after spore germination in AM medium. All supernatants containing the blue pigments also exhibited a pH-dependent color change. pH-dependent biosynthetic activity of germlings Biosynthesis of albaflavenone involves the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP170A1) which, depending on pH, can either act as a monooxygenase (pH 7.0-8.2) or as a farnesene synthase (5.5–6.5) (Zhao et al., 2009). Whereas β-farnesene was not synthesized in cultures in R3, NMMP, and AM medium at pH 7.0–7.2, we showed that the germlings produce a substance corresponding to albaflavenone. To see whether β-farnesene is produced in more acidic conditions, we performed a germination experiment in R3 medium with glycerol at pH 6.0. Secondary metabolites were extracted by the solid phase extraction, followed by the LC-MS analysis. To compare, we used an extract after 6 h of cultivation at pH 7.2 without changing the other conditions. Although the direct production of β-farnesene was not found, it is clear from the total ionic and base peak chromatograms that under different pH conditions S. coelicolor produces a different spectrum of substances (Figure 4). Further analysis was beyond the scope of this manuscript. Figure 4pH-dependent biosynthetic activity of germlings.

Biological effects of albaflavenone, germicidin A, and chalcone Albaflavenone Since albaflavenone was not commercially available, its possible effect on germination was tested using the albaflavenone-hexane extract (see Methods). A negative control, which contained pure hexane, was included in the experiment. No quantitative or phenotypic changes were observed in the tested conditions (Figure 5C). To verify this result, a dehydrogenase activity test was performed (Figure 5D). Metabolic activity of living cells that are present in the medium during germination was determined as a function of their dehydrogenase activity, proportional to the concentration of rising TF measured by the optical density at 484 nm (see Methods for details). The optical density increased in time during germination at the same rate in both tested and control samples; the albaflavenone-hexane extract created no observable effect.

Metabolic activity was measured at denoted time points by optical density at 484 nm. The biological effect of the other two secondary metabolites on germination was examined using standards of gemicidin A (Cayman Pharma) and chalcone (Sigma-Aldrich). Experiments were performed on six-section cultivation titration plates (Gama Group). Three fields in one column contained ONA medium with a gradient of tested compound (0–8 μg mL−1) and pure medium without the tested substance was poured into the fields in the other column as negative controls. Results were evaluated in terms of the number of colony forming units (CFU) and phenotypic changes. Germicidin A Germicidin A clearly inhibited the germination of S. coelicolor from the concentration of 4 μg mL−1 (Figure 5A). The average number of colony-forming units (germinating spores) was 20 on an ONA medium with the linear gradient of germicidin A at 4 μg mL−1 and lower; 60 colonies were grown without germicidin A as a negative control. The tested colonies were of the same shape and size as their controls. Actinorhodin production was quantitatively the same. Chalcone Our initial experiments showed that chalcone suppressed germination of S. coelicolor in concentrations down to 8 μg mL−1 on the solid medium (Figure 5B). The average number of CFU was 20 on a medium with a chalcone gradient (0–8 μg mL−1), contrary to 70 colonies on the chalcone-free medium. The size of the colonies was inversely proportional to the chalcone concentrations; the colonies were significantly smaller compared to the negative control, suggesting a slower germination rate and/or vegetative growth. Moreover, in the presence of chalcone, actinorhodin was not produced throughout the whole cell cycle. The effect of chalcone was additionally examined in R3 liquid medium. Whereas the concentration 8 μg mL−1 revealed to be subinhibitory, the chalcone concentration of 80 μg mL−1 completely suppressed the development as could be seen in electronmicroscopic images taken from the germination course in the 4th and 6th hour of cultivation Figure 6. As could be seen in the image, the developing germ tubes disrupt in the presence of chalcone, leaving empty cell envelopes. Figure 6An inhibitory effect of chalcone on spore germination.
