RESULTS Here we introduce the FunARTS web server, which now allows the analysis of fungal phyla, thus facilitating BGCs prioritization and discovery of bioactive compounds with interesting modes of action. To the best of our knowledge, FunARTS is the only open-source web tool that incorporates and automates the expanded, target-directed genome mining pipeline. Moreover, FunARTS offers a more user-friendly, rapid, and effective analysis compared to resistance-guided mining methods. Likewise, interactive tables and visual outputs allow uncomplicated exploration, faster interpretation, and export of all data. Reference set and core gene analysis To enable accurate and efficient identification of resistance and core genes in fungal genomes, phylum-specific reference sets were generated where essential genes were identified using Hidden Markov Models. This analysis was performed using the BUSCO software. The core genes were filtered for ‘Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism’ functions by terms found in the clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) to reduce the number of false-positive targets (Supplementary Table S1). However, a second search mode, called ‘exploration mode’, is available as an option to search all the core genes in the reference beside ‘default mode’. Nonetheless, it was observed that genes with functions such as unclassified and translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis were the most abundant in the functional classification of each reference set (Supplementary Figure S1). Median values of all Nei-Gojobori pairwise dN/dS calculations, a gene's frequency of occurrence as a single copy, and reference ubiquity were logged to the model metadata (Supplementary Figure S2). Positive controls To validate the accuracy and sensitivity of FunARTS, we analyzed most of the available fungal genomes that contained well-known examples of resistant target genes. We identified some of them following a thorough literature review. To increase the number of known positive controls, we next searched the MIBiG database for natural product BGCs with resistant target genes. From the characterized BGCs in the MIBiG dataset, corresponding genomes were downloaded and analyzed with FunARTs. However, no whole genome data are available for the squalestatin BGC. In that case only the BGC was analyzed for core genes within the BGC (Table 1). Overall, we were able to find 13 known fungal BGCs containing resistant targets. FunARTS identified at least one hit in all but four cases. In these four instances, the resistant target genes were not detected since the BUSCO database does not include these as essential genes (methionine aminopeptidase, HMG-CoA reductase, F1-ATPase ß-subunit, and ß-1,3-d-glucan synthase FKS1 subunit), showing that the database for essential genes needs to be expanded in the future. In conclusion, with few exceptions, FunARTS identified resistance genes associated with BGCs in nearly all fungal sequence data tested. Positive examples of genomes with known self-resistance mechanisms which were analyzed with the FunARTS default mode. D: duplication, B: BGC proximity, R: resistance model.
