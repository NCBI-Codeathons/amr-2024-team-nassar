The broad bioactivities of nonribosomal peptides rely on increasing structural diversity. Genome mining of the Burkholderiales strain Schlegelella brevitalea DSM 7029 leads to the identification of a class of dodecapeptides, glidonins, that feature diverse N-terminal modifications and a uniform putrescine moiety at the C-terminus. The N-terminal diversity originates from the wide substrate selectivity of the initiation module. The C-terminal putrescine moiety is introduced by the unusual termination module 13, the condensation domain directly catalyzes the assembly of putrescine into the peptidyl backbone, and other domains are essential for stabilizing the protein structure. Swapping of this module to another two nonribosomal peptide synthetases leads to the addition of a putrescine to the C-terminus of related nonribosomal peptides, improving their hydrophilicity and bioactivity. This study elucidates the mechanism for putrescine addition and provides further insights to generate diverse and improved nonribosomal peptides by introducing a C-terminal putrescine. Nonribosomal peptides have diverse bioactivities and can possess unusual moieties at their C-terminus, such as polyamines. In this study, the authors identify a class of dodecapeptides glidonins that feature diverse N-terminal modifications and a uniform putrescine moiety at the C-terminus, elucidate their biosynthesis, and introduce the putrescine into the C-terminus of other nonribosomal peptides.
