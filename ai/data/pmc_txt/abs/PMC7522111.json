["Emerging and re-emerging microbial pathogens, together with their rapid evolution and adaptation against antibiotics, highlight the importance not only of screening for new antimicrobial agents, but also for deepening knowledge about existing antibiotics. Primycin is a large 36-membered non-polyene macrolide lactone exclusively produced by Saccharomonospora azurea. This study provides information about strain dependent primycin production ability in conjunction with the structural, functional and comparative genomic examinations. Comparison of high- and low-primycin producer strains, transcriptomic analysis identified a total of 686 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), classified into diverse Cluster of Orthologous Groups. Among them, genes related to fatty acid synthesis, self-resistance, regulation of secondary metabolism and agmatinase encoding gene responsible for catalyze conversion between guanidino/amino forms of primycin were discussed. Based on in silico data mining methods, we were able to identify DEGs whose altered expression provide a good starting point for the optimization of fermentation processes, in order to perform targeted strain improvement and rational drug design.", "Electronic supplementary material", "The online version of this article (10.1007/s11274-020-02935-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."]
