Myxobacteria feature unique biological characteristics, including their capability to glide on the surface, undergo different multicellular developmental stages and produce structurally unique natural products such as the catecholate-type siderophores myxochelins A and B. Herein, we report the isolation, structure elucidation and a proposed biosynthesis of the new congener myxochelin B-succinate from the terrestrial myxobacterial strain MSr12020, featuring a succinyl decoration at its primary amine group. Myxochelin-B-succinate exhibited antibacterial growth inhibition and moderate cytotoxic activity against selected human cancer cell lines. This unique chemical modification of myxochelin B might provide interesting insights for future microbiological studies to understand the biological function and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite succinylation.
