Gliotoxin (GT) is a mycotoxin produced by some species of ascomycete fungi
including the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus
fumigatus. In order to produce GT the host organism needs to have
evolved a self-protection mechanism. GT contains a redox-cycling disulfide
bridge that is important in mediating toxicity. Recently is has been
demonstrated that A. fumigatus possesses a novel
thiomethyltransferase protein called GtmA that has the ability to thiomethylate
GT in vivo, which aids the organism in regulating GT
biosynthesis. It has been suggested that thiomethylation of GT and similar
sulfur-containing toxins may play a role in providing self-protection in host
organisms. In this work we have engineered Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, a GT-na√Øve organism, to express A.
fumigatus GtmA. We demonstrate that GtmA can readily thiomethylate
GT in yeast, which results in protection of the organism from exogenous GT. Our
work has implications for understanding the evolution of GT self-protection
mechanisms in organisms that are GT producers and non-producers.
