 Surfactin, as one of the most powerful
biosurfactants, can be widely
applied in agriculture, food, and pharmaceutics. However, low biosynthesis
efficiency is the major obstacle in its commercialization. Here, we
used nanoparticles to increase the surfactin production in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MT45 through enhancing
the secretion (the key step of surfactin biosynthesis). The results
showed that the surfactin titer increased from 4.93 to 7.15 g/L in
the flask and from 5.94 to 9.18 g/L in a 7 L bioreactor by adding
5 g/L Fe nanoparticles. They were the highest titers in the reported
wild-type strain. Our results indicated that Fe nanoparticles enhanced
the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin.
Moreover, Fe nanoparticles increased the permeability of cell membranes,
resulting in a more efficient secretion of surfactin. This study provides
an efficient strategy for increasing the biosynthesis of microbial
metabolites and provides new insights into the nanoparticlesâ€™
impacts on microbes.
