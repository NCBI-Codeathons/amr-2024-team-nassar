Summary Intracellular microorganisms, like viruses, bacteria, and fungi, pose challenges in detection due to their non-culturable forms. Transcriptomic analysis at cellular level enables exploration of distributions and the impact of these microorganisms on host cells, a domain that remains underexplored because of methodological limitations. Single-cell technology shows promise in addressing this by capturing polyadenine-tailed transcripts, because recent studies confirmed polyadenylation in microbial transcriptomes. We utilized single-cell RNA-seq from PBMCs to probe intracellular microbes in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-positive, and recovered individuals. Among 76 bacterial species detected, 16 showed significant abundance differences. Buchnera aphidicola, Streptomyces clavuligerus, and Ehrlichia canis emerged significantly in memory-B, Naïve-T, and Treg cells. Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma mycoides, Leptospira interrogans, and others displayed elevated levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, suggesting possible disease association. This highlights the strength of single-cell technology in revealing potential microorganism’s cell-specific functions. Further research is essential for functional understanding of their cell-specific abundance across physiological states.
