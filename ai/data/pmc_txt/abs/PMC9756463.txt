Background Antarctica has one of the most extreme environments in the world. This region is inhabited by specifically adapted microorganisms that produce various unique secondary metabolites (e.g. pigments) enabling their survival under the harsh environmental conditions. It was already shown that these natural, biologically active molecules may find application in various fields of biotechnology. Results In this study, a cold-active brown-pigment-producing Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H4 strain was characterized. In-depth genomic analysis combined with the application of a fosmid expression system revealed two different pathways of melanin-like compounds biosynthesis by the ANT_H4 strain. The chromatographic behavior and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analyses allowed for the identification of the extracted melanin-like compound as a pyomelanin. Furthermore, optimization of the production and thorough functional analyses of the pyomelanin were performed to test its usability in biotechnology. It was confirmed that ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin increases the sun protection factor, enables scavenging of free radicals, and interacts with the iron from minerals. Moreover, it was shown for the first time that pyomelanin exhibits priming properties toward Calendula officinalis hairy roots in in vitro cultures. Conclusions Results of the study indicate the significant biotechnological potential of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin and open opportunities for future applications. Taking into account protective features of analyzed pyomelanin it may be potentially used in medical biotechnology and cosmetology. Especially interesting was showing that pyomelanin exhibits priming properties toward hairy roots, which creates a perspective for its usage for the development of novel and sustainable agrotechnical solutions.
