Aurantinins (ARTs) are antibacterial polyketides featuring a unique 6/7/8/5-fused tetracyclic ring system and a triene side chain with a carboxyl terminus. Here we identify the art gene cluster and dissect ARTâ€™s C-methyl incorporation patterns to study its biosynthesis. During this process, an apparently redundant methyltransferase Art28 was characterized as a malonyl-acyl carrier protein O-methyltransferase, which represents an unusual on-line methyl esterification initiation strategy for polyketide biosynthesis. The methyl ester bond introduced by Art28 is kept until the last step of ART biosynthesis, in which it is hydrolyzed by Art9 to convert inactive ART 9B to active ART B. The cryptic reactions catalyzed by Art28 and Art9 represent a protecting group biosynthetic logic to render the ART carboxyl terminus inert to unwanted side reactions and to protect producing organisms from toxic ART intermediates. Further analyses revealed a wide distribution of this initiation strategy for polyketide biosynthesis in various bacteria. Aurantinins are polyketides with unusual connectivities and broad antibacterial activity. Here the authors show the biosynthesis of aurantinins, which proceeds via an on-line methyl esterification at the terminus that enables the iterative chain elongations prior to condensation and cyclization.
