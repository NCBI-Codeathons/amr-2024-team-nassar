The balance between anabolism and catabolism is disrupted with aging, with the rate of anabolism being faster than that of catabolism. Therefore, mTOR, whose major function is to enhance anabolism and inhibit catabolism, has become a potential target of inhibition for anti-aging therapy. Interestingly, it was found that the downregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway had a lifespan-extending effect resembling calorie restriction. In addition, the mTOR signaling pathway promotes cell proliferation and has been regarded as a potential anti-cancer target. Rapamycin and rapalogs, such as everolimus, have proven to be effective in preventing certain tumor growth. Here, we reviewed the basic knowledge of mTOR signaling, including both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Then, for anti-aging, we cited a lot of evidence to discuss the role of targeting mTOR and its anti-aging mechanism. For cancer therapy, we also discussed the role of mTOR signaling in different types of cancers, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tumor immunity, etc. In short, we discussed the research progress and both the advantages and disadvantages of targeting mTOR in anti-aging and anti-cancer therapy. Hopefully, this review may promote more ideas to be generated for developing inhibitors of mTOR signaling to fight cancer and extend lifespan.
