 The bleomycin (BLM) family of glycopeptide-derived
antitumor antibiotics
consists of BLMs, tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycins (PLMs), and zorbamycin
(ZBM). The self-resistant elements BlmB and TlmB, discovered from
the BLM- and TLM-producing organisms Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94
ATCC31158, respectively, are N-acetyltransferases
that provide resistance to the producers by disrupting the metal-binding
domain of the antibiotics required for activity. Although each member
of the BLM family of antibiotics possesses a conserved metal-binding
domain, the structural differences between each member, namely, the
bithiazole moiety and C-terminal amine of BLMs, have been suggested
to instill substrate specificity within BlmB. Here we report that
BlmB and TlmB readily accept and acetylate BLMs, TLMs, PLMs, and ZBM in vitro but only in the metal-free forms. Kinetic analysis
of BlmB and TlmB reveals there is no strong preference or rate enhancement
for specific substrates, indicating that the structural differences
between each member of the BLM family play a negligible role in substrate
recognition, binding, or catalysis. Intriguingly, the zbm gene cluster from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892
does not contain an N-acetyltransferase, yet ZBM
is readily acetylated by BlmB and TlmB. We subsequently established
that S. flavoviridis lacks the homologue of BlmB
and TlmB, and ZbmA, the ZBM-binding protein, alone is sufficient to
provide ZBM resistance. We further confirmed that BlmB can indeed
confer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases the level of resistance.
