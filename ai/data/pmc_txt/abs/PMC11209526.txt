Fusarium verticillioides produces fumonisins, which are mycotoxins inhibiting sphingolipid biosynthesis in humans, animals, and other eukaryotes. Fumonisins are presumed virulence factors of plant pathogens, but may also play a role in interactions between competing fungi. We observed higher resistance to added fumonisin B1 (FB1) in fumonisin-producing Fusarium verticillioides than in nonproducing F. graminearum, and likewise between isolates of Aspergillus and Alternaria differing in production of sphinganine-analog toxins. It has been reported that in F. verticillioides, ceramide synthase encoded in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster is responsible for self-resistance. We reinvestigated the role of FUM17 and FUM18 by generating a double mutant strain in a fum1 background. Nearly unchanged resistance to added FB1 was observed compared to the parental fum1 strain. A recently developed fumonisin-sensitive baker’s yeast strain allowed for the testing of candidate ceramide synthases by heterologous expression. The overexpression of the yeast LAC1 gene, but not LAG1, increased fumonisin resistance. High-level resistance was conferred by FUM18, but not by FUM17. Likewise, strong resistance to FB1 was caused by overexpression of the presumed F. verticillioides “housekeeping” ceramide synthases CER1, CER2, and CER3, located outside the fumonisin cluster, indicating that F. verticillioides possesses a redundant set of insensitive targets as a self-resistance mechanism.
