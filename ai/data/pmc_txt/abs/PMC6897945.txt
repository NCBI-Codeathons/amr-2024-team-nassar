Antibiotic-producing microorganism can develop strategies to deal with self-toxicity. Cytorhodins X and Y, cosmomycins A and B, and iremycin, are produced as final products from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666. These C-7 reduced metabolites show reduced antimicrobial and comparable cytotoxic activities relative to their C-7 glycosylated counterparts. However, the biosynthetic mechanisms and relevant enzymes that drive C-7 reduction in cytorhodin biosynthesis have not yet been characterized. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a reductase, CytA, that mediates C-7 reduction of this anthracycline scaffold; CytA endows the producer Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666 with a means of protecting itself from the effects of its anthracycline products. Additionally, we identified cosmomycins C and D as two intermediates involved in cytorhodin biosynthesis and we also broadened the substrate specificity of CytA to clinically used anthracycline drugs. Chun Gui et al. identify CytA, a reductase involved in C-7 reduction during the biosynthesis of cytorhodin, as an anthracycline antibiotic. This study suggests that CytA may protect its producer bacteria by inactivating anthracycline drugs.
