During a screening for antifungal secondary metabolites, six new mono-/bis-alkenoic acid derivatives (2–7) and one known alkenoic acid derivative (1) were isolated from an endophytic fungi Scopulariopsis candelabrum. Their chemical structures were identified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 2D NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry, as well as comparisons with previously reported literatures. Among them, fusariumesters C‒F (2–5) are bis-alkenoic acid derivatives dimerized by an ester bond, while acetylfusaridioic acid A (6) and fusaridioic acid D (7) are alkenoic acid monomers. All the isolates were submitted to an antifungal assay against Candida albicans and the corn pathogen Exserohilum turcicum using the filter paper agar diffusion method. As a result, only compound 1 decorating with β-lactone ring turned out to be active against these two tested fungi. The broth microdilution assay against Candida albicans showed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 1 to be 20 μg/ml, while the minimum inhibitory concentration value of the positive control (naystatin) was 10 μg/ml. And the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value (21.23 μg/ml) of 1 against Exserohilum turcicum was determined by analyzing its inhibition effect on the mycelial growth, using cycloheximide (IC50 = 46.70 μg/ml) as the positive control.
