Abstract Many microbial secondary metabolites have been studied for decades primarily because of their antimicrobial properties. However, several of these metabolites also possess nonantimicrobial functions, both influencing the physiology of the producer and their ecological neighbors. An example of a versatile bacterial secondary metabolite with multiple functions is the tropone derivative tropodithietic acid (TDA). TDA is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound produced by several members of the Rhodobacteraceae family, a major marine bacterial lineage, within the genera Phaeobacter, Tritonibacter, and Pseudovibrio. The production of TDA is governed by the mode of growth and influenced by the availability of nutrient sources. The antibacterial effect of TDA is caused by disruption of the proton motive force of target microorganisms and, potentially, by its iron-chelating properties. TDA also acts as a signaling molecule, affecting gene expression in other bacteria, and altering phenotypic traits such as motility, biofilm formation, and antibiotic production in the producer. In microbial communities, TDA-producing bacteria cause a reduction of the relative abundance of closely related species and some fast-growing heterotrophic bacteria. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the chemical ecology of TDA, including the environmental niches of TDA-producing bacteria, and the molecular mechanisms governing the function and regulation of TDA. Review of the multiple roles and functions of the secondary metabolite, tropodithietic acid, produced by some marine Rhodobacteraceae.
