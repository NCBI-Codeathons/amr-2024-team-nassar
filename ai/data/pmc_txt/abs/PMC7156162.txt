COVID-19 is spreading fast with an increasing number of infected patients worldwide. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19. The specific mechanism of the virus remains unknown, and specific drugs for the virus have not been developed to date. COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak to be a global public health emergency. Currently, the research on SARS-CoV-2 is in its primary stages. Based on current published evidence, this review systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19. It is hoped that this review will help the public to recognize and deal with SARS-CoV-2, and provide a reference for future studies.
