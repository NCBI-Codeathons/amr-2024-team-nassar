Regulatory RNAs control a number of physiological processes in bacterial cells. Here we report on a 6S-like RNA transcript (scr3559) that affects both development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor. Its expression is enhanced during the transition to stationary phase. Strains that over-expressed the scr3559 gene region exhibited a shortened exponential growth phase in comparison with a control strain; accelerated aerial mycelium formation and spore maturation; alongside an elevated production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. These observations were supported by LC-MS analyses of other produced metabolites, including: germicidins, desferrioxamines, and coelimycin. A subsequent microarray differential analysis revealed increased expression of genes associated with the described morphological and physiological changes. Structural and functional similarities between the scr3559 transcript and 6S RNA, and its possible employment in regulating secondary metabolite production are discussed.
