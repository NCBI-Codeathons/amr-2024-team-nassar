Abstract A list of our research achievements on multiple aminoglycoside antibiotic (AG) resistance in AG-producing actinomycetes is outlined. In 1979, the author discovered a novel AG (istamycin)-producing Streptomyces tenjimariensis SS-939 by screening actinomycetes with kanamycin (KM)-resistance and plasmid profiles. This discovery directed our biochemical and genetic approaches to multiple AG resistance (AGR) of AG producers. In this article, the following discoveries will be outlined: (1) AGR profiles correlating with the productivity of AGs in AG-producers, (2) Wide distribution of multiple AG resistance in AG-nonproducing actinomycetes, (3) Involvement of ribosomal resistance and AG-acetylating enzymes as underlying AGR factors, (4) Activation by single nucleotide substitution of a silent gene coding for aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase, AAC(3), in S. griseus, (5) Discovery of a novel antibiotic indolizomycin through protoplast fusion treatment between S. tenjimariensis and S. griseus strains with different AGR phenotypes, and (6) Double stage-acting activity of arbekacin (ABK; an anti-MRSA semisynthetic AG) discovered by acetylation of ABK with cloned AACs; that is both ABK and its acetylated derivatives showed remarkable antibiotic activities.
