The human gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin is a possible key driver of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Understanding colibactinâ€™s biological effects remains difficult owing to the instability of the proposed active species and the complexity of the gut microbiota. Here, we report small molecule boronic acid inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis. Designed to mimic the biosynthetic precursor precolibactin, these compounds potently inhibit the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP. Using biochemical assays and crystallography, we show that they engage the ClbP binding pocket, forming a covalent bond with the catalytic serine. These inhibitors reproduce the phenotypes observed in a clbP deletion mutant and block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on eukaryotic cells. The availability of ClbP inhibitors will allow precise, temporal control over colibactin production, enabling further study of its contributions to CRC. Finally, application of our inhibitors to related peptidase-encoding pathways highlights the power of chemical tools to probe natural product biosynthesis.  A substrate-guided design strategy generated highly potent inhibitors of the biosynthesis of the genotoxin colibactin by human gut bacteria. These inhibitors also enable a generalizable approach for chemically guided natural product discovery.
