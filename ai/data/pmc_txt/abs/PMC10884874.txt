Abstract Among the plant‐associated microorganisms, the so‐called endophytes continue to attract much attention because of their ability not only to protect host plants from biotic and abiotic stress factors, but also the potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. The latter property can elicit growth‐promoting effects on plants, as well as boost the production of plant‐specific secondary metabolites with valuable pharmacological properties. In addition, endophyte‐derived secondary metabolites may be a rich source for the discovery of drugs to treat various diseases, including infections and cancer. However, the full potential of endophytes to produce bioactive secondary metabolites is often not revealed upon conventional cultivation in the laboratory. New advances in genomics and metabolic engineering offer exciting opportunities for the exploration and exploitation of endophytes' biosynthetic potential. This review focuses on bacterial endophytes of medicinal plants, some of their secondary metabolites and recent advances in deciphering their biosynthesis. The latter may assist in genetic engineering efforts aimed at the discovery of novel bioactive compounds with the potential to be developed into drugs. Bacteria dwelling within tissues of medicinal plants, the so‐called endophytes, represent a unique source of secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities. Modern approaches such as “genome mining” and metabolic engineering provide new opportunities for revealing the biosynthetic potential of bacterial endophytes and assisting in identification of novel compounds which may fuel drug discovery pipelines.
