Many Plant extracts had proved a potential antifungal activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of the aqueous extracts of Rumex vesicarius L. and Ziziphus spina-christi (L) Desf. against some fungal species. The effect on growth inhibition, conidia germination, sporogenesis, morphological, and ultrastructural characterizations of fungal growth by scanning and transmission electron microscopes, have been investigated. Both plant extracts exhibited an antifungal activity against Fusarium, Helminthosporium, Alternaria, and Rhizoctonia species, besides, the sporogenesis of Alternaria and Fusarium species was suppressed. Both plants induced severe morphological changes in the hyphal shape and surface. We concluded that the aqueous extracts of these plants had strong antifungal activities. More investigations should be performed to evaluate the possible applications in agriculture and in vivo.
