DNA polymerase III sliding clamp (DnaN) was recently validated as a new anti-tuberculosis target employing griselimycins. Three (2 S,4 R)−4-methylproline moieties of methylgriselimycin play significant roles in target binding and metabolic stability. Here, we identify the mycoplanecin biosynthetic gene cluster by genome mining using bait genes from the 4-methylproline pathway. We isolate and structurally elucidate four mycoplanecins comprising scarce homo-amino acids and 4-alkylprolines. Evaluating mycoplanecin E against Mycobacterium tuberculosis surprisingly reveals an excitingly low minimum inhibition concentration at 83 ng/mL, thus outcompeting griselimycin by approximately 24-fold. We show that mycoplanecins bind DnaN with nanomolar affinity and provide a co-crystal structure of mycoplanecin A-bound DnaN. Additionally, we reconstitute the biosyntheses of the unusual l-homoleucine, l-homonorleucine, and (2 S,4 R)−4-ethylproline building blocks by characterizing in vitro the full set of eight enzymes involved. The biosynthetic study, bioactivity evaluation, and drug target validation of mycoplanecins pave the way for their further development to tackle multidrug-resistant mycobacterial infections. Mycoplanecins show promising activity against tuberculosis. Here, the authors identify and study mycoplanecins’ biosynthesis, antibacterial effects, and binding mechanism to DnaN, suggesting potential for fighting multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
