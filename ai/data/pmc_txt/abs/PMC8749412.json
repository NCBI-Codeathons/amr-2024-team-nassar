["ABSTRACT", "Antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat to human health. A direct link has been established between antimicrobial self-resistance determinants of antibiotic producers, environmental bacteria, and clinical pathogens. Natural odilorhabdins (ODLs) constitute a new family of 10-mer linear cationic peptide antibiotics inhibiting bacterial translation by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome. These bioactive secondary metabolites are produced by entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus (Morganellaceae), vectored by the soil-dwelling nematodes. ODL-producing Xenorhabdus nematophila symbionts have mechanisms of self-protection. In this study, we cloned the 44.5-kb odl biosynthetic gene cluster (odl-BGC) of the symbiont by recombineering and showed that the N-acetyltransferase-encoding gene, oatA, is responsible for ODL resistance. In vitro acetylation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed that OatA targeted the side chain amino group of ODL rare amino acids, leading to a loss of translation inhibition and antibacterial properties. Functional, genomic, and phylogenetic analyses of oatA revealed an exclusive cis-link to the odilorhabdin BGC, found only in X. nematophila and a specific phylogenetic clade of Photorhabdus. This work highlights the coevolution of antibiotic production and self-resistance as ancient features of this unique tripartite complex of host-vector-symbiont interactions without odl-BGC dissemination by lateral gene transfer."]
