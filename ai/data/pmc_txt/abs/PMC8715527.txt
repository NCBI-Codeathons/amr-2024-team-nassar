Host-pathogen intectarions are complex, involving large dynamic changes in gene expression through the process of infection. These interactions are essential for understanding anti-infective immunity as well as pathogenesis. In this study, the host-pathogen interaction was analyzed using a model of acute infection where channel catfish were infected with Yersinia ruckeri. The infected fish showed signs of body surface hyperemia as well as hyperemia and swelling in the trunk kidney. Double RNA sequencing was performed on trunk kidneys extracted from infected channel catfish and transcriptome data was compared with data from uninfected trunk kidneys. Results revealed that the host-pathogen interaction was dynamically regulated and that the host-pathogen transcriptome fluctuated during infection. More specifically, these data revealed that the expression levels of immune genes involved in Cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling and other immune-related pathways were significantly upregulated. Y. ruckeri mainly promote pathogenesis through the flagellum gene fliC in channel catfish. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package was used to reveal that the infection of catfish is closely related to metabolic pathways. This study contributes to the understanding of the host-pathogen interaction between channel catfish and Y. ruckeri, more specifically how catfish respond to infection through a transcriptional perspective and how this infection leads to enteric red mouth disease (ERM) in these fish.
