 Myxobacteria are
a prolific source of secondary metabolites with
sheer chemical complexity, intriguing biosynthetic enzymology, and
diverse biological activities. In this study, we report the discovery,
biosynthesis, biomimetic total synthesis, physiological function,
structureâ€“activity relationship, and self-resistance mechanism
of the 5-methylated pyrazinone coralinone from a myxobacterium Corallococcus exiguus SDU70. A single NRPS/PKS gene corA was genetically and biochemically demonstrated to orchestrate
coralinone, wherein the integral PKS part is responsible for installing
the 5-methyl group. Intriguingly, coralinone exacerbated cellular
aggregation of myxobacteria grown in liquid cultures by enhancing
the secretion of extracellular matrix, and the 5-methylation is indispensable
for the alleged activity. We provided an evolutionary landscape of
the corA-associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)
distributed in the myxobacterial realm, revealing the divergent evolution
for the diversity-oriented biosynthesis of 5-alkyated pyrazinones.
This phylogenetic contextualization provoked us to identify corB located in the proximity of corA as
a self-resistance gene. CorB was experimentally verified to be a protease
that hydrolyzes extracellular proteins to antagonize the agglutination-inducing
effect of coralinone. Overall, we anticipate these findings will provide
new insights into the chemical ecology of myxobacteria and lay foundations
for the maximal excavation of these largely underexplored resources. corA autonomously codes
for 5-methylated
pyrazinone that promotes secretion of extracellular matrix to induce
agglutination of myxobacteria, and corB encoding
a protease is the self-resistance gene.
