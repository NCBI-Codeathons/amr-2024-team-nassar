Background Identifying orthologs continues to be an early and imperative step in genome analysis but remains a challenging problem. While synteny (conservation of gene order) has previously been used independently and in combination with other methods to identify orthologs, applying synteny in ortholog identification has yet to be automated in a user-friendly manner. This desire for automation and ease-of-use led us to develop OrthoRefine, a standalone program that uses synteny to refine ortholog identification. Results We developed OrthoRefine to improve the detection of orthologous genes by implementing a look-around window approach to detect synteny. We tested OrthoRefine in tandem with OrthoFinder, one of the most used software for identification of orthologs in recent years. We evaluated improvements provided by OrthoRefine in several bacterial and a eukaryotic dataset. OrthoRefine efficiently eliminates paralogs from orthologous groups detected by OrthoFinder. Using synteny increased specificity and functional ortholog identification; additionally, analysis of BLAST e-value, phylogenetics, and operon occurrence further supported using synteny for ortholog identification. A comparison of several window sizes suggested that smaller window sizes (eight genes) were generally the most suitable for identifying orthologs via synteny. However, larger windows (30 genes) performed better in datasets containing less closely related genomes. A typical run of OrthoRefine with ~ 10 bacterial genomes can be completed in a few minutes on a regular desktop PC. Conclusion OrthoRefine is a simple-to-use, standalone tool that automates the application of synteny to improve ortholog detection. OrthoRefine is particularly efficient in eliminating paralogs from orthologous groups delineated by standard methods.
