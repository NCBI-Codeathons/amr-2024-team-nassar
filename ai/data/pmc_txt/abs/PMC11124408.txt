Surfactin is widely used in the petroleum extraction, cosmetics, biopharmaceuticals and agriculture industries. It possesses antibacterial and antiviral activities and can reduce interfacial tension. Bacillus are commonly used as production chassis, but wild-type Bacillus subtilis 168 cannot synthesise surfactin. In this study, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene sfp* (with a T base removed) was overexpressed and enzyme activity was restored, enabling B. subtilis 168 to synthesise surfactin with a yield of 747.5 ± 6.5 mg/L. Knocking out ppsD and yvkC did not enhance surfactin synthesis. Overexpression of predicted surfactin transporter gene yfiS increased its titre to 1060.7 ± 89.4 mg/L, while overexpression of yerP, ycxA and ycxA-efp had little or negative effects on surfactin synthesis, suggesting YfiS is involved in surfactin efflux. By replacing the native promoter of the srfA operon encoding surfactin synthase with three promoters, surfactin synthesis was significantly reduced. However, knockout of the global transcriptional regulator gene codY enhanced the surfactin titre to 1601.8 ± 91.9 mg/L. The highest surfactin titre reached 3.89 ± 0.07 g/L, with the yield of 0.63 ± 0.02 g/g DCW, after 36 h of fed-batch fermentation in 5 L fermenter. This study provides a reference for further understanding surfactin synthesis and constructing microbial cell factories.
