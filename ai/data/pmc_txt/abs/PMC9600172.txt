ABSTRACT The antibiotic desertomycin A and its previously undescribed inactive N-succinylated analogue, desertomycin X, were isolated from Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038. Genome sequencing and analysis readily identified the desertomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), which lacked genes encoding acyltransferases that would account for desertomycin X formation. Scouting the genome for putative N-acyltransferase genes led to the identification of a candidate within a cryptic siderophore BGC (csb) encoding a putative homologue of the N6â€²-hydroxylysine acetyltransferase IucB. Expression of the codon-optimized gene designated csbC in Escherichia coli yielded the recombinant protein that was able to N-succinylate desertomycin A as well as several other structurally distinct antibiotics harboring amino groups. Some antibiotics were rendered antibiotically inactive due to the CsbC-catalyzed succinylation in vitro. Unlike many known N-acyltransferases involved in antibiotic resistance, CsbC could not efficiently acetylate the same antibiotics. When expressed in E. coli, CsbC provided low-level resistance to kanamycin and ampicillin, suggesting that it may play a role in antibiotic resistance in natural habitats, where the concentration of antibiotics is usually low.
