Chrysomycin A is one of the most promising therapeutic candidates for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. By hybridizing next-step generation (Illumina) and third-generation (PacBio) sequencing technologies, a high-quality chromosome-level genome together with a plasmid was firstly assembled for chrysomycin A-producing marine strain 891. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences revealed that this strain unambiguously belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and its genomic features and functional genes were comprehensively analyzed and annotated. AntiSMASH analysis of this strain unveiled one key biosynthetic gene cluster, T2PKS, responsible for the biosynthesis of chrysomycin, the biosynthesis pathway of which was putatively proposed. These findings definitely shed light on further investigation for construction of a robust industrial strain with high-yield chrysomycin A production using genetic engineering techniques and combinatorial biology approaches.
