A novel approach targeting self-inducible surfactin synthesis under oxygen-limited conditions is presented. Because both the nitrate (NarGHI) and nitrite (NasDE) reductase are highly expressed during anaerobic growth of B. subtilis, the native promoter PsrfA of the surfactin operon in strain B. subtilis JABs24 was replaced by promoters PnarG and PnasD to induce surfactin synthesis anaerobically. Shake flask cultivations with varying oxygen availabilities indicated no significant differences in native PsrfA expression. As hypothesized, activity of PnarG and PnasD increased with lower oxygen levels and surfactin was not produced by PsrfA::PnarG as well as PsrfA::PnasD mutant strains under conditions with highest oxygen availability. PnarG showed expressions similar to PsrfA at lowest oxygen availability, while maximum value of PnasD was more than 5.5-fold higher. Although the promoter exchange PsrfA::PnarG resulted in a decreased surfactin titer at lowest oxygen availability, the strain carrying PsrfA::PnasD reached a 1.4-fold increased surfactin concentration with 696 mg/L and revealed an exceptional high overall YP/X of 1.007 g/g. This value also surpassed the YP/X of the reference strain JABs24 at highest and moderate oxygen availability. Bioreactor cultivations illustrated that significant cell lysis occurred when the process of “anaerobization” was performed too fast. However, processes with a constantly low agitation and aeration rate showed promising potential for process improvement, especially by employing the strain carrying PsrfA::PnasD promoter exchange. Additionally, replacement of other native promoters by nitrite reductase promoter PnasD represents a promising tool for anaerobic-inducible bioprocesses in Bacillus.
