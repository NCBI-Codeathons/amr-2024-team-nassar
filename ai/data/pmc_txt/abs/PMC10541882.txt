In Lyme borreliosis, the skin constitutes a major interface for the host, the bacteria and the tick. Skin immunity is provided by specialized immune cells but also by the resident cells: the keratinocytes and the fibroblasts. Discoveries on the role of the microbiome in the modulation of skin inflammation and immunity have reinforced the potential importance of the skin in vector-borne diseases. In this study, we analyzed in vitro the interaction of human primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto N40 in presence or absence of bacterial commensal supernatants. We aimed to highlight the role of resident skin cells and skin microbiome on the inflammation induced by B. burgdorferi s.s.. The secretomes of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium striatum and Cutibacterium acnes showed an overall increase in the expression of IL-8, CXCL1, MCP-1 and SOD-2 by fibroblasts, and of IL-8, CXCL1, MCP-1 and hBD-2 in the undifferentiated keratinocytes. Commensal bacteria showed a repressive effect on the expression of IL-8, CXCL1 and MCP-1 by differentiated keratinocytes. Besides the inflammatory effect observed in the presence of Borrelia on all cell types, the cutaneous microbiome appears to promote a rapid innate response of resident skin cells during the onset of Borrelia infection.
