Abstract A nonenzymatic Pictet‐Spengler reaction has been postulated to give rise to a subset of naturally occurring uridyl peptide antibiotics (UPAs). Here, using a combination of strain engineering and synthetic chemistry, we demonstrate that Pictet‐Spengler chemistry may be employed to generate even greater diversity in the UPAs. We use an engineered strain to afford access to meta‐tyrosine containing pacidamycin 4. Pictet‐Spengler diversification of this compound using a small series of aryl‐aldehydes was achieved with some derivatives affording remarkable diastereomeric control. Beyond the natural: We demonstrate the importance of the N terminus to pacidamycin bioactivity. Incorporating meta‐tyrosine at the N‐terminal facilitates diversification of pacidamycins enabling use of Pictet‐Spengler chemistry and may enable the attenuation of compound activity.
