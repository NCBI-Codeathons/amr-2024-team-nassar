Abstract Flow cytometry has made a significant contribution to the study of several complex fundamental mechanisms in plant cytogenetics, becoming a useful analytical tool to understand several mechanisms and processes underlying plant growth, development, and function. In this study, the genome size, DNA ploidy level, and A-T/G-C ratio were measured for the first time for two genotypes of chia, Salvia hispanica, an herbaceous plant commonly used in phytotherapy and nutrition. This study also evaluated, for the first time by flow cytometry, the capacity to produce organic acids of tissues stained with LysoTracker Deep Red after elicitation with either yeast extract or cadmium chloride. Rosmarinic acid content differed between the two chia varieties treated with different elicitor concentrations, compared with non-elicited plant material. Elicited tissues of both varieties contained a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with non-elicited cultures, and cadmium chloride at 500 μM was much better than that at 1000 μM, which led to plant death. For both genotypes, a dose-response was observed with yeast extract, as the higher the concentration of elicitor used, the higher rosmarinic acid content, resulting also in better results and a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with cadmium chloride. This study demonstrates that flow cytometry may be used as a taxonomy tool, to distinguish among very close genotypses of a given species and, for the first time in plants, that this approach can also be put to profit for a characterization of the cytoplasmic acid phase and the concomitant production of secondary metabolites of interest in vitro, with or without elicitation. Key points • Genome size, ploidy level, A-T/G-C ratio, and cytoplasm acid phase of S. hispanica • Cytometry study of cytoplasm acid phase of LysoTracker Deep Red-stained plant cells • Yeast extract or cadmium chloride elicited rosmarinic acid production of chia tissues Graphical Abstract  Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00253-024-13171-w.
