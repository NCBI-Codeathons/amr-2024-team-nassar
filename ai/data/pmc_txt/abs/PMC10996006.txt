 The rapid development
of antibiotic resistance, especially among
difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria, is recognized as a serious
and urgent threat to public health. The detection and characterization
of novel resistance mechanisms are essential to better predict the
spread and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Corramycin is a novel
and modified peptidic antibiotic with activity against several Gram-negative
pathogens. We demonstrate that the kinase ComG, part of the corramycin
biosynthetic gene cluster, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates
corramycin, leading to the resistance of the host. Remarkably, we
found that the closest structural homologues of ComG are aminoglycoside
phosphotransferases; however, ComG shows no activity toward this class
of antibiotics. The crystal structure of ComG in complex with corramycin
reveals that corramycin adopts a Î²-hairpin-like structure and
allowed us to define the changes leading to a switch in substrate
from sugar to peptide. Bioinformatic analyses suggest a limited occurrence
of ComG-like proteins, which along with the absence of cross-resistance
to clinically used drugs positions corramycin as an attractive antibiotic
for further development.
