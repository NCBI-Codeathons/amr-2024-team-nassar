 Over
the past 30 years, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of
infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which have proliferated
due to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Over this same time
period, however, there has also been a decline in the number of antibiotics
with novel mechanisms of action coming to market. Therefore, there
is a growing need for an increase in the speed at which new antibiotics
are discovered and developed. Natural products produced by bacteria
have been and continue to be a robust source of novel antibiotics;
however, new and complementary methods for screening large bacterial
libraries for novel antibiotic production are needed due to the current
agar methods being limited in scope, time consuming, and prone to
error. Herein, we describe a rapid, robust, and quantitative high-throughput
liquid culture screening method for antibiotic production by bacteria.
This method has the ability to screen both mono- and coculture mixtures
of bacteria in vitro and be adapted to other phenotypic
natural product analyses. Over 260 bacterial species were screened
in monoculture, and 38 and 34% were found to produce antibiotics capable
of inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, respectively,
with 8 and 4% being classified as strong producers (â‰¥30% growth
inhibition), respectively. Bacteria found to not produce antibiotics
in monoculture were also screened in coculture using an adaptation
of this method. Of the more than 270 cocultures screened, 14 and 30%
were found to produce antibiotics capable of inhibition of S. aureus or E. coli, respectively. Of those bacteria found to produce antibiotics in
monoculture, 43 bacteria were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and
found to be majority Pseudomonas (37%), Serratia (19%), and Bacillus (14%) bacteria, but two novel
producers, Herbaspirillum and Kluyvera, were also found.
