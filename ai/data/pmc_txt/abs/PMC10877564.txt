 Recent advances in
sequencing techniques unveiled the vast potential
of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides
(RiPPs) encoded in microbiomes. Class I lantibiotics such as nisin
A, widely used as a food preservative, have been investigated for
their efficacy in killing pathogens. However, the impact of nisin
and nisin-like class I lantibiotics on commensal bacteria residing
in the human gut remains unclear. Here, we report six gut-derived
class I lantibiotics that are close homologues of nisin, four of which
are novel. We applied an improved lantibiotic expression platform
to produce and purify these lantibiotics for antimicrobial assays.
We determined their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against
both Gram-positive human pathogens and gut commensals and profiled
the lantibiotic resistance genes in these pathogens and commensals.
Structureâ€“activity relationship (SAR) studies with analogs
revealed key regions and residues that impact their antimicrobial
properties. Our characterization and SAR studies of nisin-like lantibiotics
against both pathogens and human gut commensals could shed light on
the future development of lantibiotic-based therapeutics and food
preservatives.
