The discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928 provided us with access to a new class of compounds useful at fighting bacterial infections: antibiotics. Ever since, a number of studies were carried out to find new molecules with the same activity. Microorganisms belonging to Actinobacteria phylum, the Actinomycetes, were the most important sources of antibiotics. Bioactive compounds isolated from this order were also an important inspiration reservoir for pharmaceutical chemists who realized the synthesis of new molecules with antibiotic activity. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), antibiotic resistance is currently one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development. The world urgently needs to adopt measures to reduce this risk by finding new antibiotics and changing the way they are used. In this review, we describe the primary role of Actinomycetes in the history of antibiotics. Antibiotics produced by these microorganisms, their bioactivities, and how their chemical structures have inspired generations of scientists working in the synthesis of new drugs are described thoroughly.
