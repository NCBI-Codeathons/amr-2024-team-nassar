Abstract  The demand for discovering novel microbial secondary metabolites is growing to address the limitations in bioactivities such as antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anthelmintic, and immunosuppressive functions. Among microbes, the genus Streptomyces holds particular significance for secondary metabolite discovery. Each Streptomyces species typically encodes approximately 30 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs) within its genome, which are mostly uncharacterized in terms of their products and bioactivities. The development of next-generation sequencing has enabled the identification of a large number of potent smBGCs for novel secondary metabolites that are imbalanced in number compared with discovered secondary metabolites. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has revolutionized the translation of enormous genomic potential into the discovery of secondary metabolites as the most efficient genetic engineering tool for Streptomyces. In this review, the current status of CRISPR/Cas applications in Streptomyces is summarized, with particular focus on the identification of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters and their potential applications. This review summarizes the broad range of CRISPR/Cas applications in Streptomyces for natural product discovery and production.
