Abstract Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global problem and threat to humanity. The search for new antibiotics is directed towards targeting of novel microbial systems and enzymes, as well as augmenting the activity of pre-existing antimicrobials. Sulphur-containing metabolites (e.g., auranofin and bacterial dithiolopyrrolones [e.g., holomycin]) and Zn2+-chelating ionophores (PBT2) have emerged as important antimicrobial classes. The sulphur-containing, non-ribosomal peptide gliotoxin, biosynthesised by Aspergillus fumigatus and other fungi exhibits potent antimicrobial activity, especially in the dithiol form (dithiol gliotoxin; DTG). Specifically, it has been revealed that deletion of the enzymes gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT, bis-thiomethyltransferase GtmA or the transporter GliA dramatically sensitise A. fumigatus to gliotoxin presence. Indeed, the double deletion strain A. fumigatus ΔgliTΔgtmA is especially sensitive to gliotoxin-mediated growth inhibition, which can be reversed by Zn2+ presence. Moreover, DTG is a Zn2+ chelator which can eject zinc from enzymes and inhibit activity. Although multiple studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial effect of gliotoxin, no mechanistic details are available. Interestingly, reduced holomycin can inhibit metallo-β-lactamases. Since holomycin and gliotoxin can chelate Zn2+, resulting in metalloenzyme inhibition, we propose that this metal-chelating characteristic of these metabolites requires immediate investigation to identify new antibacterial drug targets or to augment the activity of existing antimicrobials. Given that (i) gliotoxin has been shown in vitro to significantly enhance vancomycin activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) that it has been independently proposed as an ideal probe to dissect the central ‘Integrator’ role of Zn2+ in bacteria – we contend such studies are immediately undertaken to help address AMR.
