The anti-coccidiosis agent salinomycin is a polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces albus BK3-25 with a remarkable titer of 18 g/L at flask scale, suggesting a highly efficient export system. It is worth identifying the involved exporter genes for further titer improvement. In this study, a titer gradient was achieved by varying soybean oil concentrations in a fermentation medium, and the corresponding transcriptomes were studied. Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified eight putative transporter genes, whose transcription increased when the oil content was increased and ranked top among up-regulated genes at higher oil concentrations. All eight genes were proved to be positively involved in salinomycin export through gene deletion and trans-complementation in the mutants, and they showed constitutive expression in the early growth stage, whose overexpression in BK3-25 led to a 7.20â€“69.75% titer increase in salinomycin. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of SLNHY_0929 or SLNHY_1893 rendered the host Streptomyces lividans with improved resistance to salinomycin. Interestingly, SLNHY_0929 was found to be a polyether-specific transporter because the titers of monensin, lasalocid, and nigericin were also increased by 124.6%, 60.4%, and 77.5%, respectively, through its overexpression in the corresponding producing strains. In conclusion, a transcriptome-based strategy was developed to mine genes involved in salinomycin export, which may pave the way for further salinomycin titer improvement and the identification of transporter genes involved in the biosynthesis of other antibiotics.
