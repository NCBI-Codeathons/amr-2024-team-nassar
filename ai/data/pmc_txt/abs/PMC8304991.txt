Bifidobacterium bifidum strains, an important component of probiotic foods, can form biofilms on abiotic surfaces, leading to increased self-resistance. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of B. bifidum biofilm formation. A time series transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis of both B. bifidum biofilm and planktonic cells was performed to identify key genes and metabolites involved in biofilm formation. Two hundred thirty-five nonredundant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (including vanY, pstS, degP, groS, infC, groL, yajC, tadB and sigA) and 219 nonredundant differentially expressed metabolites (including L-threonine, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, ascorbic acid, niacinamide, butyric acid and sphinganine) were identified. Thirteen pathways were identified during the integration of both transcriptomics and metabolomics data, including ABC transporters; quorum sensing; two-component system; oxidative phosphorylation; cysteine and methionine metabolism; glutathione metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis. The DEGs that relate to the integration pathways included asd, atpB, degP, folC, ilvE, metC, pheA, pstS, pyrE, serB, ulaE, yajC and zwf. The differentially accumulated metabolites included L-cystine, L-serine, L-threonine, L-tyrosine, methylmalonate, monodehydroascorbate, nicotinamide, orthophosphate, spermine and tocopherol. These results indicate that quorum sensing, two-component system and amino acid metabolism are essential during B. bifidum biofilm formation.
