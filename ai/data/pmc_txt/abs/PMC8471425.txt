Soil salinization is one of the main abiotic stress factors impacting the growth of crops and the agricultural industry today. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of H2O2 pretreatment on seed germination in Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) seeds under salt stress and to evaluate this species’ salt tolerance. Through the preliminary experiment, this study used 50 mmol L−1 NaCl solution to induce seed stress. After soaking for 12 h in different H2O2 concentrations, seeds were laid in Petri dishes with 50 mmol L−1 NaCl for seven days and the germination parameters and physiological indicators were measured to screen the optimal H2O2 pretreatment concentration and the salt tolerance index. Our results indicated that pretreatment with 5–10 mmol L−1 H2O2 was most effective in alleviating NaCl’s impacts on the seeds’ germination parameters. Furthermore, the growth and material accumulation of seedlings was promoted; catalase, superoxide dismutase activity, and proline content were enhanced; and malondialdehyde content was reduced. Principal component analysis and stepwise regression revealed six key indicators that had a significant impact on the salt tolerance characteristics of F. tataricum, namely, germination potential, shoot fresh weight, root surface area, root average diameter, catalase activity, and superoxide dismutase activity.
