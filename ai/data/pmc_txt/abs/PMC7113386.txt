Bottromycin is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) produced by several streptomycetes, including the plant pathogen Streptomyces scabies. There is significant interest in this molecule as it possesses strong antibacterial activity against clinically relevant multidrug resistant pathogens and is structurally distinct from all other antibiotics. However, studies into its efficacy are hampered by poor yields. An understanding of how bottromycin biosynthesis is regulated could aid the development of strategies to increase titres. Here, we use 5â€²-tag-RNA-seq to identify the transcriptional organization of the gene cluster, which includes an internal transcriptional start site that precedes btmD, the gene that encodes the bottromycin precursor peptide. We show that the gene cluster does not encode a master regulator that controls pathway expression and instead encodes a regulatory gene, btmL, which functions as a modulator that specifically affects the expression of btmD but not genes up- or downstream of btmD. In order to identify non-cluster associated proteins involved in regulation, proteins were identified that bind to the main promoter of the pathway, which precedes btmC. This study provides insights into how this deceptively complex pathway is regulated in the absence of a pathway specific master regulator, and how it might coordinate with the central metabolism of the cell.
