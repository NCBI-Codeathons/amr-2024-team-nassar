Shiraia bambusicola is a species of the monotypic genus Shiraia in the phylum Ascomycota. In China, it is known for its pharmacological properties that are used to treat rheumatic arthritis, sciatica, pertussis, tracheitis and so forth. Its major medicinal active metabolite is hypocrellin A, which exhibits excellent antiviral and antitumor properties. However, the genes involved in the hypocrellin A anabolic pathways were still unknown due to the lack of genomic information for this species. To investigate putative genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and determine the pathway, we performed transcriptome sequencing for Shiraia bambusicola S4201-W and the mutant S4201-D1 for the first time. S4201-W has excellent hypocrellin A production, while the mutant S4201-D1 does not. Then, we obtained 38,056,034 and 39,086,896 clean reads from S4201-W and S4201-D1, respectively. In all, 17,923 unigenes were de novo assembled, and the N50 length was 1970 bp. Based on the negative binomial distribution test, 716 unigenes were found to be upregulated, and 188 genes were downregulated in S4201-D1, compared with S4201-W. We have found seven unigenes involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and proposed a putative hypocrellin A biosynthetic pathway. These data will provide a valuable resource and theoretical basis for future molecular studies of hypocrellin A, help identify the genes involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and help facilitate functional studies for enhancing hypocrellin A production.
