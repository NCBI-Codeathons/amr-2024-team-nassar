Summary The toxoflavin (Txn), broad host range phytotoxin produced by a variety of bacteria, including Burkholderia glumae, is a key pathogenicity factor of B. glumae in rice and field crops. Two bacteria exhibiting Txn‐degrading activity were isolated from healthy rice seeds and identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva and Agrobacterium sp. respectively. The genes stdR and stdA, encoding proteins responsible for Txn degradation of both bacterial isolates, were identical, indicating that horizontal gene transfer occurred between microbial communities in the same ecosystem. We identified a novel Txn‐quenching regulation of bacteria, demonstrating that the LysR‐type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) StdR induces the expression of the stdA, which encodes a Txn‐degrading enzyme, in the presence of Txn as a coinducer. Here we show that the bacterial StdRTxn‐quenching regulatory system mimics the ToxRTxn‐mediated biosynthetic regulation of B. glumae. Substrate specificity investigations revealed that Txn is the only coinducer of StdR and that StdA has a high degree of specificity for Txn. Rice plants expressing StdA showed Txn resistance. Collectively, bacteria mimic the mechanism of Txn biosynthesis regulation, employ it in the development of a Txn‐quenching regulatory system and share it with neighbouring bacteria for survival in rice environments full of Txn. Here we show that the bacterial StdR/Txn‐quenching regulatory system mimics the ToxR/Txn‐mediated biosynthetic regulation of Burkholderia glumae. Schematic of the novel Txn‐quenching gene regulation identified in two Txn‐resistant bacteria, Sphingomonas adhesiva and Agrobacterium sp., isolated from rice seeds. Exogenous Txn (double hexagon shape) binds to StdR, resulting in StdRTxn complex‐dependent activation of the expression of stdA, resulting in Txn quenching.
