 This review focuses entirely on the
natural bengamides and selected
synthetic analogues that have inspired decades of research. Bengamide
A was first reported in 1986 from the sponge Jaspis cf. coriacea, and bengamide-containing sponges
have been gathered from many biogeographic sites. In 2005, a terrestrial
Gram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus virescens, was
added as a source for bengamides. Biological activity data using varying
bengamide-based scaffolds has enabled fine-tuning of structure–activity
relationships. Molecular target finding contributed to the creation
of a synthetic “lead” compound, LAF389, that was the
subject of a phase I anticancer clinical trial. Despite clinical trial
termination, the bengamide compound class is still attracting worldwide
attention. Future breakthroughs based on the bengamide scaffold are
possible and could build on their nanomolar in vitro and positive
in vivo antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties. Bengamide
molecular targets include methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP1 and MetAP2)
and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
(NF-κB). A mixed PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster appears
to be responsible for creation of the bengamides. This review highlights
that the bengamides have driven inspirational studies and that they
will remain relevant for future research, even 30 years after the
discovery of the first structures.
