 Glycopeptide antibiotics
(GPAs) are last defense line drugs against
multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Natural GPAs teicoplanin
and vancomycin, as well as semisynthetic oritavancin, telavancin,
and dalbavancin, are currently approved for clinical use. Although
these antibiotics remain efficient, emergence of novel GPA-resistant
pathogens is a question of time. Therefore, it is important to investigate
the natural variety of GPAs coming from so-called “rare”
actinobacteria. Herein we describe a novel GPA producer—Nonomuraea coxensis DSM 45129. Its de novo sequenced and completely assembled genome harbors a biosynthetic
gene cluster (BGC) similar to the dbv BGC of A40926,
the natural precursor to dalbavancin. The strain produces a novel
GPA, which we propose is an A40926 analogue lacking the carboxyl group
on the N-acylglucosamine moiety. This structural
difference correlates with the absence of dbv29—coding
for an enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the N-acylglucosamine moiety. Introduction of dbv29 into N. coxensis led to A40926 production in this strain.
Finally, we successfully applied dbv3 and dbv4 heterologous transcriptional regulators to trigger
and improve A50926 production in N. coxensis, making them prospective tools for screening other Nonomuraea spp. for GPA production. Our work highlights
genus Nonomuraea as a still untapped
source of novel GPAs.
