Cacaoidin is produced by the strain Streptomyces cacaoi CA-170360 and represents the first member of the new lanthidin (class V lanthipeptides) RiPP family. In this work, we describe the complete identification, cloning and heterologous expression of the cacaoidin biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows unique RiPP genes whose functions were not predicted by any bioinformatic tool. We also describe that the cacaoidin pathway is restricted to strains of the subspecies Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi found in public genome databases, where we have also identified the presence of other putative class V lanthipeptide pathways. This is the first report on the heterologous production of a class V lanthipeptide.
