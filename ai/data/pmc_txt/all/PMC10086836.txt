Abstract Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are fungal secondary metabolites that share a 2,5‐diketopiperazine scaffold built from two amino acids and bridged by a sulfide moiety. Modifications of the core and the amino acid side chains, for example by methylations, acetylations, hydroxylations, prenylations, halogenations, cyclizations, and truncations create the structural diversity of ETPs and contribute to their biological activity. However, the key feature responsible for the bioactivities of ETPs is their sulfide moiety. Over the last years, combinations of genome mining, reverse genetics, metabolomics, biochemistry, and structural biology deciphered principles of ETP production. Sulfurization via glutathione and uncovering of the thiols followed by either oxidation or methylation crystallized as fundamental steps that impact expression of the biosynthesis cluster, toxicity and secretion of the metabolite as well as self‐tolerance of the producer. This article showcases structure and activity of prototype ETPs such as gliotoxin and discusses the current knowledge on the biosynthesis routes of these exceptional natural products. Housing sulfur: Certain fungi produce diketopiperazine compounds with a transannular sulfur bridge. These so‐called epipolythiodioxopiperzines are toxic by non‐specifically interacting with intracellular proteins and contribute to fungal pathogenicity. Producer strains serve as bio‐pesticides but also question safety of food fermentation. Thus, understanding the structure and biosynthesis of these intriguing natural sulfur products is of utmost interest. E. M. Huber, ChemBioChem

The Diketopiperazine Scaffold: Two Become One The Diketopiperazine Scaffold: Two Become One Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are complex natural products that belong to the family of diketopiperazines (DKPs). DKPs, also known as dioxopiperazines, piperazinediones or DKP alkaloids, contain two amide linkages and according to the position of their carbonyl groups, they are designated as 2,3‐, 2,5‐ or 2,6‐isomers. 2,5‐variants are most prominent.

Epipolythiodioxopiperazines: Bridging the Ring Epipolythiodioxopiperazines: Bridging the Ring ETPs are toxic secondary metabolites, exclusively produced by terrestrial and marine fungi. However, the genetic elements required for ETP biosynthesis are discontinuously distributed among fungi.
[23]
 Often, only few of several closely related species are ETP producers, but sometimes even distant relatives can biosynthesize the same ETP. For example, gliotoxin is produced by Aspergillus fumigatus and non‐related Trichoderma, Penicillium or Candida species,
[24]
 but Aspergillus nidulans is a non‐producer.
[25]
 Some ascomycetes (e. g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Candida albicans) or basidiomycetes (e. g. Ustilago maydis and Cryptococcus neoformans) also lack the genetic information for ETP production.

 Although ETPs are not essential for survival, they are considered to confer fungi selective advantages under certain environmental conditions and in competition with other microorganisms. However, experimental evidence for this hypothesis is still missing. In fact, competition experiments with an ETP‐producing strain and a non‐producer did not show any selective advantage.

[26] Structurally, ETPs are compounds with a transannular di‐ or polysulfide bridge. In contrast to disulfide bonds in proteins, the sulfur atoms of ETPs adopt an eclipsed conformation. Despite being strained, the sulfide moiety is stabilized by strong n→π* interactions.
[27]
 ETPs contain at least one aromatic amino acid and are mainly regularly (1,4) bridged, meaning that the sulfur atoms are anchored at the Cα positions of the cyclodipeptide core.[

[29] As reductive agents like dithiothreitol interfere with the biological activity of ETPs, it was proposed that the di‐/polysulfide functionalities are essential for toxicity.
[30]
 The current model of ETP action is that the oxidized form is taken up into cells, reduced by glutathione and consequently trapped. This accumulation is thought to enhance toxicity.

Various studies revealed that ETPs exhibit their toxicity not by targeting a single protein or a specific pathway but rather by various non‐specific interactions of their disulfide moiety with functionally relevant intracellular biomolecules.

] and the mechanism of action remained elusive, although in the meanwhile the binding modes of many other natural and synthetic 20S proteasome inhibitors have been characterized by structural means.
[48]
 In addition, gliotoxin has been reported to inhibit the proteasome from Plasmodium falciparum and has been proposed as a new antimalarial drug,
[49]
 but still the molecular basis of proteasome inhibition remains unknown and the therapeutic potential of gliotoxin in this context was not further pursued. Altogether it is questionable, whether gliotoxin directly inhibits the 20S proteasome or whether the observed inhibition is a secondary effect of for example unspecific protein damage. Only recently, gliotoxin and other ETPs were reported to inhibit Rpn11, a zinc‐dependent deubiquitinating enzyme and an essential component of the 19S regulatory particle of proteasomes responsible for ubiquitin‐mediated protein degradation in cells.

Gliotoxin is also considered as one of several virulence factors of A. fumigatus and assumed to contribute to the pathogenesis of mycoses such as invasive aspergillosis which is a deadly threat for immunocompromised patients.
[63]
 In support of this hypothesis, gliotoxin has been identified in Aspergillus isolates of patients.

 However, the impact of gliotoxin on virulence of A. fumigatus appears to depend on the host and its immune status

[67]
 At the same time, studies on the biosynthesis of gliotoxin were launched. Isotope‐labelling and feeding experiments with T. viride showed that the amino acids Phe and Ser are incorporated into gliotoxin and that Met serves as donor for the N‐methyl group.
[68]
 In 1967, the crystal structure of gliotoxin and its absolute stereochemistry were published (Figure 1),
[69]
 but the biosynthesis remained elusive for half a century. Only after the complete genomic sequence of A. fumigatus had become available in 2005,
[70]
 the gene locus for the production of gliotoxin was predicted
[71]
 based on homology to the previously identified sirodesmin biosynthesis gene cluster (see section 2.1.2.).
[72]
 Twelve genes were assigned to the putative gliotoxin cassette and enzyme functions were predicted according to sequence comparisons.
[71]
 In 2010, a 13th gene was shown to be essential for gliotoxin biosynthesis and hence included in the gli gene locus (Figure 2A).
[66b]
 The putative function of the NRPS gene gliP in formation of the DKP scaffold
[71]
 was confirmed by its disruption.
[73]
 Cloning of the gliP gene and in vitro activity assays finally established that the A1 and A2 domains of the NRPS GliP activate l‐Phe and l‐Ser, respectively,
[74]
 thereby confirming the initial feeding experiments. The slow release of the reaction product from the enzyme was supposed to arise from the lack of a thioesterase domain and led to the hypothesis that downstream processing of the DKP might occur while still being tethered to the NRPS.
[74]
 Today, this on‐line tailoring seems unlikely, as many different intermediates of gliotoxin biosynthesis have been isolated as free metabolites from individual knockout strains.
[75]
 Furthermore, the exceptional domain architecture of GliP was puzzling. Its extra condensation (C) and transfer (T) module (C2‐T3) at the C‐terminus was not expected to be required for dipeptide formation.
[74]
 Later on however, it was noted that fungal cyclic peptides are generally synthesized by NRPS containing a terminal C domain.
[77]
 Subsequently, in vitro and in vivo mutagenesis confirmed that instead of spontaneous cyclization, the DKP core of gliotoxin is cyclized by the action of the extra C2‐T3 unit of GliP.

As with all NRPS, the T domains have to be posttranslationally activated by transfer of a phosphopantetheinyl moiety from coenzyme A onto a conserved serine residue.

[82] Recently, the original mechanistic proposal for activation and sulfur transfer was refined based on the crystal structure of the GliG enzyme in complex with its reaction product, the bis‐glutathionylated DKP.
[83]
 This study revealed that GliG creates a favorable environment to selectively eliminate water from one Cα position of the dihydroxy DKP and subsequently attaches activated GSH to the resulting electrophilic carbon. Although the stereochemistry of the bis‐hydroxylated DKP is not known, the X‐ray structure of GliG implies that release of water and addition of GSH occur from the same side of the DKP. This way a mono‐glutathionylated and at the same time mono‐hydroxylated DKP is produced as an intermediate, which is processed to the bis‐glutathione adduct by repeating the SN1 reaction cascade on the other side of the DKP core.

[86] Upon linkage of the DKP scaffold to two GSH molecules, three sequential enzymatic reactions uncover the free thiols (Figure 2B): In a first step, the γ‐glutamyl‐cyclotransferase GliK cleaves the isopeptide bond in the glutathione moieties by release of 5‐oxoproline.

 The functional importance of GliK for gliotoxin production in vivo has been confirmed by deletion experiments.

Finally, the enzyme GliI creates the free dithiol precursor of gliotoxin. Originally annotated as a 1‐aminocyclopropane‐1‐carboxylic acid synthase, GliI acts as a pyridoxal 5’‐phosphate (PLP)‐dependent C−S bond lyase, phylogenetically related to alliinases.
[88]
 The current mechanistic proposal is derived from that of aminotransferases and first requires aldimine formation between the α‐amino group of one Cys residue on the DKP and the cofactor. Following abstraction of the Cα proton of Cys, a ketimine is formed that subsequently undergoes β‐elimination to yield the dithiol precursor of gliotoxin and a PLP‐linked imine that spontaneously hydrolyzes to pyruvate and ammonia.

[75d]
 the function of GliM remains unresolved. An O‐methylated shunt product has been observed in a ΔgliG knockout strain by two independent groups (Figure 2B),[

] but its origin is unknown. The crystal structure of GliM visualizes a very flat active site pocket that may fit a non‐sulfurized gliotoxin precursor (unpublished results of E. M. Huber), implying that GliM could act upstream of GliG. It is well conceivable that GliM transiently modifies an intermediate of gliotoxin biosynthesis,
[76]
 but experimental evidence is currently lacking. Moreover, the function of GliH in gliotoxin biosynthesis is unclear. As a corresponding knockout strain was deficient in gliotoxin production, GliH may have an essential function in either ETP biosynthesis or secretion, whereas a function in self‐resistance to gliotoxin has been excluded.

[113] Furthermore, the predicted DNA binding motif for the binuclear zinc finger transcription factor SirZ is identical to that of GliZ (TCGGN3CCGA), but the motif was found only upstream of the genes sirD, sirP, sirJ, sirT, sirB, sirQ, sirR, sirN, and sirO, despite similar transcription pattern of sir genes lacking the putative SirZ binding site.

[113] Given the complex structure of sirodesmin PL, the sir locus encodes several tailoring enzymes. Most importantly, the promiscuous prenyl transferase (SirD) catalyzes the addition of a dimethylallyl group to diverse acceptor sites, including the hydroxyl group of free l‐Tyr.
[138]
 The resulting metabolite O‐prenyl‐l‐Tyr then serves as a building block for DKP formation, leading to the well‐known intermediate phomamide (Figure 3B).
[139]
 Claisen rearrangement and cyclization of the prenylated Tyr may lead to the terminal five‐membered ring, but the enzyme(s) required for these reactions still remain(s) unknown. Epoxidation of the phenyl ring of Tyr by either SirB or SirE and subsequent nucleophilic attack by the amide backbone nitrogen atom of Tyr is assumed to induce intramolecular cyclization to the pyrrolidine ring structure similar to gliotoxin. Further consecutive oxidations of the Tyr remnant after the addition of water likely yield the phomalirazine intermediate (Figure 3B). A second epoxidation step, catalyzed by SirB or SirE, may trigger formation of the spiro linkage and ketone reduction by the predicted oxidoreductase SirO may set the stage for acetylation by SirH.
[72]
 This mechanistic proposal (Figure 3B) however is incomplete and preliminary, as many of the gene products have not been assigned and proven a specific function in sirodesmin PL production and as the order of reaction steps is largely unknown. The highly similar genes sirQ, sirR and sirS for example are unusual elements of secondary metabolite gene clusters. They most likely encode nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide‐dependent epimerases that act on hydroxyl groups,
[72]
 but their exact function awaits to be deciphered. Moreover, it its unknown which of the encoded CYP450 enzymes (SirB/SirE) is responsible for which oxidative modification. Lastly, SirX could not be assigned any potential function yet, as it shows no homology to any other protein.

Acetylation and oxidative ring expansion are modifications absent from gliotoxin, but the enzymes installing these decorations on aranotins were identified by comparing the metabolite profiles of the single knockout strains ΔataH and ΔataY.

 and that only sulfur‐free compounds could be isolated from a ΔataL strain,
[94a]
 it is tempting to speculate that GliH and AtaL might act upstream of sulfur incorporation in a yet unknown manner. Actions of AtaJ and the AtaI domain of AtaIMG are assumed to create the epidithiol intermediate that is oxidized by the AtaT domain of the AtaTC protein. Epoxidation of the phenyl moieties by AtaF and subsequent nucleophilic attack by the amide nitrogen atoms likely lead to the pyrrolidine moieties (Figure 4B), analogously to the reaction catalyzed by GliF during gliotoxin biosynthesis. Acetylation and oxidative ring expansion are modifications absent from gliotoxin, but the enzymes installing these decorations on aranotins were identified by comparing the metabolite profiles of the single knockout strains ΔataH and ΔataY. According to these results, AtaH acts as the acetyltransferase and AtaY installs the dihydrooxepine structures, likely via epoxidation and subsequent rearrangements.[

] Both reactions are not determined in their order,
[94a]
 but in contrast to a previous mechanistic proposal
[140c]
 they seem to occur after pyrrolidine formation.
[94a]
 In addition, similar to the gli gene cluster, a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, AtaA, is encoded in the ara locus and as part of the ataIMG gene a O‐methyltransferase domain AtaM is predicted (Figure 4A). Although a sulfur‐free O‐methylated compound has been isolated from a ataIMG deletion strain,
[94a]
 its functional relevance remains unclear. Moreover, for the gene ataL no potential function could be assigned so far. It encodes a protein that shows significant similarity to GliH. Considering that GliH is essential for gliotoxin production
[66b]

 it is tempting to speculate that GliH and AtaL might act upstream of sulfur incorporation in a yet unknown manner. Similar to gliotoxin, a bis(methylthio)‐variant has been reported

[145] Sporidesmins Sporidesmins Sporidesmins Sporidesmins To date nine different sporidesmins are known, of which sporidesmin A is the most prevalent one and sporidesmin D the bis(methylthio)‐derivative of A.
[28]
 Sporidesmin A was originally identified as the causative agent of facial eczema and liver disease in sheep and cattle predominantly in New Zealand and Australia.
[146]
 It is produced by the fungus Pseudopithomyces chartarum (formerly named Pithomyces chartarum or Sporidesmium bakeri) that grows on grasses.
[147]
 Once ingested by ruminants, sporidesmin A causes inflammation and necrosis in the bile ducts, resulting in a block of bile flow. As a result, degradation products of chlorophyll accumulate in the body and cause photosensitivity of the skin, leading to skin rash
[146a]
 and ultimately to death. Originally, veterinarians treated affected animals with zinc sulfate.
[148]
 The metal ions zinc and cadmium were later shown to protect cells from the toxic effects of sporidesmin A by chelating the ETP.
[149]
 In addition, sporidesmin A has been found to inhibit human glutaredoxin via disulfide formation.

 and highly decorated with hydroxyl, methyl and methoxy groups. Only recently, the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of sporidesmin A (Figure 5A) from P. chartarum has been identified by bioinformatics tools and reported on bioRxiv.
[144]
 It contains 21 genes, of which many products display homology to enzymes from gliotoxin (see section 2.1.1.2.), sirodesmin PL (see section 2.1.2.2.) and aspirochlorine biosynthesis (see section 2.2.2.), but validation of their biological function is still lacking. Spd20 (GliZ), Spd17 (GliP), Spd3 (GliC), Spd5 (GliG), Spd9 (GliK), Spd2 (GliJ), Spd16 (GliI), and Spd13 (GliT) are predicted to take over the same functions as their corresponding homologues from the gli gene cluster (Figure 5B). As an orthologue of AclH (see section 2.2.2.), Spd4 probably is a flavin‐dependent halogenase and Spd15 shows similarity to the acetyltransferase SirH. Four methyltransferases (Spd1, Spd7, Spd11 and Spd21) and another two CYP450 enzymes besides Spd3 (Spd8 and Spd10) are also part of the cluster. Strikingly, three transport proteins are encoded as well: one ABC (Spd6) and two MFS (Spd14 and Spd18) transporters.
[144]
 Finally, Spd12 and Spd19 are two hypothetical proteins of unknown function (Figure 5A). Given the large number of genes in the putative cluster, experimental validation of the cassette borders and the functional involvement of the genes in sporidesmin A biosynthesis is necessary.

 In agreement, the recently identified biosynthetic gene cluster of gliovirin encodes a NRPS (Glv21) that is predicted to have a single adenylation domain (Figure 6A). While the importance of Glv21 for gliovirin production has been experimentally confirmed by deletion, the functions of many of the other 21 gene products encoded in the gene cluster are up to now only predicted based on homology to the corresponding Gli enzymes.

 What applies to gliovirin remains to be investigated. The most intriguing structural feature of gliovirin is its disulfide moiety linking the Cα atom of one Phe residue to the Cβ atom of the second. According to the current mechanistic proposal, Glv3 hydroxylates the Cα atoms of both Phe residues and subsequent rearrangements move one hydroxyl group to the Cβ atom.
[156]
 A spontaneous movement is unlikely, as other ETPs are devoid of this irregular bridging. For instance, acetylaranotin, that is also made of two l‐Phe residues, features a disulfide bridge connecting both Cα atoms and no Cα–Cβ linkages have been described (see also section 2.1.3.). On the other hand, converting a symmetric substrate (either the naked or the Cα‐bis‐hydroxylated Phe‐Phe‐DKP) to an asymmetric one by enzymatic action, appears unlikely. It might therefore be conceivable that the sulfur migrates after disulfide bridge formation in a manner similar to what has been observed for aspirochlorine (see section 2.2.2.). In support of this assumption, the glv gene cluster encodes a putative O‐acyltransferase (Glv15) and two thioredoxin reductases (Glv4 and Glv16). Glv15 might take over the function of AclF in aspirochlorine biosynthesis and install a transient acetylation. In agreement, an acetylated variant of gliovirin has not been reported so far. The two thioredoxin reductases (Glv4/Glv16) are potentially responsible for oxidation of the thiols and sulfur migration, respectively. Sequence analyses for either CXXC (typical of thiol oxidases like GliT, see section 2.1.1.2.) or CXXH motifs (hallmark of AclR involved in sulfur migration during aspirochlorine biosynthesis;

[165] The structure and the biosynthesis of aspirochlorine are exceptional among the hundreds of ETPs known to date. Aspirochlorine is a halogenated spiro compound with an N‐methoxy amide linkage and, like in gliovirin, the disulfide bridge extends outside the DKP core connecting a Cα with a Cβ atom (Figure 1).

 The biosynthesis of this remarkable compound however remained unexplored until recently. The structure of aspirochlorine hinted at l‐Phe and Gly as building blocks for the DKP scaffold, but this hypothesis was disproved later. First, the acl gene cluster responsible for aspirochlorine biosynthesis was identified by genome mining and experimentally verified by gene deletion experiments (Figure 7A).

 The gene cassette encodes a transcriptional regulator (AclZ), three putative transport proteins (AclA, AclQ and AclS) and the typical set of enzymes expected for ETP production: the NRPS AclP for DKP formation; AclC (CYP450 enzyme) and AclG (glutathione‐S‐transferase) for GSH addition; AclK (γ‐glutamyl‐cyclotransferase), AclJ (dipeptidase) and AclI (aminotransferase) for GSH garbling; and AclD (thioredoxinreductase) for establishing the disulfide linkage (Figure 7).[

 The biosynthesis of this remarkable compound however remained unexplored until recently. The structure of aspirochlorine hinted at l‐Phe and Gly as building blocks for the DKP scaffold, but this hypothesis was disproved later. First, the acl gene cluster responsible for aspirochlorine biosynthesis was identified by genome mining and experimentally verified by gene deletion experiments (Figure 7A).
[165]
 The gene cassette encodes a transcriptional regulator (AclZ), three putative transport proteins (AclA, AclQ and AclS) and the typical set of enzymes expected for ETP production: the NRPS AclP for DKP formation; AclC (CYP450 enzyme) and AclG (glutathione‐S‐transferase) for GSH addition; AclK (γ‐glutamyl‐cyclotransferase), AclJ (dipeptidase) and AclI (aminotransferase) for GSH garbling; and AclD (thioredoxinreductase) for establishing the disulfide linkage (Figure 7).[

] Surprisingly, the NRPS AclP was predicted to contain only a single A domain with specificity for Phe and notably the signature sequence of the A domain was identical to that of AtaP involved in acetylaranotin biosynthesis (see section 2.1.3.). Further experiments supported l‐Phe as the sole building block of aspirochlorine and showed that one Phe residue is truncated to Gly by an oxidative C−C cleavage and release of benzaldehyde.
[165]
 Follow‐up work revealed that the CYP450 enzymes AclL and AclO install hydroxyl groups. By hydroxylating one of the nitrogen atoms of the DKP scaffold, AclO sets the stage for subsequent methylation by AclU, leading to the methoxy group in aspirochlorine. The resulting N‐alkoxy amide increases the electrophilicity of the adjacent carbonyl carbon atom
[168]
 and facilitates non‐enzymatic retro‐aldol cleavage of the Phe side chain within the same amino acid (Figure 7B).
[169]
 The final step of aspirochlorine biosynthesis is accomplished by AclH. The FAD‐dependent halogenase chlorinates the monophenyl precursor to yield the final natural product.
[165]
 Notably, the order of reaction steps is fix, as the enzymes AclL, AclO and AclU favor substrates with two phenyl groups, while AclH selects for monophenyl compounds.
[169]
 The retro‐aldol‐type fragmentation during aspirochlorine biosynthesis leads to a so far unobserved conversion of amino acids that is of significant relevance for the biological activity of the final compound. Compared to the monophenyl compounds aspirochlorine and its dechloro version, pathway intermediates with two phenyl rings showed significantly reduced fungicide activity.

[169] After the late biosynthesis steps had been elucidated, questions about the formation of the irregular seven‐membered disulfide ring of aspirochlorine were addressed. Revision of the gene cluster annotation revealed a previously undetected gene aclR whose product was predicted to share homology with AclD, the equivalent of GliT from gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, in contrast to the CXXC motif typical of thioredoxin reductases, AclR was noted to feature an unusual CXXH signature.
[157]
 A ΔaclR knockout strain accumulated a previously unobserved metabolite (prespiro‐aspirochlorine) lacking the spiro center but instead carrying two oxymethines with one being decorated by an acetyl group that is absent from the final natural product. Further analyses revealed that AclR is an FAD‐dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of prespiro‐aspirochlorine to a spiroaminal intermediate,
[157]
 which was previously shown to be a substrate for AclL.
[169]
 The crystal structure of AclR and mutagenesis data suggest that the unusual CXXH motif of AclR is necessary for efficient formation of the spiro center.
[157]
 Most likely, under the release of acetate, Cys144 forms a mixed disulfide with the substrate, leading to a thiirane. Subsequent 1,2 sulfamyl migration promoted by the lone pair of the neighboring amide nitrogen is supposed to create the α,β sulfur linkage and the spiro‐fused furan ring of aspirochlorine. His147 might assist this reaction sequence (Figure 7B).

 Characterization of the zinc finger transcription factor VerZ showed that its expression positively correlates with the production of verticillin and direct interaction of recombinant VerZ with upstream regions of various ver genes (verA, verT‐verL, verM, verN‐verI, verC‐verP, verK, verG, verZ and verB) was confirmed.

Dimerization of ETPs Dimerization of ETPs Dimerization of ETPs Dimerization of ETPs So far, the dimerization of ETPs has not been studied, but recent work on (mostly bacterial) DKP dimerases might also provide insights into the coupling of ETPs. Known DKP dimerases are CYP450 enzymes that connect Trp‐containing 2,5‐DKP monomers via C−C and C−N bonds similar to verticillin A, chaetocin and chetomin (Figure 1).
[193]
 According to the current mechanistic proposal a radical is generated at the N1 atom of the Trp side chain of a DKP monomer that subsequently moves to the C3 position, allowing for an intramolecular cyclization (Mannich reaction) to create a pyrroloindoline C3 radical. Radical addition to a second DKP monomer would finally yield a C−C linked dimeric scaffold (Figure 11A).

 Reaction of a N1 radical with another DKP monomer is thought to create the intermolecular C−N bond (Figure 11B).

Final Considerations Final Considerations ETPs are an ever‐growing class of fungal secondary metabolites, but often several structurally related compounds are reported. Although many of those congeners may be shunt metabolites or isolation artefacts and do not serve a biological function, some of them act as regulatory molecules as shown for the bis(methylthio)‐derivative of gliotoxin.
[76]
 Identification of ETP biosynthesis gene clusters and analysis of the enzymatic production of ETPs will help to distinguish relevant metabolites from irrelevant ones. This strategy however is hampered by the scarcity and instability of pathway intermediates as well as orphan enzymes that are recruited from outside the ETP biosynthesis gene cluster for tailoring reactions. The enzyme TmtA for example, encoded outside the gli gene cluster, was identified to account for the production of bis(methylthio)gliotoxin.[

] Albeit genome mining approaches significantly boostered ETP research during the last two decades, ETP production cannot be simply predicted bioinformatically. A gene cassette from Claviceps purpurea for example encodes all components required for the production of thioclapurines, but the CYP450 enzyme TcpC has altered substrate specificity leading to unusual hydroxylation and sulfurization patterns. As a result, shunt metabolites with nitrogen‐sulfur bonds are formed instead of disulfide‐linked ETPs.

[195] Moreover, to successfully study ETPs and their biosynthesis intermediates, extraction settings have to be carefully chosen to avoid artificial transformations. Under alkaline conditions for example, conversion of pretrichodermamide A to trichodermamide A and S8 was observed, suggesting that trichodermamide A is an isolation artefact.
[196]
 Also the unique structure of the dimeric ETPs vertihemiptellide A and B, identified in the insect pathogen Verticillium hemipterigenum BCC 1449 and linked via two disulfide bonds, needs further investigations to exclude artificial dimerization of two hyalodendrin units.

[197] Summary and Outlook Summary and Outlook ETPs are a structurally diverse class of fungal natural products that share at least one aromatic amino acid and a reactive sulfide moiety as a hallmark. Due to non‐selective thiol‐disulfide exchange reactions with proteins, ETPs display a myriad of bioactivities and have numerous intracellular targets. Thus, by virtue of their chemical structure, that is inevitably linked to random action, ETPs are unlikely to find application as drugs. Yet, ETPs certainly contribute to fungal virulence as well as pathogenicity and their biosynthesis pathways may be considered as potential targets of fungicides in the future. Furthermore, ETPs produced during fermentation processes are of serious concern for food safety. Therefore, understanding the biosynthesis of ETPs, their regulation and identifying potential ways to interfere with or engineer their production might open up both industrial and medical applications. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that all ETP biosynthesis pathways known to date use the same set of enzymes (NRPS, CYP450, GST, dipeptidase, lyases and oxidoreductase) to construct their sulfurized scaffold and only few tailoring enzymes are responsible for diversifying the framework and creating a specific ETP.

During the last decade much progress has been made in elucidating and studying ETP biosynthesis gene clusters and production, but there are still many knowledge gaps to be closed in the future. i) First, many gene clusters encode more proteins than one would expect to be required for the biosynthesis of the corresponding ETP. It will be interesting to analyze whether the encoded proteins really play a functional or regulatory role for ETP production. Examples from gliotoxin biosynthesis are GliH and the putative O‐methyltransferase GliM, but proteins of unknown function are encoded in all ETP biosynthesis gene clusters known to date. For instance, an O‐methyltransferase is also encoded in the ata gene cluster, although acetylaranotin production should not require an O‐methyltransferase – at least according to our current knowledge of ETP biosynthesis. In this regard, it is interesting to note that some ETP biosynthesis gene clusters encode several transport proteins of different type, the function of which in general and in ETP export is completely unknown. ii) Second, it is unclear whether Cα–Cβ bridged ETPs share a common biosynthetic principle. Specifically, it would be interesting to know whether gliovirin biosynthesis makes use of a similar mechanism for sulfur migration as aspirochlorine. Furthermore, the enzymatic reactions giving rise to epicoccin C are still elusive. iii) Last but not least, basically nothing is known about the biosynthesis of double‐decker ETPs. Compared to monomeric ETPs, the stereochemistry at the Cα atoms of the DKP rings of ETP dimers appears to be inverted during biosynthesis (Figure 1 and Figure 10B). It might therefore be worth analyzing GSTs from double‐decker ETP biosynthesis gene clusters, whether their mechanisms of action allow for stereochemistry inversion. Additional interesting aspects to study include timing of the pairing reaction during ETP biosynthesis and reaction mechanism as well as linkage and substrate selectivity of the dimerization enzymes. DKP dimerases have already been used to engineer diverse non‐natural DKP dimers[
