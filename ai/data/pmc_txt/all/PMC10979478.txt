 Myxobacteria are
a prolific source of secondary metabolites with
sheer chemical complexity, intriguing biosynthetic enzymology, and
diverse biological activities. In this study, we report the discovery,
biosynthesis, biomimetic total synthesis, physiological function,
structure–activity relationship, and self-resistance mechanism
of the 5-methylated pyrazinone coralinone from a myxobacterium Corallococcus exiguus SDU70. A single NRPS/PKS gene corA was genetically and biochemically demonstrated to orchestrate
coralinone, wherein the integral PKS part is responsible for installing
the 5-methyl group. Intriguingly, coralinone exacerbated cellular
aggregation of myxobacteria grown in liquid cultures by enhancing
the secretion of extracellular matrix, and the 5-methylation is indispensable
for the alleged activity. We provided an evolutionary landscape of
the corA-associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)
distributed in the myxobacterial realm, revealing the divergent evolution
for the diversity-oriented biosynthesis of 5-alkyated pyrazinones.
This phylogenetic contextualization provoked us to identify corB located in the proximity of corA as
a self-resistance gene. CorB was experimentally verified to be a protease
that hydrolyzes extracellular proteins to antagonize the agglutination-inducing
effect of coralinone. Overall, we anticipate these findings will provide
new insights into the chemical ecology of myxobacteria and lay foundations
for the maximal excavation of these largely underexplored resources. corA autonomously codes
for 5-methylated
pyrazinone that promotes secretion of extracellular matrix to induce
agglutination of myxobacteria, and corB encoding
a protease is the self-resistance gene. Introduction Introduction Myxobacteria are Gram-negative Myxococotta characterized
by unique morphological characteristics, complex life cycles, predation,
gliding, multicellular fruiting body formation, and large genome size.1 This branch of life domain is particularly fascinating
because they are well-renowned for producing a wealth of bioactive
secondary metabolites endowed with intricated architectures, extraordinary
bioactivities, and exquisite mode of action.2 According to our recently compiled MyxoDB database,3 most of the scaffolds are exclusively found in myxobacteria,
underpinning the importance of myxobacteria in terms of drug development.
Furthermore, the advent of low-cost genome sequencing has revealed
a far greater biosynthetic potential than what we have characterized,
ensuring that myxobacteria stand out in the forefront of microbial
natural products’ (NPs) research.4,5 Myxobacteria are Gram-negative Myxococotta characterized

all the known myxobacterial NPs, a small structural family
is pyrazinone, a nonaromatic heterocyclic ring with one ketonized
carbon and two para-situated nitrogen atoms (Figure 1). The representative
examples are nannozinones and sorazinones discovered from Nannocystis pusilla MNa10913,6 as well as enhypyrazinone A from the marine-derived Enhygromyxa sp. WMMC2695.7 Typically, the biosynthesis
of pyrazinones in microbes are derived from condensation of two molecules
of amino acids through a multidomain nonribosomal peptide synthetase
(NRPS) assembly line. The terminal R (reductase) domain releases the
tethered dipeptide as a reactive aldehyde. The nucleophilic attack
of the aldehyde by the α-amine forms a cyclic imine, followed
by oxidation to afford pyrazinone core.8−11 Therefore, it is understandable
that C-5 of the pyrazinone ring is mostly unsubstituted, as seen in
the naturally occurring pyrazinones like phevalin,12 tyrvalin, and leuvalin.8,11 Intriguingly,
there are also a considerable number of pyrazinone compounds bearing
differential substituents on C-5 of the pyrazinone skeleton, including
but not limited to cinnamoyl (enhypyrazinone),7 acetyl (nannozinone B),6 and methyl (sorazinone
B,6 butrepyrazinone13), whereas the precise enzymatic machineries for these periphery
moieties remained enigmatic. Among

of microorganisms such as fungi,14 actinomycetes,15−17 staphylococci,8,11 and sponges,18,19 which implies an important biological and ecological significance.
Interestingly, pyrazinone and related chemical scaffolds are oftentimes

to regulate various physiological processes. For example, pyrazinones
functionate as quorum sensing regulator to control biofilm formation
of Vibrio cholerae,20 or

of coralinones, a family of 5-methylated
pyrazinones from myxobacterium Corallococcus exiguus SDU70. Combining bioinformatics analysis, genetic disruption, and
heterologous expression, we identified an NRPS/PKS gene (corA) that autonomously codes for coralinones. Further by biochemical
characterization and biomimetic total synthesis, we explicitly elaborated
the assembly mechanism of coralinones, especially unravelling the
enzymology responsible for 5-methylation of the pyrazinone backbone.
More remarkably, we decrypted the biological function of coralinones
that act as morphogens to modulate the cellular aggregation of C. exiguus SDU70 and the model myxobacterium Myxococcus
xanthus DK1622 grown in liquid cultures. Interestingly, corB located in the vicinity of corA functions
as a self-resistance gene. This study advances our understanding of
chemical ecology and/or biology of myxobacteria and inspires new perspectives

of our continuing efforts to find drug leads from myxobacteria,
we were fascinated with a group of secondary metabolites produced
by the strain C. exiguus SDU70 during preliminary
screening, which gave the characteristic UV absorption spectrum for
pyrazinone in the HPLC-DAD profiling (Figure S1). A scaled-up fermentation (34 L) of SDU70 was performed. The repeated
chromatography by tracking the sought-after UV peaks led to the purification
of compounds 1 and 2. The structure elucidation
was done by a combination of 2D NMR and high-resolution MS analysis
(see Supporting Information). As a consequence,
the isolated compounds were identified as previously undescribed tri-alkylated pyrazinones differing in the isopropyl or
isobutyl substituent at C-6 (Figure 1), and they were dubbed as coralinones A (1) and B (2), respectively. The absolute configuration
of C-11 in 2 was determined to be S on
the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure S2), concordant with the biosynthetic origin of l-isoleucine
(see below). Remarkably, coralinones featured a methyl at C-5 of pyrazinone
core further expanding the diversity and complexity of this structural

of Coralinone Retrobiosynthetic analysis and isotope labeling
experiments unambiguously confirmed that l-leucine d3 and l-isoleucine d10 were the biosynthetic precursors (Figure S3). When SDU70 was fed with 13C-labeled
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), no isotopic coralinones were accumulated,
excluding the possibility that 5-CH3 is an outcome of putative C-methyltransferase. As Motoyama and co-workers have shown
that aldehydes could participate in the alkylation of pyrazines,22 we conducted an additional isotope experiment
using [1-13C]-labeled formaldehyde, but still no incorporation
was observed in the LC-MS analysis. Retrobiosynthetic analysis and isotope labeling

and then subjected to antiSMASH analysis,23 which led to the identification of 44 biosynthetic gene clusters
(BGCs). We did not find any NRPS BGC encoding the multidomain organization
of C-A-T-C-A-T-R (Figure 1) that canonically engages in the biosynthesis of pyrazinone
backbone.8−11 Instead, a hybrid NRPS/PKS BGC namely cor caught
our attention because the encoded domain architecture of A-T-C-A-T-KS-AT-ACP-TE
was predictably attainable for a peptidic product containing two amino
acids, one of the prerequisites for pyrazinone formation. This allowed
us to propose a biosynthetic model for coralinones: the textbook modular
NRPS/PKS assembly line warrants a dipeptidyl β-keto acid (1a) by CorA, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous domino
reactions, including β-keto decarboxylation, intramolecular
cyclization, and oxidation to generate 5-methylated pyrazinones (Figure 2). The divergence in the sequential reactivity order of decarboxylation
and cyclization results in two possible routes (Route I versus II),
since both reactions happen spontaneously. However, we postulated
that Route I is more favorable, because β-keto acid loses carbon
dioxide quite easily, where the immediate product will be a resonant
stabilized enolate anion followed by tautomerism into ketone.24 SDU70 was genome sequenced

pairwise combination confirmed Leu-Val, Leu-Ile, Met-Ile, Met-Val,
Phe-Ile, and Phe-Val produced 5-methylated pyrazinones 1–6 (Figure S5), as
established by the LC-MS measurements and characteristic UV absorption
spectra (Figure S6), all of which were
previously undescribed compounds. As the second A domain in CorA is
able to accept Ile and Val, the production of 1–6 implied that the first A domain is promiscuous to tolerate
Leu, Met, and Phe. According to the relative yield of 1–6 (Figure S7), we
tentatively concluded that the substrate preference for the first
A domain is Leu > Met > Phe, while that for the second A domain
is
Ile > Val. Subsequently, the substrates preference of the first
A
domain was unambiguously corroborated by the ATP–PPi exchange
assay26 (Figure S7), in agreement with the pairwise combination assay. Significantly,
the AT domain also exhibits substrate flexibility, because an additional
new compound 5-ethylated pyrazinone (7) was generated
when methylmalonyl-CoA (MMal-CoA) instead of Mal-CoA was incubated
with CorA-PKS (Figure 3B). Altogether, the in vivo and in vitro experiments unambiguously corroborated that corA autonomously synthesizes coralinones, whereby the PKS moiety is
responsible for the formation of 5-methylation. In consideration that substrate
flexibility of A domains seems
an intrinsic peculiarity of NRPS assembly line related to pyrazinone
biosynthesis,9 we explored expanding the
chemical repertoire of 5-methylated pyrazinones by virtue of combinational
synthesis using holo-CorA. In the presence of Mal-CoA,

Exacerbates Cellular Aggregation of C. exiguus SDU70
and M. xanthus DK1622 To understand
the biological function(s) of the 5-methylated pyrazinones produced
by myxobacteria, we assayed 1 and 2 against
the Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii, Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus,
and the fungus Candida albicans. No growth inhibition
was observed during agar diffusion assay when applied with 50 μg/disc,
consistent with previous investigation by Magarvey and co-workers
who demonstrated 5-unsubstituted pyrazinones are not antibiotics.8 Neither 1 nor 2 showed
any significant antiproliferative activities against four human cell
lines (Table S2). These intrigued us to
surmise that coralinones might have a distinct activity and play an
important physiological role toward SDU70. Therefore, corA was constitutively overexpressed or insertion inactivated in SDU70,
respectively. The fidelity of genotypes of the resultant mutants SDU70-corA or SDU70-ΔcorA were confirmed
by Sanger sequencing and metabolic analysis (Figure S8). The mutants obtained on solid agar plates were examined
for growth development. Interestingly, while little morphogenetic
difference was found between SDU70 wild type (SDU70-wt) and overexpression
mutant SDU70-corA, defect in the fruiting body of
null mutant SDU70-ΔcorA was conspicuous (Figure 4A). As the fruiting
body is closely associated with aggregation of myxobacterial cells,27,28 we were intrigued to monitor the agglutination of the alleged three
strains in the shaken liquid-grown cultures. The pellet morphogenesis
of SDU70-ΔcorA was significantly impeded in
comparison with SDU70-wt and SDU70-corA, which could
be restored by the chemical complementation of 1 at 5
mg/L (Figure 4B), a
concentration mirroring the total yield level (∼1.5 mg/L) of
coralinones given by SDU70-wt (Figure S1). We also tested if coralinones could induce agglutination of model
myxobacterium M. DK1622. The gene corA was expressed in DK1622, wherein the production of 1 and 2 were confirmed by HPLC-DAD analysis (Figure S8). Consistent with the results obtained
from SDU70, the dispersed morphology of wild type DK1622 (DK1622-wt)
was apparently disrupted. Likewise, exogenous supplementation of 5
mg/L 1 to DK1622-wt also led to flocculation (Figure 4B). In addition, 1 caused the flocculation of SDU70-ΔcorA and DK1622-wt in a dose-dependent manner, whereby 2 mg/L started
to be active, and 5 mg/L caused severe flocculation (Figure S9). Taken together, given the results obtained from
both SDU70 and DK1622, we concluded that coralinones serve as small-molecule
morphogens for coordinating cellular aggregation of myxobacteria. To understand

Relationship Study The Fischbach group has revealed that
the NRPS enzyme with the domain organization of C-A-T-C-A-T-R that
specifies 5-unsubstituted pyrazinone (Figure 1) is associated with protease inhibition,
wherein the biosynthetic intermediate dipeptide aldehyde (in Boc-protected
form) rather than the mature product is efficacious.11,29 In consideration of the close resemblance between 5-unsubstituted
and 5-methylated pyrazinones in terms of biosynthetic logic and the
chemical skeleton, we initially posited that the dipeptide ketone
Leu-Val-CH3 (1b) might also have protease
inhibitory activity. We thereby developed a strategy for the concise
synthesis of 5-methylated pyrazinone coralinone A (1)
and a panel of biosynthetically related compounds (1b′, 1a′′, 8, 9) by emulating its biosynthetic routes (see Supporting Information). By contrast, the synthesis of 5-unsubstituted
pyrazinone 10 and its biosynthetic intermediate Leu-Val-H
(10b′) in a Boc-protected form were predicated
upon the previously published method.29 All the compounds were assayed for the inhibition activity against
protease cathepsin L. The Boc-protected dipeptide aldehyde 10b′ exhibited inhibition activity with IC50 value of 0.23
μM, but none of the other tested compounds showed efficacy even
up to 500 μM. On the other hand, these compounds were also tested
for their ability to induce agglutination of SDU70-ΔcorA and DK1622-wt, and it was 1 and 1b′ that were effective (Figure 5 and Figure S10). We suspected
that SDU70-ΔcorA and/or DK1622-wt might serve
as biocatalysts for the deprotection of Boc group in 1b′ to release the bona fide biosynthetic intermediate 1b, followed by spontaneous reactions to generate the genuine
effector 1. However, this possibility was subsequently
ruled out because 1b′ was found to be recalcitrant
to biotransformation (Figure S11). 1b′ also induced the agglutination of SDU70-ΔcorA and DK1622-wt in a dose-dependent manner and
seemingly shared an equivalent efficacy with 1 (Figure S9). The Fischbach group has revealed that

Matrix Coralinone Stimulates the Secretion of Extracellular
Matrix Coralinone Stimulates the Secretion of Extracellular
Matrix The unique physiological role of coralinone intrigued
our interest
in investigating the underlying mechanism. It is known that bacterial
clumps and/or biofilm systems are always exacerbated by the extracellular
matrix (ECM) that normally consists of extracellular polysaccharides
(EPS), proteins, and extracellular DNA (eDNA), among other components.30 Especially, the aggregative polysaccharides
within ECM act as a molecular glue, driving the bacterial cells to
adhere to each other as well as surfaces.31 We thereby hypothesized that coralinones enhance the production
of ECM and promote intercellular adhesion. To test this assumption,
the microscopic changes in the surface properties of SDU70 cells were
visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An abundance of

appeared smooth, in contrast to DK1622-corA coated
with a dot-like scabrous (Figure 6A). To gain a deeper insight into the composites of
the secreted ECM, we measured EPS production of DK1622 using the trypan
blue binding assay.32 As a consequence,
EPS produced by DK1622-corA was around four times
that by DK1622-wt or DK1622-vector. The cumulation of EPS was also
observed for DK1622-wt supplemented with 5 mg/L 1 (Figure 6B). More intuitively,
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in combination with specific
indicator dyes was employed to in situ visualize
the distributions of cells and EPS in the biomass of DK1622 samples
(DK1622-wt, DK1622-vector, DK1622-corA, and DK1622+1). Counterstaining with the mixture of dyes SYTO9, SYTOX,
and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) presented different fluorescences
and thus allowed differentiation of EPS from the alive and debris
cells. EPS given by DK1622-wt and DK1622-vector were obviously less
than that of DK1622-corA, and DK1622+1, as represented by the evident blue signal in the latter two groups
after overlaying the images derived from the three indicator dyes
(Figure 6C). The experimental
evidence from SEM, trypan blue binding assay, and CLSM, demonstrated
that coralinone promoted EPS production, which would contribute to
the agglutination of C. exiguus SDU70 and M. xanthus DK1622 in liquid cultures. The unique physiological role of coralinone intrigued
our interest
in investigating the underlying mechanism. It is known that bacterial
clumps and/or biofilm systems are always exacerbated by the extracellular
matrix (ECM) that normally consists of extracellular polysaccharides
(EPS), proteins, and extracellular DNA (eDNA), among other components.30 Especially, the aggregative polysaccharides
within ECM act as a molecular glue, driving the bacterial cells to
adhere to each other as well as surfaces.31 We thereby hypothesized that coralinones enhance the production
of ECM and promote intercellular adhesion. To test this assumption,
the microscopic changes in the surface properties of SDU70 cells were
visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An abundance of
smeared ECM tightly glued cells of SDU70-wt and SDU70-corA, which was not observed for nonpelleting strain SDU70-ΔcorA. Likewise, the surface of DK1622-wt and the mutant DK1622-vector

BGCs in Myxobacteria Phylogenetic Contextualization of cor-Like
BGCs in Myxobacteria Phylogenetic Contextualization of cor-Like
BGCs in Myxobacteria The classification of the enzymology
governing the biosynthesis of coralinones prompted us to systematically
survey the distribution of BGCs specifying 5-alkylated pyrazinones
in myxobacteria. We analyzed all the myxobacterial genomes available
to us by antiSMASH,33 and identified 110
putative BGCs that are closely associated with the biosynthesis of
5-methylated pyrazinones. Afterward, a multilocus phylogeny of the
110 BGCs was constructed by using CORASON tool34 to render the evolutionary relationships, wherein the source
organisms and domain organization of central NRPS/PKS megasynthetases
were also indicated (Figure 7). Interestingly, the alleged hybrid NRPS/PKS BGCs specifying
5-methylated pyrazinones are dominantly distributed in Corallococcus, followed by Sorangium, Chondromyces, Nannocystis, Polyangium, while
none of them is derived from the genus Myxococcus that is so far the best cultivated and most genome-sequenced in
the phylum of myxobacteria. The grouping of cor-like
BGCs in the phylogenetic tree is generally genus-dependent, whereas
the architectural arrangements are variable. Although the central
NRPS/PKS genes show significant variance in size and arrangement,
their total domain elements are invariably amenable to assemble two
amino acids (prerequisite for pyrazinone backbone formation) and execute
one round of PKS elongation (crucial for methylation/alkylation at
C-5 of pyrazinone backbone). The phylogenetic tree could be classified
into three clades according to the domain organization of the central
NRPS/PKS. Clades I and III are predominantly derived from the genus Corallococcus, which contain a minimal set of domains indispensable
for the biosynthesis of 5-methylated pyrazinones, via A-T-C-A-T-KS-AT-ACP-TE
as exemplified in corA. These two clades differ in
the splitting pattern and arrangement of NRPS/PKS genes as well as
the standalone TE gene. By contrast, clade II shows much higher variation
in the domain compositions, and most members are originated from other
genera rather than Corallococcus. Other catalytic
domains (KR, nMT, and cMT) are embedded into the minimal set of NRPS-PKS
modules, which are expected to tune the canonical assembly line of
5-methylated pyrazinones by introducing modifications of reduction
of β-ketone, N-methylation, and C-methylation, respectively. From the perspective of evolution, such
divergent biosynthesis of 5-alkyated pyrazinones might confer advantages
to their respective hosts. The unraveled flexibility in the domain
arrangements of cor-like BGCs would not only underpin
the discovery of many more natural 5-alkyated pyrazinones from our
ever-growing myxobacterial collections but also provide clues for
the bioinformatics-directed biomimetic total synthesis of unnatural
5-alkyated pyrazinones. All in all, the blueprint of the evolutionary
scenario of the cor-like BGCs adds a new dimension
to illustrate the correspondence between genetic and molecular variations
of 5-alkyated pyrazinones. The classification of the enzymology

Coralinone The Gene corB Is a Self-resistance
Gene against
Coralinone We noticed that a peptidase gene (corB) is invariably coclustered with corA, especially
for the cor-like BGCs from Corallococcus (Figure 7). To substantiate
its function(s), corB was overexpressed in SDU70
using the strong constitutive promoter J23104.35 As a consequence, the clumping phenomenon was attenuated
in the resultant overexpression strain SDU70-corB in comparison with SDU70-wt. We also constructed a strain SDU70-ΔcorA-corB, wherein corB was constitutively
overexpressed and corA was concurrently inactivated.
This double mutation maintained the dispersed morphology in spite
of induction with 5 mg/L of 1 or 1b′. SDU70-corB and SDU70-ΔcorA-corB did not clump at the presence of as high as 50 mg/L of 1 or 1b′. The function of corB was further consolidated by the heterologous expression in DK1622.
Overexpression of corB (under the control of promoter
Tn535) in DK1622 substantially abated agglutination
induced by the endogenous expression of corA and/or
exogenous addition of 5 mg/L of 1 or 1b′. The threshold concentration that caused visible flocculation of
DK1622-corB was 3–4 times higher than that
for DK1622-wt (Figures S12–S14).
In addition, corB was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and the purified protein CorB was added to SDU70-wt and
DK1622-corA at a gradient of concentration (0.01–1
mg/L). The flocculation of these two strains was indeed suppressed
by exogenously supplemented CorB in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8A). Therefore, both
the in vivo and in vitro results
unambiguously demonstrated that corB is a self-resistance
gene36 that antagonizes the agglutination-inducing
effect of cognate products encoded by corA. Someone
might question why SDU70-wt severely clumped since it natively contains
a copy of gene corB. We inferred that this discrepancy
is due to the insufficient strength of innate promoter of corB in SDU70-wt, which leads to a lower expression level
compared with that of strains DK1622-corB and SDU70-corB equipped with a much stronger promoter. Admittedly,
RT-qPCR experiments confirmed that the transcription quantity of corA was around six times that of corB in
SDU70-wt (Figure S15). We noticed that a peptidase gene (corB) is invariably coclustered with corA, especially

its function(s), corB was overexpressed in SDU70
using the strong constitutive promoter J23104.35 As a consequence, the clumping phenomenon was attenuated
in the resultant overexpression strain SDU70-corB in comparison with SDU70-wt. We also constructed a strain SDU70-ΔcorA-corB, wherein corB was constitutively
overexpressed and corA was concurrently inactivated.
This double mutation maintained the dispersed morphology in spite
of induction with 5 mg/L of 1 or 1b′. SDU70-corB and SDU70-ΔcorA-corB did not clump at the presence of as high as 50 mg/L of 1 or 1b′. The function of corB was further consolidated by the heterologous expression in DK1622.
Overexpression of corB (under the control of promoter
Tn535) in DK1622 substantially abated agglutination
induced by the endogenous expression of corA and/or
exogenous addition of 5 mg/L of 1 or 1b′. The threshold concentration that caused visible flocculation of
DK1622-corB was 3–4 times higher than that
for DK1622-wt (Figures S12–S14).
In addition, corB was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and the purified protein CorB was added to SDU70-wt and
DK1622-corA at a gradient of concentration (0.01–1
mg/L). The flocculation of these two strains was indeed suppressed
by exogenously supplemented CorB in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8A). Therefore, both
the in vivo and in vitro results
unambiguously demonstrated that corB is a self-resistance
gene36 that antagonizes the agglutination-inducing
effect of cognate products encoded by corA. Someone
might question why SDU70-wt severely clumped since it natively contains
a copy of gene corB. We inferred that this discrepancy
is due to the insufficient strength of innate promoter of corB in SDU70-wt, which leads to a lower expression level
compared with that of strains DK1622-corB and SDU70-corB equipped with a much stronger promoter. Admittedly,
RT-qPCR experiments confirmed that the transcription quantity of corA was around six times that of corB in
SDU70-wt (Figure S15). Figure 8The gene corB encodes a protease to antagonize

CorB. The ECM could be efficiently degraded by CorB. We were curious as to how corB bestows resistance
to coralinone. The in silico analysis of the protein
product of corB using BLASTp and HHpred indicated
CorB belongs to the “DegP/Q family serine endoprotease”.
On account of the peptidic origin of 1 and 1b′, we initially speculated that enzymatic hydrolysis is the underlying
mechanism. CorB was assessed its ability to hydrolyze 1 and/or 1b′in vitro. However,
HPLC-DAD analysis indicated that both substrates remained unchanged
in the reaction system (Figure S16). Ligand
binding is not the mode of action, as judged by the microscale thermophoresis
(MST) assay (Figure S17). These experiments
compelled us to bioinformatically scrutinize its characteristics.
Sequence alignment of CorB with the peptidases DegP and DegQ confirmed
the conservation of key amino acid residues (His147, Asp177, and Ser252)
requisite for the proteolysis activity37 (Figure S18). AlphaFold238 prediction demonstrated that CorB shares a similar 3D structure
with DegP and DegQ (Figure S19), containing
one protease domain and two PDZ domains (Figure 8B).37,39,40 The existence of the signal peptide sequence implicates CorB is
secreted as an extracellular enzyme. As the proteases DegP and PegQ
are normally involved in degrading abnormal periplasmic and/or misfolded
proteins in E. coli,37,39,40 we thus conceived that CorB hydrolyzes the proteins
in ECM to degrade the framework of this so-called molecular glue,
and accordingly antagonizes the agglutination-inducing effect of the
cognate products encoded by corA. To test this supposition,
CorB was first experimentally assayed its proteolytic activity toward
the commercial casein. Next, CorB was found to be capable of degrading
the outer-membrane proteins (OmpA and OmpF) isolated from E. coli cells in a time-dependent manner (Figure 8C). Finally, the biomass of
SDU70-wt and DK1622-corA were treated with 1 mg/mL
of CorB, subsequent observation using SEM confirmed that ECM of these
two strains were substantially eliminated (Figure 8D). Taken together, these data strongly suggested
that proteolysis is the underlying self-resistance mechanism imparted
by CorB. We were curious as to how corB bestows resistance

of the gifted producers of a large array of
secondary metabolites and potentially industrial enzymes.2 Although many myxobacterial NPs have been described
for potential therapeutic applications, such as “cytotoxic”,
“antibacterial”, “antifungal”, and “anti-inflammatory”,
the bioactivities of a considerable number of sophisticated chemical
scaffolds still remain ambiguous.3 In fact,
microorganisms produce NPs for their own benefit, and the encrypted
secondary metabolites useless in therapeutic applications might play
an important role in coordinating the physiological development in situ. Of note, myxobacteria are a fertile ground for
such chemical ecology scenarios. For instance, the model Myxococcus
xanthus produces a small-molecule pigment DKxanthene for
modulating sporulation process.41 Ambruticin
from Sorangium cellulosum affects fruiting body formation
of M. xanthus under starvation.42 Antibiotic TA (myxovirescin) plays an important role in
the predatory behavior of M. xanthus.43 The lipid stigmalone produced by Stigmatella
aurantiaca functions as a pheromone that induces cellular
aggregation and enhances fruiting body formation.44 Coralinone represents the first experimentally validated
case for the small-molecule-regulated agglutination of myxobacteria
in liquid cultures. Romanowski and co-workers recently identified
the lipodepsipeptide selethramide that promotes motility of its native
producer belonging to Gram-negative Burkholderia,
a bacterial family sharing considerable physiological similarities
to myxobacteria.45 These examples strongly
support a close connection between developmental growth and sophisticated
small molecules deliberately encoded by myxobacteria. It is conceivable
that many more alike cases remain to be unveiled, which will provide
a new avenue to investigate the sociobiology of myxobacteria. In turn,
it might be particularly fruitful to exploit the ecology-based strategies
to unlock the silent BGCs46 for continued
natural products discovery from myxobacteria, given their distinct
life patterns (social behavior, predation, swarming, etc). Myxobacteria are one

aggregation phenotypes actually occur in most familiar NPs
producers, such as actinomycetes and myxobacteria. From the perspective
of ecology, flocculation (and biofilm formation alike) is a protective
social response that shields cells from stressful environments.47 As diffusion in flocs is severely impaired,
the outer cells protect the inner cells from harmful challenges that
cannot be achieved by single cells alone. On the other hand, the pellet
formation restricts the efficient transfer of nutrients and gases
to the center, which is adverse to growth and culture heterogeneity
and thus lowers the maximal obtainable product yield.32,48 For myxobacteria, cellular aggregation has been previously ascribed
to peptidic substances like A-factors49,50 and/or C-factor.51 The involvement of small-molecule morphogens
in coordinating this physiological process is surprising to us. It
is yet unclear if mechanistic connections exist for the signaling
pathways of coralinone and A-factors or C-factor. In addition, the
scenario that corA autonomously encodes the small
molecules regulating the morphogenesis of myxobacterial cells is reminiscent
of the quorum-sensing (QS) circuitry ubiquitous in microbes. QS systems
function to control cell density-dependent processes, such as LuxI/LuxR
in Vibrio fischeri,52 EsaI/EsaR
in Pantoea stewartii,53 and the γ-butyrolactones (GBLs) signaling systems in streptomycetes.54 Typically, each QS system is composed of a core
synthase (e.g. LuxI) governing the biosynthesis of
specific small-molecule signals (e.g. acyl-homoserine
lactone), and a cognate signal-responsive transcription regulator
(e.g. LuxR). Therefore, unraveling the molecular
underpinnings and/or signaling circuits of coralinone will lay foundations
for developing the corA-based biosensor for perturbing
and rewiring the underlying regulatory gene networks to achieve a
trade-off between essential pathways and product synthesis. Although
it is currently arduous to identify the receptor(s) of coralinone,
we speculate that it interacts with an anonymous global regulator
and thus impinge on multiple chemosensory signal transduction pathways
to display multifaceted regulatory effects. The

self-resistance means that antibiotic-producing
bacteria develop necessary survival adaptation to prevent self-toxicity
caused by the produced antibiotics.55 In
general, the self-resistance strategies include export and reduced
influx, target modification, sequestration, and enzymatic inactivation
of antibiotics.56 Although the metabolites
encoded by corA are not chemical weapons, the antagonism
between the products encoded by corA and corB conforms to the paradigm of self-resistance. We summarized
the relationship between corA and corB: corA autonomously specifies coralinone following
the textbook NRPS/PKS collinearity assembly line. The PKS moiety is
responsible for the installation of 5-methyl on the pyrazinone backbone
to exert the agglutination-inducing activity through enhancing the
secretion of extracellular substances. The gene corB encodes a protease that is exported outside the cell and hydrolyzes
extracellular proteins to abate aggregation. It was the first report
that bacteria devise a unique self-resistance machinery for the purpose
of regulating growth development instead of survival competition.
There is an enticing opportunity to understand mechanistically how
SDU70 regulates the transcription level of corA and corB to fine-tune the status of aggregation, which would
open a new avenue to study social interactions of myxobacteria, such
as biofilm formation, swarming, fruiting body, and predation, among
others. Moreover, the concerted evidence for functional relationship
between corA and corB in two distinct
genera Myxococcus and Corallococcus, alongside the phylogenetic contextualization of cor-like BGCs in myxobacterial realm, imply the generality of our findings. Strictly speaking,

relevance of the cor-like pathway and especially
the self-resistance mechanism of coralinones apparently provide the
impetus to develop foundamental counter-measures to circumvent the
tricky fermentative flocculation of myxobacteria in industry.28 As well, most nonmodel myxobacterial species
are barely tractable to in situ genetic manipulation.57 The cellular aggregation intercepts the entry
of exogenous DNA into the cells and thus hinders the genetic manipulation.
The elucidation of the self-resistance mechanism of coralinone would

Assay The agglutination assay basically
followed the method described by Velicer.62 Briefly, DK1622 strains were cultured in CTT medium, whereas SDU70
strains were cultured in VY/2 medium. The aggregation-inducing compounds
were added together with the initial inocula. After 3 days of growth,
∼2 mL of liquid cultures (in logarithmic growth stage) were
transferred into cuvettes. Samples were left static for 15 min to
visualize the clumping phenomenon. To plot the agglutination curves,
the absorbance readings (600 nm) were measured on a UV-8000 spectrophotometer
at differential intervals within 4 h. Decreasing the absorbance represents
the settling of agglutinated cell clumps. Data points are the means
of three replicates per strain. The agglutination assay basically

BGCs In total, all the 253 myxobacterial genomes deposited
in RefSeq database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) were downloaded as of
mid-2022 and analyzed using antiSMASH 6.033 to identify biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Subsequently, we
wrote a Python script to fetch the targeted BGCs from the obtained
data set. The constraints were: 1) no more than three adjacent genes
were NRPS and/or PKS genes; 2) NRPS/PKS contain two A domains, no
more than one C domain, one KS domain, one AT domain, one TE domain;
3) other variable domains (e.g. KR or MT) could be
flexibly incorporated. The returned 135 hits were manually checked
and trimmed to filter out 110 putative BGCs that were closely associated
with the biosynthesis of 5-methylated pyrazinones. Phylogenetic comparison
of all the cor-like BGCs was performed by CORASON
