["Pseudomonas syringae is a phytopathogenic bacterium widely spread on terrestrial plants. Sulfodiaminophosphinyl tripeptide Phaseolotoxins (PHTs), produced by P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and P. syringae pv. actinidiae, represent a kind of antimetabolic phytotoxins. PHTs inhibit host cell Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase) activity and induce Arginine auxotrophic phenotype. The biosynthesis of PHT is temperature dependent, being optically produced at around 18\u2009\u00b0C, while blocked above 28\u2009\u00b0C. PHT resistant OTCase ArgK acts as a functional replacement of housekeeping OTCase ArgF, which is the acting target of PHT, to confer PHT producers with self-resistance. It was postulated that argK might be regulated directly by a PHT biosynthetic precursor and indirectly by temperature with an unknown manner. Neither transcriptional regulator nor thermal regulation related protein encoding gene was detected from PHT biosynthetic gene cluster. The tripeptide, Cit-Ala-hArg, was identified to be a by-product of PHT biosynthetic pathway in this report. Formation of Cit-Ala-hArg was catalyzed by ArgK with tripeptide Orn-Ala-hArg and carbamyl phosphate as substrates. It showed that ArgK not only provided alternative Arginine source as reported previously, but also controlled the production of PHTs by converting PHT biosynthetic precursors to nontoxic Cit-Ala-hArg reservoir for producers\u2019 self-defense.", "Pseudomonas syringae (P. syringae) is a group of phytopathogenic bacterial species which include more than 50 pathovars. P. syringae spreads on most of the terrestrial plants and induces a wide variety of diseases12. Phosphorotriamidate natural product Phaseolotoxins (PHTs) producers, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and P. syringae pv. actinidiae, cause halo blight disease on beans and bacterial canker on kiwifruits respectively345. PHTs [N\u03b4(N\u2019-sulfo-diaminophosphinyl)-ornithyl-alanyl-homoarginine] were readily degraded by nonspecific peptidases in planta to produce compound N\u03b4 (N\u2019-sulfo-diaminophosphinyl)-ornithine (PSOrn)678. PSOrns are irreversible inhibitor of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase) attributed to the chemical structure similarity with tetrahedral intermediates in OTCase mechanism6. OTCase catalyzes the formation of Citrulline with Ornithine and carbamyl phosphate as substrates. Inhibition of OTCase blocks the biosynthesis of Arginine in vivo and leads to a reduction of protein synthesis9. In addition, PHTs are competitive inhibitors to mammalian and bacterial OTCase, including the OTCase ArgF of PHT producing strain P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A101112. So, PHT producing Pseudomonas cells must employ certain approaches to protect themselves from being killed by their own second metabolic products.", "PHT resistant OTCase ArgK, encoded by argK, is a well-known self-resistance conferring element to PHT producers131415. In P. syringae pv. phaseolicola cells, ArgK acts as a functional replacement of housekeeping OTCase ArgF to provide an alternative Arginine source whenever ArgF is inhibited by PHTs316. PHT biosynthetic gene cluster contains 23 genes (24.8\u2009kb), which organized into five transcriptional units, two monocistronic units (argK and phtL) and three operons171819. Biosynthesis of PHT is temperature dependent, being optimized between 18\u2009\u00b0C and 20\u2009\u00b0C, while blocked above 28\u2009\u00b0C2021. Resistant gene argK expressed at both 18\u2009\u00b0C and 28\u2009\u00b0C. However its transcriptional level was much lower at 28\u2009\u00b0C17. It was postulated that argK might be regulated directly by a PHT biosynthetic precursor and indirectly by temperature. A protein-binding DNA motif has been found out in argK promoter region, while no repressor protein involved in thermoregulation of PHT biosynthesis has been identified so far222324.", "Gene phtL expressed at both 18\u2009\u00b0C and 28\u2009\u00b0C, and showed no quantity difference at transcriptional level17. PhtL, the product of phtL, is a bidomain enzyme which shows distantly similarity to pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PS). It has been proposed that phtL played a regulatory function in PHT biosynthesis1725. The amidinotransferase homolog encoded by amtA, was proposed to catalyze the conversion of Lysine to homoarginine (hArg) using Arginine as guanidyl group donors26. Two ATP grasp family peptide ligase encoding genes, phtQ and phtU were recognized and deduced to catalyze the formation of amido bonds of PHT peptide scaffolds Orn-Ala-hArg27. N-Sulfodiaminophosphinyl groups attach to the delta amino group of Ornithine residues give the chemical structure of PHTs. The chronological order of individual steps involved in PHT biosynthesis and the three Nitrogen-Phosphorus bonds (N-P bonds) biosynthetic mechanism remain poorly understood.", "Here, precursor ion scan (PIS) mass spectrometry, feeding experiments and enzyme assay were employed in the identification of PHT biosynthetic pathway by-products, tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg, which indicating a dual role of ArgK for PHT producers self-defense.", "Results", "Results", "PIS mass spectrometry to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates", "PIS mass spectrometry to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates", "PIS mass spectrometry to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates", "PHTs were detected in the cultural supernatants of wild type strain P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A by High resolution mass spectrometry (HR MS) and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis.
