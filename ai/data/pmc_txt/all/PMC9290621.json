["Abstract", "Today, one of the biggest challenges in antibiotic research is a targeted prioritization of natural compound producer strains and an efficient dereplication process to avoid undesired rediscovery of already known substances. Thereby, genome sequence-driven mining strategies are often superior to wet-lab experiments because they are generally faster and less resource-intensive. In the current study, we report on the development of a novel in silico screening approach to evaluate the genetic potential of bacterial strains to produce protein synthesis inhibitors (PSI), which was termed the protein synthesis inhibitor ('psi\u2019) target gene footprinting approach = \u03a8-footprinting. The strategy is based on the occurrence of protein synthesis associated self-resistance genes in genome sequences of natural compound producers. The screening approach was applied to 406 genome sequences of actinomycetes strains from the DSMZ strain collection, resulting in the prioritization of 15 potential PSI producer strains. For twelve of them, extract samples showed protein synthesis inhibitory properties in in vitro transcription/translation assays. For four strains, namely Saccharopolyspora flava DSM 44771, Micromonospora aurantiaca DSM 43813, Nocardioides albertanoniae DSM 25218, and Geodermatophilus nigrescens DSM 45408, the protein synthesis inhibitory substance amicoumacin was identified by HPLC-MS analysis, which proved the functionality of the in silico screening approach.", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical Abstract\u03a8-footprinting approach.", "Graphical Abstract\u03a8-footprinting approach.", "\u03a8-footprinting approach.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), multidrug resistance is one of the major threats to public health (1). While the number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria is constantly increasing, there has been a steady decline in the discovery and development of new druggable anti-infectives over the past years (2,3). Thus, there is an urgent need for novel antibiotic active substances. One of the major challenges in current antibiotic screening programs is the fast dereplication of already known compounds. Indeed, most antibiotics were discovered during the golden age of antibiotic discovery from the 1940s to the 1960s (4). Back then, mainly the classical screening approach was applied, which included the isolation of soil-derived microorganisms that were screened for antimicrobial activity, a procedure known as the Waksman platform. However, many years of repeated application of this screening procedure mainly led to the rediscovery of already known substances, making it necessary to develop and apply new strategies for drug discovery. One such new approach, which we also refer to in the current manuscript, is represented by the mode of action (MoA)-based Bacillus subtilis bioreporter panel, recently reported by Wex et\u00a0al.\u00a0(5), which allows for fast and efficient combined bioactivity and MoA screening of antibiotic producer strains. The bioreporter assay employs selected biomarkers indicative of interference with the main bacterial metabolic pathways and thereby enables to selectively follow up and prioritize metabolic activities of interest (5). This MoA-based bioreporter assay was used to screen strains from the T\u00fcbingen actinomycetes strain collection for novel natural compounds (5). Preceding this study, the T\u00fcbingen strain collection had been subjected to a bioactivity test using the newly developed 96-well microplate system, designed to rapidly screen actinomycetes strain collections in agar plug assays (6). From a set of 500 natural product producers, 270 strains showed antibiotic activity against B. subtilis and were tested against the bioreporter panel sensing different types of metabolic stresses. Thereby, the bioreporter B. subtilis PbmrC-lacZ selectively responded to ribosomal stalling as a metabolic stress signal (5). Overall, six strains from the T\u00fcbingen strain collection, namely T\u00fc 2975, T\u00fc 3180, T\u00fc 6430, KNN 49.3e, T\u00fc 2108, and A 4/2 induced the B. subtilis PbmrC-lacZ bioreporter and were shown to produce protein synthesis inhibitors (PSIs), whereby T\u00fc 2975 produced pristinamycin, T\u00fc 3180 griseoviridin/viridogrisein, T\u00fc 6430 pactamycin, KNN 49.3e amicetin, T\u00fc 2108 berninamycin C, and A 4/2 cycloheximide (5). Cycloheximide was probably found rather accidentally, as A 4/2 only caused an ambiguous signal in the bioreporter assay and cycloheximide is known to act as eukaryotic PSI exclusively. In general, the bioreporter panel proved to be a highly efficient and sensitive tool for rapid compound identification and target deconvolution and allowed to identify natural products from strains of the T\u00fcbingen strains collection that had not been assigned to them before.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), multidrug resistance is one of the major threats to public health (1).

Even if these microorganisms have been extensively exploited over the past decades, they are still valuable sources for novel natural compounds. Bioinformatic analysis of >170 000 bacterial genomes and several thousand metagenome sequences suggests that overall only 3% of the genomic potential for natural product biosynthesis has been discovered so far and that especially the genus Streptomyces, belonging to the heterogeneous group of the actinomycetes, has a huge untapped potential for the production of novel secondary metabolites (11). The antibiotic encoding genes are usually organized as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in the genome of the producer strains (12). On average, Streptomyces genomes harbor 40 BGC (13), whereby the majority (\u223c90%) of all clusters is suggested to be silent, implying that the respective antibiotics are not produced under standard lab conditions (14). Bioinformatic tools and databases, such as antiSMASH, enable the prediction of BGCs in genome sequences (15) and allow genome mining of natural compound producers. Producer strains can be prioritized bioinformatically, e.g. by screening genome sequences for potential self-resistance genes. Specialized tools and databases such as the \u2018Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker\u2019 (ARTS) allow for an automated prediction for potential resistance genes (16). The scientific background behind this data-mining attempt is that self-resistance mechanisms of natural compound producers can provide information of the MoA of the produced bioactive compound and can help to identify the encoding BGCs. For example, the molecular target of the cystobactamids was identified by studying the self-resistance mechanism in the myxobacterial producer organism Cystobacter sp. (17). Here, the gene cysO encodes a putative protein belonging to a family of pentapeptide repeat protein with a proven resistance function against type II topoisomerase drugs. cysO is part of the cystobactamid BGC and the implied function as potential resistance factor against type II topoisomerase drugs paved the way to disclose the MoA of the new family of cystobactamid antibiotics as topoisomerase inhibitors (18). The cystobactamid example shows that the search for potential resistance genes can help predict the MoA of the associated antibiotic and identify its encoding BGC. A similar example is shown by the anticancer agent salinosporamide A from Salinispora tropica CNB-440, a compound identified as a proteasome inhibitor due to the presence of a redundant proteasome subunit gene as part of the salinosporamide BGC (19). Following up on this observation, 86 Salinispora genomes were browsed for the occurrence of duplicated housekeeping genes that co-localized with BGCs. Thereby, a thiotetronic acid antibiotic BGC was found to be co-localized with a putative fatty acid synthase (FAS) resistance gene, which disclosed the MoA of the thiotetronic acid compounds as FAS inhibitors (20). Accordingly, for the antibiotics novobiocin (gyrase B), platensin (FabB/F)\u00a0and griselimycin (DnaN), it is known that target-duplicated resistance genes are co-clustered with their encoding BGCs. These examples demonstrate the rationale of target-directed genome mining strategies (20). ARTS is a computational tool that takes this observation into account and enables the computer-aided search for potential self-resistance genes in bacterial genome sequences (21). ARTS predicts putative resistance genes based on three criteria: (i) duplication of genes, (ii) localization within a BGC\u00a0and (iii) evidence for a horizontal gene transfer event (HGT). A defined set of core (\u2018housekeeping\u2019) genes is used as a reference to identify essential core genes, defines duplication thresholds and infers HGT events. Traceability of HGT was implemented as a search criterion since antibiotic resistance genes are often transferred via HGT amongst bacteria and transfer events can be deduced from differences in the codon usage or GC content of DNA sequences compared to the rest of the genome (16).

We focused on PSIs since the bacterial ribosome is a hotspot for many successful antibiotics, involving important drugs from different compound classes, e.g. aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, lincosamides, pleuromutilins thiopeptides, or streptogramins (22). The bacterial ribosome is one of the most conserved functional units of the bacterial cell. It consists of the small 30S and the large 50S subunit, whereby the subunits are made up of >50 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and three rRNAs (23S, 16S\u00a0and 5S). Ribosomal RNA represents the main target for antibiotics (23). A prominent example of a PSI is the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin, which inhibits protein synthesis by interacting with the 16S rRNA and 20 ribosomal proteins of the 30S subunit (24). Streptomycin irreversibly binds to the 16S rRNA and the S12 protein, which are the main target sites (25). It inhibits the initiation process of protein synthesis (26) and causes decoding errors, which result in incorrect amino acids being incorporated into the nascent polypeptide chain (27). An example of a 50S subunit-binding PSI is the oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid, which inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the ribosomal 50S subunit. Linezolid binds to the A-site of the PTC, interacting with various 23S rRNA nucleotides and the ribosomal S3 protein (28). Although the bacterial ribosome is a target for numerous different antibiotics, not all promising binding sites are therapeutically exploited so far, as exemplified by the PSIs evernimicin and negamycin. Negamycin is a small pseudopeptide with potent bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria, which binds at a position near the A-site of the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome next to the binding site of the well-known PSI tetracycline (29). Evernimicin is an oligosaccharide antibiotic, which interacts with a specific set of nucleotides of the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit, which are distinct from the binding sites of other known ribosome-targeting substances (30).", "Based on the above-mentioned knowledge on BGC identification, we aimed to establish a genome sequence-based strategy to prioritize natural compound producers with a special emphasis on producers of PSIs.

Several berninamycin producer strains are known, whereby the production of berninamycin derivatives differs in the various producer strains (Supplemental material Figure S3). A comparison between the known berninamycin BGC from S. bernensis and the BGC from T\u00fc 2108 revealed that the predicted gene products show high amino acid sequence homologies (90\u2013100%) amongst each other (Table 2). To identify potential self-resistance genes for strain T\u00fc 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatics software tool ARTS v. 2.0. As mentioned above, ARTS detects potential self-resistance genes based on the following individual three criteria: (i) duplicated core genes, (ii) core genes localized within a BGC\u00a0and (iii) core genes with incongruent phylogeny (16). For T\u00fc 2108, the suggested self-resistance genes were sorted with regard to genes associated with protein synthesis as a metabolic function. Concerning protein synthesis associated genes, ARTS employs a reference set of 100 core genes related to protein synthesis (16). For T\u00fc 2108 it was found that 15 protein synthesis-associated genes met the above mentioned criteria for resistance patterns: In total, nine duplicated core genes, 13 core genes located in a BGC, and six phylogenetically distinct core genes were predicted (Table 3). The majority of the detected core genes present in a BGC, mapped to the berninamycin cluster BGC 6_3 (Table 2). Here, the core genes are organized at the left and right borders of the berninamycin BGC 6_3 (Figure 3) and code for potential ribosomal proteins (L4, S12, S10, uS7), as well as elongation factors G and TU (Table 2). For instance, ORF 01243 encoding the putative elongation factor TU (EF-TU) was duplicated and phylogenetically distinct from another putative EF-TU encoding gene (TIGR00485) present in the T\u00fc 2108 genome. A similar genetic organization was found for the berninamycin A BGC (berA-J) in S. bernensis (Figure 3). Notably, also a berJ homologous gene is present within BGC 6_3 of T\u00fc 2108, which codes for a potential 23S rRNA methyltransferase, an enzyme well-known for conferring resistance to ribosome-targeting drugs (43). However, this gene, which most likely represents the actual berninamycin self-resistance gene, was not detected with ARTS, which is due to the fact that it was not included in the list of core genes. The predominant occurrence of these protein synthesis-associated core genes in the proximity of the berninamycin BGC indicates a potential linkage to self-resistance mechanisms. This finding supports the hypothesis that resistance genes can provide an indication of the mode of action of a BGC-encoded secondary metabolite.", "Berninamycin belongs to the class of pyridine-containing thiopeptides and targets the 50S ribosomal subunit in a similar manner as described for thiostrepton (42). Several berninamycin producer strains are known, whereby the production of berninamycin derivatives differs in the various producer strains (Supplemental material Figure S3). A comparison between the known berninamycin BGC from S. bernensis and the BGC from T\u00fc 2108 revealed that the predicted gene products show high amino acid sequence homologies (90\u2013100%) amongst each other (Table 2). To identify potential self-resistance genes for strain T\u00fc 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatics software tool ARTS v. 2.0. As mentioned above, ARTS detects potential self-resistance genes based on the following individual three criteria: (i) duplicated core genes, (ii) core genes localized within a BGC\u00a0and (iii) core genes with incongruent phylogeny (16). For T\u00fc 2108, the suggested self-resistance genes were sorted with regard to genes associated with protein synthesis as a metabolic function. Concerning protein synthesis associated genes, ARTS employs a reference set of 100 core genes related to protein synthesis (16). For T\u00fc 2108 it was found that 15 protein synthesis-associated genes met the above mentioned criteria for resistance patterns: In total, nine duplicated core genes, 13 core genes located in a BGC, and six phylogenetically distinct core genes were predicted (Table 3). The majority of the detected core genes present in a BGC, mapped to the berninamycin cluster BGC 6_3 (Table 2).

To validate the approach, genome sequences of 47 known PSI producers were analyzed with ARTS. Here, it was found that several known PSI producers showed high numbers (>20) of protein synthesis core genes, fulfilling at least one of the three criteria mentioned for the prediction of self-resistance genes, defined as \u2018hit genes\u2019. For example, the anisomycin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenus displayed 42 hit genes and the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea 51 hit genes (Table 4). The majority of the identified hit genes of the PSI producers were characterized as phylogenetic incongruencies (76%) and only a minor part represented core gene duplications (46%) or gene localization within a BGC (26%) (Supplementary Table S3). Among the hit genes, seven core genes appeared regularly, which were rpsE, rpsL, rplC, rplD, rplK, rplQ\u00a0and rplV encoding for the putative ribosomal proteins S5, S12, L3, L4, L11, L17\u00a0and L22, respectively (Table 4). For all these genes, it was shown in previous work that they play an essential role in conferring resistance against PSIs. For example, mutations in rpsE, rpsL, and rplC resulted in altered S5, S12\u00a0and L3 proteins that conferred resistance against spectinomycin, streptomycin, and linezolid/tiamulin, respectively, in E. coli (44\u201346). Mutations in rplD and rplV were shown to result in altered L4 and L22 proteins, respectively, conferring resistance to erythromycin in E. coli (47,48). Mutations in rplK resulted in an altered L11 protein conferring resistance to thiostrepton in Thermus thermophilus (49) and mutations in rplQ resulted in an altered L17 protein conferring resistance to erythromycin in B. subtilis (50). According to these observations, the seven ribosomal genes were regarded as PSI 'resistance indicator genes\u2019 (RI genes). The RI genes were found to be mainly present in PSI producer strains with a high number of PSI hit genes, e.g. S. roseochromogenus and S. erythraea with six and five RI genes, respectively (Table 4). However, some of the RI genes were also found in PSI producers with a lower number of hit genes, such as Streptomyces pristinaespiralis PR11 and Streptomyces pactum, with only one RI gene each. Furthermore, there were also examples of known PSI producers that showed neither a high abundance of hit genes nor any RI gene (Table 4). To examine whether the accumulation of hit and RI genes is a specific phenomenon for PSI producers, we additionally analyzed numerous genome sequences of antibiotic producers, which are known not to produce PSIs as a comparison. Thereby, it was found that the non-PSI producers had generally low numbers of protein synthesis-related hit genes (<20) and none of the strains contained any of the seven RI genes (Table 5). Thus, we concluded that if a bacterial strain has (i) a large number of PSI hit genes (>20) and in addition (ii) two or more RI gene(s) it is likely to be a PSI producer strain.", "Based on the knowledge gained above, an in silico screening approach was developed, capitalizing on the occurrence of protein synthesis associated self-resistance genes to evaluate the genetic potential of bacterial strains to produce a PSI.

Methanolic culture extracts were prepared from samples harvested at the optimal production time point as reported above and protein synthesis inhibiting activity was verified in ivTT assays. For compound purification, semi-preparative HPLC was performed with the culture extracts. The fractions were collected in time-based mode every minute for 25 min and were analyzed for PSI activity via ivTT. Assay analysis revealed that individual purified fractions from all five DSM strain samples (DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\u00a0and DSM 44771) showed significant inhibition of the ivTT assay (Figure 7, Supplementary Figures S7-S10).

The HPLC chromatograms of the extract samples of F8 of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218, and DSM 44771 of F8 showed a prominent peak at a retention time (RT) 7.2 min, as representatively shown for the sample DSM 25218 (Figure 8A). HPLC-MS analysis of the F8 samples of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\u00a0and DSM 44771 revealed one distinct peak in positive and negative mode at RT 7.2 min (Figure 8B and\u00a0C).

They also show potent antibacterial activities against clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (54,55). Amicoumacin affects bacterial growth by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, specifically at the E-site codon of the mRNA, and thereby inhibits the translation process. This position is a rather unusual target site and implies a unique way of translation inhibition for amicoumacin (56). Amicoumacin has been reported as a natural product from different microbial producers, involving Gram-positive bacteria, such as certain representatives of Bacillus and Nocardia (54,57,58) but also the Gram-negative producer Xenorhabdus bovienii (53). In addition, our data revealed that amicoumacin is produced by various types of actinomycetes, namely Saccharopolyspora flava DSM 44771, Micromonospora aurantiaca DSM 43813, Nocardioides albertanoniae DSM 25218, and Geodermatophilus nigrescens DSM 45408, which belong to different orders of the phylum Actinobacteria, such as Pseudonocardiales, Micromonosporales, Propionobacteriales, and Geodermatophilales, respectively (Supplementary Figure S12). Thus, the ability to produce amicoumacin seems to be quite conserved across different groups of bacterial organisms, hinting at a so far unknown general biological function. The reason why we have not been able to dereplicate the substance based on BGC predictions is that the respective amicoumacin BGCs could not be identified by antiSMASH analysis. The amicoumacin BGC was described as nonribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid BGC for the producer strain Xenorhabdus bovieni (53). However, the BGC is not part of the MIBiG repository and thus is not accessible as a reference in the antiSMASH database, which is why the BGCs were not identified by antiSMASH analysis for the amicoumacin producers of the DSMZ strain collection. Remarkably, also detailed manual sequence analyses did not lead to the identification of the amicoumacin BGCs. We therefore assume that the actinobacterial amicoumacin biosynthesis (high GC content bacteria) proceeds differently and is encoded by a strikingly different type of BGC than in the known producers of Xenorhabdus and Bacillus (low GC content bacteria). If so, this would speak for a convergent evolution of the amicoumacin BGCs in the phylogenetically distantly related producer strains. The fact that we have detected amicoumacin as PSI in our samples underscores the feasibility and reliability of the \u03a8-footprinting strategy. The advantage of this method is that it is purely in silico-based. Conventional antibiotic screening approaches are generally much more labor-intensive since they involve screening a large number of strains, followed by extensive compound purifications and chemical analytics with the risk that the identified bioactive substance is already known. The \u03a8-footprinting strategy is a fast and efficient method to specifically prioritize potential producers of PSIs based on genome-sequence information and thereby speeds up the lead discovery process. Until now, it was not possible to transfer this method to antibiotics with a different mode of action. The derived in silico strategy is so far only applicable for the prioritization of potential PSI producer strains, due to the number of core genes used as a reference set in the ARTS analysis. For the metabolic function of protein synthesis \u223c100 core genes are defined in the reference set, which are significantly lower core gene numbers for other metabolic functions, such as DNA metabolism- or cell envelope-associated functions (16). Certainly, not all PSI producers can be detected with the \u03a8-footprinting approach, as for example shown for Streptomyces griseus, a known producer of the PSI streptomycin (Table 4). Another limitation of the approach might be that it employs known RI genes as indicator genes, which could prevent the discovery of really novel PSIs with different MoAs. In this context, however, it would be possible to adopt a less stringent \u03a8-footprinting run and exclude RI genes as a selection criterion, which would allow for a more explorative screening attempt. However, following the defined criteria for \u03a8-footprinting, which are (i) a high number (\u226520) of PSI hit genes and (ii) the additional abundance of RI genes, allows a reliable pre-selection of potential PSI producers. This was proven by the identification of twelve PSI producer strains from the 15 \u03a8-selected strains in the current study, which inhibited protein synthesis in ivTT assays. In addition, the responsible PSI substances (amicoumacin A and B) were identified for four of these strains. Prioritized strains for which protein synthesis inhibiting activities were observed but no PSI identified yet are subject to ongoing work.", "Amicoumacins are known PSIs, belonging to a class of isocoumarin antibiotics with antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities (53).
