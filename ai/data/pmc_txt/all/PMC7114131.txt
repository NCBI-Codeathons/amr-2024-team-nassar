 Surfactin, as one of the most powerful
biosurfactants, can be widely
applied in agriculture, food, and pharmaceutics. However, low biosynthesis
efficiency is the major obstacle in its commercialization. Here, we
used nanoparticles to increase the surfactin production in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MT45 through enhancing
the secretion (the key step of surfactin biosynthesis). The results
showed that the surfactin titer increased from 4.93 to 7.15 g/L in
the flask and from 5.94 to 9.18 g/L in a 7 L bioreactor by adding
5 g/L Fe nanoparticles. They were the highest titers in the reported
wild-type strain. Our results indicated that Fe nanoparticles enhanced
the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin.
Moreover, Fe nanoparticles increased the permeability of cell membranes,
resulting in a more efficient secretion of surfactin. This study provides
an efficient strategy for increasing the biosynthesis of microbial
metabolites and provides new insights into the nanoparticles’
impacts on microbes. Introduction Introduction Surfactin is a green
biosurfactant produced by various strains
of Bacillus spp.1 Surfactin
has attracted widespread attention owing to its extraordinary surface
activity, low toxicity, high environmental compatibility, and various
excellent bioactivities.2,3 Surfactin has high market
value and broad application prospect in various industrial fields,
including agriculture, food, pharmaceutics, daily chemicals, oil recovery,
and bioremediation.4−6 However, the low biosynthesis efficiency of surfactin
is the major obstacle in its commercialization.7 Surfactin is a green

the surfactin
production such as the optimizations of medium and process parameters.7,8 Genetic modification has been also widely applied to increase the
surfactin production, such as the substitution of the native promoter
with other promoters like PrepU,9 Pspac,10 and Pg3.11 Especially, the surfactin titer could be increased efficiently
by enhancing the expression of potent surfactin exporter.12 For example, the overexpression of gene swrC associated with secretion improved the surfactin titer
by approximately 1.5-fold in Bacillus subtilis THY-7,13 and the overexpression of both
genes swrC and acrB improved the
surfactin titer by 70% in B. subtilis 168.14 These results indicated that secretion
was very important for surfactin production. Although the genetic
manipulation is efficient in strengthening the secretion of metabolites,
it is generally difficult to carry out in wild-type strains, as many
parts are undefined.15 As a result, it
is important to develop strategies to strengthen the secretion of
surfactin for increasing the production in wild-type strains. Optimization of fermentation is effective in increasing

with their macroscopic counterparts because of their chemical properties,
large surface-to-volume ratio, and unique quantum effects.16 In previous studies, nanoparticles have shown
the potential to improve the production of metabolites.17 For instance, SiO2, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles could
increase the titers of ethanol,17 acetic
acid,17 cephalosporin,18 and erythromycin19 by 166.1,
29.1, 60.0, and 81.5%, respectively. These results were mainly attributed
to the increase in biomass or oxygen transfer efficiency. However,
the molecular mechanism of this high production is still unclear. Nanoparticles (NPs) often possess different properties compared

cells to leak,20,21 which resulted in cellular metabolic
disorder,22 membrane rupture,23 and even the release of the intracellular substance.22 Therefore, we hypothesized that the nanoparticles
might improve the production of metabolites through increasing the
secretion by membrane leakage. Considering the toxicity of nanoparticles
to cells, it is important to find the optimal nanomaterial at the
optimal concentration for regulating the interaction between nanoparticles
and microbes. Moreover, the effects of nanoparticles on the surfactin

of Different Nanomaterials on the Surfactin Production To
increase the surfactin production, we evaluated the performance
of seven nanomaterials, including Fe, Fe2O3,
Fe3O4, MgO, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT),
SiO2, and TiO2 NPs. As most nanomaterials affected
cells’ growth and metabolism at concentrations between 0 and
0.5 g/L,20,24 we detected the effects of nanomaterials
on the surfactin production at different concentrations (Figure 1). There was no significant
effect of MWCNT and SiO2 NPs on the surfactin titer with
a concentration of 0.05 or 0.5 g/L. Because MgO25 and TiO226 were able
to penetrate the cells, a higher concentration (0.5 g/L) led to a
dramatic reduction of the surfactin titer. Fe3O4 NPs led to the reduction of the surfactin titer at a low concentration
of 0.05 g/L. Moreover, both 0.05 and 0.5 g/L Fe2O3 NPs led to the reduction of the surfactin titer. It might because
Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 have excellent
antibacterial properties.27 The surfactin
titer significantly increased to 4.91 ± 0.13 g/L (17.18% higher)
and 5.41 ± 0.11 g/L (29.21% higher) with the addition of 0.05

representative size
distribution profile and morphology of Fe NPs. According to transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, Fe NPs were spherical (Figure S1A), with an average size of 58.45 nm
(Figure S1B). The dynamic light scattering
(DLS) results showed that Fe NPs formed aggregates with a Z-average value of 342 nm in the medium (Figure S1C). The aggregation became more severe at 23 h with
a Z-average value of 825 nm (Figure S1C). Similar results were also reported in previous
studies.28 In general, this aggregation
might be due to the high content of ionic salts in the medium.28 The ζ-potentials of Fe NPs and B. amyloliquefaciens MT45 were −7.3 ±
1.3 and −40.5 ± 1.5 mV (Figure S1D). After B. amyloliquefaciens MT45
was cultivated with Fe NPs for 23 h, the ζ-potential of the
surface charge of the cells was upregulated to −34.8 ±

that electrostatic force should greatly contribute to the interaction

in a Flask The effects of different concentrations of Fe
NPs on cell growth and the surfactin production were studied. As the
concentrations of Fe NPs increased from 0 to 10 g/L, there was no
effect on the cell concentration (Figure 2A). However, the surfactin production increased
gradually (Figure 2B). With the addition of 5 g/L Fe NPs, the surfactin titer reached
the highest value of 7.20 ± 0.40 g/L, which was 37.14% higher
than that of the control (without Fe NPs). A higher dosage of Fe NPs
(10 g/L) did not further improve the titer of surfactin. Therefore,
five grams per liter of Fe NPs was chosen as the best concentration
for surfactin production. The effects of different concentrations of Fe

a Bioreactor Effects of Fe NPs on Cell Growth and Surfactin Production in
a Bioreactor Effects of Fe NPs on Cell Growth and Surfactin Production in
a Bioreactor To enhance the surfactin production, we further
evaluated the effects of Fe NPs on B. amyloliquefaciens MT45 in a bioreactor (Figure S2). In
this fed-batch fermentation, the cell concentration reached a stationary
phase until 46 h, which was extended by 10 h compared with fermentation
in a flask (Figure 3A). The cell concentration in control was 4.80 × 109 CFU/mL, and it was increased to 5.14 × 109 CFU/mL
by adding Fe NPs for 60 h (Figure 3A). Without Fe NPs, the surfactin titer in a 7 L bioreactor
increased to 5.94 ± 0.03 g/L, which was 20.49% higher than that
in a flask (Figure 3B). It was because feeding in bioreactor extended the cell growth for nearly 10 h during
fermentation. In addition, the aeration and agitation in the bioreactor
made the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KLa) higher than that in the flask.8 To enhance the surfactin production, we further
evaluated the effects of Fe NPs on B. amyloliquefaciens MT45 in a bioreactor (Figure S2). In

with Fe NPs in a 7 L bioreactor for enhancing the surfactin production.
After the addition of Fe NPs, the surfactin titer significantly increased
to 9.18 ± 0.05 g/L (Figure 3B), which was 54.55% higher than that of control (without
Fe NPs). Obviously, the effects of Fe NPs on the surfactin production
in the 7 L bioreactor were much more enhanced than that in the flask.
These results indicated that Fe NPs had positive effects on the surfactin
production not only in the flask but also in large-scale applications.
It would promote the industrial application of Fe NPs on the surfactin
production. According to the reports, the surfactin titer in this
study was also the highest value reported for wild-type strain in
a bioreactor (Table 1). B. amyloliquefaciens MT45 was cultivated

at 23 h (Figure 2D),
we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to explore the morphological
changes of the cells at this time. Compared with the untreated cells
(Figure 4A), the treated
cells became wrinkled and abnormal after cultivation with Fe NPs (Figure 4B,C). Driven by electrostatic
force, Fe NPs surrounded the bacteria and even adhered to the cells
(Figure 4C,D). It was
apparent that the attachment of Fe NPs to the membranes of microbes
was a critical initial process. We used TEM to study the microscopic
changes in more detail. Compared with the untreated cells (Figure 4E), the treated cells
had several voids in the membranes that might have been induced due
to physical damage (Figure 4F,G). Although the membranes were damaged to release intracellular
substances (Figure 4F), the cells could still maintain the physiological activity (Figure 2C). According to
the reports, once the nanoparticles adhered to the membrane, driven
by intermolecular and surface forces, it could lead to lipid restructuring
and local deformation.45,46 Furthermore, these processes
could lead to the formation of transient voids and membrane leakage
(Figure 4F).47,48 Therefore, we speculated that even a slight leakage increased the
permeability of membranes, thus improving the secretion of surfactin. Since the synthetic rate of surfactin was the highest

of Gene Expression Transcriptomic Analysis
of Gene Expression As the synthetic
rate of surfactin was the highest at 23 h (Figure 2D), here, we further used transcriptomic
analysis to validate the effects of Fe NPs on gene expression in B. amyloliquefaciens MT45. A total of 641 genes were
differentially expressed after the addition of Fe NPs (Table S1). Among them, 166 genes were upregulated
(P value <0.05, fold change >1.50) and 475
genes
were downregulated (P value <0.05, fold change
<0.67). We evaluated 11 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to
confirm that the RNA-seq was reliable by quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR) (Table 2). These
641 DEGs were associated with 15 metabolic pathways through the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis (Figure 5). Thirty-one genes were upregulated
in the pathways of lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, carbohydrate
metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, and most (45.16%) of them were
associated with surfactin synthesis. The pathway of membrane transport
was downregulated, which could be attributed to damage to membranes.
According to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, the genes in
five GO terms of electron transfer were downregulated (Table S2). These were “NADH dehydrogenase
(ubiquinone) activity” (GO: 0008137), “NAD(P)H dehydrogenase
(quinone) activity” (GO: 0003955), “respiratory chain”
(GO: 0070469), “peroxidase activity” (GO: 0004601),
and “NAD binding” (GO: 0051287). A previous study reported
that the downregulation of genes in these GO terms could block the
electron transfer.49 Then, these leaked
electrons could combine with molecular oxygen, causing the overgeneration
of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), oxidative stress, and membrane
leakage.49 In contrast, the expressions
of genes involved in the GO term “oxidoreductase activity”
(GO: 0016491) were upregulated (Table S2). It indicated that the antioxidative defense system was also triggered
after the addition of Fe NPs. As the synthetic

Surfactin
synthesis could be divided into six modules according
to the genetic functions, including sucrose transport, glycolysis,
and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, fatty
acid biosynthesis, modularly enzymatic synthesis of surfactin, and
secretion and resistance of surfactin.12 In these modules, 20 genes were significantly changed, and all of
them were upregulated (Figure 6A and Table S3). In the sucrose
transport module, the upregulation (2.44-fold) of sacP encoding a sucrose transporter might be related to the increase
of sucrose uptake. In the module of secretion and resistance of surfactin, acrB was a unique gene for the secretion of surfactin in B. amyloliquefaciens MT45. A surfactin exporter (encoded
by acrB) and self-resistance-associated proteins
(encoded by lia gene cluster) could export the surfactin
synergistically and efficiently.14 Therefore,
the upregulation of acrB and liaH (2.06- and 2.14-fold) might be related to the increase of secretion
of surfactin. Surfactin

(encoded by fabH), fatty acid synthases (encoded

carboxylase complex (encoded by fabD and accA) played important roles in starting the synthesis and
elongation of fatty acid chains, and the overexpression of these genes
could result in higher levels of surfactin.14 Fortunately, these genes were all significantly upregulated (Figure 6A). It was because
the cells need to repair the damaged membranes by enhancing the expression
of glycerolipid synthase (Table 3) and fatty acid synthesis. As a result, it might provide

In addition, we found that genes associated with amino acid metabolism,
glycolysis, and TCA cycle were upregulated, which might provide more
amino acids and energy for surfactin synthesis (Figure 6A). Meanwhile, all genes in modularly enzymatic
synthesis of surfactin (srfAD, srfAB, srfAA, and srfAC) were upregulated

that energy and precursors were diverted to surfactin synthesis more
efficiently.14 In addition, we found that genes associated with amino acid metabolism,

Fe NPs induced leakage in membranes through
physical damage and oxidative stress, the concentration of living
cells was not changed. It might because the cells could trigger an
antioxidative defense system and repair the damaged membranes by enhancing
the synthesis of fatty acid. As a result, Fe NPs increased the permeability
of membranes and surfactin titer. Moreover, there were three reasons
for a more efficient surfactin production after the addition of Fe
NPs (Figure 6B). First,
a slight leakage in membranes resulted in more efficient sucrose ingestion
and secretion of surfactin. Second, the cells might repair the damaged
membranes by enhancing fatty acid synthesis, which could provide more
precursors for surfactin. Third, the genes involved in the modules
of glycolysis and TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, and modularly

production via strengthening the secretion of surfactin. Five grams
per liter Fe NPs increased the surfactin titer from 4.93 ± 0.46
to 7.15 ± 0.69 g/L in a flask and from 5.94 ± 0.03 to 9.18
± 0.05 g/L in a 7 L bioreactor. They were the highest titers
of surfactin in the reported wild-type strain. Furthermore, we revealed
the high-production mechanism according to the gene expression. This
work developed a new strategy to increase the surfactin production,
which could be used for other metabolites, especially biosurfactants. In this study, nanomaterials were applied to increase the surfactin

RNA samples were converted to cDNA through a QuantiNova reverse transcription
kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems,
Foster, CA) was used for qPCR analysis. The volume of each qPCR reaction
was 20 μL, containing 10 μL of an AceQ Universal SYBR
qPCR master mix (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China), 0.4 μL of
each primer (20 μmol/L), 1 μL of cDNA template, and 8.2
μL of nuclease-free water. The qPCR conditions were as follows:
preheating at 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10
s, and 60 °C for 30 s. All of the samples were automatically
processed for melting curve analysis to evaluate the reaction specificity.
Melting curves were obtained through slow heating from 60 to 95 °C
at 5 s intervals of 0.5 °C, with continuous fluorescence collection.
The relative transcription levels of target genes were quantified
by the 2 –ΔΔCT method57 using gene recA as an internal control.
All of the reactions were conducted in triplicate, including nontemplate
as the negative control. The primers for qPCR are listed in Table S4. The total
