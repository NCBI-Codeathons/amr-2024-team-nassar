 Natural products
provide a rich source of potential antimicrobials
for treating infectious diseases for which drug resistance has emerged.
Foremost among these diseases is tuberculosis. Assessment of the antimycobacterial
activity of nargenicin, a natural product that targets the replicative
DNA polymerase of Staphylococcus aureus, revealed that it is a bactericidal genotoxin that induces a DNA
damage response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and inhibits growth by blocking the replicative
DNA polymerase, DnaE1. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that binding
of nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate
such that nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and
the polymerase and occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide
and templating base. Comparative analysis across three bacterial species
suggests that the activity of nargenicin is partly attributable to
the DNA binding affinity of the replicative polymerase. This work
has laid the foundation for target-led drug discovery efforts focused
on Mtb DnaE1. Claiming
an estimated 1.5 million
lives in 2020, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes
of death globally from an infectious disease.1 The severe disruptions to health services wrought by the COVID-19
pandemic are predicted to worsen this grim toll by a further 1 million
TB deaths per annum over the next four years.1 In the absence of a highly efficacious vaccine, prolonged chemotherapy
with combinations of anti-TB drugs forms the cornerstone of TB control.
However, the increase of drug resistance through ongoing evolution
and spread of drug-resistant strains of the etiologic agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
is undermining current efforts. This problem, exacerbated by additional
treatment delays caused by the pandemic, underscores the urgent need
for new TB drugs with distinct mechanisms of action for inclusion
in shorter, safer, and more effective drug regimens. The TB drug discovery
and development pipeline established in recent years has begun to
deliver new and repurposed drugs and combinations that have revolutionized
the treatment of drug-resistant TB2 and
demonstrated that treatment shortening is an achievable goal.3 However, maintaining this momentum requires replenishment
of the pipeline with high-quality hit compounds that show mechanistic
novelty.4 This is a key objective of the
Tuberculosis Drug Accelerator (TBDA).5 Of the vital cellular processes targeted by TB drugs in clinical
use, DNA replication stands out as relatively under-represented;6−8 this is despite the high vulnerability of some genes essential for
DNA replication in Mtb,9 including those encoding DNA gyrase, the target of the fluoroquinolones,
moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin, and the only DNA metabolic
enzyme currently targeted for TB therapy. Fluoroquinolones inhibit
DNA gyrase with bactericidal consequences for Mtb(10,11) and have been incorporated in second-line therapy
for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB12 and
in treatment-shortening regimens for drug-susceptible TB.3 The identification of novel scaffolds that target
DNA gyrase remains an active area of investigation,13,14 while topoisomerase I is also being pursued as a new TB drug target.15 Recently, the replisome—the macromolecular
machine that copies the bacterial chromosome—has emerged as
an attractive target for TB6,7 and antibacterial drug
discovery, more generally.16 Key discoveries
involving natural products have added impetus to exploring this target
further: first, griselimycin, a cyclic depsipeptide discovered more
than 50 years ago, was shown to bind with high affinity and selectivity
to the β-clamp (DnaN) at the site of interaction with DNA polymerase
and other DNA metabolizing enzymes.17 During
DNA replication, the β-clamp interacts with DnaE1, the replicative
DNA polymerase termed variously as DnaE, DnaE1, or PolC in different
bacteria, greatly enhancing the processivity of the polymerase. Griselimycin
interferes with the protein interaction between DnaE1 and the β-clamp,
affecting the processivity of DNA replication.17 The mechanistic novelty of griselimycin led to the development
of the analogue, cyclohexyl-griselimycin, which has improved potency
and stability and demonstrated comparable efficacy to rifampicin when
used in combination with first-line drugs in a mouse infection model.17 Second, studies in Staphylococcus
aureus identified the replicative DNA polymerase,
DnaE, as the target of nargenicin A1 (referred to here as nargenicin),18 which belongs to a class of partially saturated
alicyclic polyketides comprising an octalin ring (Figure 1A).19 Nargenicin is an ether-bridged macrolide antibiotic first isolated
from various Nocardia species almost three decades
ago.20,21 It is a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial18 with activity against gram-positive bacteria,
including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Micrococcus luteus.22 The identification of narR/ngnU,21,23 a dnaE homologue immediately
adjacent to the nargenicin biosynthetic gene cluster in the producer
organism, Nocardia sp. CS682,24 suggested a mechanism of self-resistance to nargenicin
using NarR/NgnU as a “decoy”.21 Figure 1Antimycobacterial

for nargenicin in S. aureus(18) led us to investigate the antimycobacterial
properties of this molecule25 under the
auspices of the TBDA. Here, we show that nargenicin is a bactericidal
genotoxin that induces a DNA damage response in Mtb that is accompanied by cellular elongation and potential weakening
of the cell envelope. We further demonstrate that the antimycobacterial
activity of nargenicin is mediated through the inhibition of DNA synthesis,
consistent with the inhibition of the DNA polymerase activity of purified
DnaE1. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed
a unique mode of binding by nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1
in the presence of DNA in which nargenicin occupies the position of
both the incoming nucleotide and templating base and stacks onto the
terminal base pair. We show that the antibacterial efficacy of nargenicin
as a DNA replication inhibitor is attributable, at least in part,
to the DNA binding affinity of the organism’s replicative polymerase. Results Results Nargenicin

was shown to have a minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) of 12.5 μM against Mtb H37Rv under standard
culture conditions (7H9/OADC/Tw) (Figure 1B; Table S1).
In this culture medium, nargenicin showed comparable activity against
a range of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant clinical isolates of Mtb and was active against Mycobacterium
smegmatis (Msm). The activity against Mtb diminished significantly when Tween-80 was replaced
by Tyloxapol to disperse the mycobacteria. A synergistic effect of
Tween-80 has been observed for other TB drugs, most notably rifampicin26 and streptomycin.27 The differential potency of nargenicin in media containing Tween-80 versus Tyloxapol likely reflects the differential impact
of these two detergents on the lipid composition of the cell envelope
at the concentrations typically used for clump dispersal28 with Tween-80 increasing permeability to the
drug.29,30 Nargenicin also showed increased potency
in GAST/(Fe)/Tween-80. The in vitro selectivity index
was reasonable with limited cytotoxicity against the HepG2 cell line

revealed
that nargenicin was bactericidal in Mtb H37Rv, showing
time-dependent kill with limited dose-dependency over the concentration
range tested (Figure 1C). To ascertain whether this bactericidal activity was accompanied
by cell lysis, we quantified green fluorescent protein (GFP) release
from H37Rv-GFP.31,32 Nargenicin treatment led to GFP
release from day 4 onwards, peaking on days 6–7 (Figure 1D). Griselimycin treatment
also resulted in delayed GFP release analogous to that elicited by
nargenicin, but no release of GFP was observed upon exposure to the
DNA gyrase inhibitors, ciprofloxacin, or moxifloxacin, demonstrating
that the GFP release was not a generic consequence of disrupting DNA
metabolism (Figure 1D). Time–kill kinetic analysis

same mechanism of action in mycobacteria as in S. aureus,18 we applied a suite of complementary
biological profiling assays in Mtb and Msm. Multiple attempts to isolate spontaneous nargenicin-resistant mutants
in Mtb or Msm by plating 109–1010 bacilli on media containing nargenicin
at 5–20× MIC (Mtb) or 1–10×
MIC (Msm) were unsuccessful, yielding no heritably
resistant mutants. Reasoning that nargenicin would elicit a DNA damage
response if it disrupts DNA replication, we used the Mtb PrecA-LUX reporter strain to monitor the activity
of the DNA-damage-inducible recA promoter in response
to drug treatment.33 Like fluoroquinolones
and griselimycin, nargenicin triggered dose-dependent induction of
luminescence (Figures 2A and S1). Comparative DNA microarray
analysis revealed a transcriptomic signature for nargenicin-treated Mtb that shared key features with those elicited by mitomycin
C and fluoroquinolones (Figures S2A, S2B, and Table S2).34,35 Genome-wide transcriptome analysis
by RNA-seq revealed a profound upregulation of dnaE2, imuA′, and imuB, components
of the mycobacterial “mutasome” responsible for DNA
damage tolerance and damage-induced mutagenesis35,36 and other DNA repair and recombination genes, including recA, radA, uvrA, lhr, and adnAB (Figures 2B, S2C, and Data S1), which are contained in the PafBC regulon.37 Interestingly, deletion of either recA(38) or dnaE2(35,36) had a negligible impact on the antimycobacterial activity of nargenicin
(Table S1). Genes most highly downregulated
by nargenicin were enriched in those associated with cell division
(ftsZ, whiB2, and ripA) and included genes involved in cell envelope biogenesis (e.g., fbpC) (Figures 2B and S2C). To ascertain whether nargenicin shares the

of components of the DNA replication and repair machinery (Figure 2C), as previously
defined,39 further implicating the disruption
of DNA metabolism in the mode of action of nargenicin. Direct evidence
for the inhibition of DNA replication was then obtained from a macromolecular
incorporation assay, which compares the incorporation of radiolabeled
precursors into the total nucleic acid, DNA, protein, peptidoglycan,
or fatty acid in cells treated with an experimental drug versus controls. Nargenicin had a profound effect on DNA synthesis resulting
in 60% and >95% reduction in [3H]-uracil incorporation
when used to treat Mtb at 2× and 20× MIC,
respectively. In contrast, nargenicin had a limited impact on RNA,
protein, peptidoglycan, and fatty acid synthesis (Figure 2D). Together, these results
were consistent with the replicative polymerase, DnaE1, as the likely
target of nargenicin in mycobacteria. Morphological profiling of Msm exposed to nargenicin
revealed a filamentation phenotype with the proportion of elongated
bacilli in the population increasing with the drug dose (Figure S3). This drug-induced profile clustered

we assessed the impact of modulating
the level of dnaE1 expression on the susceptibility
of mycobacteria to nargenicin. We generated a set of fluorescently
labeled Mtb hypomorphs carrying inducible dnaE1 CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)40 constructs and determined the inhibitory activity of nargenicin
against these strains in the presence or absence of the anhydrotetracycline
(ATc) inducer. Marked hypersensitization to nargenicin was observed
for all four hypomorphs under conditions of dnaE1 silencing (+ATc) but not in the uninduced controls (-ATc) (Figure 3A–C). Importantly,
the effect was specific to nargenicin, as evidenced by the lack of
effect of dnaE1 silencing on the susceptibility of Mtb to isoniazid or ciprofloxacin, which target mycolic
acid biosynthesis and DNA gyrase, respectively (Figure 3C). Together, these results identified DnaE1
as a potential target of nargenicin in Mtb. Using
a vector shown previously to conditionally overexpress Msm DnaE1,41 we found that conditional overexpression
of Msm dnaE1 in Msm or Mtb, as further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis (Figure S4C), had no effect on the nargenicin susceptibility of either organism
(Figure S4A,B). Therefore, the DnaE1 copy
number alone did not determine nargenicin efficacy in mycobacteria. To investigate this further,
we assessed the impact of modulating
the level of dnaE1 expression on the susceptibility
of mycobacteria to nargenicin. We generated a set of fluorescently

for all four hypomorphs under conditions of dnaE1 silencing (+ATc) but not in the uninduced controls (-ATc) (Figure 3A–C). Importantly,
the effect was specific to nargenicin, as evidenced by the lack of

replicative DNA polymerase from Escherichia coli, DNA polymerase III α (Pol IIIα). To monitor the polymerase
activity, we used a real-time polymerase assay in which the incorporation
of dGMPs in the primer strand quenches the fluorescent signal of a
fluorescein group at the 5′ end of the template strand.41 We found that nargenicin also inhibits the activity
of Mtb DnaE1, albeit at ∼20-fold higher concentrations
than S. aureus DnaE (IC50 = 125 and 6 nM, respectively) under the conditions of this assay
(Figure 4A). Surprisingly,

elucidate the mechanism of polymerase inhibition, we determined
the structure of full-length Mtb DnaE1 in complex
with nargenicin and a DNA substrate by cryo-EM (Figures 4B–F and S5). The structure was determined to a resolution of 2.9 Å with
well-defined density for the polymerase active site, DNA, and the
bound nargenicin molecule (Figure 4B–F). The cryo-EM structure of Mtb DnaE1 is identical to the previously determined crystal structure42 with the exception of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide
binding (OB) domain that was not included in the crystal structure
(Figure S6). The OB-domain is flexible
as it shows a weaker density in the cryo-EM map when compared to the
rest of the molecule (Figures S5C and S6C). The flexibility of the OB-domain is consistent with cryo-EM structures
of E. coli Pol IIIα that show
a 70 Å movement of the OB-domain between the DNA-bound and DNA-free
state.43 To

manner between the thumb and fingers domains, as was previously observed
for other C-family DNA polymerases.43,44 The nargenicin
molecule is bound in the polymerase active site and is sandwiched
between the last base pair of the DNA duplex, the first base of the
template strand, and the fingers domain of the polymerase (Figure 4D). Nargenicin occupies
both the position of the incoming nucleotide as well as the template
base and thus mimics the position of the newly synthesized base pair
(Figure 4E). To do
so, the first unpaired template base is displaced from its position
and bumps into Pro668 of an adjacent helix (residues 668 to 673) that
becomes disordered. On the protein side, nargenicin occupies a shallow
pocket and only makes three direct contacts with the protein: Arg667
and His787 make a hydrogen bond to two oxygens in nargenicin, while
Gln638 makes a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen in the pyrrole ring
(Figure 4F). The opposite
end of nargenicin that is located on top of His787 makes no interaction
with the protein as its nearest neighbor is over 5 Å away. The DNA is bound in a canonical
manner between the thumb and fingers domains, as was previously observed

between the last base pair of the DNA duplex, the first base of the
template strand, and the fingers domain of the polymerase (Figure 4D). Nargenicin occupies
both the position of the incoming nucleotide as well as the template
base and thus mimics the position of the newly synthesized base pair
(Figure 4E). To do
so, the first unpaired template base is displaced from its position
and bumps into Pro668 of an adjacent helix (residues 668 to 673) that
becomes disordered. On the protein side, nargenicin occupies a shallow
pocket and only makes three direct contacts with the protein: Arg667
and His787 make a hydrogen bond to two oxygens in nargenicin, while
Gln638 makes a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen in the pyrrole ring
(Figure 4F). The opposite
end of nargenicin that is located on top of His787 makes no interaction
with the protein as its nearest neighbor is over 5 Å away. The binding of nargenicin is reminiscent of the binding of aphidicolin
in human DNA polymerase α (hPolα).45 Although the two inhibitors differ in the structure (Figure S7A) and the polymerases belong to different
families (hPolα is a B-family polymerase, whereas Mtb DnaE1 a C-family polymerase), both inhibitors are bound between
the last base pair of the DNA and the polymerase fingers domain, occupy
the position of both incoming and templating base, and displace the
templating base (Figure S7B,C). However,
owing to the structural differences in the polymerase active sites,
it is unlikely that nargenicin can inhibit the human polymerase as
modeling of nargenicin into the hPolα structure reveals several
clashes with the protein (Figure S7D).
The similar mechanism of action of the two inhibitors is derived from
different organisms—aphidicolin is derived from the mold, Cephalosporium aphidicola,45 whereas nargenicin is produced by a Nocardia species19,20—provides a remarkable example of convergent evolution. The binding of nargenicin is reminiscent of the binding of aphidicolin

Drug Resistance through Allostery Drug Resistance through Allostery Drug Resistance through Allostery The structure described
above shows that the DNA forms a crucial part of the nargenicin binding
site, consistent with the previous observation that binding of nargenicin
to S. aureus DnaE only occurs in the
presence of DNA.18 This DNA dependency
of binding may also hold the key to the differences in inhibition
between S. aureus DnaE, Mtb DnaE1, and E. coli Pol IIIα
(Figure 5). The predicted
nargenicin binding sites for S. aureus DnaE and E. coli Pol IIIα are
highly similar to those of Mtb DnaE1 (Figure 5A,B), and the three residues
that make a hydrogen bond with nargenicin are conserved in all three
species. Hence, the difference in sensitivity does not appear to have
its origin in the binding site. Moreover, a mutation in S. aureus DnaE (a serine to leucine mutation at position
765, equivalent to Mtb DnaE1 residue 860) that renders
it resistant to nargenicin is located ∼30 Å away from
nargenicin (Figure 5C). This mutation is immediately adjacent to the region of the fingers
domain that interacts with the phosphate backbone of the double-stranded
DNA substrate. Therefore, we hypothesized that the potency of nargenicin
to inhibit a DNA polymerase may be dictated by the polymerase’s
affinity for DNA. To test this, we measured the DNA affinity of the
three polymerases by fluorescence anisotropy using a primed DNA substrate
(Figure 5D). The three
DNA polymerases show strikingly different dissociation constants of
∼6 nM for S. aureus DnaE, 250
nM for Mtb DnaE1, and 12 μM for E. coli Pol IIIα. Importantly, these DNA affinities
correlate with the relative sensitivities to nargenicin, which follow
the same trend (Figure 4A). We also tested the resistant mutation in S. aureus DnaE (S765L), which, as predicted, reduced the affinity for DNA,
approximately 14-fold (Figure 5D). The structure described
above shows that the DNA forms a crucial part of the nargenicin binding
site, consistent with the previous observation that binding of nargenicin

the notion that the potential
of nargenicin to inhibit a DNA polymerase is dependent on the polymerase’s

to reduced nargenicin potency, either through natural variation, as
in the case of E. coli Pol IIIα,
or through a resistance-conferring mutation,18 as for S. aureus DnaE. Importantly, S. aureus engages two essential DNA polymerases at
the replication fork, namely, PolC and DnaE;46 if the activity of one is impaired, the other may compensate. However,
mycobacteria rely on only one replicative polymerase, DnaE1. Therefore,
nargenicin resistance-conferring mutations in DnaE1 could have catastrophic
consequences in mycobacteria, which might explain our inability to
isolate spontaneous resistant mutants in Mtb or Msm. Taken together, these data support

lines of evidence that nargenicin acts
as a DNA replication inhibitor in mycobacteria by targeting the essential
DnaE1 polymerase, an enzyme identified recently as a highly vulnerable
component of the DNA replication machinery in Mtb.9 Unlike the commonly used nucleotide
analogues that act as chain terminators through the incorporation
into the nascent DNA strand, nargenicin does not become incorporated
into the DNA. Instead, it is wedged between the terminal base pair
of the DNA substrate and the polymerase fingers domain, occupying
both the position of the incoming nucleotide and the templating base,
which is displaced by nargenicin. This binding mode is analogous to
that of the human Pol α inhibitor, aphidicolin, which is derived
from the fungus, Cephalosporium aphidicola, and unrelated in structure to nargenicin, indicating that these
inhibitors have evolved independently. This unusual mechanism might
explain the observation that the antimycobacterial activity of nargenicin
was not diminished by overexpression of the cognate target, DnaE1.
Based on this mechanism, the DnaE homologue in the Nocardia sp. CS682 producer organism would presumably need to bind nargenicin
in a DNA-independent manner to fulfill its postulated “decoy”
role in self-resistance.21 We have reported multiple

disruption of replisome function triggers a
physiological response in Mtb, which resembles that
elicited by genotoxins, which cause double-stranded breaks (DSBs)
(mitomycin C, fluoroquinolones).35 This
features upregulation of genes encoding the recombinase involved in
recombination repair (recA), the mutasome responsible
for DNA-damage-induced mutagenesis and damage tolerance (dnaE2, imuA′, imuB),35,36 the PafBC-regulated DSB-resecting motor-nuclease (adnAB)37,47 and a cell wall hydrolase (chiZ),48 among other DNA-damage-responsive
genes in mycobacteria. The DNA damage response to nargenicin begs
the question of whether pharmacological inhibition of DnaE1 by this
or other inhibitors might have the unintended consequence of inducing
chromosomal mutations, which could fuel the evolution of drug resistance,
as documented for sublethal treatment of mycobacteria and other organisms
by fluoroquinolones.49,50 The concomitant downregulation
of ftsZ,39sepF,51whiB2,52 and ripA(51) is consistent with cellular elongation, resulting from
a block in cell division, followed by cell death. Ablation of the
SOS response by deletion of recA, or a key component
thereof (mutasome function) by deletion of dnaE2,
had no discernible impact on the antimycobacterial activity of nargenicin,
suggesting that the LexA/RecA-dependent DNA repair, damage tolerance,
and (SOS) mutagenesis systems are unable to rescue mycobacteria from
the growth inhibitory effects of nargenicin. Instead, an arrest in
cell division, as evidenced by bacillary elongation, appears to precede
cell death. However, the DNA damage response to nargenicin also includes
genes such as adnA, adnB, cho, and uvrA, which form part of the mycobacterial
LexA/RecA-independent regulon controlled by PafBC.37,53 Given that adnA, adnB, and lhr are among the genes most highly upregulated by nargenicin
treatment, it will be important to establish whether, under which
conditions, and to what extent the functional disruption of this regulon
might have on the susceptibility of mycobacteria to this compound. Nargenicin-mediated

strong signal elicited in the GFP release assay. The induction of chiZ and downregulation of fbpC might be
telling in this regard: first, the damage-inducible protein, ChiZ,54 has been reported to arrest cell division, increase
filamentation, and induce cell lysis when overexpressed.48 Second, inactivation of the mycolyltransferase,
FbpC, a member of the antigen 85 complex involved in the synthesis
of trehalose dimycolate and mycolylarabinogalactan, which are key
components of the mycobacterial cell envelope, has been shown to significantly
reduce the mycolate content and increase the permeability of the cell
envelope to small hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.55 Thus, in addition to its replication-arresting
activity, nargenicin may also compromise the integrity of the mycobacterial
outer membrane and thus act as a potentiator of other antitubercular
agents whose efficacy is limited by permeation across the mycobacterial
cell envelope. Another feature of the nargenicin mode of action was the late,

shown that nargenicin mediates its bactericidal
activity against M. tuberculosis through
interaction with DnaE1 in a manner that depends upon the presence
of the DNA substrate. In this interaction, the nargenicin molecule
wedges itself between DnaE1 and the terminal base pair of the DNA
and occupies the place of both the incoming nucleotide and the templating
base. By analyzing the physiological consequences of Mtb exposure to nargenicin, we show that the arrest in bacillary replication
resulting from the nargenicin-DnaE1 interaction triggers induction
of a DNA damage response coupled with an arrest in cell division and
an apparent weakening of the mycobacterial cell envelope. In addition
to strongly reaffirming the value of natural products as a source
of novel antitubercular agents, this work has provided the rationale
and platform for focusing target-led drug discovery efforts on a promising
new TB drug target. In conclusion, we have

incorporation assays were performed as described.62,63 Briefly, Mtb cultures were grown to early exponential
phase (OD600 of ∼0.3) and 1 μCi/mL [3H]-uracil, 2.5 μCi/mL [3H]-phenylalanine, 10 μCi/mL [3H]-N-acetyl glucosamine, and 1 μCi/mL [14C]-acetate were added to quantify the incorporation of the radiolabeled
precursors into either total nucleic acid (i.e., DNA and RNA), protein,
cell wall, or fatty acids, respectively. The cells were incubated
at 37 °C for 1 h, and 150 μL was transferred to 96-well
microtiter plates containing 150 μL of each test compound. Nargenicin
was used at 2× and 20× MIC with 1% DMSO included as an untreated
control. The specificity of assays was monitored by the inclusion
of the pathway-specific antibiotics OFX (5 μg/mL), STR (10 μg/mL), d-cycloserine (DCS, 5 μg/mL), and INH (0.2 μg/mL)
as positive controls. The assay plates were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h, and precursor incorporation was terminated by the addition
of 300 μL of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The samples were
incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and the precipitates were collected
by vacuum filtration with a 96-well MultiScreen GFC glass fiber plate
(Millipore). Precipitates were washed three times with 10% TCA, followed
by three 95% ethanol washes, and the plates were allowed to air-dry.
Precipitates were resuspended in 50 μL of MicroScint 20 (PerkinElmer),
and the radioactivity on each filter was measured in a MicroBeta Liquid
Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer). To distinguish between the incorporation
of [3H]-uracil into DNA vs. RNA, the RNA was hydrolyzed
with 500 μL of 1 M KOH at 37 °C for 16 h and neutralized
with 125 μL of HCl. The samples were then precipitated by adding
625 μL of 20% TCA, and the amount of residual radioactivity
present in the DNA precipitates was quantified following filtration
and washing as described above. All samples were analyzed in duplicate,
and the results represent the percentage of radiolabel incorporation
relative to the DMSO-treated control from two independent replicates. Macromolecular

qRT-PCR, and microarray experiments, Mtb cultures
(20–30 mL) were grown either in roller bottles or culture flasks
on a shaker to mid-exponential phase (OD600 of ∼0.3–0.5)
prior to treatment with nargenicin at 1× or 10× MIC for
6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of Qiazol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen).
The cells were lysed with 0.1 mm Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec) in
a MagNA Lyser Homogenizer (Roche) (6000 rpm, 30 s) three times with
1 min cooling intervals. The samples were centrifuged at 10 000g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred
into a clean tube containing an equal volume of 100% ethanol. The
RNA was purified and treated with DNase on-column using the Direct-zol
RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The samples were eluted in 50 μL of RNase- and DNase-free
water. Purified RNA was treated with DNase for an additional 60 min
at 37 °C using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. In preparation for microarray analysis
and RNA-seq, the sample quality was confirmed using a Bioanalyzer
RNA 6000 Nano Kit and Chips (Agilent). For RNA-seq experiments, three
independent biological replicates of both nargenicin-treated (10×
MIC) and untreated samples were performed. Library preparation and
sequencing were done by Admera Health (NJ) using the Illumina NovaSeq
S4 sequencing platform. The sequencing strategy included an average
of 60 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample. Reads were demultiplexed
to generate raw fastq files for each sample and data were deposited
in the NCBI SRA repository (PRJNA722614). Initial quality control
(QC) of the raw fastQ files was performed using FastQC.67 Reads were trimmed and adapters were removed

Gene Ontologies, STRING local network clusters, annotated keywords,
KEGG pathways, and InterPro protein domains and features as categories.
Multiple comparisons were compensated for using the false discovery
rate (FDR), with significant enrichment considered as FDR > 0.05. For RNA-seq,
qRT-PCR, and microarray experiments, Mtb cultures
(20–30 mL) were grown either in roller bottles or culture flasks
on a shaker to mid-exponential phase (OD600 of ∼0.3–0.5)
prior to treatment with nargenicin at 1× or 10× MIC for
6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of Qiazol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen).
The cells were lysed with 0.1 mm Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec) in
a MagNA Lyser Homogenizer (Roche) (6000 rpm, 30 s) three times with
1 min cooling intervals. The samples were centrifuged at 10 000g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred
into a clean tube containing an equal volume of 100% ethanol. The
RNA was purified and treated with DNase on-column using the Direct-zol
RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The samples were eluted in 50 μL of RNase- and DNase-free
water. Purified RNA was treated with DNase for an additional 60 min
at 37 °C using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. In preparation for microarray analysis
and RNA-seq, the sample quality was confirmed using a Bioanalyzer
RNA 6000 Nano Kit and Chips (Agilent). For RNA-seq experiments, three
independent biological replicates of both nargenicin-treated (10×
MIC) and untreated samples were performed. Library preparation and
sequencing were done by Admera Health (NJ) using the Illumina NovaSeq
S4 sequencing platform. The sequencing strategy included an average
of 60 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample. Reads were demultiplexed
to generate raw fastq files for each sample and data were deposited
in the NCBI SRA repository (PRJNA722614). Initial quality control

processing was performed
using RELION 3.1.76 The images were drift
corrected using RELION’s own (CPU-based) implementation of
the UCSF motioncor2, and defocus was estimated using gCTF.77 LoG-based auto-picking was performed on all
micrographs, and picked particles were 2D classified. After three
rounds of 2D classification, classes with different orientations were
selected for initial model generation in RELION. The initial model
was used as a reference for 3D classification into different classes.
The selected classes from 3D classification were subjected to 3D auto
refinement followed by different rounds of CTF refinement plus a final
round of Bayesian polishing. Polished particles were used for the
3D auto-refine job, and the final map was postprocessed to correct
for the modulation transfer function of the detector and sharpened
by applying a negative B-factor manually set to −50. A soft
mask was applied during postprocessing to generate FSC curves to produce
a map of an average resolution of 2.9 Å. The RELION postprocessed
map was used to generate improved-resolution EM maps using the SuperEM
method,78 which aided in model building
and refinement. Model building was performed using Coot,79 REFMAC5,80 the CCPEM-suite,81 and Phenix.82 Details
on model refinement and validation are shown in Table 1. In brief, model building started by the
rigid-body fitting of the known DnaE1 crystal structure (PDB 5LEW)42 into the experimental density map using Coot. The DNA molecule
was generated, and the rigid body was fitted into the experimental

by applying a negative B-factor manually set to −50. A soft
mask was applied during postprocessing to generate FSC curves to produce
a map of an average resolution of 2.9 Å. The RELION postprocessed
map was used to generate improved-resolution EM maps using the SuperEM
method,78 which aided in model building
and refinement. Model building was performed using Coot,79 REFMAC5,80 the CCPEM-suite,81 and Phenix.82 Details
on model refinement and validation are shown in Table 1. In brief, model building started by the
rigid-body fitting of the known DnaE1 crystal structure (PDB 5LEW)42 into the experimental density map using Coot. The DNA molecule
was generated, and the rigid body was fitted into the experimental
density map using Coot. Next, we carried out one round of refinement
in REFMAC5 using jelly-body restraints, and the model was further
manually adjusted in Coot. Final refinement and model validation were
performed using Phenix. Quantification and Statistical Analysis Quantification and Statistical Analysis Quantification and Statistical Analysis Statistical
details are given in the Methods sections and
figure legends, and these include details of the experiments, numbers
of replicates (technical and/or experimental), statistical software
used, and thresholds of significance. Significance was generally determined
as p<0.05, and correction for multiple comparisons was performed,
as appropriate. Independent experiments were performed a minimum of
two times, and these data were utilized for the generation of summary
statistics (mean and standard deviation). Replicate data are included
within each figure, as indicated in figure legends, else data are
described as a representative experiment. In addition, DNA polymerase
assays and DNA binding experiments were performed in three or more
independent experiments. Data were not excluded from experimental
datasets prior to or during analyses other than during cryo-EM data
processing, where particles that did not possess high-resolution features
were removed following standard procedures for cryo-EM structure determination. Statistical
