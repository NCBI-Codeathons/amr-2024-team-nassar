The metagenomic whole genome shotgun sequencing (mWGS) approach was used to characterize antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of the rhizobiomes of this wild plant and surrounding bulk soil microbiomes and to figure out the chance and consequences for highly abundant ARGs, e.g., mtrA, golS, soxR, oleC, novA, kdpE, vanRO, parY, and rbpA, to horizontally transfer to human gut pathogens via mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The results indicated that abundance of these ARGs, except for golS, was higher in rhizosphere of M. oleifera than that in bulk soil microbiome with no signs of emerging new soil ARGs in either soil type. The most highly abundant metabolic processes of the most abundant ARGs were previously detected in members of phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. These processes refer to three resistance mechanisms namely antibiotic efflux pump, antibiotic target alteration and antibiotic target protection. Antibiotic efflux mechanism included resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), ATP-binding cassette (ABC), and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) antibiotics pumps as well as the two-component regulatory kdpDE system. Antibiotic target alteration included glycopeptide resistance gene cluster (vanRO), aminocoumarin resistance parY, and aminocoumarin self-resistance parY. While, antibiotic target protection mechanism included RbpA bacterial RNA polymerase (rpoB)-binding protein. The study supports the claim of the possible horizontal transfer of these ARGs to human gut and emergence of new multidrug resistant clinical isolates. Thus, careful agricultural practices are required especially for plants used in circles of human nutrition industry or in traditional medicine.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Moringa oleifera (or the miracle tree) is a drought-tolerant wild plant species of the family Moringaceae (Olson and Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2010). This species is native to several habitats in Southern America, Africa and Asia including Saudi Arabia (Al-Eisawi and Al-Ruzayza, 2015). This plant is commonly used in traditional herbal medicine due to its health benefits as it possesses anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-depressant as well as anti-inflammatory properties (Olson and Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2010). Seed oil and leaf powder of M. oleifera contain a variety of useful proteins, vitamins (A, B1, B2, B3, B6, and C) and minerals (e.g., Ca, K, Mg, Fe, P, and Zn) (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2016). The plant is also used in treating edema, asthma and diabetes, in reducing high blood pressure, in treating stomach complaints, in fighting against bacterial diseases and cancer, in making bones healthier, and in healing skin wounds (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2016).", "Moringa oleifera (or the miracle tree) is a drought-tolerant wild plant species of the family Moringaceae (Olson and Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2010).

The rhizospheric region is regarded as a hotspot of effective microbial activity, recovery of new antibiotics and potential transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (Blau et al., 2019). NGS approaches of amplicon (or 16S rRNA) and metagenomic whole genome shotgun sequencing (mWGS) are used to decipher microbial composition and predicted function. Advantages of the latter approach include the ability to study the genomes of archaea, bacteria, fungi, and viruses and reaching accurate insights into taxonomy, biodiversity, phylogenetic relationships, and functionality of microbiomes (Segata et al., 2011). mWGS also allows studying the influences of environmental conditions and host-microbe interactions in shaping microbiome signatures and allows deciphering new ARGs and antibiotics in the phyllospheric and rhizospheric regions of a given plant especially if this plant is edible by human or livestock (Tringe et al., 2005; Raes et al., 2007).", "Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and subsequent bioinformatics approaches allow the accurate detection of microbial composition and function in the phyllospheric and rhizospheric regions of the plant (Vorholt, 2012; Bai et al., 2015; Vorholt et al., 2017).

However, the treatment of pathogenic bacteria is increasingly hindered by the ability of bacteria to generate resistance against antibiotics due to occurrence of gene mutations, or due to a bacterial taxon being transformed with ARGs of other bacterial taxon; a process called horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (B\u00e4ckhed et al., 2015). The latter incidence raises a concern that ARGs integrated in mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of rhizospheric or phyllospheric bacteria can contaminate an edible plant, thus, can eventually be transmitted to human gut microbiome. If a certain microbial pathogen exists in the latter environment, then a risk of acquired resistance against clinical antibiotics is raised. Up to date, no enough attention was paid to the serious incidence of horizontal transfer of ARGs existing in plant microbiomes to human gut or skin microbiome (Chen et al., 2019). In addition, the influence of resistome of native or wild plants was almost neglected (Obermeier et al., 2021). The study of rhizobiome of native plants allows the detection of natural antibiotics along with new versatile ARGs due to the existence of highly diversified microbial community in this dynamic region.", "Identification and development of new antibiotics was for years a top research priority among pharmaceutical companies (Dutescu and Hillier, 2021).

RND efflux is composed of seven families including the hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux (or MtrCDE efflux) and the heavy metal efflux (HME) (Tseng et al., 1999). RND transporters are involved in maintaining cell homeostasis and in exporting a broad spectrum of toxic compounds and virulence determinants (Coyne et al., 2010). In the present study, the most abundant ARG in rhizobiome of M. oleifera, e.g., mtrA (multiple transferable resistance A) gene (Figures 3, 4), is known to encode a transcriptional activator or inducer of the MtrCDE multidrug efflux pump mostly in human pathogenic bacteria, e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Rouquette et al., 1999; Ohneck et al., 2011; Handing et al., 2018), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Du et al., 2018). MtrCDE efflux pump is a member of the highly abundant hydrophobic and amphiphilic efflux RND family. N. gonorrhoeae is the causative pathogen of gonorrhea and can also evade protective human immune responses (Wi et al., 2017; Nudel et al., 2018). MtrA is a gonococcal protein belonging to the AraC/XylS family that participates in the construction of the bacterial multiple transferable resistance (MTR) complex (Nikaido, 1996; Rouquette et al., 1999). The latter promotes an energy-dependent MtrCDE efflux pump comprising three cell envelope proteins namely MtrC, MtrD, and MtrE. These three proteins, in turn, serve in exporting antimicrobial agents outside the bacterial cell. These antimicrobial agents include hydrophobic agents (HAs), such as free fatty acids, bile salts, gonadol steroids, and antibacterial peptides (Handing et al., 2018). Many reports indicated that the MtrCDE efflux system can also act on antibiotics, like penicillin, erythromycin, cephalosporin, and rifampin (Olesky et al., 2006; Handing et al., 2018). On the other hand, HA-sensitive bacteria harbors another gene, e.g., mtrR, that otherwise encodes a transcriptional repressor of MtrCDE multidrug efflux pump system (Lucas et al., 1997). The latter gene does not exist in soil microbiome of M. oleifera, thus, does not seem to be involved in modulating the operon system of MtrCDE efflux pump in the resistome of M. oleifera (Figure 7). Ma et al. (1994) indicated that the loss of repressor activity is correlated with increased bacterial resistance to antimicrobial compounds. Thus, high abundance/relative abundance of mtrA gene (promoting positive regulation) and absence of mtrR gene (promoting negative regulation) in the resistome of M. oleifera can results in higher influence on virulence and the ability of the bacteria to resist antimicrobial agents more efficiently, in accordance with prior reports (Ohneck et al., 2011). This information indicates that horizontal transfer of such an mtrA+/mtrR\u2013 resistance determinant to human gut can be dangerous. However, Handing et al. (2018) declared that bacterial acquisition of antibiotic resistance is associated with a fitness cost. Other reports claim that bacteria also need the negative regulation as over-activation of efflux pump can slow down rate of bacterial growth (Nikaido, 1996), thus, modulation of positive/negative regulation of the efflux pump is required for AMR, on one hand, and for optimal growth rate, on the other hand.", "RND superfamily transporters3 are made of large polypeptide chains located in the cytoplasm.

It controls proteins GolT, which is a P-type ATPase, and GolB, which is a small cytoplasmic metal-binding RND protein located in the inner membrane (Pontel et al., 2007). The latter two proteins participate in RND-dependent CBA efflux system that induces a resistance response against gold salts inside Salmonella cells. Salmonella is a poisonous bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract and mostly infect human through contaminated water or food. The increase of GolS concentration could also result in direct sequestration of intracellular free Au levels (Brown et al., 2003). However, when high Au levels persists, CBA efflux system will be induced. The CBA efflux system is a tripartite protein complex consisting of subunits C, B, and A that generally direct efflux of metal ions or drugs from either the cytoplasm or the periplasm into the extracellular space. It was speculated that this efflux system likely results in transporting cellular metabolites (either damaged by Au or after forming a complex with this ion), rather than in transporting the toxic metal ion per se (Brown et al., 2003).

SoxR promotes several efflux pump genes of the RND family including adeB, adeJ, and adeG (Marchand et al., 2004; Gu and Imlay, 2011). In alignment with the results of the present study, several reports indicated that soxR contributes to multidrug resistance mainly in members of the Gram-negative phylum Proteobacteria (Palma et al., 2005; Sakhtah et al., 2016). As an indirect regulator, SoxR protein is firstly oxidized in response to superoxide-generating agents in order to oxidize another protein namely soxS referring to the SoxR/SoxS paradigm (Pomposiello and Demple, 2001; Li et al., 2017). Although SoxR can be oxidized by extracellular superoxide anion, this anion might not be able to diffuse across the double membrane of the bacteria to oxidize SoxR. Instead, the latter can be rather oxidized by a permeable nitric oxide (NO) radical (Pomposiello and Demple, 2001). SoxS, in turn, promotes overexpression of a multidrug efflux machinery namely AcrAB-TolC in Escherichia coli, a member of the Proteobacterial family Enterobacteriaceae. AcrAB-TolC is a tripartite transporter that effluxes periplasm substrates out of the cell (White et al., 1997; Ruiz and Levy, 2014). This resistance pattern to resistome in the rhizospheric region of M. oleifera as SoxS does not exist. On the other hand, SoxR can directly regulate target genes, e.g., a 6-gene regulon, that promotes efflux pump in members of the Proteobacterial families Pseudomonadaceae (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Moraxellaceae (Acinetobacter baumannii) (Bialek-Davenet et al., 2011; Li et al., 2017). In particular, A. baumannii is a human pathogen that causes nosocomial and bloodstream infections (Peleg et al., 2008). SoxR was also reported to facilitate induction of MFS efflux pump genes in a way similar to that of the major facilitator MfsA (Saidijam et al., 2006; Dulyayangkul et al., 2016).

Some of these proteins are involved in tumor resistance (Dean et al., 2001). During this ABC system, ATPases utilize ATP to provide energy required for the bidirectional translocation (influx/efflux) of substrates across membranes (Sauna et al., 2009). Of which, the OleC transporter of Streptomyces antibioticus is constituted by two proteins, e.g., OleC that recognizes, binds and hydrolyses ATP, and OleC5 that is a hydrophobic membrane protein (Olano et al., 1996). oleC gene, referred to as the orf4 resistance determinant, shows similarity with proteins harboring ATP-binding domains, a feature of the ABC-transporter superfamily. This ARG dominates in the rhizospheric region of M. oleifera (Figure 3). The ABC transporter system allows secretion of oleandomycin out of the cell as an efflux transport mechanism of self-resistance against this antibiotic (Ma Rodriguez et al., 1993). Up to date, genus Streptomyces was reported to produce the majority of the clinical antibiotics (e.g., neomycin, cypemycin, grisemycin, bottromycins, chloramphenicol, aminocoumarin, etc.) mostly by S. antibioticus (de Lima Proc\u00f3pio et al., 2012) and S. lividans (Lee et al., 2007) that still can produce new antibiotics. Interestingly, S. antibioticus harbors another enzyme that catalyzes the last step of oleandomycin biosynthesis to release glucose from the inactivated oleandomycin and eventually generate new active antibiotics (Salas et al., 1994). In addition, novA, a highly abundant ARG in the present study (Figure 3), is an aminocoumarin resistance gene of such a biosynthetic gene cluster in S. lividans (Schmutz et al., 2003). The gene encodes a type III ABC-like transporter that confers a moderate level of resistance as this transporter presumably acts in the sequestration of the antibiotic into the medium (M\u00e9ndez and Salas, 2001). The gene cluster harboring novA gene also contains two gyrB genes, e.g., gyrBS and gyrBR (Thiara and Cundliffe, 1989). Unlike novA gene, gyrBR presumably provides the principal resistance mechanism in the aminocoumarin antibiotic producer Streptomyces lividans due to the synthesis of coumarin-resistant topoisomerases (Schmutz et al., 2003). As abundance of oleC and novA genes of genus Streptomyces is high in the rhizosphere soil of M. oleifera, then, there is a chance that we can decipher new antibiotics as secondary metabolites generated by members of this genus that can be used further in clinical trials against newly emerging diseases. Fortunately, invasive infections with members of this genus are rarely encountered in clinical practice (Kapadia et al., 2007), thus, if their ARGs, like oleC and novA genes of rhizobiome of M. oleifera, were not horizontally transferred through contaminated food to other clinical species, it is unlikely that these bacteria can pose a risk to human health.", "The ABC transporter superfamily is composed of several membrane and membrane-associated (e.g., AAA ATPases) proteins that transport a variety of substrates (lipids, metabolic products, drugs, etc.) across extra- or intracellular membranes.

As abundance of oleC and novA genes of genus Streptomyces is high in the rhizosphere soil of M. oleifera, then, there is a chance that we can decipher new antibiotics as secondary metabolites generated by members of this genus that can be used further in clinical trials against newly emerging diseases. Fortunately, invasive infections with members of this genus are rarely encountered in clinical practice (Kapadia et al., 2007), thus, if their ARGs, like oleC and novA genes of rhizobiome of M. oleifera, were not horizontally transferred through contaminated food to other clinical species, it is unlikely that these bacteria can pose a risk to human health.", "The ABC transporter superfamily is composed of several membrane and membrane-associated (e.g., AAA ATPases) proteins that transport a variety of substrates (lipids, metabolic products, drugs, etc.) across extra- or intracellular membranes. Some of these proteins are involved in tumor resistance (Dean et al., 2001). During this ABC system, ATPases utilize ATP to provide energy required for the bidirectional translocation (influx/efflux) of substrates across membranes (Sauna et al., 2009). Of which, the OleC transporter of Streptomyces antibioticus is constituted by two proteins, e.g., OleC that recognizes, binds and hydrolyses ATP, and OleC5 that is a hydrophobic membrane protein (Olano et al., 1996). oleC gene, referred to as the orf4 resistance determinant, shows similarity with proteins harboring ATP-binding domains, a feature of the ABC-transporter superfamily. This ARG dominates in the rhizospheric region of M. oleifera (Figure 3). The ABC transporter system allows secretion of oleandomycin out of the cell as an efflux transport mechanism of self-resistance against this antibiotic (Ma Rodriguez et al., 1993). Up to date, genus Streptomyces was reported to produce the majority of the clinical antibiotics (e.g., neomycin, cypemycin, grisemycin, bottromycins, chloramphenicol, aminocoumarin, etc.) mostly by S. antibioticus (de Lima Proc\u00f3pio et al., 2012) and S. lividans (Lee et al., 2007) that still can produce new antibiotics. Interestingly, S. antibioticus harbors another enzyme that catalyzes the last step of oleandomycin biosynthesis to release glucose from the inactivated oleandomycin and eventually generate new active antibiotics (Salas et al., 1994). In addition, novA, a highly abundant ARG in the present study (Figure 3), is an aminocoumarin resistance gene of such a biosynthetic gene cluster in S. lividans (Schmutz et al., 2003). The gene encodes a type III ABC-like transporter that confers a moderate level of resistance as this transporter presumably acts in the sequestration of the antibiotic into the medium (M\u00e9ndez and Salas, 2001).

TCS also responds directly in bacteria to the presence of antibiotics and acts as a major player in the realm of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria (Cardona et al., 2018; Tierney and Rather, 2019). Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance via TCS are divided into four categories of which the increased drug efflux dominates. The latter regulatory system comprise a histidine kinase (HK) for sensing environmental signals, and a response regulator (RR) for mediating cellular response and altering expression of target genes (Freeman et al., 2013). Examples include the membrane-bound HK and the cytosolic RR that form KdpD (HK)/KdpE (RR) TCS. This system refers to the regulation of the potassium (K+) dependent- (Kdp\u2212) ATPase pump of operon KdpFABC. The gene encoding KdpE was proven to be highly abundant in the rhizobiome of M. oleifera (Figure 3). It was reported that KdpD/KdpE system can increase the ability of bacteria to cause the disease and/or survive in the host cell (Alegado et al., 2011). In Salmonella typhimurium, KdpD was proven to maintain bacterial growth in macrophage of nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) cell lines as worms fed on the kdpD mutant strain lived longer than those fed on the wild type bacteria (Alegado et al., 2011). In terms of KdpE, prior results indicated its role as a RR of expression of a range of virulence genes in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (Hughes et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2011). This induced expression coincided with the increased survival rate of the two bacteria in human macrophages. Interestingly, deletion of kdpD/kdpE system in S. aureus resulted in the altered expression levels of > 100 genes regulating synthesis of surface protein and capsular polysaccharide, of alpha- and gamma-hemolysin toxins (offensive capabilities), and of metalloproteinase aureolysin that participates in inhibiting phagocytosis and killing the bacteria by neutrophils (defensive capabilities) (Laarman et al., 2011; Freeman et al., 2013). Moreover, kdpE gene was frequently reported to act as a RR gene in conferring resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin via efflux pump system in E. coli (Hirakawa et al., 2003; Lv et al., 2021).

Vancomycin resistance is common in Enterococcus faecium, a commensal microbe in the gastrointestinal tract of human that turned to be pathogenic causing serious diseases like neonatal meningitis or endocarditis (Arias and Murray, 2012). Vancomycin resistance occurs due to the action of one or more of the 11 van operons and acquisition of resistance in clinical isolates was previously proven to be due to horizontal transfer via MGEs, e.g., conjugative or non-conjugative plasmids carrying Tn3 transposons (Arias and Murray, 2012). The clinical isolates of E. faecium harbor vanA and vanB operons that are either carried on plasmids or integrated in the bacterial chromosome (Munita and Arias, 2016).

Physical association of a resistance protein with the antibiotic target reduces the ability of the antibiotic to reach receptor of its target molecule. The rbpA (or RNA-polymerase binding protein A) gene is an ARG that is highly abundant in rhizosphere of M. oleifera. The encoded protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis functions as a transcription activator that binds the core RNA-polymerase (RNAP), e.g., a target of the antibiotic rifampicin, to stabilize the principal promoter-specific housekeeping \u03c3A factor, thus, to promote action of RNAP (Hu et al., 2012).

M. tuberculosis is the causative pathogen of tuberculosis (TB) in human of which rifampicin is the first-line drug used to cure the disease. It was suggested that RbpA binds cluster I of the \u03b2 subunit of RNAP to prevent association/induce dissociation of the antibiotic and RNAP (Hu et al., 2012).

However, we assume that the first mechanism is likely to represent the rbpA gene action as the enzyme RNAP is still valid to cause transcription of the virulence genes after disappearance of the antibiotic. Figure 10 indicates that rate of expression by RNAP increases in the presence of RbpA compared with that in the absence of this protein (Hu et al., 2012).

Examples of these extracellular DNAs include the self-transmissible plasmids conferring tetracycline resistance that were proven to be captured by Escherichia coli referring to the unintended transfer of this bacteria to human gut microbiome (Blau et al., 2018). Thus, HGT can refer to more than one layer of gene transfer within phyllosphere or rhizosphere microbiome of a plant species, e.g., from microbe in the rhizobiome to other microbe, from microbe to plant, from plant-contaminating microbes with ARGs to human microbiome (e.g., gut or skin), and from non-pathogenic to pathogenic microbes in either human organ. All of these layers of horizontal transfer of ARGs are mediated by the MGEs (Nardelli et al., 2012; Djordjevic et al., 2013).", "Plant-contaminating microbes that harbor ARGs and their vectors, e.g., MGEs are unlikely to be removed during food production, storage or processing, thus, can horizontally pass into microbiome of human gut. If the gut microbiome harbors pathogenic bacteria, then, the latter can acquire these ARGs, thus pose a great risk to human health (Chen et al., 2017, 2019).
