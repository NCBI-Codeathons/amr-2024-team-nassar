Kuipers, University of Groningen, Netherlands; Berenike Maier, University of Cologne, Germany This article was submitted to Microbial Physiology and Metabolism, a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology Genetic competence for the uptake and integration of extracellular DNA is a key process in horizontal gene transfer (HGT), one of the most powerful forces driving the evolution of bacteria. In several species, development of genetic competence is coupled with cell lysis. Using Bacillus subtilis as a model bacterium, we studied the role of surfactin, a powerful biosurfactant and antimicrobial lipopeptide, in genetic transformation. We showed that surfactin itself promotes cell lysis and DNA release, thereby promoting HGT. These results, therefore, provide evidence for a fundamental mechanism involved in HGT and significantly increase our understanding of the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes and diversification of microbial communities in the environment. Introduction Introduction Surfactin is an important microbial surfactant with interesting biological activities. It is important for social spreading on solid surfaces (Kearns and Losick, 2003; Kinsinger et al., 2003; Grau et al., 2015; van Gestel et al., 2015), rhizosphere colonization (Bais et al., 2004; Aleti et al., 2016), biocontrol of a plant pathogen (Bais et al., 2004), or potentially even human viruses (Yuan et al., 2018). Its synthesis is regulated by a process called quorum sensing (QS) (Roggiani and Dubnau, 1993). In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the major QS system ComQXPA activates the transcription of hundreds of genes, including the srfA operon and competence genes (Weinrauch et al., 1990; Roggiani and Dubnau, 1993; Magnuson et al., 1994). The srfA operon encodes enzymes for the synthesis of surfactin and also contributes to the development of genetic competence (D’Souza et al., 1994; Hamoen et al., 2003; Comella and Grossman, 2005) through a small out-of-frame gene, comS, that is embedded in the second gene (srfAB) of the operon (Nakano et al., 1991; D’Souza et al., 1994; Hamoen et al., 2003; Comella and Grossman, 2005). ComS stops proteolytic degradation of ComK (Turgay et al., 1998) that then increases in concentration and consequently activates the transcription of late competence genes that encode processes responsible for the DNA uptake and integration (Dubnau, 1991). This state has been referred to as the K-state (Berka et al., 2002). Therefore, surfactin is linked to competence development because phosphorylated ComA (ComA-P) de-represses the srfA operon, which ultimately stabilizes ComK and the K-state, thereby increasing the transformation frequency of the population (Miras and Dubnau, 2016). Competence and transformation of Bacillus subtilis is a result of a complex regulatory network that, through stochastic cell differentiation, occurs only in 10–20% of the cells within a population and is transient (approximately 2 h) in nature (reviewed by Maier, 2020). It has been shown previously that in B. subtilis PS-216, competence is developed in the late exponential growth phase (Miras and Dubnau, 2016), when surfactin production is high (Oslizlo et al., 2014; Dogsa et al., 2021). Both ComA and the srfA de-repression, therefore, have significant effects on HGT, which shapes microbial evolution and ecology. Transformation also requires extracellular DNA (eDNA), which is spontaneously released by B. subtilis during growth (Zafra et al., 2012) through a mechanism that is not yet fully understood.

Results Results Genetic Transformation via DNA Exchange Genetic Transformation via DNA Exchange Genetic Transformation via DNA Exchange Genetic transformation is mostly studied in monocultures to which extracellular DNA with an antibiotic resistance locus is added, and transformants are selected on LB agar plates containing this antibiotic (Figure 1A). However, in a natural setting, DNA is usually released by cells that undergo lysis or actively release DNA (reviewed in Ibáñez de Aldecoa et al., 2017), which could be captured by cells in the vicinity (Steinmoen et al., 2002; Veening and Blokesch, 2017). This assumption was tested by mixing two B. subtilis PS-216 strains, which carry different antibiotic markers (chloramphenicol or spectinomycin resistance cassettes/cat or spec) integrated at different chromosomal loci, at 1:1 ratio. After the indicated incubation time, transformants were selected by plating the co-culture directly on LB agar plates with both antibiotics (Figure 1B). We refer to this process as DNA exchange because both single-antibiotic resistance strains have a comparable chance to acquire the resistance gene of the second antibiotic, thereby becoming double-antibiotic resistant. The results show that transformation frequency by DNA exchange is high [(2.2 ± 0.84) × 10–5]. If the standard transformation assay was carried out by adding the saturating concentration of DNA to PS-216 monoculture, the detected transformation frequency was (1.17 ± 0.22) × 10–5 (Figure 1C). Next, it was tested whether DNA exchange is mediated by transformation by adding DNase I (100 U) to the co-culture and again selecting transformants for CatRSpecRdouble resistance. DNA exchange of PS-216 wild-type strains in co-culture was completely abolished in the presence of DNase I. The fact that we could not detect any transformants in the presence of DNase I indicates that DNA exchange is mediated by free DNA and not horizontal gene transfer vesicles.

Bacillus subtilis strain was grown in monoculture in CM medium for 6 h at 37°C and 200 rpm and then genomic DNA carrying an antibiotic resistance marker (chloramphenicol-CatR) was added to the medium.

Surfactin Promotes DNA Release and Facilitates Intraspecies DNA Exchange Surfactin Promotes DNA Release and Facilitates Intraspecies DNA Exchange Surfactin Promotes DNA Release and Facilitates Intraspecies DNA Exchange It is already known that B. subtilis NCIB 3610 secretes high molecular weight DNA during growth (Zafra et al., 2012) and that B. subtilis strains with a deletion in the surfactin operon (B. subtilis NCIB 3610 ΔsrfAA) are impaired in DNA release (Zafra et al., 2012). However, whether surfactin may have a direct or indirect role in this process has not been tested directly. To determine the relationship between surfactin concentration and DNA release, the ΔsrfA mutant (BM1044) was incubated with different concentrations of surfactin (2.5-20 μg ml–1) and eDNA concentration was compared with that released by the wild-type strain. eDNA concentration in the conditioned medium of the ΔsrfA mutant strain was approximately 15-fold lower than that in the conditioned medium of the wild-type strain (Figure 2A). We also observed that levels of eDNA released by the ΔsrfA mutant could be restored by the addition of surfactin to the growth medium, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2A). The maximal surfactin concentration (20 μg ml–1) recovered the phenotype of the surfactin mutant to the levels of the surfactin producing wild-type strain. This surfactin concentration was previously measured in the spent media of B. subtilis PS-216 during early stationary phase (Oslizlo et al., 2014). It is known that when the surfactin concentration is below or near the critical micelle concentration (10–25 μg ml–1) surfactin inserts into phospholipid layers inducing mild content leakage. On the other hand, at higher concentrations, surfactin attacks the phospholipid bilayer causing membrane solubilization (Deleu et al., 2013). The influence of surfactin concentration on final colony-forming units (CFU) was determined for a ΔsrfA mutant where CFU count did not decrease significantly with increasing surfactin concentration (Figure 2B). These results, therefore, indicated that surfactin promotes eDNA release, either through active release that might limit cell growth (although this is not easily detectable) or through cell lysis. It is already known that B. subtilis NCIB 3610 secretes high molecular weight DNA during growth (Zafra et al., 2012) and that B. subtilis strains with a deletion in the surfactin operon (B. subtilis NCIB 3610 ΔsrfAA) are impaired in DNA release (Zafra et al., 2012).

To further investigate whether cell lysis is responsible for eDNA release, levels of extracellular β-galactosidase in the conditioned medium of wtlacZ (BM1298) or ΔsrfAlacZ (BM1299) cultures were measured after incubation with surfactin (Figure 3A). β-galactosidase is localized intracellularly, and its presence in the culture supernatant is generally used as a measure of bacterial cell lysis (Steinmoen et al., 2002; Zafra et al., 2012). Early stationary phase cultures of the wtlacZ and ΔsrfAlacZ strains were exposed to surfactin (20 μg ml–1 in CM medium), and CFU, eDNA concentration, and extracellular β-galactosidase activity were measured after exposure to surfactin for 0-3 h (Figure 3). Extracellular β-galactosidase activity in wtlacZ-conditioned medium was to approximately threefold greater than that of ΔsrfAlacZ, in the absence of exogenously added surfactin. Increasing exposure to surfactin increased extracellular β-galactosidase activity of the ΔsrfAlacZ strain (Figure 3A), reaching levels similar to those in the wtlacZ strain after exposure to surfactin for 3 h (Figure 3A). Increasing surfactin exposure also significantly increased eDNA concentration measured in conditioned medium of the ΔsrfAlacZ strain, but had little effect on eDNA concentration in wtlacZ medium (Figure 3B). CFU showed a similar pattern, with twofold greater CFU counts in the ΔsrfAlacZ culture than in the wtlacZ culture, but a subsequent decrease in ΔsrfAlacZ CFU within increasing exposure to surfactin (Figure 3C). Together, these results indicated that surfactin causes cell lysis and thus DNA release within the B. subtilis population.

CFU showed a similar pattern, with twofold greater CFU counts in the ΔsrfAlacZ culture than in the wtlacZ culture, but a subsequent decrease in ΔsrfAlacZ CFU within increasing exposure to surfactin (Figure 3C). Together, these results indicated that surfactin causes cell lysis and thus DNA release within the B. subtilis population.

Surfactin-Mediated DNA Release Affects DNA Exchange Surfactin-Mediated DNA Release Affects DNA Exchange Surfactin-Mediated DNA Release Affects DNA Exchange The role of surfactin-mediated DNA release in DNA exchange in co-culture was then examined (Figure 4). This was determined by comparing the transformation frequency of differentially marked wild-type strains (wt + wt) and srfA mutants without or with added surfactin in co-cultures. When comparing transformation frequency of the ΔsrfA mutant, it is important to note that transposon insertion in the ΔsrfA mutant does not disrupt the comS gene and, therefore, should not significantly alter transformation frequency (Vollenbroich et al., 1994). This was confirmed by transforming the ΔsrfA mutant with the wild-type strain chromosomal DNA carrying tetracycline-resistance gene (2 h after the entry into competence state), and the wild-type strain and ΔsrfA mutant showed comparable transformation frequencies (p = 0.27), [(1.17 ± 0.22) × 10–5] and [(0.82 ± 0.16) × 10–5], respectively.

Next co-cultures of ΔsrfAcat (BM1062) and ΔsrfAspec (BM1063) strains were grown in the presence and absence of exogenous surfactin, and the CatRSpecR transformants were quantified after co-cultivation for 8 h in CM medium. The transformation frequency of the ΔsrfA co-culture increased approximately 10-fold after surfactin addition, reaching a level similar to the wild-type co-culture (Figure 4). eDNA concentration was also measured in these co-cultures before transformation frequency was determined. eDNA concentration of the ΔsrfA co-culture increased 2.4-fold after surfactin addition, reaching similar eDNA concentration as the wild-type co-culture (Figure 4).

Discussion Discussion It is well established that QS response regulators function in a pleiotropic manner by simultaneously modulating several different phenotypic traits (Schuster et al., 2003; Comella and Grossman, 2005; Antunes et al., 2007; Dandekar et al., 2012; Majerczyk et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). In this study, the role of the quorum-sensing regulated lipopeptide, surfactin, in the DNA release and the consequence of this action on DNA exchange between strains of B. subtilis were investigated. We provide evidence that DNA can be exchanged between strains without the external source of eDNA and that this HGT is dependent on eDNA released through surfactin action. It is well established that QS response regulators function in a pleiotropic manner by simultaneously modulating several different phenotypic traits (Schuster et al., 2003; Comella and Grossman, 2005; Antunes et al., 2007; Dandekar et al., 2012; Majerczyk et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). In this study, the role of the quorum-sensing regulated lipopeptide, surfactin, in the DNA release and the consequence of this action on DNA exchange between strains of B. subtilis were investigated. We provide evidence that DNA can be exchanged between strains without the external source of eDNA and that this HGT is dependent on eDNA released through surfactin action. The role of eDNA in horizontal gene transfer has been previously proposed for B. subtilis and other naturally competent bacteria such as Neisseria and Streptococcus (Dillard and Seifert, 2001; Steinmoen et al., 2002; Zafra et al., 2012; Veening and Blokesch, 2017). It has been shown that B. subtilis NCIB 3610 strain releases eDNA just before entry into the stationary phase and that the ΔsrfA mutant shows a defect in eDNA (Zafra et al., 2012), but the study did not indicate a direct role of surfactin in eDNA release. We provide this evidence that the lack of surfactin significantly impairs DNA exchange between ΔsrfAspec and ΔsrfAcat mutants, while the surfactin addition to the CM medium fully restores the transformation frequency of the ΔsrfA mutants. Although it could be argued that the srfA mutant may be defective in transformation also due to ComS deficiency, we showed that this is not the case as the ΔsrfA mutant used in this study was still transformable by externally added DNA to comparable levels as the wild-type strain. Moreover, surfactin addition to the co-culture of two srfA mutants restored the transformation to the wild-type levels, providing a direct evidence that this lipopeptide mediates DNA exchange, which can be abolished by DNase.

We provided here evidence that surfactin contributes to horizontal gene transfer by inducing cell lysis in a fraction of cells. It is known that surfactin producers are protected against surfactin due to resistance provided by efflux pump SwrC (YerP), which is responsible for surfactin secretion and self-resistance to surfactin (Tsuge et al., 2001). A self-tolerance against the membrane active surfactin might also be provided by the modification of the phospholipid content in the membrane of the B. subtilis cells (Uttlová et al., 2016). Although all cells activate srfA operon, over time, they show a broad heterogeneity in srfA expression levels (Miras and Dubnau, 2016; Dogsa et al., 2021). Moreover, although specific subpopulation undergoing lysis has not been detected, we have recently reported that srfA operon is already activated during the early to mid-exponential phase (Dogsa et al., 2021), between 2.5 and 3 h of growth, where strong heterogeneity in srfA expression is evident with a small population showing very low fluorescence of srfA-cfp reporter (Dogsa et al., 2021). Therefore, cells expressing srfA operon at very low levels might be the potential targets of surfactin-mediated lysis. We have previously observed that the membrane permeability changes during the planktonic growth of B. subtilis-PS-216 culture with the highest proportion of “damaged” cells (approximately 25-30%) detected around 4 h of growth (late exponential phase) (Oslizlo et al., 2014). This number dropped to only 10% in surfactin non-producers (Oslizlo et al., 2014). Although it remains to be proven whether this change in cell permeability is linked to surfactin-mediated lysis and eDNA release, this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that surfactin increases a proportion of cells with compromised membrane integrity (Deleu et al., 2013). This phenotypic change in the membrane is especially interesting because it coincides in time with the induction of the master regulator ComK and the transition to K-state (Miras and Dubnau, 2016) in 10-20% of cells (Maamar and Dubnau, 2005; Miras and Dubnau, 2016; Maier, 2020). These cells are known to be resistant to antibiotics, most probably due to growth arrest (Nester and Stocker, 1963; Engelmoer and Rozen, 2011; Yüksel et al., 2016), and therefore not targeted for surfactin lysis.

Surfactin has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, and it can also lyse other Bacilli and non-Bacilli (Sharma et al., 2020), but the frequency of homologous recombination decreases sharply with the level of relatedness between the donor DNA and recipient strain’s genome (Majewski and Cohan, 1999). Therefore, we suggest that the action of surfactin may be more important for horizontal gene transfer between genetically highly related B. subtills strains or even within clonal populations and not between distantly related Bacillus strains. We have recently shown that the DNA exchange also occurs on agar surfaces at the meeting point of two swarms (Stefanic et al., 2021). However, it needs to be tested whether surfactin, which is essential for surface spreading, also contributes to eDNA release during swarming.

To conclude, we have demonstrated that surfactin contributes to horizontal gene transfer between the two almost identical populations of B. subtilis by inducing cell lysis in a fraction of cells. eDNA released from lysed cells then serves as the source of new genetic traits for nearby competent cells or for DNA repair, if exchange occurs within clonal population. Therefore, surfactin is linked to horizontal gene transfer at the level of its operon, which embeds ComS and, as a pore-forming lipopeptide, that contributes to eDNA pool.
