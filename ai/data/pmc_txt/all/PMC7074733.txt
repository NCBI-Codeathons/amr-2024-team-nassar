Organic fertilizer is a major carrier that stores and transmits antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In the environment, due to the application of organic fertilizers in agriculture, the increasing diversity and abundance of ARGs poses a potential threat to human health and environmental safety. In this paper, the microbial community structure and ARGs in different types of organic fertilizer treated with composting were examined. We found that the abundance and diversity of ARGs in earthworm cast organic fertilizer were the lowest and the highest in chicken manure organic fertilizer. Interestingly, the abundance and diversity of ARGs, especially beta-lactam resistance genes, sulfonamide resistance genes, and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance genes, in organic fertilizers were reduced significantly, while composting caused no significant change in mobile genetic elements (MGEs), where antibiotic deactivation and the use of efflux pumps were the two most dominant mechanisms. It was clear that removal of ARGs became more efficient with increasing reduction in the bacterial abundances and diversity of potential ARG hosts, and integron-mediated horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) played an important role in the proliferation of most ARG types. Therefore, the reduction in ARGs was mainly driven by changes in bacterial community composition caused by composting. Furthermore, rather than HGTs, the diversity and abundance of bacterial communities affected by compost physical and chemical properties were the main drivers shaping and altering the abundance and diversity of ARGs, which was indicated by a correlation analysis of these properties, antibiotic residues, microbial community structure, and ARGs. In general, high-temperature composting effectively removed antibiotic residues and ARGs from these organic fertilizers; however, it cannot prevent the proliferation of MGEs. The insights gained from these results may be of assistance in the safe and rational use of organic fertilizers by indicating the changes in microbial community structure and ARGs in different types of organic fertilizer treated with composting. 1. Introduction 1. Introduction Antibiotics have been widely used in disease prevention and treatment for animals and humans. In the mid-1950s, scientists obtained multidrug-resistant bacteria through isolation and culture [1]. At that time, people were aware of the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and drug resistance genes, and they attracted widespread attention. A report published by the WHO states that antibiotic resistance has become increasingly serious and will seriously threaten human health, and it suggests that this topic should receive increasing attention [2]. In current research, ARGs are emerging environmental pollutants and are widely distributed in soil, air, and water, while human activities have promoted the spread of ARGs [3].

A report published by the WHO states that antibiotic resistance has become increasingly serious and will seriously threaten human health, and it suggests that this topic should receive increasing attention [2]. In current research, ARGs are emerging environmental pollutants and are widely distributed in soil, air, and water, while human activities have promoted the spread of ARGs [3]. Due to the increasing use of antibiotics in agricultural production and livestock breeding, antibiotic resistance has become increasingly severe [4]. Antimicrobials constitute more than 6% of all prescriptions in human medicine, and more than 70% of all consumed pharmaceuticals in veterinary medicine [5]. For example, it is reported that in Turkey, antibacterial drugs used to treat diseased animals and used as a prophylactic or to promote the growth of the undiseased animals account for 33% of the total veterinary pharmaceutical consumption [6]. In Denmark, consumption of antibiotics in 1997 exceeded more than 150 t, out of which >100 t were used as growth promoters [7], while there was an increase of nearly 80-fold in antibiotic usage for growth promotion within a span of four decades in the US [8]. A similar increase in antibiotic usage has been observed in several other countries (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, the EU) [9]. In particular, China uses more than 46% of the world’s antibiotics to ensure growth augmentation and disease control in livestock industries [10,11]. However, only a small concentration of consumed antibiotics can be absorbed because most antibiotics are excreted into the environment through excrement, and manure is considered an important reservoir for environmental antibiotic contamination [12,13]. Therefore, in the environmental microbiota, unprocessed manure contains large amounts of ARGs and antibiotic residues [14,15]. To increase animal immunity and yield, antibiotics (especially tetracyclines (TCs), sulfonamides (SAs), and fluoroquinolones (FLQs)) are widely used as veterinary drugs and growth promoters in the farming industry [16,17]. TCs, SAs, and FLQs have been detected in liquid manure and dung samples at up to 46, 91, and 8.3 mg kg−1, respectively [18]. Repeated fertilization of agricultural soils with animal manure can lead to a nonpoint source contamination of the terrestrial environment with these substances, and in turn, accumulation of them in agricultural soils. Studies of the occurrence of various antimicrobials in different soils fertilized with animal manure reported the maximum concentrations of 0.3 mg kg−1, 0.015 mg kg−1, and 0.37 mg kg−1 for TCs, SAs, and FLQs, respectively [18,19,20]. Of all antibiotics, 22% of SAs and 66% of TCs are used in the animal industry. For swine, the frequency of ARGs carried by bacteria seems to be especially high compared to that of other livestock due to the extensive use of antibiotics in these animals. In addition, the concentration of TC reached as high as 300 mg kg−1 soil, which demonstrates that repeated fertilization with liquid manure from intensive pig farming leads to the accumulation of this antibiotic [21]. When soil received raw or digested manure, vegetables may be contaminated by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The misuse and overuse of continuous emissions into the environment of antibiotics has raised concerns over the risk of promoting antibiotic resistance [22,23,24].

The misuse and overuse of continuous emissions into the environment of antibiotics has raised concerns over the risk of promoting antibiotic resistance [22,23,24]. In Shandong Province, approximately 30% of the annual agricultural product income comes from the livestock breeding industry, and it trends upward year by year. By the end of 2018, the number of live pigs in livestock farms in Shandong Province was 46.6 million, and studies have found that antibiotics that can be completely absorbed by animals account for less than 70% of the total antibiotics used and that most are excreted [25,26]. In addition, antibiotics affect cell functions, change the expression of virulence factors, and result in the transfer of antibiotic resistance at subinhibitory concentrations. However, resistance to antibiotics is a highly complex process that is not completely understood, even in clinical environments. Therefore, although direct sunlight drying, indoor air drying, composting, and other bioconversion treatments have been used for the utilization and treatment of manure in large livestock and poultry farms [27], livestock manure is widely used in agricultural production and current processes do not have sufficient capacity to address emerging environmental contaminants such as antibiotics, resistant bacteria and ARGs (The 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Modern Animal Husbandry in Shandong Province (2016–2020)).

In this work, four livestock manures were studied. Changes in physicochemical properties (pH, C, N, NH4+-N, and NO3−-N) and antibiotic residues (sulfadiazine (SDZ), oxytocin (OTC), sulfamethazine (SMZ), chlortetracycline (CTC), sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMN), TC, ofloxacin (Oflox), doxycycline (Dox), and enrofloxacin (Enroflox)) before and after composting were determined. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate changes in bacterial community characteristics; high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) targeting 285 ARGs, 10 mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and 16S rRNA marker genes was used to characterize the ARGs in organic fertilizers before and after compositing. Bipartite network analysis was used to reveal the ARGs shared between uncomposted organic fertilizers and compost-treated organic fertilizers. To explore how antibiotic resistance in organic fertilizers changes before and after composting, the effect of composting on organic fertilizers and the relationships of physicochemical properties, microbial community and ARGs were analyzed. The outcome will provide important theoretical support for the rational utilization of organic fertilizer in agriculture and the effective disposal of wastes.

Each 25 μL PCR contained 12.5 μL of 2 × T5 super PCR Mix, 1 μL of forward primer (10 μM), 1 μL of reverse primer (10 μM), 10 ng of template DNA, and nuclease-free water to a volume of 25 μL. The conditions of PCR amplification and recovery of purified products were performed as follows: first, the sample was incubated at 98 °C for 3 min to activate the PCR enzyme. Then, 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 30 s were performed.

Real-Time Quantitative PCR and High-Throughput Quantitative PCR Analysis 2.5. Real-Time Quantitative PCR and High-Throughput Quantitative PCR Analysis 2.5. Real-Time Quantitative PCR and High-Throughput Quantitative PCR Analysis To obtain total bacterial abundances, this study used real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Light Cycler 480 II) (Roche Scientific, Indianapolis, IN, USA) with the universal primers 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3′) and 907R (5′-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT-3′) for amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in triplicate. All assays were conducted in a 20 μL qPCR system consisting of 10 μL of 2 × TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix (AQ131, Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China), 0.5 μL of each primer (10 μM concentration, 0.5 μM final), 2 μL of DNA as a template, and 7 μL of HyPure Molecular Biology grade water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The thermal profile of RT-qPCR was as follows: the initial enzyme activation was performed at 95 °C for 5 min, and then 40 cycles of the following procedure were used for amplification: 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. A negative control group used three RNase-free water samples as the template in reactions. To obtain a standard curve, Escherichia coli was used to clone the 16S rRNA-encoding gene, which was transferred to a plasmid as a target gene, and then 10-fold gradient dilution was performed (amplification efficiency 96−104%, r2 > 0.99).

In this experiment, the 10-fold gradient dilution of the plasmid standard solution was processed together with the sample and tested. The number of 16S rRNA-encoding genes in the sample was quantified by a standard curve generated by the plasmid. To obtain total bacterial abundances, this study used real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Light Cycler 480 II) (Roche Scientific, Indianapolis, IN, USA) with the universal primers 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3′) and 907R (5′-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT-3′) for amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in triplicate. All assays were conducted in a 20 μL qPCR system consisting of 10 μL of 2 × TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix (AQ131, Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China), 0.5 μL of each primer (10 μM concentration, 0.5 μM final), 2 μL of DNA as a template, and 7 μL of HyPure Molecular Biology grade water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The thermal profile of RT-qPCR was as follows: the initial enzyme activation was performed at 95 °C for 5 min, and then 40 cycles of the following procedure were used for amplification: 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 20 s.

The number of 16S rRNA-encoding genes in the sample was quantified by a standard curve generated by the plasmid. The relative abundance of ARGs was determined by using real-time PCR (Wafergen SmartChip Real-time PCR system) (Wafergen, Fremont, CA). The primers used in this experiment targeted almost all major categories of ARGs and MGEs (8 transposases, class 1 integrons, clinical class 1 integrons) and the 16S rRNA genes, for a total of 296 targets (Table S2) [35,36]. The qPCRs were performed as previously described: 100 nL (50 nL from an assay source plate and 50 nL from a sample source plate) containing the required 1x Light Cycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Scientific, Indianapolis, IN, USA), RNase-free PCR-grade water, each primer and DNA template was added per well. The wells need to be heated to 95 °C for 10 min to activate the enzyme, and then 40 cycles were performed according to the following procedure: 30 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C [35]. The qPCR results were obtained directly by Wafergen software. Analyzing the experimental results identified samples with multiple melting peaks and amplification efficiencies beyond the range of 1.8–2.2, which were then not used. The experiment used a threshold cycle (Ct) of 31 as the detection limit, and ARGs amplified in all replicates could be used. The relative copy number was calculated according to Equation (1), and the absolute copy number was calculated from the 16S rRNA gene copy number according to Equation (2) [37,38,39,40,41].

Antibiotic Residues in Organic Fertilizer Because of sorption, antibiotics are often concentrated in the solid phase of manure [44,45,46,47]. In addition, the half-lives of different antibiotics in the manure varied [48,49], and the anticipated storage period of manure was longer than these half-lives. This result indicated that before manure was used for agriculture, the parent antibiotic compounds may have degraded.

This result indicated that before manure was used for agriculture, the parent antibiotic compounds may have degraded. Figure S1 shows the degradation of antibiotics in the four groups of organic fertilizers before and after composting. With the completion of composting, TCs, SAs, and quinolones in the CM group were obviously degraded. In the CM group, the removal rates of OTC, Dox, Oflox, and SMN reached more than 60%. At the same time, the OTC concentration in the CM samples decreased significantly, and the final elimination rate reached 100%. It has been reported that during manure composting, OTC may degrade with a total removal of over 90%, which is consistent with our results. The antibiotic residues in the EC group and SM group were lower than the detection limit, so they were not detected. The Oflox (a quinolone) removal rate in the CM group organic fertilizer was 48%. The Enroflox removal rate was 26.7%. TC, CTC, and SDZ were not detected, probably due to the low levels remaining.

When composting, the organic matter in the manure is generally utilized and converted by microbes by humification or mineralization. In addition, the microbial activity can be reflected by variation in the C/N ratio; obviously, the C/N ratio of the ECC, CDC, and SMC groups were lower than that of groups without composting (Figure S3). Conversely, the C/N ratio in the CM group after composting was significantly higher than that in the uncomposted samples.

Figure 6 shows that after composting treatment, the content of ARGs in CM and CD groups is reduced, but the EC and SM samples show opposite trends. In EC samples and SM samples, MGEs increased after composting, which was the same trend as that found for ARGs. The absolute abundance of ARGs in organic fertilizer samples ranged from 2.3 × 104 to 2.49 × 107 copies g−1 solid dry weight (Figure 6).

Because of the different numbers of bacterial cells in organic fertilizer samples, the normalized copy numbers of ARGs and MGEs were calculated relative to the 16S rRNA gene copy number (Figure S7). Obviously, composting reduced ARGs in organic fertilizers, but ARGs in SM samples increased after composting, as did MGEs. In addition, we observed that EC samples had less ARG richness and diversity than other samples, and their abundance of MGEs was much lower than that of other samples.

According to a heat map analysis (Figure 7), the total abundance of ARGs in the samples after organic fertilizer composting was lower than that before organic fertilizer composting. However, in the SM group of organic fertilizers, the abundance of multidrug, MLSB, chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, ARGs, and MGEs after composting was higher than that of uncomposted fertilizers, and the same phenomenon appeared in the EC group for chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, ARGs, and MGEs.

In view of the different amounts of antibiotics added to feed used in poultry farming, the abundance of native ARGs in the intestines of poultry also varies. Although the abundance of some ARGs after composting is higher than that before composting in this study, the overall results show that the abundance of most ARGs after composting is significantly reduced. ARGs from different sources of organic fertilizers are not exactly the same, but overall, aminoglycoside resistance genes and MGEs are relatively abundant.

Figure 8 shows the enrichment in ARGs in each organic fertilizer sample, and the total enrichment in organic fertilizer samples was approximated for all ARGs. The absolute gene copy number of ARGs ranged from 0 to 313,328.57 (the CMU sample). This result showed that the antibiotic resistance in different manures showed large discrepancies and that the variation in different antibiotic types varied clearly among organic fertilizer samples, especially those without composting which had the highest abundance.

Correlation between ARGs and Microorganisms 3.4.3. Correlation between ARGs and Microorganisms The cooccurring ARGs, MGEs (relative gene copy number) and potential host bacteria (at the phylum level, 16S rRNA gene sequence data) based on Pearson’s correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) were analyzed by network analysis (Figure 9). As Figure 9 shows, bacteria in the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes showed close relationships with several ARG types (such as TC, MLSB, and intl-1 (clinic) ARGs). In addition, SA resistance genes, TC resistance genes and integrase genes showed significant and positive correlations with Proteobacteria; six multidrug resistance genes (marR-01, yceL/mdtH-01, emrD, acrA-04, oprJ, and oprD) and five vancomycin resistance genes (vanXD, vanHB, vanRA-01, vanA, and vanRA-02) showed significant and positive correlations with Nitrospirae; however, the relationship between Bacteroidetes and the ARGs was generally weak. When there was a strong and significant positive correlation between ARGs and coexisting microbial populations, it can be speculated that the cooccurrence pattern between ARGs and microbial populations is nonrandom, further indicating possible host information for ARGs. Thus, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Nitrospirae were identified as potential hosts for ARGs.

Thus, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Nitrospirae were identified as potential hosts for ARGs. The relationships between environmental factors, MGEs, microbial communities, and ARGs were explored by performing canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (Figure 10). The microbial communities at the phylum level and MGEs were analyzed as the environmental factors for ARGs, and the first two principal components (PCs) accounted for 88.3% of the total variation. The pH and NO3− exhibited a significant positive relationship with the abundance of ARGs in fertilizer. Additionally, TN, TC, and the C/N exhibited no significant correlation with ARGs. Four phyla (Deinococcus-Thermus, Actinobacteria,
Gemmatimonadetes, and Bacteroidetes) were found significantly correlated with the ARGs in fertilizer (p < 0.05). Deinococcus-Thermus, Actinobacteria, and pH positively correlated with the first axis (explaining 68.96% of total variance) and SMC and CMC samples. However, the phyla Nitrospirae and Planctomycetes were negatively correlated with the first axis but positively correlated with the second axis (explaining 19.34% of total variance) and the ECU sample. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to determine the key contributor of bacterial communities and MGEs to the variation as whole or separate factors (Figure 10), and the variation was 92.58%, which could explain the selected variables; the bacterial community contributed 46.29% of the total ARG variation, which was higher than the contributions of environmental factors (23.86%) and MGEs (22.43%). The Mantel test (Bray−Curtis distance, r = 0.4959, p < 0.05) showed that, regardless of composting, a significant correlation between bacterial communities (OTUs) and ARG profiles was obvious.

Discussion and Conclusions 4. Discussion and Conclusions Through an analysis of physicochemical properties and antibiotic residues and comparing different treatment methods and organic fertilizers, it can be seen that composting can significantly reduce the antibiotic residues in organic fertilizers. The degradation of SMN during the composting of animal manure is inconsistent. This result was in good agreement with the results of the last two studies: dairy cow manure can effectively decompose the residual SMN after composting, which is speculated to be caused by the combined effects of raw material solids and temperature [51]. At the same time, the results of He’s research showed that the SA and SDZ remaining in the broiler manure were almost completely degraded after composting. This phenomenon may be caused by temperature-dependent abiotic processes [52]. Composting can effectively degrade residual antibiotics in organic fertilizers but not completely remove them. The possible reason was that the antibiotic residue decayed significantly in the manure after the treatment, resulting in decreased antibiotic residue [29]. Previous studies showed that the target antibiotics were removed, while the proliferation of ARGs could not be prevented, and there is a significant positive correlation between the residues of antibiotics at subtherapeutic levels and the accumulation of ARGs [53], and that their degradation also has a positive effect on maintaining the presence of ARGs [54]. The addition of antibiotics inhibits microbial activity in the early stages of composting but promotes the proliferation of ARGs, especially in the mesophilic phase. Integron-mediated horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in the proliferation of most ARG types studied [55,56,57,58,59]. Therefore, as antibiotic residues still exist in organic fertilizers, their effects on ARG proliferation cannot be ignored.

Therefore, as antibiotic residues still exist in organic fertilizers, their effects on ARG proliferation cannot be ignored. After composting, the C/N changes of EC, CD, SM, and CM groups indirectly reflected their microbial activity. Analyzing the differences in microbial community structure of organic fertilizer indicated that there are obvious differences in the microbial community structures of different organic fertilizers and that composting obviously changes the microbial community structure in organic manure. The manure-borne bacterial community showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased in the EC (13%), CD (50%), SM (33.7%), and CM (48.5%) groups after composting (Figure S5).

The manure-borne bacterial community showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased in the EC (13%), CD (50%), SM (33.7%), and CM (48.5%) groups after composting (Figure S5). To evaluate the effect of compost on ARGs, we used HT-qPCR to quantify the abundance and diversity of ARGs. Although the types and abundances of the 285 assessed ARGs differed greatly from those found in organic fertilizer, a total of 218 ARGs and 10 MGEs were detected, which was consistent with previous studies [11,60] and indicated the importance of animal manure as a reservoir for ARGs [61,62,63]. ARGs for broad-spectrum antibiotics were detected, and some of these ARGs have never been previously reported in organic fertilizer samples [64,65,66,67]. However, this broad-spectrum distribution of ARGs in organic fertilizer samples varies from that in soil samples [55,68]. Although the relative abundance varied among different organic fertilizer samples, the types of ARGs were roughly the same. This is attributable mainly to the different antibiotic contact histories of the two environments [69,70]. Furthermore, previous studies have found that thermophilic anaerobic digestion decreased ARGs better than moderate and mesophilic anaerobic digestion [71,72]. Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in this study showed that after organic fertilizer composting, the diversity and abundance of the microbial community was improved, the dominant population changed significantly (specifically, in the CMC group, Actinobacteria (48.5%) became the dominant population, in the CDC group, Actinobacteria (50%) is the dominant population and in the SMC group, Actinobacteria (33.7%) is the dominant population, while in the ECC group, Cytophagia (28.8%) and Actinobacteria (13.3%) became the dominant populations). Combining these experimental results, it can be found that after organic fertilizer composting, the diversity and abundance of ARGs was significantly reduced (ranged from 2.3 × 104 to 2.49 × 107) and there was a significant correlation between ARG structure and bacterial community composition (p < 0.05) (Figure 9).

The experimental results showed that no complete elimination of ARGs occurred with and without composting. According to the experimental conditions before and after composting, it can be speculated that the dynamic change in ARGs may be attributed to the HGT produced by bacterial cells through MGEs, the changes in the concentrations of residual antibiotics, the changes in NH4+-N and NO3−-N content, the temperature change during compost, and the succession of the related bacterial communities. Previous studies have found that reducing MGEs plays a key role in the removal of ARG from compost, which is consistent with our results [73]. In addition, the integrase gene copy number remained nearly constant after composting, which may reflect no significant change in the integron-mediated HGT activity with composting. Current research has found that these relatively abundant ARGs are often detected in organic fertilizers [65]. Clearly, the enrichment in ARGs without composting was much higher than that with composting, which may be due to the many antibiotic residues and ARGs in poultry manure, as poultry manures are regarded as reservoirs of ARGs [39,55,65]. Of course, the amount of antibiotics added to the feed used in different poultry farms is different, and the abundance of native ARGs in the intestines of poultry is different, which may lead to this phenomenon. Although the abundance of some ARGs increased after composting, the overall results showed that the abundance of most ARGs after composting was significantly reduced. Organic fertilizers from different sources have unique ARGs, but overall, aminoglycoside resistance genes and MGEs exhibited high abundance. Existing research results show that composting can effectively reduce most types of ARGs in livestock manure [65]. According to the composting conditions, the temperature increase in the thermophilic phase during the composting process and the exposure to the air during the composting process are not conducive to the survival of anaerobic bacteria, which may lead to a reduction in ARGs after organic fertilizer composting [74]. Due to the anaerobic environment in the intestines of animals and the existence of a large number of Gram-negative bacteria that can carry various ARGs, these ARGs generally do not exist in thermophiles; therefore, composting organic manure for poultry and livestock can effectively reduce [65] ARG content. The experimental results showed that no complete elimination of ARGs occurred with and without composting. According to the experimental conditions before and after composting, it can be speculated that the dynamic change in ARGs may be attributed to the HGT produced by bacterial cells through MGEs, the changes in the concentrations of residual antibiotics, the changes in NH4+-N and NO3−-N content, the temperature change during compost, and the succession of the related bacterial communities. Previous studies have found that reducing MGEs plays a key role in the removal of ARG from compost, which is consistent with our results [73]. In addition, the integrase gene copy number remained nearly constant after composting, which may reflect no significant change in the integron-mediated HGT activity with composting. Current research has found that these relatively abundant ARGs are often detected in organic fertilizers [65]. Clearly, the enrichment in ARGs without composting was much higher than that with composting, which may be due to the many antibiotic residues and ARGs in poultry manure, as poultry manures are regarded as reservoirs of ARGs [39,55,65]. Of course, the amount of antibiotics added to the feed used in different poultry farms is different, and the abundance of native ARGs in the intestines of poultry is different, which may lead to this phenomenon. Although the abundance of some ARGs increased after composting, the overall results showed that the abundance of most ARGs after composting was significantly reduced. Organic fertilizers from different sources have unique ARGs, but overall, aminoglycoside resistance genes and MGEs exhibited high abundance. Existing research results show that composting can effectively reduce most types of ARGs in livestock manure [65]. According to the composting conditions, the temperature increase in the thermophilic phase during the composting process and the exposure to the air during the composting process are not conducive to the survival of anaerobic bacteria, which may lead to a reduction in ARGs after organic fertilizer composting [74]. Due to the anaerobic environment in the intestines of animals and the existence of a large number of Gram-negative bacteria that can carry various ARGs, these ARGs generally do not exist in thermophiles; therefore, composting organic manure for poultry and livestock can effectively reduce [65] ARG content. According to the Pearson’s correlation coefficients in this study (p < 0.05), the correlation between ARGs (qPCR data) and bacterial community structure and composition (16S rRNA OTU data) was significant (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 9). After composting, ARGs showed a significant correlation with the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria clearly increased (Figure S5 and Figure 9). Previous studies have found that Bacilli and Flavobacteria within Firmicutes, which prevail during the thermophilic phase of composting, were significantly related to ARGs [75]. Many previous reports have shown that [76] Actinobacteria exhibit multiresistance and self-resistance [77] and that these bacteria are regarded as the main host microbial community of ARGs. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria are some of the most prevalent predicted source phyla of ARGs and have a clear correlation with changes in the abundance and diversity of ARGs based on the main resistance mechanisms of acetyltransferases and phosphotransferases [78]. This may also cause aminoglycoside resistance genes to be enriched in organic fertilizers after composting.

This may also cause aminoglycoside resistance genes to be enriched in organic fertilizers after composting. These results suggested that rather than HGT, the diversity and abundance of bacterial communities affected by physical and chemical properties were the main drivers of shaping and altering the abundance and diversity of ARGs. Previous studies have shown that bacterial community composition is the main determinant of soil ARG content, which is consistent with the results of this study [78]. As the VPA shows, the percentage of variation explained by MGEs is only 22.43%, which is lower than the percentage explained by the bacterial community and environmental factors. This result indicated that the HGT of ARGs before and after composting is less important than other factors in this study. However, the microbial community structure before and after the composting of different organic fertilizers is very different, and the diversity and abundance of most samples after composting are higher than those before composting. Therefore, HGT cannot be ruled out. Moreover, there is a clear positive correlation between MGEs and ARGs, which further proves that the potential of HGT to spread and concentrate ARGs cannot be ignored. Abundant and enriched ARGs can still be detected after composting, which indicates that direct application of composted organic fertilizers in the field may lead to the spread of ARGs in soils. Organic fertilizers from different sources have different abundances and diversities of ARGs due to the influence of different livestock and feeding sources. Although composting can effectively reduce the abundance of ARGs, the changes in MGEs are limited, so HGT fails to prevent ARG proliferation and its impact cannot be underestimated.
