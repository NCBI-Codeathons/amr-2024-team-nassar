Oral delivery is considered as the most preferred and yet most challenging mode of drug administration; especially a fragile and sensitive peptide like insulin that shows extremely low bioavailability through the gastro-intestinal (GIT) route. To address this problem, we have designed a novel drug delivery system (DDS) using precipitation-induced Barium (Ba) salt particles. The DDS can load insulin molecules and transport them through the GIT route. There were several in vitro simulation tests carried out to prove the efficiency of Ba salt particles as oral delivery candidates. All three Ba salt particles (BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3) showed very good loading of insulin (>70% in all formulations) and a degree of resistance throughout a wide range of pHs from basic to acidic conditions when assessed by spectrophotometry. Particles and insulin-associated particles were morphologically assessed and characterized using FE-SEM and FT-IR. A set of tests were designed and carried out with mucin to predict whether the particles are potentially capable of overcoming one of the barriers for crossing intestinal epithelium. The mucin binding experiment demonstrated 60–100% of mucin adhesion to the three different particles. FT-IR identifies the characteristic peaks for mucin protein, particles, and particle-mucin complex re-confirming mucin adhesion to the particles. Finally, the effectiveness of nano-insulin was tested on streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. A short acting human insulin analog, insulin aspart, was loaded into Ba salt particles at a dose of 100 IU/Kg prior to oral administration. Among the three formulations, insulin aspart-loaded BaSO4 and BaCO3 particles dramatically reduced the existing hyperglycemia. BaSO4 with loaded Insulin showed an onset of glucose-lowering action within 1 hr, with blood glucose level measured significantly lower compared to the 2nd and 3rd h (p < 0.05). Insulin-loaded BaCO3 particles showed a significant decrease in blood glucose level at 1–2 h, although the glucose level started to show a slight rise at 3rd h and by 4th h, it was back to baseline level. However, although BaSO3 particles with loaded insulin showed a trend of reduction in blood glucose level, the reduction was not found to be significant (p < 0.05) at any point in time. Therefore, oral formulations of insulin/BaSO4 and insulin/BaCO3 particles were observed as effective as native insulin aspart subcutaneous formulation in terms of onset and duration of action. Further investigation will be needed to reveal bioavailability and mechanism of action of this novel Nano-Insulin formulations. 1. Introduction 1. Introduction The emergence of protein therapeutics is being considered as one of the biggest milestones of 20th century medical and pharmaceutical science [1]. Advancement in biotechnology and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of clinical conditions helped several protein and peptide drugs to be recognized as potential therapeutics [2]. The trend is ongoing and in the next few decades, protein and peptide therapeutics will be covering an even bigger share of pharmaceutical products in industry. However, one disturbing fact for protein and peptide therapeutics is that there is a scarcity in noninvasive oral modes of administration. Proteins are naturally hydrophilic molecules with poor absorbance through the intestine and often prone to harsh pH and enzymatic degradation [2]. For example, the first-ever protein molecule used as therapeutic was insulin which, since that time, has been the one and only treatment for type1 diabetes as well as for type2 diabetes mellitus [1]. Yet, the only form of treatment available for insulin is the injectable form. Regular and very frequent subcutaneous (SC) administrations are associated with low patient compliance and multiple injection site injuries. Unfortunately, it is not possible to administrate insulin as an oral tablet. Insulin is a small 51 amino acid peptide molecule that is not resistant to stomach acid or enzymatic degradation.

Regular and very frequent subcutaneous (SC) administrations are associated with low patient compliance and multiple injection site injuries. Unfortunately, it is not possible to administrate insulin as an oral tablet. Insulin is a small 51 amino acid peptide molecule that is not resistant to stomach acid or enzymatic degradation. Delivery through the oral route is generally recognized as the delivery of drugs through the GIT where the start point for a drug can be mouth or buccal and the absorption can take place from different parts of the small and large intestine [3]. Popular searches for oral insulin are mostly restricted to direct delivery from mouth to absorption through the small intestinal wall [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. The complex GI tract is one single tube intended to serve one single purpose of entry and absorbance of nutrients from an outside source and making them available to the body. The tube is divided into different organs with each organ having its own pH and enzymatic environment. For example, stomach and small intestine pH and secretary enzymes are specialized in modifying and breaking peptide and protein molecules. In this process, these organs destroy any protein drug that goes through them non-discriminatorily [3,11]. The pH and enzymes are considered a primary barrier for oral delivery of insulin and other protein drugs. Another barrier is intestinal absorption of high molecular weight protein in intact form. The intestinal wall is covered with a mucus layer which is a combination of glycoproteins and bicarbonate ions. Beneath the mucus is the epithelium, basement membrane (non-cellular layer), and a layer of submucosa that holds blood vessels and lymphatic ducts. There are different modes of uptake of molecules (phagocytosis, absorption through payer’s patches, or endocytosis by enterocytes) depending on the size, surface charge, hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of the molecule [3,12]. Absorption of an intact protein fails mostly due to its size and hydrophilic nature.

Absorption of an intact protein fails mostly due to its size and hydrophilic nature. Despite all those setbacks, there have been several strategies proposed to design an oral protein formulation. The concept of attaching a protein molecule to another molecule that envelops and creates a cargo for it is a popular one. Nanoparticle-based strategies are best served for this concept. To be an ideal candidate for oral peptide delivery, a carrier molecule must meet few criteria, such as the ability to bind to a therapeutic molecule, showing adequate resistance to stand stomach harsh pH and enzymatic degradation and capacity to be absorbed through the intestinal wall. Due to the complexity of the task, until now the success rate in designing an oral protein formulation is still very low [3]. A popular choice for oral insulin carriers so far included polymeric nanoparticles, like poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and its derivatives. Insulin incorporated into a blended polymer of poly fumaric anhydride (FA) and PLGA 50: 50 (FA: PLGA) showed a reduction of glucose load in fasted rats for 3 h [4,5]. Another formulation of HP55-coated capsule containing PLGA/RS nanoparticle- loaded insulin gradually lowered glucose level from 10–15 h [6]. Apart from PLGA particles, there were few successful oral nano-insulin delivery tools reported using chitosan (CS) and its derivatives. PH-sensitive CS particles showed a promising 15 h long effect on blood glucose levels in diabetic rats, however, the effect started with a burst release [7]. Similarly, TBA (thiolated polymer 2-Iminothiolane)-attached CS with incorporated insulin showed a glucose-lowering effect for 24 h in non-diabetic rats [13]. Lysosome-entrapped insulin (LEI) also reported for successful oral insulin formulation [14,15]. Despite the success of the animal model, none of the formulations were qualified for the clinical trial. Most recently, oral insulin 338(1338) has been taken out of the Phase II clinical trial, although the formulation showed a good hyperglycemic grip in patients. Oral insulin 338(1338) was created by a combination of technologies involving amino acid substitution and linking to a carrier molecule. Acylation at 1338 via 18 C fatty acid let the insulin to bind reversibly with albumin which extended its half-life in circulation, while attachment to sodium caprate enhanced the absorption. The clinical trial was discontinued based on the finding that insulin 338(1338) was effective in a very high dose which would make production cost high [16]. However, insulin 338(1338) is the formulation that almost made its way to the market, with the most advanced research made in the oral insulin field to date.

However, insulin 338(1338) is the formulation that almost made its way to the market, with the most advanced research made in the oral insulin field to date. Another formulation is insulin tregopil (Biocon), a human insulin analog attached to a methoxy-triethylene-glycol-propionyl moiety linked to the Lys-β29 amino group and formulated with sodium caporate. Administration of 10–30-mg tablets showed promising effects on hyperglycemia. The clinical trial is ongoing and we can learn better about it in a few years. Again, the bioavailability estimated in dogs seems not very high (0.82–0.85%) which is common for oral insulin tablets [17,18]. ORMD-0801 from Oramed was successful in the Phase1 clinical trial and currently in the Phase2 clinical trial. The formulation was prepared by attaching insulin to a permeation enhancer, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and a chelator. Pre-clinical stage bioavailability in animal study was estimated at 5–8% [17,19]. The clinical trial showed a promising effect on controlling blood sugar levels without any noticeable adverse side-effect. Another formulation, Diasome, which can be given both orally and subcutaneously, is liver-targeted. The oral dosing is less effective compared to SC administration [17,20].

The first precipitation-based particle reported for insulin loading for oral delivery was strontium- substituted carbonate apatite which showed limited success in terms of binding and release in in vitro medium [21]. Here we report a novel group of precipitation-based salt particle formulations designed in our lab, having enormous potential as cargo for oral macromolecular drug delivery. There is no harsh temperature or pH processing required during the fabrication process that can contribute to preventing protein degradation or inactivation. In our earlier studies, we reported Group 2 metal sulfate, sulfite, and carbonate as potential delivery vehicles for genetic material and micromolecular drugs to tumor tissue [22,23]. These salt particles are less immunogenic compared to viral vectors and thus considered safer. Moreover, the flexible synthesis conditions make them easily modifiable depending on the target binding molecule and mode of delivery. They have a better drug loading capacity, and the drug release profile can be controlled as well [22]. In this study, we aimed to investigate their effectiveness as delivery vehicles for macromolecular peptides orally. Ba salt particles (BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3) have both positive and negative charged domains conferred, respectively, by cations (Ba2+) and anions (SO42−, SO32−, and CO32−). Due to heterogeneous charge distribution, these particles are capable of binding peptide molecules like insulin through electrostatic interactions. The particles were tested in vitro with excellent protein loading efficiency and release profile. They also demonstrated high resistance to withstand gastrointestinal pH and enzymatic environment along with the ability to efficiently bind mucin, indicating their potential capacity for intestinal absorption. Finally, using a short-acting human insulin analog (insulin aspart), the effectiveness of oral insulin delivery was evaluated for the three different particles in diabetic rats. Among the three candidates, BaSO4 and BaCO3 particles were found to dramatically reduce the existing hyperglycemia, apparently working as the native insulin Aspart subcutaneous formulation in terms of onset and duration of the action.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) FT-IR was used to confirm the formation of Ba salt particles (BaSO4/BaSO3/BaCO3) by revealing the functional groups. Figure 3 displays the FT-IR spectrum obtained for three different Ba salt particles. IR spectrum for BaSO4 (Figure 3a) shows peaks at 1188 cm−1, 1060 cm−1, and 982 cm−1 which are attributed to symmetric stretching of SO42−, peaks at 1635 cm−1 due to stretching vibration of SO42− and peaks at 604 cm−1 and 637 cm−1, representing out-of-plane bending for SO42−. Peaks at 2360 cm−1 seem to be the overtone of S-O vibration [24,25]. The existence of the functional group suggests the generation of BaSO4 particles. Figure 3b shows the characteristic peaks for SO32− found at 490 cm−1, 630 cm−1, 912 cm−1, and 1133 cm−1 position, suggesting the formation of BaSO3 particles [26,27]. The characteristic peaks for CO32− found at 855 cm−1 and 692 cm−1 (Figure 3c) were owing to in-plane and out-of-plane bending, whereas the peak at 1414 cm−1 corresponds with asymmetric stretching of C–O bond and peak at 1059 cm−1 is attributed to the symmetric C–O stretching vibration [28], thus indicating the formation of BaCO3 particles.

Particle Stability Assessment 3.2. Particle Stability Assessment 3.2. Particle Stability Assessment One of the biggest challenges in oral delivery is pre-systemic degradation due to harsh pH in the stomach having a fluctuating pH which can be extremely acidic (~pH 1) in fasting state. Therefore, any oral delivery agent needs to be resistant to extreme acidic pH to survive during GIT transport. To test how stable Ba salt particles are in different pHs, a set of in vitro experiments were designed and carried out by exposing the formulations to a wide range of pHs for a period of 3 h.Figure 5 shows changes in the turbidity pattern at 320 nm for Ba salt particles. Both BaSO4 and BaSO3 particles demonstrated much higher absorbance than BaCO3 particles when measured immediately after their generation at pH 7.78, reflecting the tendency of BaSO4 and BaSO3 to generate a significantly higher number of particles than BaCO3. Consistently high turbidity values for BaSO4 particles indicate their excellent resistance to degradation over a wide range of pHs at different time points (1–3 h), while the turbidity of BaSO3 particles sharply dropped at pH 1.69 suggesting the considerable amount of particle loss. BaCO3 maintained almost the same level of turbidity throughout the range of pHs, with apparently no significant particle loss at low pH.

Analysis of Mucin Adhesion to Ba Salt Particles Using FT-IR FT-IR was used to confirm the mucin binding of Ba salt particles (BaSO4/BaSO3/BaCO3) by revealing the functional groups for particle along with mucin protein. Samples for particles only, mucin only, and particles adhered to mucin were analyzed with FT-IR. The comparison of the peak patterns showed positive mucin binding for all three Ba salt particles. Free mucin displayed characteristic peaks of N-H at 3279 cm−1, Amide I at 1634 cm−1, Amide II at 1549 cm−1, C-H at 1434 cm−1, and 1374 cm−1, Amide III 1232 cm−1, C–O–C at 1115 cm−1 and C–C–O at 1029 cm−1 [29].

Again, because of inconsistency in glucose reduction pattern in different animals, % of reduction in case of BaSO3 loaded insulin treatment was not significant at any point in time.

Discussion Oral insulin is the most attractive choice to eliminate the necessity of subcutaneous insulin therapy [30]. As mentioned earlier, the most promising concept for oral insulin delivery is based on attaching the insulin molecule to a “cargo” that carries it through the GI tract. For that, the “cargo” or “carrier” itself has to pass all the criteria for an oral delivery candidate. Several papers reported polymeric nanoparticle as carriers for insulin [3,4,5,6]. The concept of complexing insulin molecules with inorganic salt particles based on ionic interactions is a relatively new one, having enormous potential [22]. Ba salt particles (BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3) have both positive and negative charged domains conferred, respectively, by cations (Ba2+) and anions (SO42−, SO32−, and CO32−). Due to heterogeneous charge distribution, these particles are capable of binding peptide molecules like insulin through electrostatic interactions. The target protein molecule here is insulin (5.8 kDa) which also has localized surface charges either positive or negative at basic or acidic pH. These surface charges of insulin likely allowed it to electrostatically bind with either cationic or anionic charges of Ba salt particles, depending on the pH of the solution. However, the challenge was whether Ba salt particles could resist a harsh GIT environment and allow insulin molecules to pass through the intestinal wall [31,32]. This is the first study to explore the potential of Ba salt particles as oral delivery carriers for insulin.

This is the first study to explore the potential of Ba salt particles as oral delivery carriers for insulin. A series of in vitro tests were carried out in GIT-mimicking conditions, before investigating the effect of orally administered insulin-loaded particles on hyperglycemia in diabetic Wister–Kyoto rats (WKY). GIT itself is a large and complex organ system where each different chamber has its own pH and enzymatic environment. Orally administrated protein therapeutics often show poor bioavailability due to the physical as well as physiological barriers imposed by the GIT. One of the biggest challenges is protein degradation by the extreme acidic pH of the stomach. The second prominent barrier is the enzymatic degradation in both the stomach and intestine. Even after successfully bypassing the stomach pH and enzymatic action, the protein-loaded particles or the released proteins are supposed to encounter mucin of the GI lining [33], prior to crossing the epithelium either via transcellular or paracellular route to reach the blood circulation.

Particle Stability Assessment 4.2. Particle Stability Assessment 4.2. Particle Stability Assessment Particle stability study was important to understand how efficiently Ba salt particles could resist harsh pHs, and thus, predict which of the Ba salt particles among BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3 would show the highest potential as an oral carrier. Successful oral delivery can only take place if the formulations are resistant enough in fluctuating stomach pH. Another important factor in oral delivery is stomach and intestinal residence time. Depending on the particle properties, the residence time inside the gut could vary from 20 min to 3 h [34]. An ideal oral delivery carrier must be resistant to both basic and acidic pHs within that time-frame. The stomach has fluctuating pH which can vary from pH 1.7 to 4.7 [35], whereas intestinal pH is around 6–8 [35].

In vitro tests were done to see whether the particles are capable of sustaining in a wide range of pHs over a certain period. As mentioned at the beginning, these particles are new and at the time of the study, properties were mostly unknown. It was important to check their response towards pH and enzymatic activity separately as well as combined. DMEM media composition is suitable for sustaining any biological molecules, like, proteins. At the same time, DMEM can accommodate pH change to a wide range. The particles (free and insulin bound) were exposed to DMEM prepared with a wide range of pH to study their self-resistance as well as resistance to hold a protein molecule against drastic pH change (described in Section 4.3). Turbidity which is measured as absorbance at 320nm increases as particle formation is accelerated and decreases as particle formation is inhibited or particle dissolution takes place. Particles were prepared at pH 7.8 and then exposed to lower pHs. The in vitro tests showed that BaSO4 particles had the highest synthesis rate at pH of 7.8, as well as the best resistance at all pHs throughout the period of 3 h, followed by BaCO3 and BaSO3 particles. All three formulations seemed to be suitable as oral delivery carriers based on their pH resistance.

Insulin Loading Efficiency of Ba Salt Particles and Subsequent Release of Insulin from Particles at Lower pHs 4.3. Insulin Loading Efficiency of Ba Salt Particles and Subsequent Release of Insulin from Particles at Lower pHs The fluorometric assay was performed with a fixed amount of FITC-insulin added prior to the formation of insulin-loaded particles. The portion of the added FITC-insulin absorbed by the particles were later separated in a pellet form by centrifugation. All 3 Ba salt particles showed very good insulin loading efficiency (80–100%). And insulin-loaded particles were found to be stable while gradually reducing pH to 5.0, with almost no release of insulin from the complex. At pH < 5 different degrees of insulin release were observed. Insulin release from BaSO4 particles was 30% even in very harsh acidic pH, implying that this particular nano-insulin formulation would be stable inside the stomach regardless of fed or fasting state. However, BaSO3 and BaCO3 particles with loaded insulin showed almost 80–100% release in acidic pH of nearly 1.0.

Assessment of Mucin Adhesion to Ba Salt Particles 4.5. Assessment of Mucin Adhesion to Ba Salt Particles 4.5. Assessment of Mucin Adhesion to Ba Salt Particles Mucin of GI lining is considered as the primary barrier for any molecule to cross the intestinal lining and reach the systemic circulation. Indeed, secreted mucin along with the contents of the gut creates an intestinal fluid environment [36]. Therefore, orally delivered insulin-loaded Ba salt particles will be in contact with mucin while crossing the intestinal lining. In vitro tests were done to predict whether the particles would be capable of crossing the intestinal lining. Particle adhesion to mucin was analyzed with FT-IR and Bradford protein assay kit, with FT-IR bands showing characteristic peaks for both Ba salts particle and mucin, and the protein assay reconfirming mucin adhesion to the particles quantitatively. All three Ba salt particles were found to have high mucin adhesion (60–100%).

Effect of Orally Administrated Nano-Insulin on Hyperglycemia 4.6. Effect of Orally Administrated Nano-Insulin on Hyperglycemia For oral delivery, particle formulations were prepared in 20× concentrated form to efficiently load high insulin (100 IU/kg) dose. All three formulations of Ba salt particles with loaded insulin showed a significant reduction in blood glucose levels. The effect generated during oral administration of insulin-loaded particles was surprisingly similar to the effect noticed for subcutaneous delivery of commercial human insulin aspart, only lasting 4–5 h with a maximum drop in blood glucose level during 2–3 h. The onset of the action on hyperglycemia started at 1 h for the oral nano-insulin formulation, which could be due to the required transport time for insulin-loaded particles to reach the blood stream. The percentage of reduction of blood glucose level in comparison to the baseline level showed the maximum reduction below 50% at any time point for all 3 Ba salt particles. The newly designed Ba salt/Insulin showed a visible significant effect on hyperglycemia at doses of 100 IU/Kg and % reduction in blood glucose is less than 50%.

In vitro insulin loading and mucin adhesion profile were promising from all three Ba salt particles, however, in vitro stability and protection from pH and enzymatic activity data showed stronger protection from BaSO4 and BaCO3 particles towards protein molecule compared to BaSO3 particle. In vivo activity in diabetic rats also reflected that. Although the BaSO3 particle also successfully reduced blood glucose levels, there were fluctuations and inconsistencies in the reduction pattern between the animals which ultimately affected the significance of the finding. Notably, this inconsistency was also observed for the other two particles in a lower dose of insulin (50 IU/kg, data not shown here). The authors believe BaSO3 loaded insulin might show a significant and consistent reduction of blood glucose at much higher doses. In summary, BaSO3 loaded insulin is less efficient compared to BaSO4 and BaCO3 particle loaded oral insulin. However, there is plenty of room for improvement for these formulations.

A common problem with potential oral insulin formulations from the literature is the low bioavailability and requirement for very high doses [6,7,37]. This is because of degradation in the GI tract and low percentage of intestinal crossing mainly. The onset, duration of action, and maximum reduction of blood glucose level vary a lot from formulation to formulation due to properties and diversified mechanism of action of the particle or system used as DDS for insulin molecule. Wu et.al. reported, insulin loaded PLGA/RS nanoparticles (50 IU/kg) showed a slow decrease after a lag phase of 4 h with no visible effect. The maximum blood glucose reduction was in 10 h (32%) and the effect lasted for 24 h [6]. Pan et al. (2002) reported the effectiveness of positively charged CS-NP that was bound to insulin at doses 21 IU/kg and hypoglycemia prolonged for 15 h. There was no reporting of % decrease of blood glucose level [7]. Another nanoparticle (NP) loaded insulin system composed of chitosan (CS) and poly(g-glutamic acid) reported an extended period of activity of insulin aspart when loaded in NP. NP loaded insulin aspart was given orally in a similar manner to Ba salt insulin administration reported in this paper. However, the effect was observed as peak-less prolonged reduction of blood glucose. The formulation loaded with insulin aspart, which is originally a short-acting human insulin analog. Interestingly in NP loaded form oral administration of it showed an effect similar to subcutaneous intermediate-acting formulations available in the market. The effect was an observer at doses of 30 IU/kg and reduction of blood glucose level was never more than 30–40% [37].

There could be several factors involved that can influence any nanoparticle-mediated insulin formulation. In general nanoparticle binding towards protein is effected/influenced by surface charge, crystallinity, size of nanoparticle as well as insulin molecule. On the other hand, oral delivery of nanoparticle loaded insulin depends on size, lipophilicity, surface charge, and resistance of the carrier molecule. The reported Ba salt insulin formulations are at an early stage. As new formulations, they are in vivo profile of GI transport and activity in the blood are unknown. Although, quick onset with the same duration of action as native insulin aspart indicates a unique in vivo profile.

Conclusions As a novel group of oral macromolecular drug delivery system, Ba salt particles, in particular, BaSO4 and BaCO3 look very promising. In vitro tests on binding, resistance and characterization have shown that the particles can bind protein therapeutics like insulin efficiently. In vivo study on rats has proven their effectiveness in managing hyperglycemia when given orally. Novel nano-insulin, i.e., Ba salt particle-loaded insulin aspart (oral) has a similar effect on blood glucose level as the original insulin aspart subcutaneous formulation in higher doses. Therefore, the developed oral formulations could be an attractive alternative to subcutaneous ones in the future.

Figure 13Oral delivery of free insulin and particle loaded insulin effect on hyperglycemia. The group of STZ-induced diabetic rats without any treatment was taken as a negative control, whereas the group of STZ-induced diabetic rats treated with free insulin was considered as a positive control. 3 different treatment groups of diabetic rats were orally given Insulin aspart-loaded particles of BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3. Each control and treatment groups have 3 animals per group. The baseline blood glucose level was read before the treatment. All 3 insulin-loaded Ba salt formulations showed a reduction in blood glucose level within 1 h of the oral administration. Mean value of (±standard deviation) was plotted for BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3 loaded with Insulin aspart (100 IU/kg) (p < 0.05). For BaSO4 particles with loaded insulin, blood glucose level was significantly low compared to the baseline level in 1–3 h (p < 0.05). At 4th h, the level was still low compared to the baseline level but not significant, with an ascending trend. BaCO3 particles with loaded insulin showed a significant decrease of blood glucose level at 1–2 h, although blood glucose level started to show a slight rise at 3rd h, and by the 4th h, it was back to the baseline level. However, insulin-loaded BaSO3 particles showed a reduction in blood glucose level but the reduction was not significant at 4 h.
