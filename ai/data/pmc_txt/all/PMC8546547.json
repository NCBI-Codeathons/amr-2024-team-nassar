At subinhibitory concentrations, they act as cues or signals inducing antibiotic production; however, our knowledge of well-documented antibiotic-based sensing systems is limited. Here, for the soil actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis, we describe a fundamentally new ribosome-mediated signaling cascade that accelerates the onset of lincomycin production in response to an external ribosome-targeting antibiotic to synchronize antibiotic production within the population. The entire cascade is encoded in the lincomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and consists of three lincomycin resistance proteins in addition to the transcriptional regulator LmbU: a lincomycin transporter (LmrA), a 23S rRNA methyltransferase (LmrB), both of which confer high resistance, and an ATP-binding cassette family F (ABCF) ATPase, LmrC, which confers only moderate resistance but is essential for antibiotic-induced signal transduction. Specifically, antibiotic sensing occurs via ribosome-mediated attenuation, which activates LmrC production in response to lincosamide, streptogramin A, or pleuromutilin antibiotics. Then, ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated LmrC triggers the transcription of lmbU and consequently the expression of lincomycin BGC. Finally, the production of LmrC is downregulated by LmrA and LmrB, which reduces the amount of ribosome-bound antibiotic and thus fine-tunes the cascade. We propose that analogous ABCF-mediated signaling systems are relatively common because many ribosome-targeting antibiotic BGCs encode an ABCF protein accompanied by additional resistance protein(s) and transcriptional regulators. Moreover, we revealed that three of the eight coproduced ABCF proteins of S. lincolnensis are clindamycin responsive, suggesting that the ABCF-mediated antibiotic signaling may be a widely utilized tool for chemical communication.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "The genus Streptomyces and several other related genera of Actinobacteria (here referred to as streptomycetes) are filamentous soil and marine bacteria characterized by a remarkably rich specialized metabolism. Specifically, the genomes of streptomycetes contain the highest proportion of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) per Mb among all bacteria (1). BGCs encode the biosynthesis of a wide arsenal of bioactive specialized metabolites, which have applications in various areas, particularly in medicine. For instance, streptomycetes produce two-thirds of the clinically used antibiotics of natural origin. However, the relevant biological roles of specialized metabolites in nature are still under debate. The current concept is that antibiotics are produced as a response to cues from competitors to defend the habitats of the organism, producing them in natural competitive environments (2\u20135). These cues also involve ribosome-targeting antibiotics, which at subinhibitory concentrations act as elicitors of secondary metabolism (6\u20138). However, antibiotic-sensing systems common to a group of functionally related but structurally distinct ribosome-targeting antibiotics have not been reported. Streptomycete-derived macrolide, ketolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin antibiotics target the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the 50S ribosomal subunit or structures in proximity to it (adjacent A- and P-sites or ribosomal exit tunnel). As a result, all these natural products interfere with proteosynthesis and inhibit bacterial cell growth (for a review, see reference 9). Therefore, apart from truly biosynthetic genes, BGCs of 50S ribosomal subunit-targeting antibiotics also encode regulation elements for timely and coordinated production and resistance mechanisms for self-protection. The regulation typically employs global and/or pleiotropic regulators which direct BGC expression via activation of a pathway-specific regulator (for a review, see reference 10). For resistance, one protein can be sufficient to protect the producing strain (11, 12). However, several mechanisms for self-resistance are often encoded in the BGCs, particularly in those for the biosynthesis of 50S ribosomal subunit-targeting antibiotics (13\u201317). Specifically, these BGCs often encode antibiotic resistance proteins of the ABCF family and a protein(s) with another resistance mechanism. ABCF proteins are cytosolic ATPases of the ABC superfamily that confer resistance by ribosome protection (18) and not by efflux, which was the hypothesis for a long time. All characterized ABCFs to date act on the ribosome, and their common feature is the ATP-dependent modulation of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) (reviewed in reference 19). However, the biological function of these proteins is not uniform. Notably, the bacterial ABCFs include not only the antibiotic resistance proteins but also a protein, EttA, involved in translational regulation (20, 21). However, the function of the majority of bacterial ABCFs, which are widely distributed in almost all bacteria, with the highest number per genome (8\u201311) encoded in actinomycetes remains unknown (22).", "The genus Streptomyces and several other related genera of Actinobacteria (here referred to as streptomycetes) are filamentous soil and marine bacteria characterized by a remarkably rich specialized metabolism.

To uncover the role of LmrC, we performed comparative mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of the mycelia of S. lincolnensis WT, WT+Cc, and \u0394C strains grown in the absence or presence of clindamycin. As shown in Fig.\u00a03a, clindamycin supplementation increased the abundance of lincomycin BGC proteins in both the WT (namely, proteins of the lmbUXYB operon) and WT+Cc (the whole BGC), while in the \u0394C strain, lincomycin BGC proteins were more abundant in cultures without clindamycin. The induction by clindamycin was also observable at the lincomycin production level at 40 h in the WT+Cc strain but not in the \u0394C knockout strain, where higher production levels were independent of clindamycin treatment (Fig.\u00a03a). No lincomycin was detected in clindamycin supplemented WT cultures, which contradicts the experiment in Fig.\u00a02a, where high levels of lincomycin were detected at the end of seed culture supplemented with clindamycin. Slight differences in cultivation conditions might be responsible for the shifted onset of lincomycin production between the two experiments (see Fig.\u00a0S7b). Nevertheless, these results suggest that LmrC is required for the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis triggered by clindamycin. To confirm that LmrC is essential for the transduction of antibiotic signal to the expression of lincomycin BGC, we quantified the transcripts of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN genes in S. lincolnensis WT and \u0394C cultured with or without clindamycin at a time point before lincomycin BGC expression. As shown in Fig.\u00a03b, the clindamycin induced transcription of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN, which was not under the direct control of lmbU, in the WT strain but not in the lmrC-deficient \u0394C knockout strain. Notably, the observed low-level constitutive transcription of lmbU in the \u0394C strain can be explained by the insertion of apramycin cassette (see Fig.\u00a0S3b), causing a polar effect. This phenomenon explains the increased production of proteins in \u0394C (Fig.\u00a03a). However, it is important for our reasoning that neither protein production nor lmbU transcription in the \u0394C strain is affected by clindamycin. ABCF family proteins generally exhibit ATPase activity, which is required for protein function (22). Therefore, we wondered whether LmrC is a functional protein capable of ATPase activity that induces gene expression. Hence, we complemented the \u0394C knockout strain with lmrC or lmrCEQ12 expressed from a theophylline-inducible plasmid (Ci). The overproduction of functional LmrC resulted in the expression of lmbU and lmbN, while the overproduction of ATPase-deficient LmrCEQ12 mutant did not have this effect (Fig.\u00a03c). Notably, the expression of lmbU and lmbN mediated by the overproduction of LmrC was achieved without supplementation with clindamycin, and a similar phenomenon was observed at the protein level when LmrC was produced constitutively in the WT (the comparison of WT and WT+CC without clindamycin treatment is shown in Fig.\u00a03a). Altogether, these results demonstrate that clindamycin induces the production of LmrC, which in turn induces the production of LmbU, which is a known activator of lincomycin biosynthesis (24).", "Given the newly defined function of ABCF proteins as modulators of ribosomal PTC, the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics might be regulated by LmrC.

This phenomenon explains the increased production of proteins in \u0394C (Fig.\u00a03a). However, it is important for our reasoning that neither protein production nor lmbU transcription in the \u0394C strain is affected by clindamycin. ABCF family proteins generally exhibit ATPase activity, which is required for protein function (22). Therefore, we wondered whether LmrC is a functional protein capable of ATPase activity that induces gene expression. Hence, we complemented the \u0394C knockout strain with lmrC or lmrCEQ12 expressed from a theophylline-inducible plasmid (Ci). The overproduction of functional LmrC resulted in the expression of lmbU and lmbN, while the overproduction of ATPase-deficient LmrCEQ12 mutant did not have this effect (Fig.\u00a03c). Notably, the expression of lmbU and lmbN mediated by the overproduction of LmrC was achieved without supplementation with clindamycin, and a similar phenomenon was observed at the protein level when LmrC was produced constitutively in the WT (the comparison of WT and WT+CC without clindamycin treatment is shown in Fig.\u00a03a). Altogether, these results demonstrate that clindamycin induces the production of LmrC, which in turn induces the production of LmbU, which is a known activator of lincomycin biosynthesis (24).", "Given the newly defined function of ABCF proteins as modulators of ribosomal PTC, the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics might be regulated by LmrC. To uncover the role of LmrC, we performed comparative mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of the mycelia of S. lincolnensis WT, WT+Cc, and \u0394C strains grown in the absence or presence of clindamycin. As shown in Fig.\u00a03a, clindamycin supplementation increased the abundance of lincomycin BGC proteins in both the WT (namely, proteins of the lmbUXYB operon) and WT+Cc (the whole BGC), while in the \u0394C strain, lincomycin BGC proteins were more abundant in cultures without clindamycin. The induction by clindamycin was also observable at the lincomycin production level at 40 h in the WT+Cc strain but not in the \u0394C knockout strain, where higher production levels were independent of clindamycin treatment (Fig.\u00a03a). No lincomycin was detected in clindamycin supplemented WT cultures, which contradicts the experiment in Fig.\u00a02a, where high levels of lincomycin were detected at the end of seed culture supplemented with clindamycin. Slight differences in cultivation conditions might be responsible for the shifted onset of lincomycin production between the two experiments (see Fig.\u00a0S7b). Nevertheless, these results suggest that LmrC is required for the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis triggered by clindamycin. To confirm that LmrC is essential for the transduction of antibiotic signal to the expression of lincomycin BGC, we quantified the transcripts of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN genes in S. lincolnensis WT and \u0394C cultured with or without clindamycin at a time point before lincomycin BGC expression. As shown in Fig.\u00a03b, the clindamycin induced transcription of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN, which was not under the direct control of lmbU, in the WT strain but not in the lmrC-deficient \u0394C knockout strain. Notably, the observed low-level constitutive transcription of lmbU in the \u0394C strain can be explained by the insertion of apramycin cassette (see Fig.\u00a0S3b), causing a polar effect.

Truncated versions of the construct without the 5\u2032-half lmrC (U-mCh) and lmbU-mCherry expressed from the constitutive ermEp promoter (UC-mCh) were used as controls (Fig.\u00a03d). As expected, the induced production of the mCherry reporter in response to clindamycin was detected only in the strain with the full-length C-U-mCh construct, while in the strain with the truncated lmrC gene (U-mCh), the level of mCherry expression did not change after clindamycin induction. From these data, we concluded that lmbU expression, and thus the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics, is mainly triggered by lmrC.

As expected, the induced production of the mCherry reporter in response to clindamycin was detected only in the strain with the full-length C-U-mCh construct, while in the strain with the truncated lmrC gene (U-mCh), the level of mCherry expression did not change after clindamycin induction. From these data, we concluded that lmbU expression, and thus the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics, is mainly triggered by lmrC. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that S. coelicolor homologs of global regulators that contribute to lincomycin biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis, such as AdpA and BldD (32, 33), also affect the expression of lmrC and lmbU in S. coelicolor.", "Several recent studies described regulators of lincomycin biosynthesis encoded outside the BGC in the S. lincolnensis genome (28\u201331).

To gain more insight into the regulation of LmrC production, we first tested whether the inducing antibiotics were limited only to clindamycin. For this purpose, we treated S. lincolnensis WT cells with a range of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and a cell wall-targeting carbenicillin, and we detected LmrC protein levels using an LmrC-specific antibody. In addition to clindamycin, only lincomycin (lincosamide group), pristinamycin IIA (streptogramin A group), and tiamulin (pleuromutilin group), with lower efficiency, induced LmrC production (Fig.\u00a04a). Interestingly, the activity of these lincosamide-streptogramin A-pleuromutilin (LSAP) antibiotics with overlapping binding sites on the ribosome (Fig.\u00a04a) is compromised by antibiotic resistance ABCF proteins as exemplified by Vga(A)LC in staphylococci (18, 34, 35).

LmrC could thus be regulated by a ribosome-mediated attenuation mechanism as described previously for other antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins (38\u201340): in the absence of antibiotics, either the formation of a premature terminator in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) or the inaccessibility of ribosome binding site (RBS) prevent gene expression. In the presence of antibiotics, inhibited ribosomes stall during translation of the upstream regulatory open reading frame (uORF), which promotes the alteration of the 5\u2032UTR secondary structure and thereby releases gene expression (41). Indeed, an in silico analysis of the lmrC upstream region revealed two putative promoters and two premature terminators with the ability to form alternative antiterminator conformations and several short uORFs (Fig.\u00a05a). To examine whether the attenuation mechanism is involved in the control of lmrC expression, we first used RT-PCR to map from which of the two predicted promoters lmrC is transcribed and the position of the premature terminator (Fig.\u00a05a). The analysis of RNA from the 16-h time point, where lmrC is induced by clindamycin, and from the 104-h time point, where lmrC transcription starts naturally without clindamycin supplementation (Fig.\u00a02a), showed that in both cases, the lmrC transcript starts from promoter P1 (Fig.\u00a05b). As shown in Fig.\u00a05c, the position of the premature terminator was mapped to the region between primers RT 4 and 5, which corresponds to the position of the predicted terminator 1 (Fig.\u00a05a). Next, we prepared a reporter system in which the lmrC upstream region, including its promoter, and full-length lmrC were translationally fused to mCherry (C-mCh). We introduced the construct into S. lincolnensis WT and S. coelicolor M145 strains and determined mCherry levels with or without clindamycin (see Fig.\u00a0S5d). The mCherry-specific signal was detected only in the presence of clindamycin in both strains, so further experiments were performed in S. coelicolor M145. A series of G-to-C and C-to-G point mutations (see Fig.\u00a0S6a) in the terminator hairpin led to the disruption and restoration of clindamycin-induced C-mCh production, confirming the terminator prediction (Fig.\u00a05d). To localize the uORF, we mutated the start codons of four upstream ORFs (ATG to ATC or ATG to AAG; Fig.\u00a0S6a). Surprisingly, only the disruption of uORF2, which partially overlaps with the terminator, led to strong constitutive expression of C-mCh, whereas mutations in other ORFs did not affect C-mCh production (Fig.\u00a05d). This observation suggests an unusual attenuation mechanism in which uORF2 translation is required to form a terminator structure. In summary, the antibiotic-mediated control of lmrC expression occurs via the formation of a premature terminator structure, which prevents lmrC expression in the absence of an antibiotic. LSAP antibiotics, if bound to PTC, trigger the shift from the terminator to the antiterminator conformation, enabling lmrC transcription (see Fig.\u00a0S6a). The lmrC transcript, specifically its attenuator, is thus the primary sensor of the antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade for lincomycin biosynthesis.", "Substantially reduced production of LmrC in the lmrB-overexpression strain (Fig.\u00a04b) after antibiotic induction showed that the binding of the antibiotic to the ribosome is a prerequisite for the induction of LmrC production. LmrC could thus be regulated by a ribosome-mediated attenuation mechanism as described previously for other antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins (38\u201340): in the absence of antibiotics, either the formation of a premature terminator in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) or the inaccessibility of ribosome binding site (RBS) prevent gene expression. In the presence of antibiotics, inhibited ribosomes stall during translation of the upstream regulatory open reading frame (uORF), which promotes the alteration of the 5\u2032UTR secondary structure and thereby releases gene expression (41). Indeed, an in silico analysis of the lmrC upstream region revealed two putative promoters and two premature terminators with the ability to form alternative antiterminator conformations and several short uORFs (Fig.\u00a05a). To examine whether the attenuation mechanism is involved in the control of lmrC expression, we first used RT-PCR to map from which of the two predicted promoters lmrC is transcribed and the position of the premature terminator (Fig.\u00a05a). The analysis of RNA from the 16-h time point, where lmrC is induced by clindamycin, and from the 104-h time point, where lmrC transcription starts naturally without clindamycin supplementation (Fig.\u00a02a), showed that in both cases, the lmrC transcript starts from promoter P1 (Fig.\u00a05b). As shown in Fig.\u00a05c, the position of the premature terminator was mapped to the region between primers RT 4 and 5, which corresponds to the position of the predicted terminator 1 (Fig.\u00a05a). Next, we prepared a reporter system in which the lmrC upstream region, including its promoter, and full-length lmrC were translationally fused to mCherry (C-mCh). We introduced the construct into S. lincolnensis WT and S. coelicolor M145 strains and determined mCherry levels with or without clindamycin (see Fig.\u00a0S5d). The mCherry-specific signal was detected only in the presence of clindamycin in both strains, so further experiments were performed in S. coelicolor M145.

The mechanism lies in the induction of lmrC transcription by ribosome-mediated attenuation, which means that lmrC, specifically its attenuator-forming upstream 5\u2032UTR transcript, is a sensor of LSAP antibiotics. Ribosome-mediated attenuation is a common mechanism of regulation of antibiotic resistance ABCF genes in Firmicutes (38\u201340, 45). However, we describe here for the first time its function as a sensor of the signaling cascade. The major novelty of this cascade lies in the dual antibiotic resistance and regulatory function of the ABCF protein LmrC, which transduces the antibiotic signal to the expression of LmbU and promotes lincomycin biosynthesis. In addition, we show that another two lincomycin BGC-encoded resistance proteins, LmrB and LmrA, affect the cascade by dampening the LSAP antibiotic-induced expression of lmrC. We assume that LmrB, due to its position in the lmbUXY-lmrB operon with two biosynthetic genes, mediates a direct negative feedback loop of the cascade. The LmrA transporter links lincomycin biosynthesis to the primary metabolic pathways since it is regulated by the GlnR global regulator (37). LmrA seems to be the most important component for lincomycin production because lincomycin biosynthesis is remarkably suppressed when LmrA is not present. Furthermore, LmrA, as a lincomycin-specific transporter, desensitizes the cascade specifically to lincomycin, which may prevent the products from reactivation the biosynthesis when it is no longer desirable. In addition, the active export of lincomycin contributes to the propagation of antibiotics within the population.", "In this study, we characterized an LSAP antibiotic-driven signaling cascade for the activation of the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis, in which an antibiotic resistance protein, LmrC, from the ARE5 subfamily of ABCF proteins is the key signal-transducing element (Fig.\u00a06a). The mechanism lies in the induction of lmrC transcription by ribosome-mediated attenuation, which means that lmrC, specifically its attenuator-forming upstream 5\u2032UTR transcript, is a sensor of LSAP antibiotics. Ribosome-mediated attenuation is a common mechanism of regulation of antibiotic resistance ABCF genes in Firmicutes (38\u201340, 45). However, we describe here for the first time its function as a sensor of the signaling cascade. The major novelty of this cascade lies in the dual antibiotic resistance and regulatory function of the ABCF protein LmrC, which transduces the antibiotic signal to the expression of LmbU and promotes lincomycin biosynthesis. In addition, we show that another two lincomycin BGC-encoded resistance proteins, LmrB and LmrA, affect the cascade by dampening the LSAP antibiotic-induced expression of lmrC. We assume that LmrB, due to its position in the lmbUXY-lmrB operon with two biosynthetic genes, mediates a direct negative feedback loop of the cascade. The LmrA transporter links lincomycin biosynthesis to the primary metabolic pathways since it is regulated by the GlnR global regulator (37). LmrA seems to be the most important component for lincomycin production because lincomycin biosynthesis is remarkably suppressed when LmrA is not present. Furthermore, LmrA, as a lincomycin-specific transporter, desensitizes the cascade specifically to lincomycin, which may prevent the products from reactivation the biosynthesis when it is no longer desirable. In addition, the active export of lincomycin contributes to the propagation of antibiotics within the population.", "FIG\u00a06ABCF proteins encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters are putative regulators of antibiotic production in response to antibiotics that share a ribosomal binding site.

This signaling cascade may, in response to the extracellular lincomycin secreted by neighboring cells, induce a premature onset of lincomycin production to ensure its synchronous biosynthesis in a wider population, thereby achieving an ecologically efficient lincomycin concentration similar to that proposed for the biosynthesis of the cell wall inhibiting lantibiotic planosporicin (49) or actinorhodin (50).

The detection of antibiotics by a ribosome via a 5\u2032UTR attenuator upstream of the ABCF-encoding gene differs fundamentally from known antibiotic signaling cascades, in which antibiotic or biosynthetic intermediates are detected regardless of their mode of action, typically by direct binding to a transcription factor or its cognate receptor (53). In addition, several examples of resistance systems consisting of antibiotic efflux and cognate, TetR-like transcriptional repressors, such as in the biosynthesis of simocyclinone (54), actinorhodin (50), or landomycin A (55), have been described to promote antibiotic production by sensing a final product or intermediate. The regulatory effect in these examples is facilitated by the export of antibiotics, which is required for high production (50, 54), or is mediated by a cognate antibiotic-recognizing repressor that, in addition to the regulation of transporter, also regulates biosynthetic genes (55). In contrast, LmrC appears to directly transduce the antibiotic signal to lmbU transcription while conferring low antibiotic resistance. However, the exact mechanism of LmrC-driven signal transduction remains to be elucidated. Thus, LmrC has a dual function: resistance and regulation, but it is also possible that the low LmrC-mediated resistance is only an indirect consequence of the primary antibiotic signal transduction function and that its biological significance is minor. Notably, LmrC, as well as other ABCF proteins implicated in antibiotic resistance in streptomycetes, shares the antibiotic resistance domain ARD with structurally characterized antibiotic resistance ABCF proteins, VmlR, MsrE, VgaALC, VgaL, and LsaA from Firmicutes. The ARD interacts with PTC to dislodge the antibiotic from the ribosome (34, 35, 56, 57) (Fig.\u00a06c), and it is present in the majority of antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins but not in EttA and other putative regulatory ABCFs (22). In addition to ARD, LmrC also has the arm domain, which is absent in antibiotic-resistance ABCFs but is present in the EttA translation regulator (20). In EttA, the arm domain restricts ribosome dynamics in response to a lack of available ATP (21).
