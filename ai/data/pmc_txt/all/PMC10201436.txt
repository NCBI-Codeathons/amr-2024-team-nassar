Abstract Genome-encoded antibiotic resistance (ARE) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins of the F subfamily (ARE-ABCFs) mediate intrinsic resistance in diverse Gram-positive bacteria. The diversity of chromosomally-encoded ARE-ABCFs is far from being fully experimentally explored. Here we characterise phylogenetically diverse genome-encoded ABCFs from Actinomycetia (Ard1 from Streptomyces capreolus, producer of the nucleoside antibiotic A201A), Bacilli (VmlR2 from soil bacterium Neobacillus vireti) and Clostridia (CplR from Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridioides difficile). We demonstrate that Ard1 is a narrow spectrum ARE-ABCF that specifically mediates self-resistance against nucleoside antibiotics. The single-particle cryo-EM structure of a VmlR2-ribosome complex allows us to rationalise the resistance spectrum of this ARE-ABCF that is equipped with an unusually long antibiotic resistance determinant (ARD) subdomain. We show that CplR contributes to intrinsic pleuromutilin, lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance in Clostridioides, and demonstrate that C. difficile CplR (CDIF630_02847) synergises with the transposon-encoded 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase Erm to grant high levels of antibiotic resistance to the C. difficile 630 clinical isolate. Finally, assisted by uORF4u, our novel tool for detection of upstream open reading frames, we dissect the translational attenuation mechanism that controls the induction of cplR expression upon an antibiotic challenge. INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a constantly growing threat to human health. A 2022 report in The Lancet estimated that in 2019 1.27 million deaths were attributable to bacterial AMR globally (1). One of the primary antibiotic targets is the ribosome (2), and, accordingly, bacteria protect their protein synthesis machinery via diverse resistance mechanisms (3–5). The functional elements primarily targeted by the antibiotics on the large (50S) ribosomal subunit are the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) and the nascent polypeptide exit tunnel (NPET) (3,6). The PTC is targeted by numerous antibiotic classes, including (i) nucleoside compounds, such A201A (7) and hygromycin A (7,8), (ii) pleuromutilins, such as tiamulin (9), (iii) lincosamides, such as the natural compound lincomycin (10), its semi-synthetic derivative clindamycin (11) and the fully synthetic antibiotic iboxamycin (12), (iv) type A streptogramins, such as virginiamycin M1 (13), (v) phenicols, such as chloramphenicol (14) and (vi) oxazolidinones, such as linezolid (15,16). Antibiotics targeting the NPET are represented by macrolides, such as the context-dependent polypeptide elongation inhibitor erythromycin (17,18), and by members of the streptogramin B class such as quinupristin (19).

Antibiotics targeting the NPET are represented by macrolides, such as the context-dependent polypeptide elongation inhibitor erythromycin (17,18), and by members of the streptogramin B class such as quinupristin (19). The F subfamily of ABC ATPases includes both ribosome-associated antibiotic resistance (ARE) ABCFs (5,20), as well as multiple housekeeping factors that assist protein synthesis and ribosome assembly (21–24). ARE-ABCF factors mediate antibiotic resistance in human pathogens (exemplified by staphylococcal VgaA (25) and closely related Listeria monocytogenes VgaL/Lmo0919 (26,27)), in environmental bacteria (exemplified by B. subtilis VmlR (28)), and also confer self-resistance in antibiotic producers (exemplified by Streptomyces lincolnensis LmrC (29)). Expression of ARE-ABCFs is suppressed through abortive transcription termination, with full-length mRNA production and ARE-ABCF expression being induced upon antibiotic-induced ribosomal stalling on a regulatory upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is located in the mRNA region preceding the ARE-ABCF main ORF (27–32).

ARE-ABCFs are classified into eight relatively well-studied major subfamilies (ARE1 to ARE8) as well numerous poorly characterised phylum-specific groups, such as actinobacterial AAF1-6 (24,33). Members of ARE1-3, ARE5 and ARE6 subfamilies protect the ribosome from PTC-targeting pleuromutilin, lincosamide and streptogramin A (PLSA) antibiotics, with the most well-studied ARE-ABCF representatives being ARE1 VgaA and Lmo0919/VgaL, ARE2 VmlR, ARE3 LsaA, ARE5 LmrC and ARE6 Sal (27,28,34–36). ARE-ABCFs ARE8 PoxtA and ARE7 OptrA protect against phenicol and oxazolidinone (PhO) transpeptidation inhibitors (33,37,38). Finally, members of the ARE4 subfamily (such as TlrC) and a subset of ARE1 ABCFs (such as Msr) confer resistance to macrolide and streptogramin B (MSB) antibiotics (39–41).

ARE-ABCFs ARE8 PoxtA and ARE7 OptrA protect against phenicol and oxazolidinone (PhO) transpeptidation inhibitors (33,37,38). Finally, members of the ARE4 subfamily (such as TlrC) and a subset of ARE1 ABCFs (such as Msr) confer resistance to macrolide and streptogramin B (MSB) antibiotics (39–41). ABCF ATPases share a common molecular architecture with two ABC nucleotide-binding domains NBD1 and NBD2 connected by an interdomain linker element which is variable in both amino acid sequence and length (24). This linker is referred to as the antibiotic resistance determinant (ARD) in the case of ARE-ABCFs (34,41,42) and as the P-site tRNA-interaction motif (PtIM) in the case of housekeeping ABCFs (21,22). The ARD is crucial for displacement of the antibiotic by ARE-ABCFs, and its deletion renders the resistance determinant inactive (24). Macrolide-resisting factors such as ARE1 MsrE have the longest ARDs which extend into the ribosomal NPET (41). ARDs of PLSA-resisting ARE-ABCF are shorter, as they make contact with the PTC-bound antibiotic and/or induce conformational changes in the PTC that promote antibiotic dissociation (26,34,43). PhO-resisting PoxtA and OptrA have even shorter ARDs, which act by perturbing the positioning of the CCA-end of the P-site tRNA, rather than directly distorting the PTC (33). Finally, the P-site tRNA-contacting PtIM elements of the housekeeping ABCFs are in general shorter than the ARD elements of ARE-ABCFs (21–23).

Antibiotic resistance mediated by ARE-ABCF can synergise with other mechanisms, importantly with resistance mediated by 23S rRNA methylation. This rRNA modification is installed by clinically relevant and widely-spread Erm (Erythromycin resistance methylase) and Cfr (Chloramphenicol and florfenicol resistance) rRNA methyltransferases and confers resistance to macrolide, PhO and PLSA antibiotic classes (44–47). Recently we have found that B. subtilis ARE-ABCF VmlR can synergise with Cfr to grant significant resistance to lincosamides, including the highly potent fully-synthetic antibiotic iboxamycin (48). The cfr gene is often encoded next to lsa ABCF in bacterial pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) (49) and staphylococci (50), which is supportive of the two resistance determinants cooperating to grant high levels of protection. However, synergy of ARE-ABCFs with Cfr/Erm has not as yet been systematically tested experimentally. Importantly, Erm-mediated resistance is associated with an increased risk of C. difficile infection (CDI), and the risk further increases upon clindamycin use (51). Neither the role of ARE-ABCFs in C. difficile resistance, nor potential ARE-ABCF–Erm synergy, has been studied.

Neither the role of ARE-ABCFs in C. difficile resistance, nor potential ARE-ABCF–Erm synergy, has been studied. To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive bacteria, we have characterised four genome-encoded ARE-ABCF factors. First, we show that well-studied B. subtilis ARE2 VmlR mediates resistance to A201A and hygromycin A, which expands the spectrum of ABCF-mediated resistance to nucleoside antibiotics. Second, we characterise the resistance spectrum of a VmlR representative with an unusually long ARD encoded in the genome of soil bacterium Neobacillus vireti (formerly Bacillus vireti)—VmlR2. We rationalise the antibiotic sensitivity data by solving the cryo-EM structure of the VmlR2-70S complex and probe its mechanism through mutagenesis. Third, we demonstrate that actinobacterial AAF1 Ard1 encoded by the A201A producer Streptomyces capreolus (52,53) is a narrow spectrum ARE-ABCF that specifically mediates self-resistance against nucleoside antibiotics. Fourth, we establish Clostridial pleuromutilin and lincosamide resistance protein (CplR) as an ARE1 ABCF resistance factor. We characterise CplR of the important human pathogen C. difficile (originally annotated as a multidrug resistance (MDR)-type ABC transporter CDIF630_02847 (54)), of Clostridium perfringens, a common causative agent of food poisoning, as well as of the mutualistic bacterium Clostridium sporogenes. We demonstrate that CplR contributes to intrinsic resistance of Clostridioides to lincosamides lincomycin, clindamycin and iboxamycin as well as pleuromutilin retapamulin. While lincosamide resistance mediated by CplR can be overcome by the fully synthetic lincosamide iboxamycin (12), ARE1 CplR provides high levels of iboxamycin resistance when acting together with transposon-encoded ErmB present in clinically isolated C. difficile strain 630 (55). Given that clindamycin treatment is associated with increased risk of CDI (51,56–59), our discovery and characterisation of CplR-mediated lincosamide resistance mechanism in C. difficile is of direct clinical importance.

A DNA fragment containing group II intron and ltrA gene from pJIR750ai (Merck) as well as a Clostridium-E. coli shuttle vector pMTL83153 (CHAIN biotech, Nottingham, UK) containing a constitutive promoter Pfdx were PCR-amplified, and the intron-containing plasmid was produced by ligation of these DNA fragments pre-digested with HindIII and XhoI. Then, a PCR-amplified C. sporogenes cplR-targeted intron was introduced into HindIII-BsrGI site in the plasmid. The resulting pNO201 plasmid was used for cplR mutant construction. The pNO201 plasmid was introduced into C. sporogenes by conjugation as described above, with one modification: the heat treatment prior to conjugation was omitted. While this step is crucial for obtaining transconjugants with C. difficile, in the case of C. sporogenes transconjugants are easily obtained without heat shock. To screen the mutant in which the target gene was disrupted, the colonies were restreaked onto BHIS containing 20 μg/ml erythromycin. The insertion of the intron in the appropriate locus was verified by PCR amplification. C. sporogenes mutants were constructed using the Targetron system (Merck).

Cryo-EM data analysis Cryo-EM data analysis Cryo-EM data analysis MotionCor2 was used to correct for beam-induced motion in 6384 starting micrographs (81). Contrast transfer functions were estimated with Gctf (82). Subsequent processing was performed in RELION 3.1 unless specified otherwise (83,84). Micrographs with MaxRes >4 Å and/or a CtfFigureOfMerit <0.05 were discarded, resulting in 5014 micrographs used for further processing. From the resulting set of 5 014 micrographs, 279 082 particles were picked with Gautomatch [https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/download/gautomatch-056] and extracted with a pixel size of 2.46 Å. 2D classification was used to remove non-ribosomal particles, resulting in 193 343 particles which were subjected to 3D auto refinement. The initial reference, which was low-pass filtered to 60 Å, was a B. subtilis 70S ribosome that contained a P-tRNA and no factor in the E site (EMD-0176, (34)). The output volume was used as a reference for subsequent 3D refinements. 3D classification with four classes and without angular sampling was then performed, resulting in two classes of interest that contained density in the E site. The best-resolved of the two classes, class 2, was used for most analyses, on the grounds that this class had the most continuous and feature-rich density for the protein in the E site. Particles from class 2 were re-extracted at the original pixel size and used for 3D autorefinement, and then anisotropic magnification, per-particle defocus, per-micrograph astigmatism, beam tilt, and higher-order aberrations were refined before final 3D autorefinement and post-processing (84).

A combined volume, containing particles from both classes with VmlR2 density in the E site, was also re-extracted as above and partial signal subtraction followed by 3D classification around the A and E sites was performed. For the A-site classification, three classes with 29.1%, 37.6% and 33.3% occupancy were observed. The first and last of these classes contained a tRNA, each in a slightly different conformation, while the second class had no density in the A site, consistent with the poorly resolved density for the A tRNA in the parent map. Each of these classes was reverted to full density and used for 3D autorefinement. Partial signal subtraction and 3D classification around the E site and L1 stalk yielded three maps that differed mostly in the conformation of the L1 stalk, consistent with the poor resolution of this region in the parent map. However, density for VmlR2 was not improved in any of these classes, so class 2 from the initial 3D classification was used for further analyses.

However, density for VmlR2 was not improved in any of these classes, so class 2 from the initial 3D classification was used for further analyses. For post-processing, soft solvent masks and a B factor automatically estimated by Guinier analysis were used.

Model building and refinement Model building and refinement Model building and refinement Starting models for B. subtilis ribosomal proteins and VmlR2 were obtained from the AlphaFold2 database (85). Ribosomal RNA was taken from PDB 6HA1 (34). Models were first adjusted using Coot (86) into a high-resolution B. subtilis 70S map (to be described elsewhere). The resulting model was then fitted in the VmlR2-70S map and adjusted manually with Coot. The starting model of VmlR2 was fitted domain-by-domain and adjusted by hand. A prediction created by ModelAngelo was also used to guide modelling of VmlR2 in places (87). For the P-site tRNA and 23S rRNA of the L1 stalk, PDBs 7NHK and 7NHL were used as starting points, respectively (26). Density for the uL1 protein and the CCA-3′ end nucleotides of the P-site tRNA was very unclear and these regions were therefore omitted from the model. PDB 7K00 was used as a reference to guide modelling, especially around 23S rRNA helix 69 (88). The resulting model was refined first with REFMAC5/Servalcat (89,90), then with Phenix using the starting model as a reference for restraints to decrease bond length and angle root-mean-square deviations (91). MolProbity through Phenix was used for model validation (92). Model statistics are available in Supplementary Table 2.

RESULTS RESULTS The ABCF ARE1 subfamily member CplR is conserved in Clostridia The ABCF ARE1 subfamily member CplR is conserved in Clostridia The ABCF ARE1 subfamily member CplR is conserved in Clostridia While horizontally mobile ARE-ABCFs that are encoded in mobile genetic elements or plasmids mediate acquired antibiotic resistance, chromosomally-encoded ARE-ABCFs provide intrinsic antibiotic resistance and are likely to be predominantly inherited vertically. The three Gram-positive ARE-ABCF representatives characterised here—CplR (standing for Clostridial pleuromutilin and lincosamide resistance; we propose this new name based on the resistance spectrum determined in the current study, see below), VmlR2 and Ard1—are of the latter, intrinsic type. Despite this commonality, they belong to very different subfamilies of the ABCF family tree (Figure 1A). C. difficile CplR encoded by the gene CDIF630_02847 (RefSeq protein accession WP_011861613.1) is a member of the ARE1 subfamily, although it is phylogenetically distinct from the well-characterised mobile Vga- and Msr-like ARE1 proteins. CplR is found in a range of different Clostridia, including C. difficile, C. perfringens and C. sporogenes (Figure 1A). The core CplR group is found in various clostridia genera: Terrisporobacter, Clostridium, Clostridoides and Paeniclostridia (Supplementary Figure S3). However, there is a large diversity of CplR close relatives in bacillota, for which it is hard to establish orthology versus paralogy. The ARE2 subfamily of ABCFs can be subdivided into two phylogenetically distinct types: one subtype has a short ‘arm’ subdomain, as is seen in VmlR from B. subtilis (34), while the second form has insertions in the arm and – sometimes – the ARD/linker element, as is the case with Neobacillus vireti VmlR2 (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S4). The Ard1 ABCF from Streptomyces capreolus is classified as being in the actinobacterial subfamily AAF1, closely related to ARE4 and ARE5 subfamilies (24). Just as with C. difficile CplR ARE-ABCF (54), Ard1 was originally mis-annotated as a transporter (52). While ABCF proteins do carry the ATP-binding cassette domain that is also found in many transmembrane transporters, they lack the necessary transmembrane domains for such a role. Ard1 is encoded as part of the A201A antibiotic biosynthesis gene cluster, acting as a self-resistance determinant (53).

N.D. stands for ‘not determined’. While the wild-type B. subtilis is virtually immune to A201A and hygromycin A (MICs in excess of 256 μg/ml, beyond the concentration levels that are experimentally feasible given the paucity of these antibiotics), the ΔvmlR strain is sensitive (MIC for A201A of 4 μg/ml, MIC for hygromycin A of 16 μg/ml) (Table 1). This observation expands the spectrum of known VmlR-mediated resistance to nucleoside compounds. When B. subtilis VmlR is overexpressed in ΔvmlR B. subtilis, the strain becomes PLSA- and nucleoside-resistant; no protective effect is detectable when an ATPase-deficient EQ2 variant of VmlR is expressed (Table 1). Expression of N. vireti VmlR2 confers the same PLSA and nucleoside resistance spectrum, despite the relatively long ARD, without any detectable resistance to macrolides (Table 1). Expression of S. capreolus Ard1 in Streptomyces lividuns is known to confer resistance to A201 (52), however no systematic characterisation of the Ard1 resistance spectrum was performed. The Phy-spank-driven expression of wild-type S. capreolus Ard1—but not that of EQ2 Ard1—confers ΔvmlR B. subtilis moderate resistance to nucleoside—but not PLSA—antibiotics. The narrow spectrum of Ard1-mediated resistance suggests that Ard1 specifically confers self-resistance to A201A (Table 1). Finally, ectopic expression of C. difficile CplR confers ΔvmlR B. subtilis resistance to PLSA antibiotics and has a moderate (2- to 4-fold increase in MIC) protective effect against nucleosides.

Collectively, these results (i) expand the resistance spectrum of ABCF-mediated resistance to nucleoside antibiotics, (ii) demonstrate that despite its relatively long ARD, N. vireti ARE2 VmlR has a PLSA and nucleoside resistance spectrum identical to that of the short-ARD B. subtilis ARE2 VmlR, (iii) establish S. capreolus Ard1 ARE-AAF1 as a dedicated narrow-spectrum nucleoside resistance factor and (iv) establish genome-encoded C. difficile ARE1 CplR as a PLSA resistance determinant.

Cryo-EM structure of N. vireti VmlR2-70S complex Cryo-EM structure of N. vireti VmlR2-70S complex Cryo-EM structure of N. vireti VmlR2-70S complex Next, we aimed to determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of ribosome-bound ATPase-deficient (EQ2) C. difficile ARE1 CplR and N. vireti ARE2 VmlR2. To generate the ribosome-bound complexes we employed our well-established affinity purification strategy (26,33). While the C. difficile CplR structure would provide the necessary structural insights into intrinsic PLSA and nucleoside antibiotic resistance of C. difficile pathogen, the N. vireti VmlR structure would be instructive for structural rationalisation of the VmlR2N.vireti resistance spectrum that is identical to that of short-ARD B. subtilis VmlR. S. capreolus Ard1 has not been prioritised for structural studies for two reasons: (i) the lack of established genetic tools for S. capreolus and (ii) the levels of nucleoside antibiotic resistance conferred in B. subtilis surrogate host are modest, indicative of imperfect functioning of the resistance determinant on the B. subtilis 70S ribosome. Next, we aimed to determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of ribosome-bound ATPase-deficient (EQ2) C. difficile ARE1 CplR and N. vireti ARE2 VmlR2.

Unfortunately, our attempts to purify the FLAG3-tagged C. difficile CplR in complex with the ribosome were unsuccessful. As C-terminal FLAG3-tagging of C. difficile CplR abrogated the functionality of CplR in ΔvmlR B. subtilis (Table 1; ΔvmlR thrC::Physpank-cplRCd-FLAG3), we did not pursue this direction further. However, we were successful in isolating a complex of EQ2N. vireti VmlR2-HTF with B. subtilis 70S ribosomes (Supplementary Figure S1). The immunoprecipitated FLAG3-tagged EQ2 VmlR2 was eluted and applied to a cryo-EM grid for imaging in a Titan Krios followed by single-particle analysis using RELION (83). Three-dimensional classification revealed one major class of particles (72.3% of particles after 2D classification) consisting of VmlR2-EQ2 bound to the 70S ribosome (Supplementary Figure S2). This volume could be refined to an average resolution of 2.9 Å (Supplementary Figure S5A, B). The VmlR2 NBDs and C-terminal extension (CTE) could be modelled by domain-wise fitting and adjustment of the AlphaFold2 model (Supplementary Figure S5C). While the density for the NBDs was not sufficient to draw conclusions about the precise geometry adopted by the catalytic region of the enzyme, the VmlR2 interdomain linker, consisting of two α helices and a loop, and which extends into the core of the large ribosomal subunit, was well resolved and could be modelled de novo with high confidence (Supplementary Figure S5C). The VmlR2-70S structure is globally similar to other antibiotic resistance ABCF-70S complexes (26,33,34,41,43) (Figure 2A, B). VmlR2-EQ2 is bound in the ribosomal E site with closed NBDs and density corresponding to two bound NTP molecules, presumably ATP (Figure 2A–C, Supplementary Figure S6A, B). The VmlR2 α-helical interdomain linker extends from the E site into the PTC, overlapping the canonical position of a P-site tRNA (Figure 2D,E). This results in a distorted tRNA occupying the P site, with the tRNA elbow contacting the VmlR2 NBD2, pulled towards the E site, and the acceptor stem highly distorted. Poor density for the P-tRNA acceptor stem indicates a high degree of flexibility in this region, and in particular the CCA-3′ end could not be modelled (Supplementary Figure S6C).

As observed previously in ABCF samples prepared by ex vivo immunoprecipitation (26,33,34), the density of the P-site tRNA was most consistent with an initiator fMet-tRNA (Supplementary Figure S6C), and density for the P-site codon was most consistent with AUG (Supplementary Figure S6D). An apparent Shine-Dalgarno–anti-Shine-Dalgarno helix is positioned in the mRNA exit channel, close to, but not visibly contacting, the VmlR2 CTD (Supplementary Figure S6E). A sub-stoichiometric tRNA is present in the A site, as observed previously for the 70S-LsaA-EQ2 complex from Enterococcus faecalis, and sub-classification revealed that the A-site tRNA can adopt multiple conformations (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure S7). These observations imply that VmlR2-EQ2 had bound to and stalled the 70S ribosome after translation initiation, but before the first translocation event, which is the same state stalled by PLSA and nucleoside antibiotics (7,96).

As expected from the high degree of sequence homology, the structure of VmlR2 bound to the 70S ribosome is globally similar to B. subtilis VmlR bound to the 70S, with a root square mean deviation (RMSD) of 1.44 Å between the two factors after least-squares fitting. In particular, the α-helices of the well-resolved interdomain linker, which travel through the path normally occupied by the P-tRNA to reach into the PTC, are highly structurally conserved (Figure 2D, E). The ends of the α-helices and the ARD-loop linking them, diverge from the equivalent region in the B. subtilis VmlR (Figure 2E), as expected from the sequence alignment (Figure 1B). Compared to VmlR, the additional eight residues in the VmlR2 ARD are mostly oriented away from the PTC and drug binding site (Supplementary Figure S8A), similar to that observed for the ARDs of LsaA, VgaALC and VgaL, which are also extended compared to B. subtilis VmlR despite sharing a similar spectrum of antibiotic resistance (Supplementary Figure S8B–D) (26). Indeed, despite containing eight more amino acids than B. subtilis VmlR, the VmlR2 ARD reaches a similar site in the PTC as many other PLSA-specific ARE-ABCFs (Figure 2E, Supplementary Figure S8). Residue Ile261 of VmlR2 overlaps with the binding site of PLSA and nucleoside antibiotics, similarly to Phe237 of B. subtilis VmlR except inserted approximately 1.4 Å deeper into the PTC (Figure 2F, Supplementary Figure S9A–H).

We next mutated selected residues of the ARD-loop of VmlR2 to alanine and assessed the ability of the resulting VmlR2 variants to mediate antibiotic resistance in a ΔvmlR B. subtilis background (Table 2). As observed for other antibiotic-resistance ABCFs, mutating the only residue that overlaps with the PLSA binding site, in this case Ile261 to alanine, did not appreciably shift the antibiotic resistance spectrum of VmlR2 (Table 1). However, due to the increased penetration of the VmlR2 ARD into the PTC, an alanine side chain at position 261 is also predicted to still overlap with the PLSA binding site (Supplementary Figure S9I–K). Therefore, we next performed a more radical substitution and replaced Ile261 with glycine. The Ile261Gly substitution, which is predicted to remove overlap between VmlR2 and the drugs (Supplementary Figure S9L–N), compromised the activity of VmlR2 against retapamulin and virginiamycin M1 but not against lincomycin and iboxamycin (Table 1). This antibiotic-specific loss of protective activity is reminiscent of the effect we have previously observed with the Phe237Val substitution in B. subtilis VmlR (34). We therefore conclude that while the Ile261 sidechain is not required for antibiotic resistance.

Mutation of other selected residues close to the drug-binding site resulted in a complex pattern of changes to antibiotic resistance (Supplementary Figure S10). Residues Arg259 and Gln260, positioned in the tip of the ARD, were insensitive to mutation to alanine despite making defined contacts with the 23S rRNA (Supplementary Figure S10A, B). By contrast, VmlR2 Y266 was required for resistance to tiamulin and virginiamycin M. This residue is positioned similarly to B. subtilis VmlR Y240 and VgaALC Y223, with each residue stacking with 23S rRNA nucleotide U2585 (E. coli numbering; Figure 2G), and we previously found that a VgaALC Y223A variant also displayed reduced resistance against PLSA antibiotics (26). The adjacent residue, E265, also had a drastic effect on antibiotic resistance when mutated to alanine. E265 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of 23S rRNA residues A2450 and A2451, which form part of a region we have previously termed PTC loop 2 (PL2, Supplementary Figure S10C, (26)). Interactions between VmlR2 and the 23S rRNA in this region may serve to position the VmlR2 ARD in the PTC.

Interactions between VmlR2 and the 23S rRNA in this region may serve to position the VmlR2 ARD in the PTC. Finally, we have truncated the very tip of the ARD including the above-mentioned Arg259 and Gln260. The Δ254–261 (ΔSASERRQI) VmlR2 variant (Supplementary Figure S8A) displayed (albeit diminished) protective activity against all of the antibiotics tested, i.e. retapamulin, virginiamycin M1, iboxamycin and lincomycin. This result further reinforces the idea that VmlR2 acts allosterically to protect the ribosome. Finally, we have truncated the very tip of the ARD including the above-mentioned Arg259 and Gln260.

In summary, residues that interact with U2585 and A2450/A2451, located at the beginning of interdomain linker α2, appear to be important for PLSA resistance mediated by VmlR2, while by contrast, mutating the residue that physically overlaps with the PLSA binding site or other residues in the extended tip of the ARD does not affect antibiotic resistance (Supplementary Figure S10C,D). These observations are consistent with previous mutagenesis studies of ARE-ABCFs (26,34). Previously, we proposed a model in which ARE-ABCFs confer antibiotic resistance by modulation of the antibiotic binding site (26,33,34). Similar to B. subtilis VmlR, VmlR2 modulates the conformation of several 23S rRNA nucleotides that form the PLSA binding site. In particular, nucleotides around A2451, part of PL2, are displaced in the VmlR2-bound structure compared to the antibiotic-bound structures or a stalled elongating ribosome (Figure 2H,I, Supplementary Figure S11). We therefore propose that binding of VmlR2 to a PLSA- or nucleoside-bound ribosome triggers a distortion of the antibiotic-binding site, in turn leading to dissociation of the antibiotic and ultimately allowing translation to resume after dissociation of the ARE-ABCF.

Next, we characterised the resistance mediated by C. difficile, C. perfringens and C. sporogenes CplR in the native bacterial hosts. In our C. difficile antibiotic sensitivity experiments we used two strains: the erm- R20291 and the erm + 630. R20291 is an epidemic hypervirulent strain that belongs to PCR-ribotype 027 (97). The MIC values determined with this strain are directly comparable with erm- ATCC 700057 MICs reported by Mitcheltree and colleagues in the original iboxamycin study (12). Despite encoding a genomic copy of CplR, both R20291 and ATCC 700057 are sensitive to iboxamycin (MIC of 0.0625 μg/ml for R20291, MIC of 0.25 μg/ml for ATCC 700057 (12)) (Table 2).

The C. difficile 630 wild-type reference strain is a clinical isolate that over the years gained popularity with the research community (98). The prophage region of the mobilizable, non-conjugative transposon Tn5398 present in the genome of C. difficile 630 encodes a tandem expression cassette for two identical copies of the ermB gene for rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase (55). This ubiquitous antibiotic resistance determinant confers resistance to macrolides as well as lincomycin and clindamycin (99,100). Compared to wild-type 630, the Δerm 630 C. difficile is more sensitive to pleuromutilin retapamulin (MIC for of 0.4 μg/ml vs 1.6 μg/ml) as well as lincosamides (MIC for lincomycin of 16 μg/ml vs > 256 μg/ml, MIC for clindamycin of 16 μg/ml versus 256 μg/ml and MIC for iboxamycin of 0.25 μg/ml vs 16 μg/ml) (Table 2). Since in B. subtilis VmlR synergises with Cfr to grant high levels of resistance (48), we next tested the effects of CplR loss in Δerm 630 C. difficile. The strain is further sensitised to lincosamides (MIC for lincomycin, clindamycin and iboxamycin of 0.1, 0.5 and <0.125 μg/ml, respectively) as well as virginiamycin M1 (MIC of 16 μg/ml) but not florfenicol or hygromycin A. The effect of CplR expression on nucleoside resistance is minor: a mere 2-fold increase in sensitivity to A201A, and no effect on sensitivity to hygromycin A (Table 2, compare 630Δerm ΔcplR to 630Δerm as well as 630Δerm ΔcplR/pRFP185 to 630Δerm ΔcplR/pRFP185-cplR). Our results establish that the synergetic action of Erm and CplR is responsible for the ability of wild-type C. difficile 630 to resist PLSA antibiotics, including iboxamycin (MIC of 16 μg/ml).

Our results establish that the synergetic action of Erm and CplR is responsible for the ability of wild-type C. difficile 630 to resist PLSA antibiotics, including iboxamycin (MIC of 16 μg/ml). Next, we tested the effects of CplR loss on antibiotic sensitivity of C. perfringens (Table 3) and C. sporogenes (Table 4). Compared to wild-type HN13 C. perfringens, the isogenic strain harbouring a markerless disruption of cplR is sensitised to the pleuromutilin retapamulin (32-fold increased sensitivity, MIC of 0.8 vs 0.025 μg/ml), lincosamides (MICs dropping 8- (lincomycin), 2- (iboxamycin) or >32-fold (clindamycin)), as well as virginiamycin M1 (a 2-fold MIC drop). Conversely, ectopic overexpression of CplRCp from the pJIR 750 vector in the ΔcplR background drastically increased the MICs against retapamulin, lincomycin, clindamycin and iboxamycin, exceeding that of the wild-type HN13 C. perfringens by 8-fold (Table 3). Next, we tested the effects of CplR loss on antibiotic sensitivity of C. perfringens (Table 3) and C. sporogenes (Table 4).

The MIC test for C. sporogenes was carried out in GAM media, and the growth inhibition was scored after 24 h of anaerobic incubation at 37°C.

The MIC test for C. sporogenes was carried out in GAM media, and the growth inhibition was scored after 24 h of anaerobic incubation at 37°C. To test the role of CplR in antibiotic resistance of C. sporogenes, we constructed a strain in which the cplRCs gene is disrupted by the insertion of the intron-ermB resistance marker (Table 4). To deconvolute the effect of the introduced ermB gene on antibiotic resistance from that of cplRCs disruption, we also constructed a strain in which the intron-ermB marker is introduced into the sigD locus. Compared to the isogenic wild type, the cplR::intron-ermB strain is more sensitive to retapamulin (MICs of 0.025 μg/ml versus 25.6 μg/ml, Table 4) suggesting that CplR mediates resistance to pleuromutilins. As expected, the introduction of the ErmB marker the cplR::intron-ermB strain displays higher resistance to lincomycin than the isogenic wild type (MIC for lincomycin of 256 μg/ml versus 32 μg/ml, Table 4). At the same time, the cplR::intron-ermB strain is more sensitive to iboxamycin (MICs of 0.031 μg/ml versus 0.125 μg/ml), consistent with the role of CplR in lincosamide resistance. The antibiotic resistance function of ClpR is further supported by the clindamycin and iboxamycin MIC of the cplR-disrupted mutant being lower than that of the sigD mutant (compare cplR:intron-ermB to sigD::intron-ermB: clindamycin MICs of 8 μg/ml vs 128 μg/ml, iboxamycin MICs of 0.031 μg/ml versus 16 μg/ml) (Table 4). Finally, the effects on nucleoside antibiotic sensitivity are minor (2-fold increased sensitivity to hygromycin B, and no effect on sensitivity to A201A).

Finally, the effects on nucleoside antibiotic sensitivity are minor (2-fold increased sensitivity to hygromycin B, and no effect on sensitivity to A201A). Taken together, our results establish ARE1 CplR as a clostridial genome-encoded PLSA resistance determinant and suggest that high PLSA resistance levels of C. difficile 630 are mediated through a combined action of direct ribosome protection by CplR and 23S rRNA modification by the ErmB methyltransferase.

Expression of ARE-ABCFs is typically induced upon a sub-MIC antibiotic challenge through a de-repression mechanism, with the full-length mRNA levels being kept low in the absence of the cognate antibiotic due to premature transcription termination in the absence of ribosomal stalling on a regulatory uORF (27–32).

Genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites (TSSs; identified using dRNA-seq) and termination sites (TTSs; identified using RNAtag-seq) in C. difficile 630 (54) revealed that i) the cplR ORF preceded by a 212 nucleotide-long 5′ upstream region (CDIF630nc_084), and that ii) as expected for an ARE-ABCF, under non-inducing conditions, the transcript prematurely terminates at start codon of the cplR ORF (CDIF630_02847) (Figure 3A). Since antibiotic-induced ribosomal stalling by a regulatory uORF is a common regulatory strategy employed for inducible control of ARE-ABCF expression (27–32), we have mounted an in silico search for regulatory ORFs of CplR and close relatives using our bioinformatic tool for uORF detection, uORF4u (61). Sequence conservation analysis reveals that the uORF of Clostridial CplR has a consensus of MR[I/M], with C. difficile cplR uORF specifically encoding Met-Arg-Ile (Figure 3B, C). The consensus is different from the uORF4u-computed uORF for VmlR (MIN, Figure 3C), VmlR2 (MK[L/Q], Figure 3D) and LsaA (MAGN, Figure 3F), despite the four ARE-ABCFs having similar resistance spectra. The identified short uORFs are likely to be stalled by PLSA and nucleoside antibiotics, which inhibit translation after initiation with little context-specificity (7,96). We could not identify an adequate number of sufficiently closely related homologues for the tool to be able to predict any conserved uORFs for Ard1.

We predicted secondary structures of the 5′ cplR leader region in induced (i.e. full-length mRNA with 70S ribosome stalled on the uORF in the presence of antibiotics) and repressed (i.e. prematurely terminated mRNA generated in the absence of antibiotics) conformations using RNAfold (66) and Mfold (101). In the repressed conformation the 5′ cplR leader region is predicted to form two stable stem loop structures (Figure 3G). The 5′ hairpin sequesters the putative regulatory uORF(MRI). The 3′ terminator hairpin is followed by a single-stranded polyU stretch, thus constituting a canonical signal for efficient intrinsic termination in bacteria (102–105). Importantly, the stem loop of the terminator hairpin sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno element positioned to drive the expression of the cplR ORF, potentially mediating the suppression of the cplR expression from full-length mRNA transcripts that fail to terminate prematurely. In repressed conformation the terminator hairpin is not formed, with an anti-terminator stem loop formed instead which allows transcription of full-length mRNA (Figure 3H). Furthermore, the Shine-Dalgarno that drives the cplR expression is readily accessible for initiating ribosomes (Figure 3D).

To test antibiotic-inducible expression of C. difficile cplR, we cultured 630ΔermR C. difficile in the presence of increasing sub-MIC concentrations of retapamulin (2–200 ng/ml; MIC of 800–1600 ng/ml) and lincomycin (0.02–2.0 μg/ml; MIC of 32 μg/ml) and assessed the levels of cplR mRNA by RT-PCR using two primer pairs: one amplifying 5′ leader region and the other targeting the ORF (Figure 4A). As expected, the level of cplR mRNA was increased in a dose-dependent manner for both retapamulin and lincomycin treatment, with the RT-PCR signal for both mRNA regions increasing upon antibiotic challenge (Figure 4B).

The time point of antibiotic addition is set as zero on the time axis. Next, we investigated the time-course of cplR expression upon antibiotic challenge. We hypothesised that when the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic on translation is relieved by the ARE-ABCF, the expression of the factor should subside as the antibiotic-induced ribosomal stalling that drives the expression is abolished. To test this hypothesis, we contrasted the RT-PCR data with bacterial growth kinetics. The cplR expression quickly responded to the antibiotic challenge, peaking within 30 min after the addition of antibiotics (Figure 4C, left). Importantly, while the retapamulin-induced growth inhibition was severe and persisted for the whole duration of the experiment, the lincomycin-induced growth inhibition is much milder and at the later time points the growth kinetics are similar to that one the untreated control (Figure 4C, right). Consistent with the prediction, while in the presence of 200 ng/ml retapamulin the maximal levels of cplR mRNA are maintained throughout the 6 h of the RT-PCR time course, but the cplR mRNA levels gradually decreased as bacterial growth – and, by inference, protein synthesis – has recovered from the lincomycin challenge (Figure 4C, left).

Wild-type PcplR-mCherry reporter is induced by both retapamulin (C) and lincomycin (D), though the signal is much lower than in the case of Pfdx-mCherry. The muttermSL reporter is constitutively induced and is insensitive to addition of either retapamulin (C) or lincomycin (D). The mutpolyU reporter is repressed in the absence of antibiotics and is induced by the retapamulin challenge (C). To calculate the relative promoter activity, relative fluorescence intensity normalised by O.D.600 was further normalised by the signal from the constitutive Pfdx-mCherry reporter. The ribosomal stalling on the uORF but not the premature RNAP termination is essential for induction of cplR in response to antibiotic challenge. (A) Experimental setup used for mutational probing of the cplR 5′ leader region. Fluorescent reporters relied on mCherry expression driven by the cplR promotor (PCplR) using wither (i) wild-type cplR 5′ leader, (ii) fdxA 5′ leader (5′ leaderfdxA), (iii–v) cplR 5′ leader with substitutions in the uORF start codon (mutuORF), the intrinsic terminator stem (muttermSL) or the polyU track downstream of the intrinsic terminator stem loop (mutpolyU). Locations of the substitutions on the mRNA secondary structure are presented on Figure 3CD. (B) Accumulation mCherry mRNA variants with different cplR 5′ leaders in response to a sub-MIC challenge with lincomycin (2 μg/ml). The antibiotics were added to the logarithmic phase of C. difficile 630 ΔermR culture and total RNA was collected 30 mins after the antibiotic challenge. mCherry ORF and fdx ORF were probed by RT-PCR amplification. 23S rRNA was used as loading control.

To calculate the relative promoter activity, relative fluorescence intensity normalised by O.D.600 was further normalised by the signal from the constitutive Pfdx-mCherry reporter. When PcplR is used to drive the expression of mCherry preceded by wild-type cplR 5′ leader, while virtually no RT-PCR or fluorescence signal is detectable in the absence of antibiotics, whereas addition of either retapamulin (at 0.2 μg/μl) or lincomycin (at 2 μg/ml) results in strong induction of the reporter (Figure 5B, C, Supplementary Figure S12). Conversely, when the 5′ leader region is replaced with that of constitutively and strongly expressed ferredoxin gene (fdx) (106), both the RT-PCR (Figure 5B) and fluorescence (Figure 5C, D) signal drastically increased and became insensitive to the antibiotic challenge. Taken together, these results suggest that our mCherry-based reporter strategy faithfully replicates the regulatory mechanisms that natively control the expression of cplR. When PcplR is used to drive the expression of mCherry preceded by wild-type cplR 5′ leader, while virtually no RT-PCR or fluorescence signal is detectable in the absence of antibiotics, whereas addition of either retapamulin (at 0.2 μg/μl) or lincomycin (at 2 μg/ml) results in strong induction of the reporter (Figure 5B, C, Supplementary Figure S12). Conversely, when the 5′ leader region is replaced with that of constitutively and strongly expressed ferredoxin gene (fdx) (106), both the RT-PCR (Figure 5B) and fluorescence (Figure 5C, D) signal drastically increased and became insensitive to the antibiotic challenge.

Taken together, these results suggest that our mCherry-based reporter strategy faithfully replicates the regulatory mechanisms that natively control the expression of cplR. After establishing the validity of the assay, we next introduced point mutations in the cplR 5′ leader probing (i) the regulatory uORF (AUG to AUC substitution of the initiation codon; mutuORF), (ii) the terminator stem loop that sequesters the cplR main ORF Shine-Dalgarno motif (triple C-to-G substitution disrupting the helix; muttermSL) and, finally, (iii) the terminator polyU tract (triple U-to-A substitution; mutpolyU) (Figures 3G, H and 5A).

The mutuORF fluorescent reporter is inactive both in the presence and the absence of either retapamulin (Figure 5C) or lincomycin (Figure 5D), which is consistent with translation of the uORF being essential for the induction of cplR. The muttermSL reporter in which premature transcription termination is ablated and the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) element that drives expression of cplR is made directly accessible for translation initiation is (i) constitutively active and non-responsive to addition of antibiotics, and (ii) the fluorescent signal is >10-fold higher than that of the fully induced wild-type 5′ leader reporter construct (Figure 5C, D). By contrast, the expression of mCherry from the mutpolyU reporter is (i) tightly regulated by antibiotics, with only very weak signal detectable in the absence of retapamulin, (ii) in the presence of retapamulin, the fluorescent signal was about twice (2.3-fold) as strong as that in the case of the wild-type reporter (Figure 5C). In the case of the mutpolyU reporter the full-length mRNA is expected to be constitutively produced (just as in the case of muttermSL). Our RT-PCR experiments directly support this prediction: in good agreement with consistent production of the mutpolyU reporter mRNA, the maximum induced signal is higher for the mutpolyU reporter than for the wild-type reporter (Figure 5B). At the same time, the cplR SD element is expected—just as in the wild-type reporter—to be accessible only upon ribosomal stalling on the uORF, and, evidently, translational attenuation is sufficient to ensure the suppression of cplR expression in the absence of antibiotic.

Collectively, our results establish that translational attenuation and transcriptional attenuation synergise to control the inducible expression of CplR in C. difficile.

DISCUSSION DISCUSSION We have experimentally characterised five genome-encoded ARE-ABCF proteins that are implicated in the intrinsic antibiotic resistance of S. capreolus (AAF1 Ard1), N. vireti (ARE2 VmlR2), and Clostridia C. difficile, C. perfringens and C. sporogenes (ARE1 CplR). As we show here, the ΔvmlR B. subtilis strain is a convenient surrogate host for uncovering the resistance spectra of different ARE-ABCFs. Thus, antibiotic sensitivity assays using heterologous expression in ΔvmlR B. subtilis could be used to study other chromosomal ABCFs, guided by bioinformatic surveys.

Thus, antibiotic sensitivity assays using heterologous expression in ΔvmlR B. subtilis could be used to study other chromosomal ABCFs, guided by bioinformatic surveys. Our cryo-EM reconstruction of the N. vireti VmlR2-70S complex is broadly similar to structures of other ARE-ABCFs with specificity for PLSA antibiotics. The ARD of these elements is counter-intuitively both essential for resistance and poorly conserved at the sequence level, exemplified by the eight-amino-acid insertion in the VmlR2 ARD compared to the B. subtilis VmlR ARD, despite the similar antibiotic resistance profiles of both these ARE-ABCFs (Figure 1B, Table 1, Supplementary Figure S8). We observe the extended VmlR2 ARD to be oriented mostly away from the PTC and towards the P-tRNA, reminiscent of the ARDs from more distantly-related PLSA-specific ARE-ABCFs such as LsaA, VgaALC and VgaL (Supplementary Figure S8). Thus, ARDs from PLSA-specific ARE-ABCFs can accommodate addition or deletion of amino acids while only modestly modulating their position with respect to the PTC. To date, all ribosome-bound ARE-ABCF structures have shown either a modest overlap between the factor and the antibiotic binding site, or no overlap at all—a pattern which holds for ARE-ABCFs specific for both PLSAs as well as macrolide, ketolide, and streptogramin Bs (26,34,41,43). This pattern is challenged by our results expanding the specificity of VmlR and VmlR2 to the nucleoside antibiotics A201A and Hygromycin A (Table 1), as each of these antibiotics occupy the PLSA binding site but additionally extend towards the A site. Modelled overlaps between VmlR and these antibiotics are extensive (Supplementary Figure S9). However, consistent with previous ARE-ABCF structures, an overlap between the ARE-ABCF and the antibiotic is not strictly required for resistance, as mutants predicted to abrogate the modelled overlap do not abolish activity (Table 1) (26,34,41). We note that VmlR2 induces distortions in the PTC nucleotides that would disrupt the antibiotic binding site, especially in the region around A2451, which we term PTC loop 2. Such a distortion is common to other PLSA ARE-ABCFs (26). Our cryo-EM reconstruction of the N. vireti VmlR2-70S complex is broadly similar to structures of other ARE-ABCFs with specificity for PLSA antibiotics.

We note that VmlR2 induces distortions in the PTC nucleotides that would disrupt the antibiotic binding site, especially in the region around A2451, which we term PTC loop 2. Such a distortion is common to other PLSA ARE-ABCFs (26). The most clinically important aspect of this work is the detailed study of the Clostridial ARE1 CplR. The Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium C. difficile is a causative agent of nosocomial and chronic infections as well as healthcare-associated diarrhoea (107). Disruption of the protective gut microbiota by broad-spectrum antibiotics allows for efficient proliferation of antibiotic-resistant C. difficile in the gut, thus triggering C. difficile infection, CDI (108). C. difficile has high levels of antibiotic resistance, and treatment with lincosamides such as clindamycin has long been recognised as a risk factor for development of CDI, especially in the case of erm + strains (51,56–59). As we show here, (i) similarly to L. monocytogenes ARE-ABCF VgaL and 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase Cfr (48), C. difficile CplR synergises with the 23S rRNA methyltransferase Erm to grant high levels of PLSA resistance, and, (ii) analogously to other experimentally studied ARE-ABCFs, induction of CplR is controlled by ribosomal stalling on a regulatory uORF. These results warrant a systematic exploration for co-occurrence of ARE-ABCFs and 23S rRNA methyltransferase antibiotic resistance determinants, with a special focus on the cases of their co-localisation in one operon on a mobile element (as is observed for LsaA and Cfr (49,50)). We demonstrate the utility of our bioinformatic tool uORF4u (61) for identification of regulatory uORFs and their consensus sequences. The induction of ARE-ABCFs relies on antibiotic-induced ribosomal stalling on regulatory uORFs (27–32), and for elongation inhibitors such as macrolides, phenicols and oxazolidinones, antibiotic-induced ribosomal stalling is context-specific (14,15,17,109–112). A dedicated follow-up investigation of the relationship between uORF consensuses and ARE-ABCF resistance and antibiotic inducibility spectrum is warranted. The specific sequence conservation of the uORF could point towards as-yet-uncharacterized patterns of sequence-specific antibiotic-mediated ribosomal stalling that are used by the cell to trigger the resistance factor induction upon an antibiotic challenge. As we have shown earlier, in the case of B. subtilis VmlR, the sequence identity of the regulatory uORF(MIN) is crucial for efficient induction upon a lincomycin challenge (31), despite this antibiotic not being known to act in a context-dependent manner. These insights, in turn, could potentially be leveraged for development of antibiotic variants with unnatural novel stalling profiles that are not detected by uORF-mediated attenuation mechanisms, and, therefore, do not trigger inducible resistance.
