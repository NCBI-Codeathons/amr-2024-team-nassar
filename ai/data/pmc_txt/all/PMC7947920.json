Approximately 3\u201330% of the selected isolates were identified as Pedobacter, whereas isolation without antibiotics did not yield any isolates of this genus. Next generation sequencing data showed Pedobacter to be on 69th place among the bacterial genera (0.32% of bacterial sequences). The Pedobacter isolates produced a wide array of novel compounds when screened by UHPLC-MS/MSMS, and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in several distinct clusters of compounds produced by specific isolates of Pedobacter, and most of these compounds were found to be peptides. The Pedobacter strain UP508 produced isopedopeptins, whereas another set of strains produced pedopeptins, which both are known cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by Pedobacter sp. Other Pedobacter strains produced analogous peptides with a sequence variation. Further strains of Pedobacter produced additional novel antibacterial cyclic lipopeptides (ca 800 or 1400 Da in size) and/or linear lipopeptides (ca 700\u2013960 Da in size). A 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree for the Pedobacter isolates revealed several distinct clades and subclades of isolates. One of the subclades comprised isolates producing isopedopeptin analogs, but the isopedopeptin producing isolate UP508 was clearly placed on a separate branch. We suggest that the non-ribosomal peptide synthases producing pedopeptins, isopedopeptins, and the analogous peptides, may derive from a common ancestral non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene cluster, which may have been subjected to a mutation leading to changed specificity in one of the modules and then to a modular rearrangement leading to the changed sequence found in the isopedopeptins produced by isolate UP508.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The discovery and use of antibiotics in human medicine have saved millions of lives, helped to increase our life expectancy and made possible many of the medical practices that are now standard in modern medicine. Most of all clinically relevant antibiotics originate from natural products made by microorganisms, and mainly soil bacteria (Demain, 2014). These natural products stem from the ancient struggle for existence during which an intricate web of antibiotic production and factors for defense or self-protection have evolved. Accordingly, it is quite common for soil bacteria to both carry genes coding for antibiotics as well as the corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (Omura et al., 2001; Bentley et al., 2002; D\u2019Costa et al., 2006; Walsh and Duffy, 2013).", "The discovery and use of antibiotics in human medicine have saved millions of lives, helped to increase our life expectancy and made possible many of the medical practices that are now standard in modern medicine.

The current situation with increasing antimicrobial resistance against antibiotics and an accelerated spread of antibiotic resistance genes is indeed of critical concern. To make bad even worse, the antibacterial pipeline has been insufficient for many years to keep resistant pathogenic bacteria and especially the Gram-negatives at bay (Theuretzbacher et al., 2019). Therefore, in order to tackle the most critical clinical needs more novel antibiotic leads must urgently be fed into the pipeline (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019a, b).", "The use and overuse of antibiotics exert a strong selection pressure on affected microorganisms and as a result, many clinically essential antibacterial drugs against important pathogens are becoming less useful.

The major part of the microorganisms known to be present in soils and other natural environments, as detected by metagenome studies, will not grow easily in the laboratory, which makes these potentially useful microbes difficult to access. On the other hand, many cultivable microorganisms often produce already known compounds that in turn prompts the need for efficient de-replication. Consequently, it can be difficult to isolate producers of novel and promising antibiotics. In order to challenge these obstacles, some researchers have pursued in situ isolation methods to expand the cultivable part of the soil microbiota and successfully found novel and promising antibiotic lead molecules (Ling et al., 2015). Others have focused on the inherent need for antibiotics producing bacteria to be self-resistant and thus used selected single antibiotics during the isolation of bacteria, with the aim to increase the proportion of bacterial isolates that can produce compounds similar to the supplemented antibiotic (Thaker et al., 2013, 2014).", "However, there are numerous obstacles to overcome when searching for novel antibiotics among natural products.

A couple of studies on soil microorganisms have simply used the definition of antibiotic resistant bacteria as those that can grow in the presence of 20 mg/L of the tested antibiotic (D\u2019Costa et al., 2006; Walsh and Duffy, 2013). Examples of environmental antibiotic resistant bacteria are members of the Gram-negative genus Pedobacter, that have been found to be resistant against numerous antibiotics from several classes (Viana et al., 2018). These included the facultative psychrophilic bacterium P. cryoconitis, which was first described after being isolated from the dark windblown debris called cryoconite on a glacier in Austria (Margesin et al., 2003), Pedobacter lusitanus, which is a close relative to P. cryoconitis, first isolated from the sludge of a deactivated uranium mine in Portugal (Covas et al., 2017) and Pedobacter steynii that was first obtained from the creek Westerh\u00f6fer Bach in Germany (Muurholm et al., 2007). Further, in a recent study the antibiotic resistance of P. cryoconitis, P. lusitanus and a few more closely related Pedobacter species, were investigated in more detail (Viana et al., 2018). Several of the Pedobacter species in this study were found resistant to antibiotics belonging to three or more different classes of antibiotics, which categorized them as multidrug-resistant (MDR) environmental superbugs (Magiorakos et al., 2012). The antibiotic resistance of the Pedobacter members has been shown to depend on chromosomal genes and not genes on mobile genetic elements and approximately 6\u20138% of their protein coding genes have been estimated to be involved in providing antibiotic resistance (Viana et al., 2018). The genus Pedobacter has been rapidly expanding since the description of the first four species some 20 years ago (Steyn et al., 1998) and currently includes 87 species.1", "For clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria, the definition of antibiotic resistance is based on their clinical breakpoint values, but for environmental bacteria the definition is less straightforward.

(2013, 2014) with the goal to find bacterial isolates talented in production of antibiotic compounds. We have reasoned that MDR environmental bacteria may have the corresponding capacity to produce more than one type of antibacterial compound. Thus, when isolating soil bacteria for subsequent screening for new antibiotic compounds, we have combined several antibiotics in order to specifically select for MDR bacteria. The use of this approach resulted in the isolation of P. cryoconitis UP508, which was found to produce isopedopeptins, which are cyclic lipodepsipeptides with potent activity against WHO top-priority bacterial pathogens (Nord et al., 2020). In the present paper, we describe the application of this methodology to isolate several MDR strains of Pedobacter, along with UHPLC-MS based hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the metabolites produced by the isolates. Based on UHPLC-MSMS, we also characterize a number of peptides, of which only a few are previously known whereas the large majority are new chemical entities. Additionally, most of these novel peptides were indicated to have activity against important human Gram-negative and/or Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.", "We have recently adapted and extended the antibiotic resistance approach by Thaker et al.

In MSMS, these peptides did not produce ions enabling facile determination of the full amino acid sequence, and they did not add methanol when treated with NaOMe, suggesting them to be ring-closed by peptide bonds. MSMS resulted in a few Y-type ions suggesting N-terminal fatty acyl groups for the peptides \u2013 C10\u201311 hydroxy fatty acids for clusters 9 and 11, and C8\u20139 fatty acids with and without hydroxyl groups for the cluster 12 (Figure 8). Judging from Y-type ions, the fatty acyl groups of the clusters 9 and 12 peptides were linked to two consecutive DAPA residues, whereas in the cluster 11 peptides the linkage was to DAPA \u2013 Leu/Ile (Figure 8). For neither of the peptides, no further Y-type ions were observed, suggesting these fatty acyl dipeptide moieties to be sidechains on cyclic peptide cores. The observed immonium ions formed by the peptides in MSMS showed the clusters 9 and 12 peptides to contain Phe, whereas the cluster 11 peptides instead contained Leu/Ile. Additionally, the clusters 9 and 12 peptides produced both 2+ and 3+ ions, whereas the cluster 11 peptides only produced 2+ ions, suggesting the presence of one additional basic amino acid, such as DAPA, in the clusters 9 and 12 peptides compared to the cluster 11 peptides. The presumed peptide core of the cluster 11 peptides gave a fragment at m/z 470.271 (1+), whereas the corresponding fragment for the clusters 9 and 12 peptides gave an ion at m/z 504.256 (1+) (Figure 8). As mentioned above, the cluster 11 peptides did not contain Phe, but instead Leu/Ile. By replacing the mass of a Leu/Ile residue in core of the cluster 11 peptides, with the mass of a Phe residue, identical masses are obtained for the core part of the structures. This strongly suggests that the cluster 11 peptides are analogs to the clusters 9 and 12 peptides with a central Phe replaced with a Leu/Ile and one DAPA in the sidechain replaced with another Leu/Ile. The only reasonable molecular formula within \u00b12 mDa for the fragment ions at m/z 470.271 (1+) and 504.256 (1+) is C20H36N7O6+ and C23H34N7O6+, respectively, which may correspond to peptide cores composed of 2 \u00d7 DAPA, Thr, Leu/Ile, ABA, and 2 \u00d7 DAPA, Thr, Phe, ABA, respectively, or various homologous combinations of amino acids (Figure 8). To account for the observation of 2+ and 3+ ions for the clusters 9 and 12 peptides, and 2+ ions for the cluster 11 peptides, the sidechain should be linked to one of the two DAPA residues (or homologs) in the central peptide core (Figure 8).", "Clusters 9, 11, and 12, were found to include another type of peptides, presumably related to each other, with monoisotopic molecular masses in the range 785\u2013860 Da, which gave 2+ and 3+ ions in MS.

Judging from Y-type ions, the fatty acyl groups of the clusters 9 and 12 peptides were linked to two consecutive DAPA residues, whereas in the cluster 11 peptides the linkage was to DAPA \u2013 Leu/Ile (Figure 8). For neither of the peptides, no further Y-type ions were observed, suggesting these fatty acyl dipeptide moieties to be sidechains on cyclic peptide cores. The observed immonium ions formed by the peptides in MSMS showed the clusters 9 and 12 peptides to contain Phe, whereas the cluster 11 peptides instead contained Leu/Ile. Additionally, the clusters 9 and 12 peptides produced both 2+ and 3+ ions, whereas the cluster 11 peptides only produced 2+ ions, suggesting the presence of one additional basic amino acid, such as DAPA, in the clusters 9 and 12 peptides compared to the cluster 11 peptides. The presumed peptide core of the cluster 11 peptides gave a fragment at m/z 470.271 (1+), whereas the corresponding fragment for the clusters 9 and 12 peptides gave an ion at m/z 504.256 (1+) (Figure 8). As mentioned above, the cluster 11 peptides did not contain Phe, but instead Leu/Ile. By replacing the mass of a Leu/Ile residue in core of the cluster 11 peptides, with the mass of a Phe residue, identical masses are obtained for the core part of the structures. This strongly suggests that the cluster 11 peptides are analogs to the clusters 9 and 12 peptides with a central Phe replaced with a Leu/Ile and one DAPA in the sidechain replaced with another Leu/Ile. The only reasonable molecular formula within \u00b12 mDa for the fragment ions at m/z 470.271 (1+) and 504.256 (1+) is C20H36N7O6+ and C23H34N7O6+, respectively, which may correspond to peptide cores composed of 2 \u00d7 DAPA, Thr, Leu/Ile, ABA, and 2 \u00d7 DAPA, Thr, Phe, ABA, respectively, or various homologous combinations of amino acids (Figure 8). To account for the observation of 2+ and 3+ ions for the clusters 9 and 12 peptides, and 2+ ions for the cluster 11 peptides, the sidechain should be linked to one of the two DAPA residues (or homologs) in the central peptide core (Figure 8).", "Clusters 9, 11, and 12, were found to include another type of peptides, presumably related to each other, with monoisotopic molecular masses in the range 785\u2013860 Da, which gave 2+ and 3+ ions in MS.

The isolate UP508 was recently described to produce isopedopeptins (Nord et al., 2020) and several other strains produced the pedopeptins (Hirota-Takahata et al., 2014), here identified by MSMS. However, a number of isolates also produced unknown compounds, including the isopedopeptin analogs present in clusters 2 and 3, here only characterized by MSMS, and linear lipopeptides (clusters 5, 6, 13, and 14), characterized by MSMS and partly by NMR (two peptides of cluster 5). The isopedopeptins, the pedopeptins and the cluster 2 peptides share some structural features with the last-resort antibiotics polymyxin B and E (colistin), i.e., they are cyclic peptides of similar size (ca 1100\u20131150 Da), they are cationic due to the presence of several basic amino acids, and they have a fatty acid tail. One major difference is the nature of the cyclic structure. The polymyxins have a 23-membered ring, involving seven of the ten amino acids, ring-closed via an amide bond to the \u03b3-amino group of a 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid residue (DABA), compared to a 31-membered lactone, involving all nine amino acids and the 3-hydroxyfatty acid, for the Pedobacter peptides. Another difference is the presence of six DABA residues in the polymyxins, compared to one DABA and two 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid residues in the Pedobacter peptides, which makes the polymyxins more cationic than the Pedobacter peptides. With respect to antibacterial activity and mechanism of action, there are both similarities and differences between polymyxins and the Pedobacter peptides. Both pedopeptins and isopedopeptins have potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Kozuma et al., 2014; Nord et al., 2020) just as the polymyxins, which are used to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections, but the isopedopeptins have activity also against colistin resistant strains (Nord et al., 2020). Regarding the mechanism of action, the isopedopeptins were recently described to cause leakage of bacterial membranes (Nord et al., 2020), as the polymyxins and many other cationic peptides (Straus and Hancock, 2006).
