Mycobacterium abscessus is the most common rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria to cause pulmonary disease in patients with impaired lung function such as cystic fibrosis. M. abscessus displays high intrinsic resistance to common antibiotics and inducible resistance to macrolides like clarithromycin. As such, M. abscessus is clinically resistant to the entire regimen of front-line M. tuberculosis drugs, and treatment with antibiotics that do inhibit M. abscessus in the lab results in cure rates of 50% or less. Here, we identified epetraborole (EPT) from the MMV pandemic response box as an inhibitor against the essential protein leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) in M. abscessus. EPT protected zebrafish from lethal M. abscessus infection and did not induce self-resistance nor against clarithromycin. Contrary to most antimycobacterials, the whole-cell activity of EPT was greater against M. abscessus than M. tuberculosis, but crystallographic and equilibrium binding data showed that EPT binds LeuRSMabs and LeuRSMtb with similar residues and dissociation constants. Since EPT-resistant M. abscessus mutants lost LeuRS editing activity, these mutants became susceptible to misaminoacylation with leucine mimics like the non-proteinogenic amino acid norvaline. Proteomic analysis revealed that when M. abscessus LeuRS mutants were fed norvaline, leucine residues in proteins were replaced by norvaline, inducing the unfolded protein response with temporal changes in expression of GroEL chaperonins and Clp proteases. This supports our in vitro data that supplementation of media with norvaline reduced the emergence of EPT mutants in both M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, the combination of EPT and norvaline had improved in vivo efficacy compared to EPT in a murine model of M. abscessus infection. Our results emphasize the effectiveness of EPT against the clinically relevant cystic fibrosis pathogen M. abscessus, and these findings also suggest norvaline adjunct therapy with EPT could be beneficial for M. abscessus and other mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis. Author summary Current antimycobacterial drugs are inadequate to handle the increasing number of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections that eclipse tuberculosis infections in many developed countries. Of particular importance for cystic fibrosis patients, Mycobacterium abscessus is notoriously difficult to treat where patients spend extended time on antibiotics with cure rates comparable to extreme drug resistant M. tuberculosis. Here, we identified epetraborole (EPT) with in vitro and in vivo activities against M. abscessus. We showed that EPT targets the editing domain of the leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) and that escape mutants lost LeuRS editing activity, making these mutants susceptible to misaminoacylation with leucine mimics. Most importantly, combination therapy of EPT and norvaline limited the rate of EPT resistance in both M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis, and this was the first study to demonstrate improved in vivo efficacy of EPT and norvaline compared to EPT in a murine model of M. abscessus pulmonary infection. The demonstration of norvaline adjunct therapy with EPT for M. abscessus infections is promising for cystic fibrosis patients and could translate to other mycobacterial infections, such as tuberculosis.

Introduction Introduction Mycobacterium abscessus is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that commonly causes chronic lung disease, especially among patients with cystic fibrosis [1]. Treatment of pulmonary exacerbation relies on a regimen of intravenous amikacin (AMK), tigecycline, and imipenem plus an oral macrolide if the isolate is susceptible to macrolides [2,3]. Despite guideline-based treatment, combination therapy typically results in cure rates of 50% or less due to the bacterium being intrinsically resistant to many antibiotic classes [4,5]. Unfortunately, the M. abscessus drug-development pipeline is limited to a handful of repurposed drugs (clofazimine, rifabutin, and bedaquiline) [6]. Lately, antibiotics that have shown activity in pre-clinical studies include the oxazolidinones (LCB01-0371 [7] and tedizolid [8]) that target the 50S ribosomal subunit and PIPD1/indol-2-carboxamides that target the mycolic acid transporter MmpL3 [9,10].

Recently, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) became targets of interest for drug discovery when benzoxaboroles were identified as novel boron-based pharmacophores [11,12]. aaRSs are enzymes that aminoacylate tRNAs with their cognate amino acids. All aaRSs have an aminoacylation domain while some are bifunctional and contain an editing domain. The aminoacylation domain forms an aminoacyl adenylate through condensation of the amino acid with ATP, and then transfers the aminoacyl moiety to the 3’ terminal adenosine of the tRNA acceptor stem. Some aaRSs, however, have evolved an editing domain to ensure the correct amino acid is ligated to its tRNA [13,14]. This domain is critical for aaRSs that must distinguish their cognate amino acid from structurally similar amino acids like branched-chain amino acids. Leucyl-tRNA synthetases (LeuRSs) are examples of aaRSs that rely on their editing domains to limit misaminoacylation of tRNA with near-cognate amino acids and maintain the fidelity of the genetic code.

Herein, we identified epetraborole (EPT) from the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) Open pandemic response box as a LeuRS inhibitor in M. abscessus with nanomolar activity in vitro and activity in zebrafish embryos and NOD.SCID mice. Interestingly, EPT was more active against M. abscessus than M. tuberculosis, and this observation was not supported by structural differences in the crystal structures of the LeuRS editing domain of M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis bound to EPT. Furthermore, we highlighted the utility of norvaline to target LeuRS editing deficient escape mutants and suppress resistance in vitro by misincorporation of norvaline in place of leucine residues resulting in disrupted protein folding. Importantly, we showed that EPT and norvaline combination has improved efficacy over EPT monotherapy in a murine model of M. abscessus infection. These data support the potential of the benzoxaborole scaffold in the antimycobacterial drug pipeline and suggest that its activity can be potentiated by supplementation with norvaline or a norvaline derivative.

Results Results Discovery of an antimycobacterial inhibitor against M. abscessus Discovery of an antimycobacterial inhibitor against M. abscessus Discovery of an antimycobacterial inhibitor against M. abscessus To identify compounds with antimycobacterial activity, we first engineered a luminescent M. abscessus ATCC 19977 strain which constitutively expressed the luxCDABE operon [15] (M. abscessus lux). We then screened the 176 compound open-library provided by GlaxoSmithKline (S1A–S1C Fig) and the 400 compound Pathogen and Pandemic Response Boxes from MMV (S1D–S1F Fig) using a threshold ≥ 90% reduction in luminescence compared to non-treated bacteria at 10 μM. Primary hits (20 compounds) were tested in a secondary screen using the resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) at 10 μM on the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 strain. Secondary hits (9 compounds) were then tested in a dose-response assay on M. abscessus ATCC 19977 from a fresh solid compound to determine MIC90. The HepG2 (human hepatocytes) cell line was used to assess the toxicity of hits. Among three compounds (0.3% positive hits of 976 compounds) from the pandemic response box that satisfied primary and secondary criteria, we identified EPT (Fig 1A) as having the most potent antimycobacterial activity and highest therapeutic index (Table 1, MIC90 0.23 μM (0.063 μg/mL), TI (TD50/MIC90) EPT > 330). It was previously reported in M. tuberculosis that potent in vitro growth inhibitors could display carbon-source-dependent effects, which leads to a loss of activity when advanced into in vivo models [16]. We thus measured the MIC90 of EPT on different carbon sources (glycerol vs acetate), in the presence or absence of the detergent Tween-80, and in different nutrient bases (Middlebrook 7H9 vs cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton). EPT was active in all assayed growth conditions but lost potency in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton (CaMH) media (S1 Table). Lower activity of EPT in CaMH media is unsurprising as it was previously shown that rifamycins [17] as well as other antimicrobials [18] lose activity in CaMH media (0.5mg/L Ca2+ and 0.05mg/L Mg2+ in 7H9; 20-25mg/L Ca2+ and 10–12.5mg/L Mg2+ in CaMH). It is thought that some antimicrobials may chelate divalent metal ions, thus limiting their uptake in cells.

However, macrolide susceptibility in vitro does not correlate with clinical outcome success due to point mutations at positions 2058 or 2059 in the 23S rRNA rrl gene (E. coli numbering), and inducible macrolide resistance conferred from the recently identified ribosomal methyltransferase erm(41) [21,22]. Nash et al (2009) discovered that M. abscessus exhibited an inducible resistant phenotype to macrolides, like clarithromycin (CLR), during a 14-day incubation. To this extent, we asked if EPT induced self-resistance or cross-resistance to macrolides. To answer this question, we performed the inducible macrolide resistance assay where M. abscessus was cultured with a subinhibitory concentration of CLR (0.016 μg/mL) or EPT (0.016 μg/mL) for 14 days. At 24 hours and 14 days, aliquots of culture were collected, and the MIC90 of CLR and EPT was determined using REMA. Relative to drug-free conditions, M. abscessus cultured with CLR displayed an increased MIC90 to CLR while the EPT MIC90 for bacteria exposed to EPT remained unchanged up to 14 days (Fig 1C solid bars). To ensure the increased MIC90 resulted from inducible resistance rather than the selection of spontaneous CLR and EPT resistant mutants, the cultures were passaged in antibiotic-free media for 6 additional days and the MIC90 measurements were repeated. In the case of CLR resistance, the MIC90 returned to baseline after the antibiotics were removed (Fig 1C dotted bars). In addition, EPT stimulation did not result in cross-resistance to CLR, and CLR induction did not result in cross-resistance to EPT. The latter is an important finding with clinical significance because CLR is known to impart resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics [23].

Because M. abscessus infections require 18–24 months of antibiotic courses, multidrug treatments are standard practice [2,3]. To ensure EPT would not hamper a multidrug regimen, we performed checkerboard assays with common antimycobacterial drugs. In the checkerboard assays, we used RIF/CLR and CLR/AMK as the synergy and antagonism controls, respectively [23,24]. We did not observe antagonism between EPT and various antimycobacterial agents that target a range of cellular processes (S2 Fig). Whether EPT should be included in a multidrug regimen remains to be determined.

EPT protects zebrafish from M. abscessus infection EPT protects zebrafish from M. abscessus infection EPT protects zebrafish from M. abscessus infection In order to investigate the in vivo activity of EPT, we used the embryonic zebrafish model of M. abscessus infection, which has been developed to test the in vivo efficacy of drugs against M. abscessus [25–27]. Initial experiments indicated that EPT concentrations up to 40 μg/mL (final concentration in fish water) did not interfere with larval development and was well tolerated in embryos when treatment was applied for up to 5 days with daily drug renewal (Fig 2A). Green fluorescent wasabi-expressing M. abscessus (R variant) was microinjected in the caudal vein of embryos at 30 hours post-fertilization. EPT was directly added at 1 day post-infection to the water containing the infected embryos, with EPT-supplemented water changed on a daily basis for 5 days. Embryo survival was monitored and recorded daily for 11 days. While a slight increase in the survival rate was observed with 10 μg/mL EPT, this effect was significantly improved with 40 μg/mL EPT with a delay in larval mortality, as compared to the untreated group (Fig 2B). The protection provided by EPT is maintained throughout the 5-day treatment course and was correlated with decreased bacterial burdens beginning 4 dpi demonstrated by fluorescent pixel counting (Fig 2C and 2D).

EPT targets LeuRS in M. abscessus EPT targets LeuRS in M. abscessus EPT targets LeuRS in M. abscessus Benzoxaboroles were shown to inhibit LeuRS in fungi, gram-negative pathogens and most recently M. tuberculosis [11,19,28]. To determine the target of EPT in M. abscessus, 109 CFUs were plated on solid media with 10X, 20X, or 40X MIC90 of EPT to select EPT-resistant mutants. Control mutants were also selected on 40X MIC of AMK. Unlike the EPT resistance frequency of 4.8 x 10−8 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the resistance frequency was 10-fold lower in M. abscessus (S4 Table, 2 x 10−9) [28]. The low in vitro resistance frequency to EPT is highlighted when compared to the control mutants against AMK (1.3 x 10−8). In order to confirm that isolated resistant mutants were true mutants to EPT, we performed REMA using a panel of antimycobacterial agents on the four mutants (one selected on 10X, one on 20X, and two on 40X MIC90 of EPT). We also screened one AMK mutant. As illustrated in S3 Fig, the four EPT mutants were resistant up to 2.7 μg/mL EPT, while maintaining susceptibility to AMK, bedaquiline (BDQ), and RIF. Likewise, the AMK control mutant was only resistant to AMK. Benzoxaboroles were shown to inhibit LeuRS in fungi, gram-negative pathogens and most recently M. tuberculosis [11,19,28].

Likewise, the AMK control mutant was only resistant to AMK. Since benzoxaboroles are known to target LeuRSs, we used a focused approach to identify the mutation(s) in leuS that could be responsible for the observed EPT resistance. leuS was PCR amplified from gDNA from the four EPT mutants, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using Sanger sequencing (S5 Table). In all four mutants, a G to C transversion at position 1306 was identified, which resulted in the conserved D436 residue critical for the catalysis of editing misaminoacylated tRNALeu substituted for H436 (Fig 3A and 3B) [29]. This was further supported with whole-genome sequencing of the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 reference strain, one mutant isolated at 20X MIC, and one mutant isolated at 40X MIC. When compared to the reference strain, five variants were identified in the 20X mutant including a T to G transition at position 1261 in leuS which resulted in a Y421D substitution. Furthermore, the G to C transversion at position 1306 which lead to the D436H substitution was confirmed in the 40X mutant (S6 Table). This contrasts with LeuRS variants identified in P. aeruginosa such as T323P, T327P, and V429M from Hernandez et al. or LeuRS variants such as T322I, D326N, A414V, and R435H identified in a phase 2 clinical trial for complicated urinary tract infections caused by E. coli from O’Dwyer et al. [28,30]. However, the phase 2 clinical trial did identify E. coli isolates with a LeuRS D436A variant. (M. abscessus numbering). To verify the functional significance of the D436H substitution, the leuS genes from M. abscessus ATCC 19977 wildtype (EPT sensitive) and M. abscessus containing the G1306C substitution (EPT-resistant) were cloned into the mycobacterial integrative vector pMV306 under the control of the constitutive hsp60 promoter, yielding pMVhsp60_leuSD and pMVhsp60_leuSD436H. EPT-sensitive M. abscessus was electroporated with pMVhsp60_leuSD, pMVhsp60_leuSD436H, or empty vector control. Only EPT sensitive M. abscessus complemented with the mutant leuS (pMVhsp60_leuSD436H) and not the wildtype leuS (pMVhsp60_leuSD) had increased resistance to EPT (Fig 3C). The integrative complement system using pMVhsp60 may not have provided a complete phenocopy of the true mutant when compared to the episomal equivalent. Also, M. abscessus may not use the hsp60 promoter from M. bovis with optimal efficiency. Lastly, the hsp60 promoter may not operate with the same strength as the leuS promoter.

This contrasts with LeuRS variants identified in P. aeruginosa such as T323P, T327P, and V429M from Hernandez et al. or LeuRS variants such as T322I, D326N, A414V, and R435H identified in a phase 2 clinical trial for complicated urinary tract infections caused by E. coli from O’Dwyer et al. [28,30]. However, the phase 2 clinical trial did identify E. coli isolates with a LeuRS D436A variant. (M. abscessus numbering). To verify the functional significance of the D436H substitution, the leuS genes from M. abscessus ATCC 19977 wildtype (EPT sensitive) and M. abscessus containing the G1306C substitution (EPT-resistant) were cloned into the mycobacterial integrative vector pMV306 under the control of the constitutive hsp60 promoter, yielding pMVhsp60_leuSD and pMVhsp60_leuSD436H. EPT-sensitive M. abscessus was electroporated with pMVhsp60_leuSD, pMVhsp60_leuSD436H, or empty vector control. Only EPT sensitive M. abscessus complemented with the mutant leuS (pMVhsp60_leuSD436H) and not the wildtype leuS (pMVhsp60_leuSD) had increased resistance to EPT (Fig 3C). The integrative complement system using pMVhsp60 may not have provided a complete phenocopy of the true mutant when compared to the episomal equivalent. Also, M. abscessus may not use the hsp60 promoter from M. bovis with optimal efficiency. Lastly, the hsp60 promoter may not operate with the same strength as the leuS promoter. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009965.g003Fig 3EPT targets the editing domain of LeuRS in M. abscessus.A Domains of M. abscessus LeuRS.

Data shown is mean ± SD from three biological replicates. We showed that LeuRSD436H confers high-level resistance to EPT and that complementing the resistant allele into a wildtype background imparts resistance. As a complementary means of verifying the target, we adapted a CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) system for gene knockdown in M. abscessus [31]. CRISPRi facilitates gene knockdown using a guide RNA and catalytically inactive Cas9 endonuclease to sterically prevent transcription of a gene of interest when induced with anhydrotetracycline (ATc). We used CRISPRi to knockdown leuS which resulted in hyper susceptibility to EPT. Since leuS is an essential gene in M. abscessus (Fig 3D), we used 10-fold and 20-fold less ATc than required for complete growth suppression when targeting an essential gene. The EPT MIC99 of the strain induced with 0.1 μg/mL ATc decreased 10-fold compared to uninduced conditions, while induction did not affect the rifabutin (RFB) MIC99 (Fig 3E). These results provide further evidence that EPT targets LeuRS in M. abscessus.

EPT binds the editing active site of LeuRS EPT binds the editing active site of LeuRS EPT binds the editing active site of LeuRS Although EPT is active against M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis, the MIC90 for M. abscessus whole-cell activity is 7-fold lower (MIC90Mabs 0.063 μg/mL vs MIC90Mtb 0.46 μg/mL). We hypothesized that EPT had a higher affinity for the M. abscessus LeuRS editing active site. We therefore performed binding studies between EPT and the editing domains of LeuRS from M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (S4 Fig). M. abscessus LeuRS and M. tuberculosis LeuRS contain a single binding site for EPT, and we obtained similar equilibrium dissociation constants and Gibbs free energies (Table 2). The EPT—M. abscessus LeuRS binding has a higher enthalpic contribution (1.1 to 3.2 kcal mol-1), while the EPT—M. abscessus LeuRS binding has a lower entropic contribution (5.5 to 3.3 kcal mol-1). Although EPT is active against M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis, the MIC90 for M. abscessus whole-cell activity is 7-fold lower (MIC90Mabs 0.063 μg/mL vs MIC90Mtb 0.46 μg/mL).

We obtained the crystal structures of the LeuRS editing domain unliganded 2.1 Å resolution (PDB 7N11) and in complex with the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) adduct with EPT at 1.7 Å resolution (PDB 7N12, S7 Table). AMP acts as a surrogate for the 3’ end of the tRNA acceptor stem. In concordance with the binding mode of action of benzoxaboroles [19], we detected strong electron density in the active site corresponding to the EPT-AMP adduct formed through covalent interactions between the boron atom of EPT and the 2’ and 3’ hydroxyl groups on the ribose ring of AMP (Figs 4A and S5A). Comparing unliganded and liganded residues in M. abscessus editing domain structures shows a sizable shift of residues 416–422, located around the adenosine pocket, upon drug binding, including ordering of Y421 to interact with the EPT-AMP adduct phosphate, and a decrease of B factors in the neighbouring residues (S5B Fig). This increase in order could explain the relatively lower entropic contribution to binding observed in ITC, although an unliganded M. tuberculosis structure is not available for comparison.

Once bound with benzoxaborole-AMP adduct, the active sites of M. tuberculosis (PDB: 5AGR) [19] and M. abscessus LeuRS, and mode of adduct binding are very similar (Figs 4A and S5C). Both proteins make critical contacts with the primary amine side chain through D433 (D447 in M. tuberculosis) and the universally conserved D436 (D450 in M. tuberculosis) (Fig 4A). In addition, R435 (R449 in M. tuberculosis) hydrogen bonds with the ethoxy oxygen of EPT and packed with the ribose of AMP (Fig 4A). The packing interaction on the ribose of AMP is underscored from E. coli mutants with R435H variants that lead to resistance early in the phase 2 clinical trial for complicated urinary tract infections. EPT has a hydroxypropyl ether moiety, rather than the ethyl ether in the benzoxaborole bound to M. tuberculosis LeuRS, but the extension shows very weak electron density and likely does not contribute to binding. The only notable difference is a ~1 Å shift in phosphate group of the EPT-AMP adduct (Fig 4B). In both complexes, the phosphate is pinned between Y421 (Y435) and T323 (T337). The electron density indicates that there are multiple rotomeric conformations of T323, meaning its hydroxyl could hydrogen bond with the phosphate or with the 3’ O and ether oxygen of the adduct (Fig 4B). M. tuberculosis LeuRS T337 is modelled in the latter position, but inspection of deposited maps also indicates multiple rotomeric conformations. Variants at T322, T323 and T327 were identified in P. aeruginosa and E. coli mutants resistant to benzoxaboroles, which supports the importance of the threonine rich region for editing activity [32]. From the structural data, we propose that EPT binds LeuRS from M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis in a similar manner with similar affinity, providing a shared pathway for future structure-activity relationship analysis.

The only notable difference is a ~1 Å shift in phosphate group of the EPT-AMP adduct (Fig 4B). In both complexes, the phosphate is pinned between Y421 (Y435) and T323 (T337). The electron density indicates that there are multiple rotomeric conformations of T323, meaning its hydroxyl could hydrogen bond with the phosphate or with the 3’ O and ether oxygen of the adduct (Fig 4B). M. tuberculosis LeuRS T337 is modelled in the latter position, but inspection of deposited maps also indicates multiple rotomeric conformations. Variants at T322, T323 and T327 were identified in P. aeruginosa and E. coli mutants resistant to benzoxaboroles, which supports the importance of the threonine rich region for editing activity [32]. From the structural data, we propose that EPT binds LeuRS from M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis in a similar manner with similar affinity, providing a shared pathway for future structure-activity relationship analysis. Norvaline is toxic to editing-deficient EPT mutants Norvaline is toxic to editing-deficient EPT mutants Norvaline is toxic to editing-deficient EPT mutants Since resistance to EPT was shown in a phase 2 clinical trial of complicated urinary tract infections from E. coli, we sought a way to minimize the emergence of resistance in M. abscessus pulmonary infections [30]. We hypothesized that norvaline, a non-proteinogenic amino acid absent from extant proteins [33], would be toxic to M. abscessus editing-deficient mutants that acquired EPT resistance. When challenged with 59 μg/mL norvaline, the D436H editing-deficient mutant was significantly reduced in growth, while the wild-type strain was not inhibited (Fig 5A). The mutant strain complemented with wild-type leuS (D436H::leuSD) displayed a two-day lag before significant growth. As controls, leucine and isoleucine were not toxic to the D436H mutant. There was however a minor reduction in mutant growth in 59 μg/mL valine, but no growth difference between the D436H and D436H::leuSD strains. Thus, we cannot conclude that valine exerts some toxicity to editing-deficient strains. Next, we asked if norvaline toxicity could be rescued with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The D436H mutant was grown in 59 μg/mL norvaline with varying concentrations of BCAAs. Leucine but not isoleucine or valine rescued growth (Fig 5B). These observations corroborate the results that LeuRSs contain natural selectivity with their aminoacylation site for leucine and can discriminate against isoleucine and valine, but to a lesser extent against norvaline as non-cognate amino acids [34].

Norvalination of the proteome induces the heat shock response Norvalination of the proteome induces the heat shock response Norvalination of the proteome induces the heat shock response To provide a mechanism of norvaline toxicity, we analyzed the proteomes of wild-type, D436H mutant, and D436H:leuSD grown in norvaline or valine as control. We analyzed ~2500 proteins from whole-cell lysates after 12 hours or 3 days of incubation in 59 μg/mL norvaline or valine using reverse-phase HPLC/MS. Proteins filtered for leucine residues 14 Da lighter (14 Da corresponds to missing methylene group on norvaline) were enumerated using spectral counting. The wild-type maintained preferential incorporation of leucine into proteins, while the D436H mutant had a median norvaline misincorporation in 6% of the proteome after 12 hours. However, the amount of norvaline misincorporation between the D436H mutant and the D436H::leuSD strain was not significantly different (Fig 6A). Given that there was a two-day delay when the complemented strain was grown in norvaline (Fig 5A), we hypothesized that the effects of gene complementation would be seen at a later time point when grown in 59 μg/mL norvaline. The experiments were repeated, and the strains were incubated for 3 days. Again, the median norvalination increased in the D436H mutant relative to wild-type, but the level of misincorporated norvaline increased to 20% of the proteome. At this time point, the complemented strain partially rescued the level of norvalination after 3 days (Fig 6B). In all conditions tested, we measured background misaminoacylation of valine in the proteome (Fig 6A and 6B).

Next, we asked how the cell responded to stress caused by norvaline misincorporation in the proteome. Using total spectral counting, we determined the fold change in protein abundance from D436H mutant relative to wild-type. There was a distinct increase in proteins when challenged with norvaline that was absent from the valine control (Fig 6C-F). We used the protein-protein interaction (PPI) mapping tool STRING to identify upregulated proteins with common functions. When 130 of the most highly abundant proteins after norvaline stress were mapped for PPIs (Fig 7A), proteins belonging to the Clp protease family (ClpP1, ClpP2, ClpX) and GroEL chaperonin family (GroEL, GroL2, GroS) were identified (False discovery rate 7.2x10-4 at 12 h, 2.1x10-5 at 3 d) (Fig 7C). As a control, 130 randomly selected proteins from the norvaline dataset were not enriched for chaperonins and proteases when analyzed for PPIs (Fig 7B). We also observed a temporal change in chaperonin and protease levels where early stress from norvaline at 12 hours upregulated chaperonins followed by protease upregulation at 3 days (Fig 7D). This data suggests that norvaline misincorporation into the proteome results in toxicity from misfolded proteins [14,33,35–40].

Norvaline reduces resistance to EPT in vitro and potentiates EPT activity in vivo Norvaline reduces resistance to EPT in vitro and potentiates EPT activity in vivo Norvaline reduces resistance to EPT in vitro and potentiates EPT activity in vivo Knowing that norvaline targets LeuRS editing domain, we asked if norvaline could prevent escape mutants to EPT in vitro. We observed a 23-fold reduction in escape mutant frequency when M. abscessus ATCC 19977 was plated on 7H10 plates containing 10X MIC90 EPT and 590 μg/mL norvaline (1.89 x 10−10) over EPT alone (4.28 x 10−9) (Fig 8A); as a control, RFB did not benefit from norvaline supplementation. To test whether this effect would be observed in other mycobacteria, we repeated with M. tuberculosis, again observing a suppression of EPT mutants with norvaline exposure (Fig 8A). Next, the MIC90 of EPT against M. abscessus ATCC 19977 was measured with differing doses of norvaline (Fig 8B). Norvaline had no effect on the MIC90 even up to 590 μg/mL.

We evaluated EPT and norvaline combination therapy for in vivo activity in a NOD.SCID mouse model of M. abscessus infection [41]. Mice were infected intranasally with a high inoculum of M. abscessus (~106 CFU). Treatment was started 1-day post-infection with once-daily oral vehicle (carboxymethylcellulose), RFB as positive control (10 mg/kg), EPT (10 mg/kg), EPT + norvaline (10 mg/kg + 3.3 mg/kg), or norvaline (3.3 mg/kg). Norvaline was dosed at 3.3 mg/kg (5 mM) which represents ~10X MIC90
in vitro against the editing deficient D436H mutant. Previously, norvaline had been shown to be an effective in vivo neuroprotective agent as an arginase inhibitor at 2 mM in a triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease [42]. Compared to vehicle-treated mice, we measured a 1 log10 decrease in bacterial burden in the lungs from RFB or EPT treatment. Furthermore, the addition of norvaline to the EPT group was significantly more active than EPT alone with an additional ~1 log10 decrease in bacterial burden in the lungs while norvaline alone had no significant effect (Fig 8C).

Discussion Discussion Our data and two recent publications [43,44] confirmed the activity of benzoxaboroles against mycobacteria using zebrafish and murine models of infection and we showed that benzoxaboroles can be potentiated when combined with norvaline. Specifically, we demonstrated that the combination of EPT with norvaline reduces the emergence of M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis mutants and results in increased activity in vivo compared to EPT. Whether norvaline can be a therapeutic adjunct for other benzoxaboroles remains to be established, but is supported by observations with tavaborole and norvaline in E. coli [45]. The potential for combination therapy may be of value in non-mycobacterial applications, such as the treatment of urinary tract infections, where EPT did not progress beyond phase 2 studies owing to the rapid emergence of resistance [30].

While we documented that EPT is active against both M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis in vitro, unexpectedly, we observed that EPT is more active against M. abscessus, which conflicts with the standard experience in antimycobacterial drug discovery [6,46–51]. Our cocrystal structure and ITC data point to similarities and differences in the interaction of EPT with the respective LeuRS proteins. Most notably, while the Kd values were similar, the enthalpy was greater for the EPT interaction with LeuRS of M. abscessus. Knowing that compounds with more enthalpically favourable binding are prioritized in hit-to-lead optimization [52], it may be possible that the discordance in enthalpy in part explains the difference in biological activity of EPT against the two organisms (MIC90Mabs 0.063 μg/mL vs MIC90Mtb 0.46 μg/mL). Other possibilities explaining the difference in whole-cell activity may be linked to differential expression level of leuS in both species, the lack of efflux pumps in M. abscessus, or the inability of M. abscessus to survive conditions that mimic leucine starvation, although these remain to be addressed. At a minimum, the current data can be used for future structure-activity relationship studies aimed at uncovering analogues with improved potency against LeuRS of M. abscessus, M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria.

Our in vivo data shows the value of EPT alone in rescuing zebrafish embryos from lethal M. abscessus infection and that EPT + norvaline can control experimental pulmonary M. abscessus infection to a greater degree than the control antibiotic, RFB. Rather than acting as a traditional adjuvant like β-lactamase inhibitors for β-lactams [53], we propose that norvaline potentiates EPT in vitro activity by maintaining a pharmacological pressure on M. abscessus to remain editing proficient and limit the toxicity induced by the unfolded protein response and thus, limiting escape mutants. However, given that our in vivo model of pulmonary M. abscessus infection in NOD.SCID mice does not exceed a bacterial burden of ~107 in the lungs and that the rate of resistance against EPT is ~10−9, other mechanisms might better explain our findings. Since the NOD.SCID model is immunocompromised for NK cells and adaptive immunity, macrophages—the most notable front-line defence for mycobacterial pulmonary infections—would be the main immune cell responsible for controlling the M. abscessus infection. One of the primary mechanisms of macrophages for controlling infections is the production of reactive nitrogen species like nitric oxide (NO) from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Because NO is produced from arginine by iNOS, macrophages must regulate arginine metabolism between iNOS and the urea cycle, which naturally metabolizes arginine through the enzyme arginase. Interestingly, norvaline was shown to be an inhibitor of arginase and this resulted in increased production of NO in activated macrophages [54,55]. This increased production of NO from arginase inhibition might explain the lower bacterial burden observed in the NOD.SCID mouse group that received EPT + norvaline treatment.

Given that response rates to M. abscessus treatment are poor, resulting in chronic and potentially untreatable pulmonary and dermatologic infections, we submit that benzoxaboroles with the addition of a leucine mimic hold promise for the treatment of M. abscessus infections, and potentially other mycobacterial infections, such as tuberculosis.

Nevertheless, the concerns seem feasible enough to address as a minor revision. Reviewer Comments (if any, and for reference): Reviewer's Responses to Questions Part I - Summary Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship. Reviewer #1: The manuscript entitled "Efficacy of epetraborole against Mycobacterium abscessus is increased with norvaline" by Sullivan, describes the activity of epetraborate and norvaline against M. abscessus. Overall the paper is very interesting and generally well supported by experimental results. I think this paper could strongly benefit from enzymatic data. Structures look very good and support the results of the paper. There are several issues that should be addressed before the paper can be accepted. 1. The beginning of the abstract needs to be rewritten. The first few sentences are short and seem disjointed. It reads more like bullet points. 2. Line 103 – The authors used two different methods to measure viability in their whole cell active compound screen, namely luminescence and resazurin. I think it would be helpful to show the correlation between these two screens. I do not believe it changes validity of results, but it would be good to know how many compounds were active on luminescence, resazurin or both. 3. Line 114 – The author claims that EPT lost potency in cation-adjusted Muller Hinton. This seems like an important finding. I believe the authors would make a stronger statement if they could at least provide a at least some speculation on mode of action of EPT. 4. Line 144 – The author reference fig 1C. I found this figure to be challenging to navigate, due to the number of experiments being shown in each panel (MIC of EPT and CLR, with incubation on EPT or CLR, with and without Passage for 6 days). I found myself constantly having to go back to the legend when trying to compare datasets. I think it may be beneficial to split this figure in more panels to make it easier to understand 5. Fig 1C – on the 14 day figure, it seems like pre exposure to EPT, sensitized cells to both EPT and CLR. Especially when comparing the with and without 6 days of passage. The fold change is not large, but the small error bars for these data sets suggest it is statistically significant. Biological significance is however debatable. 6. Line 154 – The authors found no synergy between EPT and other antimycobacterial drugs, yet the text reads “indicating the potential for a future multidrug regime”. I understand they are mostly pointing out that EPT is at least not antagonistic, but I don’t know if these results demonstrate strong potential for combination therapy. 7. Line 161 – Wrong figure name. I believe this should be Fig 2A not 1A 8. Line 167 – The authors claim that there was only minimal benefit at 10ug/mL, but significantly improved at 40ug/mL. However, at day 11, the probability of survival is the same in both dosages. Significantly higher than untreated. Please explain. 9. Fig 2B – I believe this experiment should have been carried out longer. Although the 10ug trace started off closely matching the untreated, they separate in the later days. The authors repeatedly mention that abscessus is notoriously difficult to treat, with regimen taking 18 months, yet stopped recording data 11 days post infection. Zebrafish can live for 3 years. Furthermore at 11 days, survivability was still 40% in the untreated cohort, and was not showing sign of plateauing. 10. Line 185 – The authors conclude that the mechanism of resistance must be specific to EPT. However, they only test 3 other drugs. Although it is true that this seems EPT dependent, testing 3 other compounds, with unrelated mechanisms of action, is in my opinion not enough to say it is EPT specific. 11. Line 186 – The authors decided to use a focused approach to identify the mutation in leuS based on literature. However, with only 4 four mutants, I think doing whole genome sequence would have been feasible. It is entirely possible that each mutant had to accumulate more than the D436H mutation. Since the resistance frequency is higher than expected, this is a possibility. 12. Fig 3c – WT cells can become resistant by transforming with a mutant leuS, indicating the enzyme plays a role in the mechanism of resistance. However, the level of resistance is intermediate. I think this should be addressed in the paper to offer some hypotheses. Relative expression of WT leuS vs Mutant leuS in this strain could also explain the results. It is also possible the resistant mutant strain has other mutation contributing to the resistance. 13. Line 215 – The authors hypothesize that EPT is more potent against M. abscessus than M. tuberculosis because it has higher affinity to LeuRS active site in M. abscessus. Binding data does not strongly support that this is the case. However, in order to demonstrate stronger inhibition of the M. abscessus enzyme, I believe an enzymatic assay would be very important. The difference in whole cell potency between species could easily be due to difference in cell permeability, efflux pump or many other cellular processes that can affect potency of drugs. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase can be easily assayed by measuring released pyrophosphate or AMP. 14. PDB- 7N12 I could not access the structure however, the I/sigma is, I believe, too low in the PDB validation document at 0.2. I believe resolution should be cut. 15. Line 252 – Their final conclusion based on structure data seem to contradict their hypothesis that EPT has higher affinity for the M. abscessus enzyme. If this is the case, I believe authors should reflect back on the hypothesis of line 215. 16. Line 317 – Using Norvaline in order to reduce resistance is, in my opinion, very clever. However, I believe that in order to further demonstrate this as a possible avenue, the authors should either demonstrate themselves or provide evidence from literature that Norvaline is safe. 17. Line 337 – The authors are trying to make the argument that using Norvaline in combination with EPT would be valuable, because rapid emergence of resistance caused EPT not to progress in phase 2 clinical study (UTI). However, this contradicts their previous findings, where they claim that resistance rates were lower than expected in M. abscessus. The UTI trial was probably on a different organism, therefore emergence of resistance may not be a problem for treatment of m. abscessus. 18. Line345 – I do not think the enthalpy difference is strong enough to convincingly claim that EPT inhibits M. abscessus’ LeuRS more than Mtb’s. This needs to be assayed enzymatically. Reviewer #2: I thought this was a good manuscript covering an important area of drug discovery for this unmet medical need. A large number of experiments have been performed and the article tells a very complete story. I would support acceptance of this manuscript with a few minor revisions highlighted below Reviewer #3: This well written manuscript describes a series of experiments that identified EPT as a potent inhibitor of Mycobacterium abscessus, confirmed the expected targeting of LeuRS, demonstrated therapeutic proof of concept in a mouse model of M. abscessus infection and tested the novel hypothesis that adjunctive norvaline could potentiate EPT efficacy and suppress emergence of EPT resistance by compromising survival of EPT-resistant LeuRS editing domain mutants. The authors conclude that the approach of combining oxaborole LeuRS inhibitors with leucine mimics hold promise for treatment of M. abscessus infections and potentially tuberculosis and other NTM infections. The work is novel, comprehensive and potentially impactful for several difficult-to-treat mycobacterial infections. In addition to EPT, the oxaborole LeuRS inhibitor GSK3036656 has progressed to a phase 2 trial for tuberculosis. A few major and minor issues are described in the comments below. ********** Part II – Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be absolutely required to validate study conclusions. Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject". Reviewer #1: (No Response) Reviewer #2: None Reviewer #3: The conclusion that the additive activity of norvaline and EPT observed in vivo is attributable to suppression of LeuRS mutants by the addition of norvaline is dubious. Given the extremely low frequency of spontaneous mutants observed in vitro, the limited growth of the bacteria in vivo and the limited bactericidal effect of EPT, these mutants are unlikely to have replaced the susceptible bacterial population in the lungs of mice after just 10 days of treatment. Thus, selective amplification of such mutants is unlikely to be the factor limiting the magnitude of the EPT effect in this model. This could be confirmed by testing the isolates obtained at the end of treatment for EPT resistance and LeuRS mutations. This comment is not intended to discount the observation of potentiation by norvaline but, rather, to challenge the proposed explanation. The proposed experiment could be avoided if the discussion is revised accordingly. ********** Part III – Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. Reviewer #1: (No Response) Reviewer #2: Abstract, summary statement AND introduction should be reviewed to improve the flow of the text The location of the resistant mutation (D436H) should be related to those seen in the clinical resistance in E.coli. In particular in relation to whether the same residues are seen and propose how the mutation causes resistance (in the crystallography section) Is reference 40 the correct reference for 2mM in vivo treatment of norvaline, if it is then it needs to be made clear this its activity is not for mycobacterial infection models. An explanation needs to proposed for why in vivo synergy is seen, I am not an expert in this area but in a study this short it seems unlikely to me that when there is no effect on MIC, synergy would be related to effects on escape resistance when only infecting with 106 bacteria and frequency of resistance is only 2 x-9 There are two publications this year relating to M abscessus and epetraborole. While this manuscript expands on these studies by looking at norvaline it should mention these earlier publications Reviewer #3: The prospects for incorporating norvaline into clinical use for the adjunctive treatment of mycobacterial treatment could be discussed in more detail. For example, what is the relevance of the 5 mM concentration/dose tested in vitro and in vivo in light of what is known of the human exposures that may be safely attained and tolerated? EPT concentrations are alternately described in uM or ug/ml in different sections of the manuscript; one unit should be adopted throughout, with the translation of uM to ug/ml encouraged if uM is used Lines 157-70: in this paragraph, figs referenced should be figs 2a-d rather than figs 1a-d Line 322: suggest revision to “~10X MIC90 in vitro against the D436H mutant” or something similar to clarify this MIC is against the mutant Line 323: suggest revision to “effective in vivo as a neuroprotective agent” or something similar to clarify that this statement of efficacy applies to a different, non-infectious disease model Line 386: please indicate which strain was engineered for luminescence Lines 752-4: duplicate of ref 30 Lines 811-3: duplicate of ref 26 Fig 1 legend: for fig 1c, change “upper” and “lower” to “left” and “right” ********** PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (what does this mean?).
