Abstract By limiting the nitrogen source to glutamic acid, we isolated cyclic peptides from Euglena gracilis containing asparagine and non‐proteinogenic amino acids. Structure elucidation was accomplished through spectroscopic methods, mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. The euglenatides potently inhibit pathogenic fungi and cancer cell lines e.g., euglenatide B exhibiting IC50 values of 4.3 μM in Aspergillus fumigatus and 0.29 μM in MCF‐7 breast cancer cells. In an unprecedented convergence of non‐ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase assembly‐line biosynthesis between unicellular species and the metazoan kingdom, euglenatides bear resemblance to nemamides from Caenorhabditis elegans and inhibited both producing organisms E. gracilis and C. elegans. By molecular network analysis, we detected over forty euglenatide‐like metabolites in E. gracilis, E. sanguinea and E. mutabilis, suggesting an important biological role for these natural products. Light and glutamic acid induced E. gracilis to produce euglenatides with antifungal and anticancer activity. Euglenatides were also detected in E. sanguinea and E. mutabilis. They resemble the nemamides isolated from C. elegans, inhibited both producing species, and represent uniquely convergent assembly‐line biosynthesis between unicellular organisms and metazoans. M.

Results and Discussion Results and Discussion Discovery of Euglenatides Discovery of Euglenatides Discovery of Euglenatides We cultured Euglena gracilis var. saccharophila Klebs (strain 1224/7A) under photosynthetic and heterotrophic conditions (media composition in Table S1, S2). Disappointingly, only common chlorophyll and xanthophyll photosynthetic pigments were perceived in extracts of either the supernatant or the algal biomass. The addition of small molecule epigenetic modulators, that we used to activate BGCs in Aspergillus fungi,
[21]
 was also to no avail. A breakthrough came about by considering the role of our nitrogen source. While the standard culture medium contains a complex mixture of amino acids arising from tryptone and yeast extract protein hydrolysates, Oda et al. reported that amino acids can either promote or inhibit growth in E. gracilis, with glutamic acid being the most effective nutrient.
[22]
 Consequently, we removed tryptone and yeast extract from our medium and instead used a minimal composition supplemented by glutamic acid. Gratifyingly, new metabolites were now observed in the biomass extract of E. gracilis grown photosynthetically, and the effect was replicated by several other amino acids, notably asparagine and glutamine (Figure 2). Time course experiments indicated a maximal metabolite production after ten days of cultivation in minimal medium with the addition of 30 mM glutamic acid (Figure S1). Under higher resolution in the HPLC, the main induced peak split into multiple closely overlapping signals (Figure 2). We named the compounds corresponding to the five major peaks as euglenatides A–E in order of chromatographic elution.

Isolation and Structure Elucidation Isolation and Structure Elucidation Isolation and Structure Elucidation We cultured E. gracilis in larger 18 L scale, with minimal medium+30 mM Glu, at ambient temperature under photosynthetic conditions (irradiation by daylight lamps, 2000 lumens). Following cell lysis and extraction, the residue of 1.7 g was initially purified by silica flash chromatography to give 187 mg of a mixture of euglenatides. Repeated cycles of semi‐preparative HPLC finally afforded 2.8 mg of pure euglenatide A, 5.7 mg of euglenatide B, 2.8 mg of euglenatide C, 2.3 mg of euglenatide D and 2.4 mg of euglenatide E. IR absorptions at 3347 cm−1 (NH) and 1651 cm−1 (CO) revealed the presence of amide carbonyl groups while the broad peak at 2873 cm−1 (CH) was characteristic of an aliphatic chain.

The sequence of amino acid residues was established by correlations of the NH protons to the amide carbonyls and CHα and CHβ protons in the amino acid side chains in HMBC and COSY spectra, resulting in the complete 2D structure of euglenatide B (Figure 3). The allylic loss of methanol and water assisted by the conjugated triene is presumably a facile process, accounting for the resulting fragment ions observed in positive mode mass spectrometry.

The non‐proteinogenic amino acid βAib is rarely found within natural products, previously reported in only the guanidine phascolosomine from the sipunculid worm Phascolion strombi,

] Meanwhile, to our surprise, the long chain C20 lipophilic β‐amino acid Gra bears a resemblance to the C16 amino acid found within the nemamides isolated by the Butcher group from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Figure 4).
[29]
 The nemamides are the product of the multimodule megasynthases PKS‐1 and NRPS‐1 in C. elegans, and the first example of such assembly‐line biosynthesis in a metazoan. Furthermore, the presence of PKS‐1 and NRPS‐1 homologs in many nematode genomes implies an important physiological function for these peptides. It is remarkable that nemamides, the only known metazoan PKS‐NRPS metabolites, should possess structural similarity in the lipophilic region to euglenatides of microalgal origin. While the rest of the nemamide backbone contains three Asn residues, the euglenatides are more complex and contain additional stereocenters with one Asn replaced by Dnv and βAla substituted by the chiral βAib in euglenatide B. The non‐proteinogenic amino acid βAib is rarely found within natural products, previously reported in only the guanidine phascolosomine from the sipunculid worm Phascolion strombi,

[29]
 The nemamides are the product of the multimodule megasynthases PKS‐1 and NRPS‐1 in C. elegans, and the first example of such assembly‐line biosynthesis in a metazoan. Furthermore, the presence of PKS‐1 and NRPS‐1 homologs in many nematode genomes implies an important physiological function for these peptides. It is remarkable that nemamides, the only known metazoan PKS‐NRPS metabolites, should possess structural similarity in the lipophilic region to euglenatides of microalgal origin. While the rest of the nemamide backbone contains three Asn residues, the euglenatides are more complex and contain additional stereocenters with one Asn replaced by Dnv and βAla substituted by the chiral βAib in euglenatide B. The non‐proteinogenic amino acid βAib is rarely found within natural products, previously reported in only the guanidine phascolosomine from the sipunculid worm Phascolion strombi,

 and the lipopeptides YM‐170320 and fusaristatins from fungal Candida and Fusarium sp. respectively.[

In brief (Figure S41, Tables S4–S7), euglenatide A contained the same amino acids as euglenatide B, except that Asn II was replaced by a second Dnv residue. Euglenatides D and E were deoxy analogues of euglenatides A and B, respectively, without the C2‐hydroxyl group of the graciline residue. The NMR spectrum of euglenatide C was unique relative to the others, as it contained an extra methyl group (1H, δ 1.02 ppm; 13C, δ 19.5 ppm), and COSY/HMBC correlations assigned this to the replacement of Dnv by 4,5‐dihydroxynorleucine (Dnl).

 Both L‐FDVA‐L‐Asp (RT=20.66 min) and L‐FDVA‐D‐Asp (RT=25.52 min) were found, indicating one each of L‐Asn and D‐Asn in euglenatide B, whereas only the D amino acid was detected from euglenatide A (Figure S42).

Previously, the configurational assignment of βAib by Marfey analysis was complicated by difficult HPLC separation of the two diastereomers and required mathematical peak fitting by Gaussian deconvolution.
[31]
 By careful optimization of conditions including mobile and stationary phase, temperature, flow rate and isocratic solvent system, we devised a new protocol with sufficient chromatographic resolution: L‐FDVA‐L‐βAib, RT=59.47 min and L‐FDVA‐D‐βAib, RT=56.98 min (Figure S43). This confirmed that both euglenatides A and B contain the (R)‐enantiomer, identical in stereochemistry to naturally occurring βAib isolated from bacterial, fungal or plant sources. On the other hand, in humans, βAib is a catabolite of thymine and valine metabolism and both enantiomers are detected in plasma.

[32] Determination of the Dnv stereochemistry was challenging due to the lack of commercial standards and we employed a bi‐enzymatic recycling cascade synthesis from Ala involving pyruvate‐aldolase and L‐ or D‐α‐transaminase.
[33]
 This resulted in two scalemic samples: the L‐series contained L‐Ala (70 %)+L‐syn‐Dnv (26 %)+L‐anti‐Dnv (4 %) while the D‐series contained D‐Ala (25 %)+D‐syn‐Dnv (9 %)+D‐anti‐Dnv (66 %). Marfey analysis with these samples resulted in clear separation of the four Dnv diastereomers: L‐FDVA‐L‐anti‐Dnv, RT=17.03 min; L‐FDVA‐L‐syn‐Dnv, RT=32.38 min; L‐FDVA‐D‐anti‐Dnv, RT=24.92 min; L‐FDVA‐D‐syn‐Dnv, RT=29.90 min (Figure S44). Our hydrolysates were found to produce L‐FDVA‐L‐anti‐Dnv, and further confirmation came from enantiopure Boc‐L‐anti‐Dnv(4‐TBDMS)‐OEt, an intermediate in GE81112A total synthesis kindly provided by Dr. Armin Bauer at Sanofi‐Aventis.
[34]
 Global deprotection of this material to Dnv followed by Marfey's analysis gave an identical result to our sample.

Neither the intact Gra residue nor simpler fragments were recognized from our acid hydrolysis, due to the lability of this complex amino acid under these conditions. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts, coupling constants and NOESY correlations (Tables S8–S11) of 2‐deoxyGra in euglenatides D and E closely matched the data for nemamide A, as did the CD spectra (Figure S45). We conclude that 2‐deoxyGra is identical in relative and absolute stereochemistry with the nemamide side chain. The chirality of the additional C2 hydroxyl group in graciline was deduced from comparison of J values with nemamide A. Combining all the above information completed the structure elucidation of euglenatides A–E (Figure 5).

Antiproliferative Activity of Euglenatides Antiproliferative Activity of Euglenatides Antiproliferative Activity of Euglenatides The euglenatides were tested for antibacterial activity with methicillin‐sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA ATCC 29213), methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA MB5393) and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 but were inactive at the highest tested concentration of 128 μg mL−1 (Figure S46). On the other hand, antifungal activity was observed against the yeast Candida albicans ATCC 64124. Euglenatides B, C and E had IC50 values of 13–14 μM, whereas euglenatide A (27 μM) and D (40 μM) were less active (Figure S47). Since this strain is ketoconazole resistant, it signifies the euglenatides are not cross‐resistant with the clinically important azole class of antifungal agents. All five euglenatides had a higher activity against the mold Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645, with similar IC50 values of 4–9 μM. The lack of activity against bacteria suggested a specific target in eukaryotic cells absent in prokaryotes, and we screened the most abundant member, euglenatide B, in several human cancer cell lines. Potent antiproliferative activity was noted with respective IC50 values of 533, 773 and 292 nM against the THP‐1 acute monocytic leukemia, A‐549 lung adenocarcinoma and MCF‐7 breast cancer cell lines (Figure S48).

The Butcher group did not report bioassays with the worm nemamides, perhaps due to the paucity of material as only 0.07 mg of nemamide A and even less of nemamide B was isolated from 50 L of nematode culture. Instead, C. elegans mutants that do not produce nemamides were discerned to be defective in recovery from arrest of the L1 larval stage under starvation conditions. Based on the similarity of the lipophilic side chain between nemamides and euglenatides, we predict the former would possess antiproliferative properties against fungal and mammalian cancer cells.

Effects on Producing Organisms Effects on Producing Organisms Effects on Producing Organisms Given the biological activity against eukaryotes, we were curious if euglenatides would influence the producer E. gracilis itself. After four days of algal incubation with euglenatide B, growth was significantly inhibited (Figure 6). The effect appears to be cytostatic rather than cytotoxic, as the algae recovered after a longer period of seven days. The question then arises whether the nemamides have similar bioactivity against their nematode producer C. elegans. Although the worm nemamides are unavailable for testing, we indirectly addressed this issue by using our euglenatides. At concentrations of 10 and 25 μM, euglenatide B was strongly inhibitory to starvation recovery of the L1 larval stage of C. elegans (Figure 7).

It is tempting to speculate that the nemamides in C. elegans and the euglenatides in E. gracilis perform similar biological functions. While low concentrations might serve regulatory purposes and facilitate recovery from starvation conditions without negative effects on the producing organism, the external addition of higher amounts is apparently deleterious and overcomes mechanisms of self‐resistance.[

The UV/Vis profile of the E. sanguinea extract was similar to that of E. gracilis, while the E. mutabilis extract did not have significant UV/Vis absorptions in the 200–600 nM range (Figures S49, S50). This suggests that both E. gracilis and E. sanguinea produce euglenatides with conjugated trienes, while they are either absent or in very low amounts in E. mutabilis.

MS/MS spectra of E. gracilis, E. sanguinea and E. mutabilis extracts were obtained in negative ion mode and used to construct a molecular network of related metabolites (Figure 8).

 Each node in the molecular network is labelled with the precursor mass of the molecule deduced from the corresponding MS/MS spectrum. The constructed molecular network groups the structurally similar metabolites from three Euglena species in a cluster. The higher the similarity, the closer they are in the cluster. For example, precursor masses 808 and 822 represent the MS/MS spectra of euglenatides B and C which differ only by the addition of a methyl group, while precursor masses of 809 and 825 represent euglenatides A and D that differ by an additional hydroxyl group. Our network analysis indicates the presence of over 40 euglenatide‐like metabolites within these three species, including ubiquitous examples such as 845 and 847 and others such as 849 and 1006, detected only in E. mutabilis and E. sanguinea, respectively. The broad distribution, and the multitude of family members, point to an important function for euglenatides and we searched the available genomic Euglena gracilis data for homology with the nemamide BGC.
[38]
 However, due to the incomplete assembly, and the likely absence of gene clustering in Euglena, we did not identify a candidate BGC for euglenatide biosynthesis. MS/MS spectra of E. gracilis, E. sanguinea and E. mutabilis extracts were obtained in negative ion mode and used to construct a molecular network of related metabolites (Figure 8).

Conclusion Conclusion We demonstrate that even a species like Euglena gracilis, subject to scientific study for centuries, harbors unusual and novel secondary metabolites. Ultimately, our successful unmasking of the euglenatides relied on the traditional “one strain, many compounds (OSMAC)” approach of altering fermentation conditions.

 Specifically, culture in minimal media with glutamic acid as the sole nitrogen source served to activate a normally quiescent biosynthetic pathway. The resulting euglenatides contain L‐ and D‐asparagine, as well as (R)‐β‐aminoisobutyric acid, a rare constituent in peptide natural products. In addition, the euglenatides are the first peptide natural products disclosed to incorporate 4,5‐dihydroxynorvaline, 4,5‐dihdroxynorleucine and the novel C20 polyketide derived β‐amino acid graciline with a conjugated triene and two oxygenated stereocenters in the side chain. Interestingly, the E. sanguinea metabolite euglenophycin (Figure 1) also contains 20 carbons, and it is plausible that it shares a common C20 polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor with the euglenatides.

Euglenatides exhibited significant antiproliferative activity against Candida and Aspergillus, the two major pathogenic fungal genera, and a panel of human cancer cells. By molecular network analysis, we detected over 40 euglenatide‐like metabolites in three Euglena species, implying a widespread occurrence within the genus. The euglenatides share a structural similarity to the nemamides, the only known metazoan natural product of NRPS‐PKS origin and inhibited the growth of both producing organisms E. gracilis and C. elegans. The astonishing structural congruence between protist and animal kingdom secondary metabolites is unique in chemical ecology. The ability to harvest multimg quantities of euglenatides from E. gracilis will expedite further research into the biological ramifications of these cyclic peptides.
