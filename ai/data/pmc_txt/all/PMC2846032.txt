Construction of a genomic DNA library from Pantoea agglomerans strain CU0119 and screening against the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora yielded a new family of antibiotics, dapdiamides A−E (1−5). The structures were established through 2D-NMR experiments and mass spectrometry, as well as the synthesis of dapdiamide A (1). Transposon mutagenesis of the active cosmid allowed identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster. The dapdiamide family’s promiscuous biosynthetic pathway contains two unconventional amide ligases that are predicted to couple its constituent monomers. Condensation reactions, the joining of two molecules with the formal loss of water, dominate the biosynthesis of large and small biological molecules. In nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways, condensation domains that are evolutionarily related to the coenzyme A-dependent acyltransferases used in primary metabolism carry out repetitive condensations between amino, hydroxy, and aryl acid monomers.(1) A recent study on the andrimid biosynthetic gene cluster from Pantoea agglomerans and other bacteria led to the realization that transglutaminase-like enzymes also carry out biosynthetic condensations.2,3 In this report, we describe another antibiotic family from P. agglomerans (1−5) in which an l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid fragment (DAP) is linked to two variable units through two amide bonds. The family’s promiscuous biosynthetic pathway contains no NRPS condensation domains. Results and Discussion Results and Discussion Both the dapdiamide family members and their biosynthetic gene cluster were captured by constructing a genomic library of P. agglomerans strain CU0119 and screening for cosmid clones active against Erwinia amylovora. Strains of P. agglomerans (formerly E. herbicola) have previously been shown to produce numerous antibiotics active against E. amylovora, the causative agent of the devastating plant disease fire blight.4,5 A subclone of a dapdiamide-producing cosmid was transposon mutagenized to identify the biosynthetic genes. In this way, a cluster of nine ORFs from the cosmid insert was identified, and it was further subcloned into pUC19 and transformed into E. coli. From this plasmid subclone (pUC19 A10A) members of the dapdiamide family were isolated using bioassay-guided fractionation and linked to their biosynthetic gene cluster.

From this plasmid subclone (pUC19 A10A) members of the dapdiamide family were isolated using bioassay-guided fractionation and linked to their biosynthetic gene cluster. From the 1H NMR spectra of the active fractions it was apparent that several structurally related compounds were responsible for the antibiotic activity against E. amylovora. The high-resolution MS spectrum of the most abundant compound (1) exhibited an [M + H]+ ion at m/z 301.1517, indicating the molecular formula C12H20N4O5 + H. In a DQCOSY spectrum of 1, three proton−proton spin systems corresponding to fumaramic acid, l-2,3-diaminopropionate (DAP), and l-valine units were evident (Figure 1). HMQC and HMBC 2D NMR experiments (Table 1) demonstrated that fumaramic acid is joined by an amide bond to the β-amino group of DAP, while Val is linked through an amide bond to the DAP carboxyl. Several less abundant structural variants of dapdiamide A were also isolated: dapdiamides B (2) and C (3) contain isoleucine and leucine instead of valine (Table 1); dapdiamide D (4) is identical to 1 except the linkage between fumaramic acid and DAP is through the α-amino group of DAP; and dapdiamide E (5) is identical to 4 but has an epoxide in place of the fumaramic acid double bond (Table 2).

The specific rotation [α]23D for isolated dapdiamide A was +5.9 and that for synthetic dapdiamide A was +9.5 in water.

Biosynthesis of Fumaramic Acid (DdaCDEH) Biosynthesis of Fumaramic Acid (DdaCDEH) Biosynthesis of Fumaramic Acid (DdaCDEH) The pathway for fumaramic acid biosynthesis likely begins with succinate. Like other NRPS pathways that generate oxidatively modified building blocks,(7) the dapdiamide gene cluster encodes an adenylation−thiolation (A-T) enzyme, DdaD, that sequesters the monomer to be oxidized. The A domain of DdaD is predicted to activate succinate by adenylation and then tether it to the adjacent DdaD thiolation domain as a thioester. This sequestered monomer would be oxidized by DdaC, a putative Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase. Enzymes from this family catalyze oxidative modifications of unactivated carbon centers, including hydroxylation, desaturation, and epoxide formation.(8) In the case of the dapdiamides, DdaC typically catalyzes the formation of a double bond, but may occasionally catalyze an additional two-electron oxidation to form an epoxide instead. There is precedent for the formation of an epoxide from a hydroxy group by another enzyme from this class, HppE.(9) Finally, the resulting oxidized succinate derivative is likely released from DdaD by DdaE, a homologue of the type II thioesterase domains that cleave acyl groups from thiolation domains.(10) DdaH, a homologue of asparagine synthetase, should transaminate one of the carboxylic acids of the succinate-based monomer, but the timing of its action cannot be predicted bioinformatically.11,12 The pathway for fumaramic acid biosynthesis likely begins with succinate.

However, it encodes two proteins with sequence homology to enzymes that activate carboxylate monomers in primary metabolic pathways: DdaF, a member of the ATP-grasp superfamily, and DdaG, a homologue of phenylacetate-CoA ligase. DdaF is homologous to biotin carboxylase and phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase, both of which catalyze the formation of amide bonds via an acyl phosphate intermediate. Therefore, DdaF likely catalyzes one of the two condensation reactions needed to join the dapdiamide monomers. Related ATP-grasp enzymes have been shown to form intramolecular ester and amide cross-links in microviridin and related cyanobacterial natural products, hinting at a wider role for this enzyme superfamily in natural product biosynthesis.13,14 The dapdiamide gene cluster does not encode any enzymes known to form amide bonds in secondary metabolic pathways.

DdaF is homologous to biotin carboxylase and phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase, both of which catalyze the formation of amide bonds via an acyl phosphate intermediate. Therefore, DdaF likely catalyzes one of the two condensation reactions needed to join the dapdiamide monomers. Related ATP-grasp enzymes have been shown to form intramolecular ester and amide cross-links in microviridin and related cyanobacterial natural products, hinting at a wider role for this enzyme superfamily in natural product biosynthesis.13,14 The other amide bond is likely formed by DdaG, a distant homologue of phenylacetate-CoA ligase, which activates the carboxylic acid of phenylacetate by adenylation for the subsequent attack of the terminal thiol of coenzyme A. DdaG may similarly activate a carboxylic acid by adenylation, perhaps for direct amide bond formation without the intermediacy of a CoA-linked thioester species. While acyl-CoA ligase enzymes are not known to catalyze subsequent condensation reactions, DdaG has an unassigned ∼100 amino acid domain at its C-terminus that may be involved in positioning an amine nucleophile for attack.

CB-25-I, isolated from Serratia plymuthica, has a structure nearly identical to 1 but has an epoxide in place of the olefin.(18) While the biosynthetic gene cluster for CB-25-I has never been identified, a pathway nearly identical to the biosynthetic pathway for the dapdiamide compounds in GenBank from the Serratia proteamaculans 568 sequencing project (locus tags Spro_0339−Spro_0347) suggests that this pathway has been shared between these enterobacteria. Two actinomycete-derived compounds, A19009 and Sch37137 (the epoxide analogue of A19009), contain the N-fumaramoyl-DAP core but have l-alanine linked to DAP via the α-amino group.19,20 These compounds could be made by the same pathway that uses an enzyme with different chemo- and regioselectivity for the formation of the second amide bond, but no sequence data are available. The isolation of such similar molecules from unrelated Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria suggests that the dapdiamide gene cluster is highly mobile, and the divergent structures of the dapdiamides A19009 and Sch37137 are a testament to the plasticity of a pathway based on atypical condensation catalysts.
