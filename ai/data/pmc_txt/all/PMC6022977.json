["Glycopeptide antibiotics are drugs of last resort for treating severe infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. It is widely believed that glycopeptide-resistance determinants (van genes) are ultimately derived from the producing actinomycetes.

As a control, we used the well-characterized resistance model Streptomyces coelicolor. The enzyme activities of a cytoplasmic-soluble d,d-dipeptidase and of a membrane-associated d,d-carboxypeptidase (corresponding to VanX and VanY respectively) involved in resistant cell wall remodeling were measured in the actinomycetes grown in the presence or absence of subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and A40926. Results indicated that actinomycetes possess diverse self-resistance mechanisms, and that each of them responds differently to glycopeptide induction.

Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are drugs of last resort for treating severe infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Enterococcus spp., and Clostridioides difficile [1]. Clinically important GPAs include first-generation vancomycin and teicoplanin\u2014which, although discovered many decades ago, continue to be extensively used in clinical practice\u2014and second-generation telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin, which were recently approved for clinical use for their increased antimicrobial potency and superior pharmacokinetic properties [2,3,4]. Vancomycin and teicoplanin are natural product GPAs produced by soil-dwelling filamentous actinomycetes. Their common structural motif is a core heptapeptide scaffold containing aromatic amino acids that have undergone extensive oxidative cross-linking and decoration with different moieties, such as sugar residues, chlorine atoms and\u2014in case of teicoplanin\u2014a lipid chain. GPAs inhibit peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis by binding to the d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) terminus of the peptide stem of PG-precursor lipid II. The binding of GPAs to lipid II by forming five hydrogen bonds locks PG precursors, impeding subsequent cross-linking reactions [5,6]. Second-generation GPAs are semisynthetic derivatives of vancomycin- and teicoplanin-like molecules, where the chemical modifications were introduced outside the d-Ala-d-Ala binding pocket, mainly involving the appendage of hydrophobic aryl or acyl groups that mimic the natural lipid chain of teicoplanin. In fact, the superior antimicrobial potency of teicoplanin-like molecules is due to membrane anchoring of the hydrophobic tail, which strengthens the bond to membrane-localized lipid II [7,8]. Additionally, Dong et al. [9] demonstrated that lipidation is the key functional difference between vancomycin and teicoplanin related to their differing abilities of inducing a GPA resistance response in enterococci. More recently Kwun and Hong [10], using the harmless actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor as a model resistance system, confirmed that teicoplanin-like derivatives are poor inducers of GPA resistance, and a lack of induction accounts for the susceptibility to these molecules.", "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are drugs of last resort for treating severe infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Enterococcus spp., and Clostridioides difficile [1].

Surprisingly, the membrane-associated VanY activity in N. gerenzanensis pST30 was significantly induced only by vancomycin, and its detection was delayed in comparison to the parental strain, reaching its maximum value after 96 h of growth (Figure 2). In the presence of A40926 and teicoplanin, the VanY activity was comparable to the basal level previously observed in the noninduced recombinant strain (Figure 2). Intriguingly, these data suggest that swapping heterologous A. teichomyceticus genes in N. gerenzanensis pST30 did alter the specificity of induction of the homologous VanY activity, although the heterologous VanX activity responded to induction by the three GPAs as the VanY activity did in the parental strain. It seems that in the presence of the heterologous VanX dipeptidase, homologous VanY carboxyesterase tends to play an auxiliary role as it occurs in VanA and VanB enterococci [21]. Irrespective of this finding, further investigations on the still-unknown regulatory genes controlling GPA resistance in N. gerenzanensis are needed to better explain these diverse responses to GPA induction. In a previous \u2018van genes\u2019 swapping experiment conducted by Hutchings et al., 2006, introducing the Streptomyces toyocaensis VanRS signal transduction system into S. coelicolor \u2206vanRS switched inducer specificity to that of S. toyocaensis, whose resistant genes are induced by A47934 but not by vancomycin [21]. The authors concluded that the inducer specificity was determined by the origin of VanS/VanR [21]. More recently, Kilian et al. reported that the VanRS homologous two-component system VnlRS of Amycolatopsis balhimycina (which produces the vancomycin-type balhimycin) activated the transcription of the vanHAX genes in S. coelicolor, but not in A. balhimycina [32]. Surprisingly, the introduction of VnlRS from A. balhimycina into S. coelicolor induced teicoplanin resistance, most likely by activating further unknown genes required for teicoplanin resistance [32]. Although two members of a putative VanRS-like two-component signal transduction system were previously identified in the A40926 biosynthetic cluster in N. gerenzanensis [33], their role in controlling the VanY-based self-resistance mechanism and in responding to GPA induction is still unveiled and merit further investigations.", "To shed light on the specificity of induction of GPA resistance in N. gerenzanensis, we compared the VanY activity in N. gerenzanensis and in its recombinant strain N. gerenzanensis pST30 when grown in the absence or presence of GPAs (Figure 2).

Upon induction with 10 \u00b5g/mL of vancomycin, 0.45 \u00b5g/mL of teicoplanin, or 2 \u00b5g/mL of A40926, VanY activity in the parental strain increased within the first 24 h (Figure 2), suggesting that VanY-based resistance was induced by the exposure to the three GPAs. As expected, MICs of GPAs measured on N. gerenzanensis after 48 and 72 h of growth in the presence of A40926 increased, as reported in Table S2 of Supplementary Material. Again, the addition of ramoplanin and bacitracin did not influence the activity profile (data not shown). Surprisingly, the membrane-associated VanY activity in N. gerenzanensis pST30 was significantly induced only by vancomycin, and its detection was delayed in comparison to the parental strain, reaching its maximum value after 96 h of growth (Figure 2). In the presence of A40926 and teicoplanin, the VanY activity was comparable to the basal level previously observed in the noninduced recombinant strain (Figure 2). Intriguingly, these data suggest that swapping heterologous A. teichomyceticus genes in N. gerenzanensis pST30 did alter the specificity of induction of the homologous VanY activity, although the heterologous VanX activity responded to induction by the three GPAs as the VanY activity did in the parental strain. It seems that in the presence of the heterologous VanX dipeptidase, homologous VanY carboxyesterase tends to play an auxiliary role as it occurs in VanA and VanB enterococci [21]. Irrespective of this finding, further investigations on the still-unknown regulatory genes controlling GPA resistance in N. gerenzanensis are needed to better explain these diverse responses to GPA induction. In a previous \u2018van genes\u2019 swapping experiment conducted by Hutchings et al., 2006, introducing the Streptomyces toyocaensis VanRS signal transduction system into S. coelicolor \u2206vanRS switched inducer specificity to that of S. toyocaensis, whose resistant genes are induced by A47934 but not by vancomycin [21]. The authors concluded that the inducer specificity was determined by the origin of VanS/VanR [21]. More recently, Kilian et al. reported that the VanRS homologous two-component system VnlRS of Amycolatopsis balhimycina (which produces the vancomycin-type balhimycin) activated the transcription of the vanHAX genes in S. coelicolor, but not in A. balhimycina [32]. Surprisingly, the introduction of VnlRS from A. balhimycina into S. coelicolor induced teicoplanin resistance, most likely by activating further unknown genes required for teicoplanin resistance [32]. Although two members of a putative VanRS-like two-component signal transduction system were previously identified in the A40926 biosynthetic cluster in N. gerenzanensis [33], their role in controlling the VanY-based self-resistance mechanism and in responding to GPA induction is still unveiled and merit further investigations.", "3.

Conclusions", "4. Conclusions", "By comparing the specificity of induction of VanX and VanY peptidases in three different soil-dwelling actinomycetes, we confirm that S. coelicolor has a VanB-phenotype responding to vancomycin but not to teicoplanin or to teicoplanin-like A40926. S. coelicolor does not produce any GPA but possessing resistance genes confers it a selective advantage since it shares the ecological niche (soil) with many other GPAs-producing actinomycetes. Interestingly, by a culture-independent approach using molecular probes, it has been recently estimated that the frequency of encountering a vancomycin-type producer in soil is from 2.5 to 5 times higher than for a teicoplanin-like producing actinomycete [37]. In contrast, the teicoplanin producer A. teichomyceticus is highly and constitutively resistant to all the GPAs, including its own product. On the contrary, lower resistance in N. gerenzanensis is induced either by vancomycin or teicoplanins, and is based on the action of a VanY carboxypeptidase, which in many enterococci and staphylococci plays an unessential and ancillary role in the presence of VanHAX system [27]. Evidently, although producing structurally similar GPAs, A. teichomyceticus and N. gerenzanensis do not share the same self-resistant mechanism. Previous comparative analyses of their biosynthetic GPA clusters indicated that many A40926 biosynthetic genes are more related to vancomycin-type genes than to their teicoplanin homologs [38]. The production of A40926 and teicoplanin are most likely the result of a convergent evolution rather than originating from the same common ancestor. Although the identity and the role of the putative VanRS-like two-component signal transduction system in N. gerenzanensis needs to be investigated, the results of gene swapping between A. teichomyceticus and N. gerenzanensis indicate that cross-talking of the two-component systems is possible, as previously demonstrated in other actinomycetes [21,32].
