gliotoxin detoxification mechanism: in vivo thiomethylation
protects yeast from gliotoxin cytotoxicity. Microbial Cell
3(3): 120-125. doi: 10.15698/mic2016.03.485 Gliotoxin (GT) is a mycotoxin produced by some species of ascomycete fungi
including the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus
fumigatus. In order to produce GT the host organism needs to have
evolved a self-protection mechanism. GT contains a redox-cycling disulfide
bridge that is important in mediating toxicity. Recently is has been
demonstrated that A. fumigatus possesses a novel
thiomethyltransferase protein called GtmA that has the ability to thiomethylate
GT in vivo, which aids the organism in regulating GT
biosynthesis. It has been suggested that thiomethylation of GT and similar
sulfur-containing toxins may play a role in providing self-protection in host
organisms. In this work we have engineered Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, a GT-naïve organism, to express A.
fumigatus GtmA. We demonstrate that GtmA can readily thiomethylate
GT in yeast, which results in protection of the organism from exogenous GT. Our
work has implications for understanding the evolution of GT self-protection
mechanisms in organisms that are GT producers and non-producers. INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Gliotoxin (GT) is a fungal natural product with known antibiotic and antifungal
properties and is biosynthesized by the opportunistic human pathogen,
Aspergillus fumigatus, as well as by related ascomycetes 123. Gliotoxin biosynthesis is encoded by the
gli gene cluster, which contains 13 genes, and the function of
most of these genes has now been elucidated 4.
Effectively, GT is the prototypic epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) and is
structurally and functionally related to a range of disulfide bridge-containing
non-ribosomal peptides including, amongst others, sporidesmin A and sirodesmin 25. GT is
redox-active; thus, cycling between the oxidized and reduced dithiol form
(GT-(SH)2) can generate reactive oxygen species, which have
deleterious cellular effects. GT auto-induces its own biosynthesis by activating and
maintaining gli cluster expression 6. In animal cells, GT can inactivate selected protein functionality by
covalent interaction with protein thiols and also deplete cellular glutathione (GSH)
78.
Indeed, the cytotoxicity of GT is such that an independently regulated gene within
the gli cluster, gliT encodes GT oxidoreductase
which recognizes GT-(SH)2 and catalyzes disulfide bridge closure and is
essential in A. fumigatus for self-protection against exogenous GT

yeast). As a consequence, no endogenous protection system against GT exists in this
species and S. cerevisiae growth can be inhibited by exposure to GT
101213. Expression of the
A. fumigatus
gliT-mediated self-protection system in yeast has been shown to
confer GT resistance, as has deletion of GSH1, responsible for GSH
biosynthesis 1012. Thus, by enabling disulfide bridge closure, preventing the
GSH-mediated chemical reduction of exogenously-added GT to GT-(SH)2 or
facilitating GT efflux, the resistance of gliotoxin-naïve species to this
redox-active molecular species can be augmented. GT is not biosynthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s

bis thiomethyltransferase so far identified in any species, has
recently been described in A. fumigatus and it has been shown to
convert GT-(SH)2 to bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (BmGT) (Figure 1)
14. GtmA has also been contemporaneously
characterized by others, where it is referred to as TmtA 15. Interestingly, although GtmA is encoded outside the
gli cluster, its expression is induced by GT and it has been
convincingly demonstrated to dissipate GT levels thereby attenuating
gli cluster activity and concomitant GT biosynthesis 14. In effect, GtmA appears to be the
‘off-switch’ for GT biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. Although an
unidentified thiomethyltransferase has been shown to confer resistance to a
bacterial non-ribosomal peptide, holomycin, in Streptomyces
clavivulgaris
16, gtmA deletion has
effectively no impact on the sensitivity of A. fumigatus to GT

and that the production of BmGT via GtmA is primarily linked to GT biosynthesis
and regulation 14, given that the
production of BmGT will nullify GT ability to redox cycle, we hypothesized that
under certain biological conditions GtmA may be able to provide direct
protection against GT toxicity. In previous work from our group and others 101213 yeast was utilized as a
tool to explore the in vivo effects of exposure to GT.
Following cloning of gtmA under control of the constitutive
SSA2 promoter we demonstrated that gtmA is
well expressed in yeast (Figure 2A). Growth of yeast is severely impaired on
medium containing gliotoxin (8 and 16 μg/mL, respectively), but expression of
gtmA in yeast provides protection against this cytotoxicity
(Figure 2B). The level of protection provided to yeast by gtmA
is more prominent than that provided by gliT expression (Figure
2B). Additionally, the level of protection provided when both
gliT and gtmA are expressed in yeast is
comparable to gtmA expression alone, which reflects the
apparent more efficient GT detoxification of GtmA compared to GliT when
engineered in yeast. The expression of both gtmA and
gliT does not allow yeast to efficiently grow on GT
concentration above those used in this study [data not show]. Expression of the
other methyltransferases encoded within the gli-cluster,
gliM and gliN

yeast against GT toxicity (data not shown). While it has been clearly demonstrated that GliT provides the primary

present here clearly show that GT conversion to BmGT protects against
cytotoxicity and therefore appear to support the suggestion that thiomethylation
of GT is a protection mechanism, perhaps from exogenous and/or endogenously
produced GT. However, to uncover the true biological relevance of GT to BmGT
conversion we need to consider this reaction in the context of organisms that
produce GT and those that do not. Recent evidence has clearly shown that
deletion of gtmA, and hence the removal of the ability to
convert GT to BmGT, in A. fumigatus does not produce a
GT-sensitive phenotype 1415. This is due to the maintenance of a
fully functional, primary detoxification system, GliT, in a
gtmA deletion strain. Furthermore, it has recently been
demonstrated that GliT functions in conjunction with the GT-specific transporter
GliA to maintain intracellular GT at a level that is not toxic to the host cell
18. The production of BmGT in
A. fumigatus facilitates the secretion of this product in a
GliA independent manner 18. The secretion
of BmGT from fungal cells most likely occurs through a non-specific mechanism as
the molecule is efficiently secreted from yeast (this study) and from
GliA-deficient A. fumigatus
18. Thus the primary physiological
relevance of converting GT to BmGT in GT-producing organisms appears to be as a
negative regulator of GT biosynthesis, followed by secretion of the inactive
thiomethylated derivative 18. However,
the in vivo consequence of GtmA activity, and consequent BmGT
production and secretion, will depend upon whether an organism is a GT producer
or not. What is the biological significance for GT to BmGT conversion? The results we

naïve organism, such as yeast, can provide efficient protection against
exogenous GT (Figures 2, 3 and 4). The yeast genome does not encode for any GtmA
homologs and does not endogenously convert GT to BmGT (Figure 3). Previous
phylogenetic analysis identified organisms within the fungal kingdom that
possess GtmA homologs 14 and the
implications from the results of this study suggest that a GT non-producing
organism that possesses a GtmA homolog may well utilize such a protein as a
defense mechanism against GT exposure. The absence of GT production in such
organisms may suggest that from an evolutionary perspective such GtmA homologs
may have evolved to carry out other GT-independent functions in the cell and, if
they possess the ability to produce BmGT, this may not be the primary function
of the protein. Conversely, GT non-producing fungi may have retained GtmA
homologs as a means of occupying the same habitats as GT-producing fungi. Here we clearly show that engineering a GT to BmGT conversion mechanism into a GT

constitute an ancient ETP generic-defense mechanism that has allowed the
acquisition and development of the GT-producing gene cluster, or other ETP
clusters. The evolution of the primary detoxification system involving GliT and
GliA, in conjunction with the presence of GtmA, has then allowed for intricate
systems-level interactions to develop in organisms such as A.
fumigatus, as recently shown for GT biosynthesis and interplay with
the methyl/methionine cycle 18 and for
regulation of the gli-cluster itself 14. Any effect upon GT sensitivity of removing the GT to
BmGT conversion system in A. fumigatus, or any GT-producing
organism, may only become apparent when undertaken along with the concomitant
abrogation of the primary GT-protection mechanism from the organism. Support for
this hypothesis comes from the recent discovery that deletion of the
