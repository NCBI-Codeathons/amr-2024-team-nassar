Actinobacteria isolated from unstudied ecosystems are one of the most interesting and promising sources of novel biologically active compounds. Cave ecosystems are unusual and rarely studied. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of ten new actinobacteria strains isolated from an ancient underground lake and moonmilk speleothem from the biggest conglomeratic karstic cave in Siberia with a focus on the biological activity of the obtained strains and the metabolite dereplication of one active strain. Streptomyces genera isolates from moonmilk speleothem demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal activities. Some of the strains were able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic Candida albicans.

Introduction Introduction Actinobacteria species are high-GC Gram-positive bacteria well-known for their prolific secondary metabolism and as a source of valuable bioactive compounds with medical and biotechnological properties [1,2]. Approximately 55% of all antibacterial compounds come from the Streptomyces genera, and another 11% are derived from other actinobacteria [3]. Identification of new antibiotic agents is important due to the emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic resistance [4]. In this regard, the actinobacteria isolated from unusual ecosystems are one of the most interesting sources of novel biologically active compounds [5, 6].

Identification of new antibiotic agents is important due to the emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic resistance [4]. In this regard, the actinobacteria isolated from unusual ecosystems are one of the most interesting sources of novel biologically active compounds [5, 6]. Cave ecosystems are rarely studied and contain different mineral formations, permafrost and previously unknown organisms that have evolved microclimates with minor variations in temperature, humidity, air composition and other parameters over extended periods of time [7]. Whether specific substances, especially moonmilk speleothem, exist in some caves is unclear and has been discussed in previous studies [8, 9]. As described in Encyclopedia of Geobiology (2011) the moonmilk is a carbonate deposit that occurs within various subterranean systems. Moonmilk has a white to gray color and, in contrast to rigid cave deposits such as stalactites and stalagmites, exhibits a soft, muddy texture of microcrystalline aggregates. These aggregates are mainly composed of calcite, and to a lesser extent of aragonite, monohydrocalcite, hydromagnesite, sulfates, and nitrates [10].

Cave ecosystems are of great scientific interest due to the development of the macro and microorganisms, which have undergone long evolutions in stable conditions. In addition, caves contain limited materials and have little energy exchange with the environment [11–14]. Cave ecosystems are of great scientific interest due to the development of the macro and microorganisms, which have undergone long evolutions in stable conditions. In addition, caves contain limited materials and have little energy exchange with the environment [11–14]. Knowledge regarding cave microbial and especially actinobacterial diversities is very limited, despite the fact that numerous caves have been identified throughout the world [12]. The microbial diversity of karstic caves has been studied to understand the impacts of microbes on cave formation and to determine how this knowledge can be used for cave conservation [15–21].

Maciejewska and coauthors (2015) reported the isolation of the strain Streptomyces lunaelactis sp. nov. from moonmilk speleothem collected in the cave ‘Grotte des Collemboles’(Comblain-au-Pont, Belgium) [9]. Jurado and coauthors (2010) reported the isolation of 34 novel species of actinobacteria from subterranean environments [22]. These novel actinobacteria were exemplified in the descriptions of Beutenbergia cavernae, a new genus of L-lysine-containing actinobacteria, and Agromyces subbeticus, isolated from a cave in southern Spain [23–24].

We suggested that microorganisms inhabiting an isolated ecosystem of the caves, such as biggest conglomeratic karstic cave in Siberia, should preserve a high number of unstudied bacterial strains with specific metabolic pathways and secondary products. Their isolated evolution increases the expectation that secondary metabolism genes evolved separately from the general pool and elevates the likeliness to find novel biologically active compounds.

The main goal of the current research was to isolate new actinobacteria strains from atypical sources such as the water surface from an ancient underground lake and moonmilk speleothem from the Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave (Siberia) to estimate the antibiological activity with the following dereplication of secondary metabolites.

Materials and Methods Materials and Methods Cave description and sampling Cave description and sampling Cave description and sampling The Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave (55° 17′ 34.8″ N, 93° 44′ 8.52″ E) is one of the biggest conglomeratic karstic caves in the world [25]. The cave is located in the Mansk area of the Krasnoyarsk region and contains a federally ranked geomorphological natural monument (Siberian Federal Distinct, Siberia, Russia). The Mansk area is one of the most interesting karstic and speleologic areas in the region. This area contains 450 million-year-old Ordovic basal sediment conglomerates that are nearly two-kilometers thick. The Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave is unique due to its age, size and karst cavity structural features. It ranks first in the world in length cavity among karst formations encountered in these rocks. The map of the Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave is available [26]. There are approximately 20 grots connected by an extensive system of tunnels and several lakes up to 15 m deep within the cave. Thus, there are numerous lake wells, balustrades, columns, protected areas with almost transparent stalactites, stalagmites, and draperies in the cave. However, the cave has not yet been fully explored, especially by those in the microbiology and biotechnology fields. Currently, the known depth of the cave is 195 meters, amplitude 247 meters and length of the known passages 47–58 km. The age of the cave is approximately 20–25 million years, and the annual temperature is very stable and fluctuates approximately 3°C [25, 27].

The water from the underground lake and the moonmilk speleothem of split Kolokolniy from Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave were chosen as sources of actinobacteria strains. Water surface and moonmilk samples were collected by sterile syringes and spatulas in sterile tubes, respectively. Several replicates (3–5) of each sample were collected in November 2014. Then, the samples were transferred to the laboratory in thermostatic conditions (3–5°C) where they were stirred intensively in 20% sterile glycerol at a ratio of approximately 1:10 and stored at -20°C.

Actinobacteria isolation Actinobacteria isolation Actinobacteria isolation The isolation of actinobacteria strains was performed on the solid nutrient media MS (soy flour– 20 g/L; D-mannitol– 20 g/L; agar– 20 g/L; pH 7.2) and agarised DNPM (DNPMA) (soytone– 7.5 g/L; baker yeast– 5 g/L; MOPS– 21 g/L; dextrin—40 g/L; agar– 20 g/L; pH 6.8)) supplemented with the antibiotics cycloheximide (50 μg/mL) and phosphomycin (100 μg/mL) [28]. At the same time, sample aliquots were preheated for 5 minutes at 50°C to activate the spores. All samples were diluted in a 1% sterile saline solution at 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 ratios, and the dilutions were plated on the MS and DNPMA media in 3 replicates. Plates were incubated for 30 days at 28°C and checked every 24 hours for actinobacterial colony appearance. Actinobacteria-like strains were identified based on colony morphology [28]. Colonies were transferred from the primary plates onto new MS media. An attempt was made to obtain pure cultures of all colonies observed on the primary plates. Active and rare strains were deposited in the Russian Collection of Agricultural Microorganisms (RCAM), St. Petersburg. Information about the strain deposition is available at www.arriam.spb.ru.

Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out with the following primers: 8F (AGA GTT TGA TYM TGG CTC AG) and 1510R (TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T). The obtained fragments were gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and sequenced with the amplification primers 8F and 1510R to generate a nearly complete gene sequence (1351~1396 bp). The forward and reverse sequences were assembled with SeqMan DNAStar software (Lasergen, Houston, USA). 39 sequences were multiple-aligned using MAFFT v7.017 (algorithm: auto, gap open penalty: 1.53, offset value: 0.123).

The medical properties of moonmilk speleothem have been described in medical treatises. It is known that moonmilk was used to heal bone fracture and chancre. Thus, moonmilk was used as a drug for diarrhea and dysentery. In veterinary medicine, moonmilk was used as a drug for cows with reduced lactation [43]. However, the definite effects of the drug as well as the geochemical composition of moonmilk and antibiotic compounds produced by actinobacteria remain unknown [25].

However, the definite effects of the drug as well as the geochemical composition of moonmilk and antibiotic compounds produced by actinobacteria remain unknown [25]. As a result, we have isolated ten actinobacteria strains from the moonmilk speleothem and an underground lake located in one of the biggest conglomeratic karstic caves in the world. Streptomyces genera isolates from moonmilk speleothem demonstrated antibacterial and fungicidal activities. Several fractions of the strain Streptomyces sp. IB 2014/I/78-8 and crude extract of Streptomyces sp. IB 2014 /I/78-3 were able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic C. albicans. These strains represent a particular interest for enlarged investigation, including isolation and characterization of pure active compounds and study of their biosynthesis. In conclusion, we can postulate that the majority of secondary metabolites, including antibacterial and fungicidal compounds synthesized by the isolated strains are not described in the huge available database “Dictionary of Natural products” (CRC-press), which includes more than 272 thousands compounds. This fact confirms that the chosen strategy for isolation of new actinobacteria from these unique ecological niches, such as formations of ancient and isolated caves’ ecosystems could be successful and effective to found new biologically active compounds.
