The crystal structure of DynF was determined to a resolution of 1.50 Å, revealing a dimeric eight-stranded β-barrel structure with palmitic acid bound in the interior. Dynemicin is an enediyne natural product from Micromonospora chersina ATCC53710. Access to the biosynthetic gene cluster of dynemicin has enabled the in vitro study of gene products within the cluster to decipher their roles in assembling this unique molecule. This paper reports the crystal structure of DynF, the gene product of one of the genes within the biosynthetic gene cluster of dynemicin. DynF is revealed to be a dimeric eight-stranded β-barrel structure with palmitic acid bound within a cavity. The presence of palmitic acid suggests that DynF may be involved in binding the precursor polyene heptaene, which is central to the synthesis of the ten-membered ring of the enediyne core. Introduction Introduction Dynemicin A is an anthraquinone-fused ten-membered enediyne and a metabolite of Micromonospora chersina ATCC53710. Like many other enediynes, dynemicin has a novel molecular architecture, a notable mode of action and potent cytotoxicity (Thorson et al., 2000 ▸; Van Lanen & Shen, 2008 ▸). Dynemicin comprises an enediyne core, which is common to all enediynes, and peripheral moieties (Fig. 1 ▸), which give the enediynes structural diversity. The main ring of the dynemicin core contains two acetylenic groups conjugated to a double bond in a ten-membered carbocyle. The enediyne core structural unit (termed the warhead) is central to the fundamental mechanism of action. The anthraquinone group on the peripheral moeity of dynemicin intercalates into the minor groove of DNA to confer binding specificity (Sugiura et al., 1990 ▸).

The main ring of the dynemicin core contains two acetylenic groups conjugated to a double bond in a ten-membered carbocyle. The enediyne core structural unit (termed the warhead) is central to the fundamental mechanism of action. The anthraquinone group on the peripheral moeity of dynemicin intercalates into the minor groove of DNA to confer binding specificity (Sugiura et al., 1990 ▸). In the presence of NADPH or thiol, the quinone is reduced to hydroquinone, leading to opening of the epoxide (Avendaño & Menéndez, 2015 ▸), which triggers the activation of the enediyne core. Dynemicin then undergoes a Bergman cycloaromatization to form a reactive 1,4-dehydrobenzene bi­radical that is capable of abstracting H atoms from the DNA backbone, causing single- or double-stranded DNA scission. The high reactivity of enediynes with DNA makes them quite toxic. In natural environments, some microorganisms producing enediynes protect themselves from their cytotoxic action by a self-resistance mechanism that uses a self-sacrificing protein (Biggins et al., 2003 ▸; Elshahawi et al., 2014 ▸) or specialized ABC transporters to export the toxin (Beis & Rebuffat, 2019 ▸). In cancer therapy, the toxicity of enediynes has been exploited by conjugating the molecules to tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies in polymer-assisted delivery systems to prevent premature cytotoxic effects on other important cells in the body (Abe & Otsuki, 2002 ▸; Shah, 2017 ▸).

Dynemicin can be produced by organic synthesis or in M. chersina. The total chemical synthesis of enediynes is challenging, but has been achieved for dynemicin (Nicolaou et al., 1991 ▸, 1993 ▸; Shair et al., 1996 ▸; Myers et al., 1995 ▸). The cloning, sequencing and identification of the biosynthetic gene clusters of dynemicin has paved the way for in vitro studies of these biosynthetic enzymes (Gao & Thorson, 2008 ▸). The putative biosynthesis of dynemicin is correspondingly complex: the M. chersina whole genome sequence analysis revealed 60 open reading frames (ORFs) within the biosynthetic gene cluster related to dynemicin production. Using homology to other characterized genomes, these genes have been annotated to suggest functions such as biosynthesis of the enediyne core, maturation and regulation, while there are also those with as yet unknown functions (Gao & Thorson, 2008 ▸). The gene cluster contains a common iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKSE) that is essential for the biosynthesis of a precursor polyene (heptaene) which, in the presence of other accessory enzymes, forms the ten-membered enediyne core of dynemicin (Liu et al., 2003 ▸). Evidence has accumulated that the PKSE product is also the precursor of the anthraquinone, and the biosynthesis of this moiety proceeds through a δ-thiolactone iodoanthracene intermediate (Cohen & Townsend, 2018 ▸). While some insight into the conversion of the iodo­anthracene to the anthraquinone has recently been reported upon examination of the biosynthesis of sungeidines (Ma et al., 2021 ▸), which, like dynemicin, are anthraquinone-fused ten-membered enediynes, the steps leading to the iodoanthracene in addition to the enediyne core remain mostly unknown.

This study targets one of several proteins of unknown function encoded by a gene within the biosynthetic gene cluster of dynemicin, herein named DynF. The gene encoding DynF was originally annotated orf15 (Gao & Thorson, 2008 ▸) and was deposited as ORF18 with unknown function (GenBank accession No. ACB47058.1). The DynF ortholog Sgd15 was very recently demonstrated by gene inactivation to be essential for sungeidine biosynthesis, and no intermediates, including the iodoanthracene, were detected (Ma et al., 2021 ▸), suggesting that DynF and Sgd15 are involved in the early steps of processing the PKSE product to either the enediyne core or iodoanthracene, or potentially both. Here, we report the structural characterization of DynF using X-ray crystallo­graphy as an initial step towards deciphering its role in the biosynthesis of this unique anthraquinone-fused enediyne.

Ligand determination using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) Ligand determination using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) Ligand determination using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) Acetonitrile (0.5 ml) was added to 0.5 ml purified DynF protein (40 mg ml−1) and rotated at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged using a protein concentrator (3000 molecular-weight cutoff; Millipore, Cork, Ireland) at 4000 rev min−1 for 20 min, and the acetonitrile extract (100 µl) was filtered to remove any remaining insoluble debris. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890 GC with a 30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 mm HP-5ms UI capillary column and an Agilent G7081B MSD. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The temperatures of the injector, the interface and the liner were 523 K. Injections of 5 µl were performed in splitless mode. The column temperature was initially 343 K and was held for 2 min, increased to 513 K at 277 K min−1 and run for a total run time of 59.5 min. For GC–MS detection, an electron-impact ionization system was used. The mass range was set to 50–500 m/z with a filament delay of 4 min. The sample-injection volume was 1 µl.

Co-expression of DynF with SgcE and DynE7 Co-expression of DynF with SgcE and DynE7 Co-expression of DynF with SgcE and DynE7 The genes encoding the C-1027 polyketide synthase SgcE and dynemicin thioesterase DynE7 were cloned into pETDuet using standard procedures. The gene encoding DynF was cloned into pDB.His.MBP. All genes were sequenced to confirm their identity. Both pETDuet and pDB.His.MBP plasmids with the respective genes were co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The transformed cells were plated on LB agar supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml−1 carbenicillin. After overnight incubation at 310 K, a single colony was used to inoculate 5 ml LB medium supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml−1 carbenicillin. Incubation was performed overnight at 310 K with shaking at 250 rev min−1. The culture (0.5 ml) was transferred into 50 ml fresh LB supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml−1 carbenicillin and incubated at 291 K and 250 rev min−1. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6, expression was induced with sterile IPTG solution (final concentration 0.1 mM) and incubated at 291 K and 250 rev min−1 for an additional 36 h. The cells were centrifuged at 4000 rev min−1 at 277 K for 30 min, and the wet pellet was washed once with 30 ml phosphate buffer pH 7.2. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and sonicated for 2 min with 10 s pulse on and 50 s pulse off (with 40% amplitude) on ice. The lysate was purified using nickel resin and then with amylose resin to purify the MBP-tagged DynF. The sample was extracted with acetonitrile and analyzed by GC-MS as described above.

Results and discussion Results and discussion The structure of DynF was determined to a resolution of 1.50 Å with a final R
work and R
free of 0.16 and 0.19, respectively. The DynF crystal has two molecules in its asymmetric unit (Fig. 3 ▸
a). An analysis of the crystal contacts with PISA (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007 ▸) predicts that DynF forms a stable dimer. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that DynF could exist in a higher oligomeric state in solution (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that DynF could exist in a higher oligomeric state in solution (Supplementary Fig. S1). DynF is comprised of antiparallel β-sheets that are connected by short loops and helical segments to form eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrels (Supplementary Fig. S2). The β-strands of the DynF structure are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4a/4b, 5a/5b, 6a/6b, 7a/7b and 8. Two short helical segments connect β-strands 2/3 and 5b/6a. The topology of DynF shows that each strand is directly linked to its neighbor, which is typical of most topologies of eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrels (Fig. 3 ▸
b) such as outer membrane proteins, avidins, fatty-acid binding proteins and lysozyme inhibitors (Geerds et al., 2014 ▸). Deviating from a canonical eight-stranded, up–down β-barrel (Lalonde et al., 1994 ▸), we observed short loops inserted within strands 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Figs. 3 ▸
a and 3 ▸
b). Some of the loop residues within strands 6 and 7 are located at the dimer interface and thus may be involved in stabilization of the dimer (Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

Comparative analysis of protein structures can help to decipher their functions. The DynF structure was compared with other structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the DALI server (Holm, 2020 ▸). DynF did not have significant structural similarities to previous structures (Z-score of <10; structural identity of <15%; Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that DynF represents a novel fold, thus lacking precedents for providing a known mechanism.

The electron-density map of DynF revealed an elongated ligand embedded within the β-barrel (Fig. 3 ▸
c). The size and shape of the ligand, as well as its binding environment, are suggestive of a 16-carbon fatty acid, which was confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as palmitic acid (Supplementary Fig. S5). Palmitic acid is the most abundant fatty acid expressed in E. coli cells (Cronan & Thomas, 2009 ▸). We hypothesize that the ligand co-purified with the protein. The surface representation of DynF in PyMOL reveals that the binding cavity of the ligand is closed and may thus require the channel within the ligand-binding site to open and close in order to allow the ligand to enter and exit.

The hydrophobicity of the side chains of the residues in the ligand-binding cavity (Fig. 3 ▸
d) and the presence of palmitic acid suggest that DynF may be involved in the binding or processing of the PKSE product or an early biosynthetic intermediate, which is consistent with the results from the inactivation of sgd15 (Ma et al., 2021 ▸). A linear conjugated heptaene has previously been observed upon heterologous co-expression of the genes encoding PKSE and a type II thioesterase in E. coli (Annaval et al., 2017 ▸; Smanski et al., 2011 ▸), and was hypothesized to potentially serve as the DynF ligand or substrate. To test this, DynF was co-expressed with a C-1027 polyketide synthase, SgcE, and a dynemicin thio­estarase, DynE7. However, GC-MS analysis of the ligand following purification of DynF after co-expression of the three genes gave an identical profile predominantly containing palmitic acid. Thus, the role of DynF has not directly been confirmed. Nonetheless, the structural data now provide insight into its potential role in binding the precursor polyene and provide an opportunity to further explore this role via in vitro assays.
