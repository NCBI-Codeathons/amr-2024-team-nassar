 Berberine bridge
enzyme-like oxidases are often involved in natural
product biosynthesis and are seen as essential enzymes for the generation
of intricate pharmacophores. These oxidases have the ability to transfer
a hydride atom to the FAD cofactor, which enables complex substrate
modifications and rearrangements including (intramolecular) cyclizations,
carbon–carbon bond formations, and nucleophilic additions.
Despite the diverse range of activities, the mechanistic details of
these reactions often remain incompletely understood. In this Review,
we delve into the complexity that BBE-like oxidases from bacteria,
fungal, and plant origins exhibit by providing an overview of the
shared catalytic features and emphasizing the different reactivities.
We propose four generalized modes of action by which BBE-like oxidases
enable the synthesis of natural products, ranging from the classic
alcohol oxidation reactions to less common amine and amide oxidation
reactions. Exploring the mechanisms utilized by nature to produce
its vast array of natural products is a subject of considerable interest
and can lead to the discovery of unique biochemical activities. Special Issue Published as part of Biochemistryvirtual special issue “A Tribute to Christopher
T. Walsh”. Natural products exhibit astonishing
structural diversity and this molecular variety results in a vast
array of biological activities.1 Nevertheless,
secondary metabolites generally originate from a small number of starting
components, which are obtained from primary metabolic pathways. Next
to core biosynthetic enzymes, tailoring enzymes are required to enhance
the complexity of natural products.2−5 There are a multitude of biocatalysts involved
in the modification of the metabolite precursors including oxidoreductases,
halogenases, (acyl-, glycosyl-)transferases and ligases.6 In particular, oxidoreductases are intriguing
since complex biochemical
transformations often require changes in redox states.7,8 Therefore, oxidoreductases are essential players in the complex
pathways that lead to the synthesis of secondary metabolites in different
organisms. Oxidation reactions such as dehydrogenation, epoxidation
and hydroxylation are typical redox reactions in natural product biosynthesis.9 Flavin-dependent oxidoreductases are able to
perform these transformations and are therefore commonly observed
in secondary metabolic pathways. This Review focuses on flavin-dependent
oxidases from the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase/p-cresol
methylhydroxylase (VAO/PCMH) family.10 We
will specifically cover the berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) subfamily
since they are often involved in natural product biosynthesis and
seen as essential enzymes for the generation of intricate pharmacophores.11−13 VAO/PCMH
Flavoprotein Family VAO/PCMH
Flavoprotein Family Based on structural data
and sequence homology there are six different families of flavin-dependent
oxidases.14 One of these six families is
the VAO/PCMH flavoprotein family, named after the fungal vanillyl-alcohol
oxidase and bacterial p-cresol methylhydroxylase,
feature a distinct flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain
in the N-terminal portion of the protein.12,15 This conserved domain allows for the binding of the adenosine diphosphate
and ribityl functional groups of FAD. Except for the flavin-binding
domain, VAO-type enzymes contain a substrate-binding domain (cap domain)
with greater variability positioned above the isoalloxazine ring of
the cofactor. This structural arrangement enables significant diversity
in the active site structures and, consequently, in the catalytic
activities of these enzymes.11 Based on structural data

crystal structure of VAO was the first to show FAD covalently linked
to the protein via an 8α-N3-histidyl–FAD
linkage.16−18 In the last few decades, many more members of the
VAO family have been identified and shown to contain a covalently
tethered flavin cofactor.12 Intriguingly,
a significant number of them even had the flavin cofactor bicovalently
bound to the protein, such as glucooligosaccharide oxidase (GOOX).19,20 Bicovalently tethering of the FAD enables flavoproteins to have
a rather open active site thereby allowing them to accept larger substrates
such as secondary metabolites but also oligosaccharides.21−23 Another effect of covalently binding FAD is the increase in flavin
redox potential, which is highest for bicovalently bound flavoproteins.24 Increasing the redox potential enhances the
oxidative power of the flavin cofactor making them particularly adept
at catalyzing demanding oxidation reactions. The

typically contain FAD, and sometimes flavin
mononucleotide (FMN), as prosthetic group for mediating redox reactions.9 Reactions are catalyzed in a two-step manner,
consisting of a reductive and oxidative half reaction (Scheme 1).25 In the former half, the substrate is oxidized while the flavin is
being reduced by hydride attack on the N5-atom. In the subsequent
oxidative half reaction, the reduced flavin (Flred) returns
to its oxidized state (Flox) as the cosubstrate molecular
oxygen (O2) gets reduced. The first step in the oxidative
half reaction is the single electron transfer of Flred to
O2 producing a flavin semiquinone and superoxide species
that can be covalently tethered yielding the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin
species (Fl4aOOH).26 This species
can then undergo multiple dissociation pathways, leading to different
reactivities, making flavins very versatile organic cofactors. Oxidases
typically use elimination and proton transfer to release hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) and thereby regenerate Flox. The elevated redox potential of (bi)covalently bound flavoprotein
oxidases causes O2 to be one of the few electron acceptors
that they can employ. Hence, in order to regenerate the reduced cofactor,
oxidases use O2 as an electron acceptor by definition,
effectively rendering the reaction irreversible. Flavoprotein oxidases

flavoprotein family, there are 11 different subfamilies out of which
one has members involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in both
plants and microorganisms.23 These are
named BBE-like enzymes and constitute a sizable portion of the VAO-fold
oxidoreductase family. Apart from the common FAD- and substrate-binding
domains, they have a distinct structural characteristic near the FAD-binding
site which serves as a distinguishing feature of the BBE subfamily
(Figure 1a).27 This structural characteristic has been annotated
as a domain (pfam entry PF08031) and contains a special C-terminus
with Y/FxN motif that, in the case of a Tyr, creates a specific hydrogen
bonding network proximal to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and conserved
Asn residue (Figure 1b). This motif helps shape the O2 binding pocket and affects
the positioning of the ribityl moiety of FAD.28 Within the VAO/PCMH

known as
the berberine bridge enzyme (BBE), from the plant Eschscholzia
californica is the name-bearer for this subfamily and catalyzes
the conversion of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine by mediating an oxidative ring closure reaction (Scheme 2). This reaction
is proposed to occur through a stepwise oxidation of the N-methyl group to the iminium ion followed by a Friedel–Crafts

by BBE-like Oxidases Unconventional Oxidation Reactions Catalyzed
by BBE-like Oxidases Even though BBE-like oxidases are named
as such, they are functionally
very different from the original name-bearer of this subfamily. They
are capable of catalyzing a wide range of different reactions not
only limited to the berberine bridge formation but also seen as essential
enzymes for the generation of a plethora of intricate pharmacophores.
A common trait among these unconventional oxidases is their capacity
to generate novel C–C, C–O, or C–N bonds.35,37−40 These BBE-like oxidases promote the rearrangement of the molecular
skeleton by catalyzing carbon-heteroatom and carbon–carbon
bond oxidations. Oxidation can lead to the formation of new intramolecular
bonds or prime the substrate to undergo hydration or dimerization
reactions. These redox reactions have been of widespread interest
in the field of synthetic electrochemisty41−43 and here we
show the clever ways that nature utilizes BBEs to accomplish such
challenging transformations. Even though BBE-like oxidases perform
diverse activities, the exact mechanistic functioning of the enzymes
performing the reactions is not always known. In this Review, we will
go over multiple examples of experimentally validated BBE-like oxidoreductases

oxidases enable the synthesis of intricate natural products. In Scheme 3 an example reaction
is given for each reaction type that BBE-like oxidases utilize in
natural product biosynthesis. The first reaction type is classical
alcohol oxidation, where hydride transfer occurs at the α-carbon
atom. The example shown in Scheme 3a illustrates a simple alcohol oxidation causing the
dienophile to become sufficiently electron deficient and therefore
allowing a [4 + 2] cycloaddition.44 The
second example is the deprotonation of a phenol-derivative which promotes
the hydride transfer at a distant carbon atom (Scheme 3b).45 This is
similar to the benzylic oxidation reaction catalyzed by the classic
VAO, with the only difference being the ortho-orientation
of the hydroxy group compared to the usual para-orientation.
Hydride transfer is achieved via the generation of an ortho-quinone methide (ο-QM) intermediate, that can then undergo
different reactions such as the [4 + 2] cycloaddition leading to THCA.
This ο-QM intermediate is observed in many BBE-like oxidases
some of which have already been discussed by Purdy et al.46 The third example is the oxidation of a carbon–nitrogen
bond, leading to hydride transfer from the α-carbon atom and
thereby generating a transient imine or iminium cation that can undergo
derivatization similar to the berberine bridge enzyme (Scheme 3c).47 The last example reaction is the hydride transfer from monoterpene
indole alkaloids (Scheme 3d).48 The generated intermediate,
stabilized via delocalized electrons from the indole N-atom, can undergo a multitude of derivatizations, including intramolecular
cyclization but also water addition with concomitant oxidative cyclization.
A phylogenetic tree was made but did not reveal clustering of the
BBE-like enzymes into separate clades according to their function.
The different activities might have evolved independently over time
and other factors such as the enzyme’s origin and the type
of natural product produced could be a reason for this. Below we highlight four generalized modes of action by which BBE-like

a substantial fungal natural product class encompassing over 100 derivatives
characterized by intricate three-dimensional architectures and a wide
spectrum of significant pharmacological activities.57 Sorbicillinoids are categorized into monomeric, dimeric,
trimeric, and hybrid groups based on shared structural features. The
biosynthetic pathway toward sorbicillinoids involves the collaboration
of a highly reducing iterative polyketide synthase (hrPKS, SorA) and
a nonreducing iterative polyketide synthase (nrPKS, SorB) to establish
the core backbone of sorbicillin. Subsequently, an NAD(P)H-dependent
flavoprotein monooxygenase SorC catalyzes the oxidative dearomatization
to yield sorbicillinol. The last enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway
is BBE-like oxidase SorD that has been shown to play a crucial role
in the polymerization and oxygenation of sorbicillinol.36,58,59 Recently, SorD from Acremonium
chrysogenum was heterologously expressed in Aspergillus
nidulans to analyze its exact function.56 Sorbicillinol undergoes spontaneous hydration, as it is
a highly reactive α,β-unsaturated ketone generating the
hydrated sorbicillinol intermediate (Scheme 5). Subsequently, SorD oxidizes this intermediate
to the corresponding oxosorbicillinol. Oxosorbicillinol can then spontaneously
react with sorbicillinol to form the cage-like acresorbicillinol C
by a Michael-addition reaction. Another more recent example is a BBE-like oxidase involved

react with sorbicillinol to form the cage-like acresorbicillinol C
by a Michael-addition reaction. Another more recent example is a BBE-like oxidase involved
in sorbicillinoid
biosynthesis.56 Sorbicillinoids represent
a substantial fungal natural product class encompassing over 100 derivatives
characterized by intricate three-dimensional architectures and a wide
spectrum of significant pharmacological activities.57 Sorbicillinoids are categorized into monomeric, dimeric,
trimeric, and hybrid groups based on shared structural features. The
biosynthetic pathway toward sorbicillinoids involves the collaboration
of a highly reducing iterative polyketide synthase (hrPKS, SorA) and
a nonreducing iterative polyketide synthase (nrPKS, SorB) to establish
the core backbone of sorbicillin. Subsequently, an NAD(P)H-dependent
flavoprotein monooxygenase SorC catalyzes the oxidative dearomatization
to yield sorbicillinol. The last enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway
is BBE-like oxidase SorD that has been shown to play a crucial role
in the polymerization and oxygenation of sorbicillinol.36,58,59 Recently, SorD from Acremonium
chrysogenum was heterologously expressed in Aspergillus
nidulans to analyze its exact function.56 Sorbicillinol undergoes spontaneous hydration, as it is
a highly reactive α,β-unsaturated ketone generating the
hydrated sorbicillinol intermediate (Scheme 5). Subsequently, SorD oxidizes this intermediate
to the corresponding oxosorbicillinol. Oxosorbicillinol can then spontaneously
react with sorbicillinol to form the cage-like acresorbicillinol C
by a Michael-addition reaction. Scheme 5(a) The NAD(P)H-Dependent Flavoprotein

AsmF was shown to be responsible for the oxidation of C23-OH of the
nascent polyketide synthase product 1 to yield ketone

to a Diels–Alder reaction forming compound 3.37 Knocking asmF out from the

led to an increase in novel ansaseomycin derivatives. Indeed, when
the hydroxyl group was not modified by AsmF, the substrate could undergo
spontaneous dehydration, forming 4, a common precursor
for other deoxy-naphthalenic compounds. This observation implies that
nature has developed a specific approach for incorporating the hydroxyl
naphthalenic moiety in ansamycin natural products. Ultimately, the

Derivatization AnuG was identified
in the silent biosynthetic gene cluster involved
in the oxidative lactonization forming the polyketide annullatin D.61 Via overexpression in A. nidulans, it was shown to synthesize the five-membered lactone ring via the
oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of the alkylated salicylaldehyde
precursor (Scheme 7). It is postulated that the hydroxymethyl functional group undergoes
a double oxidation to the acid.61 The first
oxidation creates an aldehyde that, after the addition of water, forms
a hydrate that can be oxidized to the acid. This is followed by spontaneous
lactonization with the other hydroxyl group. A homologous BGC can
be found in Aspergillus ruber, Neurosporin
crassa and Trichoderma virens, where the
AnuG orthologs correspond to FogF, SrdI and VirF with sequence identities
of 27–28%.62−64 These oxidases are thought to be involved in the
oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group to the aldehyde of a flavoglaucin
congener, but they do not lead to the formation of five-membered lactones.
This is because the flavoglaucin congener substrate lacks the hydroxyl
group needed for intramolecular ring-closure. The cytochrome P450
monooxygenase (CYP) responsible for installing this hydroxyl group
is not present in the BGC of N. crassa, and in A. ruber, the respective CYP hydroxylates the aromatic ring
instead of the side chain. In T. virens, the CYP

cyanogriseus WH1–2216–6 is noteworthy as it
does not partake in the biosynthesis of the nonribosomal peptide-polyketide
hybrid secondary metabolite caerulomycin A itself.69,70 This bicovalently FAD-bound oxidase named CrmK can recycle products
back to the main biosynthetic pathway via a double oxidation reaction
of an alcohol to a carboxylate via an aldehyde (Scheme 9). The on-pathway carboxylate substrate CRM
O is transformed into the corresponding aldehyde intermediate CRM
M using the dehydrogenase pair CrmN/CrmO. This aldehyde substrate
is then stepwise converted to the Z- and E-configured aldoxime CRM H by the two-component monooxygenase
CrmH. The unstable Z-CRM H, however, can spontaneously
go back to the aldehyde CRMN M by a deoximation reaction. This would
lead to an accumulation of the aldehyde intermediate. Since aldehydes
are known for being reactive electrophiles, they are often detoxified
by the cell enzymatically or spontaneously. In the cell, the aldehyde
CRM M can spontaneously reduce to the corresponding alcohol CRM P
in an inadvertent side reaction to potentially avoid buildup of the
aldehyde intermediate. However, CrmK can shunt it back to the aldehyde
and, after hydrate formation with water, also oxidize it to the carboxylate
CRM O although with lower efficiency. Intriguingly, CrmK enables the
possibility of a salvage pathway, which is rarely seen in secondary
metabolism and perhaps more unassigned genes in BGC could have this

lusitanus.81 Grincamycin (GCN)
has a tetragomycin skeleton containing a di- and trisaccharide substituent
both with a terminal L-rhodinose moiety. Interestingly, in

in tandem without forming the intermediate L-cinerulose A (Scheme 13), differently
to what has been observed in aclacinomycin biosynthesis.79 Moreover, GcnQ has divergent roles when it is
expressed in different hosts. In S. lusitanus SCSIO

for the coupling of two nahpthol derivatives, requiring a laccase-like
multicopper oxidase ElcG.103 The same was
observed in Cercospora nicotianae, where the ElcG
homologue, CTB12, was deleted thereby completely abolishing cercosporin
production.104 By heterologous biosynthesis,
it was demonstrated that both ElcE and ElcG are needed for the double
coupling step, yielding the pentacyclic perylenequinone (Scheme 21). As laccases
are known for catalyzing radical coupling reactions,3 it was suggested that ElcG catalyzes the first coupling
via a phenol radical coupling mechanism. Thereafter, ElcE would catalyze
the second carbon–carbon bond formation initiated by phenolic
hydroxyl deprotonation and a concomitant or subsequent distant hydride

the C2 of l-ascorbic acid (or its oxidative product dehydroascorbic

the reactive iminium intermediate. H2O may act as the nucleophile,
potentially activated by two Tyr active site residues, to attack the
imine and install the hydroxy-group in NDM. It was illustrated that
NapU can also mediate the subsequent two-electron oxidation, yielding

substrate fumiquinazoline A (FQA) for
C–O and C–N intramolecular cyclization. Specifically,
amide oxidation leads to a transient imine, which is captured by the
−OH group of the imidiazoindolone side chain, producing the
spirohemiaminal FQC (Scheme 28).47 Slow equilibration ultimately
forms the aminal FQD as a more thermodynamically stable product. The
absence of the lone-pair stabilization for the amide might seem to
make hydride abstraction of the α-carbon challenging, but it
is speculated that the extended delocalized system of the FQ scaffold
manages to stabilize the cation to allow for hydride abstraction.

the hydride transfer to occur at the benzylic C10 atom assisted via

the other BBE-like oxidation mechanisms discussed so far, we propose
that the hydride transfer is enabled by the electron donating effect
of the N1 atom through the indole ring to the C10 atom (Scheme 29). This ultimately
allows the hydride to be transferred to the N5 atom of FAD. Such a

named MaDA,33,137 already briefly mentioned during
the biosynthesis of morachalcone A in mulberry plants (Scheme 18b). After oxidation of the
isoprenyl moiety of moracin C by the BBE-like oxidase MaMO, MaDA enables
a [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction making it the first stand-alone intermolecular
Diels–Alderase. Multiple controls were performed to understand
the role of the FAD cofactor in MaDa, including mutagenesis of the
His116 residue that is critical for covalent FAD attachment and cofactor
reduction using sodium dithionite. This mutation rendered MaDA almost
inactive, thereby exemplifying that the (oxidized) FAD cofactor is
necessary for the endo [4 + 2] cycloaddition. Moreover,
homologous Diels–Alderases were discovered that could catalyze
the same intermolecular Diels–Alder reaction with exo-selectivity.138 Mutagenesis studies demonstrated
key residues involved in activating the dienophile through hydrogen
bonding interactions and positioning the diene via π–π
interactions for endo-selectivity. While for opposite
selectivity a crucial arginine residue forms a cation−π
interaction with the dienophile, which lowers the free energy barrier
for the exo-pathway and thereby regulates selectivity.
The evolutionary origin of MaDA and MaMO was also investigated and
suggested their Diels–Alderase and oxidative dehydrogenation
activity to have originated from a gene duplication and subsequent
neofunctionalization of an oxidocyclase.139 Nevertheless, the exact function of the FAD cofactor in MaDA remains

a stereoselective aldol reaction to form a bridged tricyclo[6.2.2.02,7]dodecane scaffold (Scheme 34). The intramolecular aldol reaction is hypothesized to proceed
via the standard base-catalyzed aldol reaction that is nonoxidative.
SthB allows for a proton abstraction thereby producing the nucleophilic
enolate that attacks the C1-carbonyl on the decalin ring, forming
stemphyloxin II. No hydride is being transferred to the N5 atom of
the FAD and the role (if any) of the cofactor in SthB has remained
unexplored, pending additional biochemical characterization.142 Scheme 34Stereoselective Aldol Reaction Synthesizing

AspoA, which is involved
in the biosynthesis of cytochalasans, fungal polyketide-nonribosomal
peptides with antibiotic properties (PK-NRPs).143,144 Interestingly, this flavoenzyme from Aspergillus flavipes does not perform a dehydrogenation reaction but acts as general
acid biocatalyst to catalyze double bond isomerization (Scheme 35). Addition of
FAD did not increase activity, and deletion of His158, which covalently
tethers the cofactor, did not decrease activity. A site-directed mutagenesis
study was performed to identify the crucial residues and showed that
Glu538 was highly conserved as mutagenesis caused a halt in activity.
Isotope labeling studies confirmed that the double bond isomerization
proceeds via protonation of the C21 carbonyl group, a hydride shift,
and a keto–enol tautomerization. AspoA homologues such as ffsJ
(85% seq. id.) from A. flavipes(145) and PhmC (60% seq. id.) from P. nodorum(146) might potentially perform similar
reactions as they both harbor the conserved glutamate residue. Another peculiar BBE-like oxidase is called

Isomerization Reaction A distinctive flavoenzyme named PylE was recently found in the
biosynthetic gene cluster of Setosphaeria sp. SCSIO41009,
responsible for the synthesis of pyrenophorol dilactones.147 Similar to AspoA (30% seq id), this flavoprotein
also catalyzes an isomerization reaction.143 In this case, PylE catalyzes the isomerization of the 4-alcohol-2,3-unsaturated
moiety of pyrenophorol, producing a 1,4-diketone. Two mechanisms were
hypothesized for the isomerization reaction (Scheme 36). In the first mechanism, it was proposed
that oxidation of the C4 hydroxyl occurs first, after which a hydride
is transferred from FAD to C3 to create the enol intermediate. Tautomerization
then leads to the first ketone product. Another isomerization round
would then yield the final 1,4-diketone product. The second mechanism
goes via initial protonation of the C1 carbonyl, after which the C4
proton is abstracted to form the enol intermediate. Tautomerization
and subsequent isomerization of this intermediate create the 1,4-diketone
product. Mutagenesis studies proved acid–base residue Glu526
to be a crucial residue for catalytic activity. With the help of docking,
the authors showed this residue to be in the vicinity of the C1 carbonyl
group and therefore could function as a general acid and base in route
b. In contrast to AspoA, mutating the conserved His153 necessary for
covalent tethering of the FAD cofactor abolished PylE’s activity.
This would suggest its involvement in isomerase activity, but a complete
mechanistic study is yet to be performed. A distinctive flavoenzyme named PylE was recently found in the

reactions were commonly thought to
be catalyzed by FAD-dependent monooxygenases using the Fl4aOOH species.9 Nevertheless, in 2013, the
BBE-like enzyme named EncM was shown to feature a different oxygenating
species termed as the flavin-N5-oxide (FlN5O).148,149 This oxygenase is part of a BGC in Streptomyces maritimus, forming enterocin, an unusual polyketide antibiotic. The FlN5O species triggers a Favorskii rearrangement by simultaneous
hydroxylation and dehydrogenation (Scheme 37), reminiscent of the postredox cyclization
reactions such as Sol5.35,55 So far, EncM has been
the only enzyme employing the flavin-N5-oxide intermediate for catalysis
within the BBE-like subfamily of oxidoreductases. Nevertheless, this
exception sparked the investigation on the versatility of the N5 position
and expanded the repertoire of known flavin catalyzed reactions.150 For a long time, oxygenation

oxidase/p-cresol methyl hydroxylase flavoprotein
family are fascinating
enzymes exhibiting extraordinary chemical activities. The ability
to transfer a hydride atom to the FAD cofactor enables complex substrate
modifications and rearrangements, including intramolecular cyclizations,
Diels–Alder reactions, Michael additions, and hydroxylations.
This leads to a structurally and functionally diverse number of natural
products in bacteria, plants, and fungi. A mechanistically recurrent
theme of most of these enzymes is the ability to elicit molecular
skeleton rearrangements triggered by an initial oxidation step through
hydride transfer to the FAD. However, there are also cases in which
the exact involvement of the FAD cofactor still remains unknown or
in which the FAD cofactor utilizes a different oxygenating species.
There is a plethora of uncharacterized BBE-like enzymes, and genomic
context is needed to predict their functions. Understanding the natural
mechanisms that are employed to generate the incredible diversity
of natural products is a topic of great interest in biochemistry for
its fundamental implications in the field. Hence, the study and characterization
of these new enzymes will allow us to uncover more unique biochemical
activities. The BBE-like oxidases from the vanillyl-alcohol
