["", "Calicheamicin \u03b31I (1)\nis an enediyne antitumor compound produced by Micromonospora\nechinospora spp. calichensis, and its biosynthetic gene cluster\nhas been previously reported. Despite extensive analysis and biochemical\nstudy, several genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 remain functionally unassigned. Using a structural genomics approach\nand biochemical characterization, two proteins encoded by genes from\nthe 1 biosynthetic gene cluster assigned as \u201cunknowns\u201d,\nCalU16 and CalU19, were characterized. Structure analysis revealed\nthat they possess the STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein related\nlipid Transfer (START) domain known mainly to bind and transport lipids\nand previously identified as the structural signature of the enediyne\nself-resistance protein CalC. Subsequent study revealed calU16 and calU19 to confer resistance to 1, and reminiscent of the prototype CalC, both CalU16 and CalU19 were\ncleaved by 1in vitro. Through site-directed\nmutagenesis and mass spectrometry, we identified the site of cleavage\nin each protein and characterized their function in conferring resistance\nagainst 1. This report emphasizes the importance of structural\ngenomics as a powerful tool for the functional annotation of unknown\nproteins.", "The calicheamicins\nare a prototype\nof the naturally occurring 10-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotic\nfamily and were first reported in 1989 as metabolites of Micromonospora\nechinospora spp. calichensis.1\u22123 Members of this family\nshare a structurally conserved bicyclo[7.3.1]enediyne core, also often\nreferred to as the \u201cwarhead\u201d as this structural unit\nis central to the fundamental enediyne mechanism of action (Figure 1A).4\u22126 In all family members, the enediyne core is strategically\ndecorated with a bioorthogonal \u201ctriggering\u201d system and\nspecific appendages that enhance affinity to the metabolite\u2019s\ntarget (DNA/RNA). The calicheamicin trigger system (and that of esperamicins,\nshishijimicins, and namenamicins) is comprised of a unique trisulfide\nthat, upon reduction by bioreductants such as glutathione, induces\nan intramolecular hetero-Michael addition at C-9 (Figure 1B).7\u22129 The resulting fused enediyne core ring strain invokes\na spontaneous cycloaromatization reaction which proceeds via a highly\nreactive diradical intermediate that is rapidly quenched by any suitable\nhydrogen source.7,10 Calicheamicin\u2019s high affinity\nfor the minor groove of DNA, by virtue of its aryltetrasaccharide,\ninsures that the diradical species is quenched via hydrogen abstraction\nfrom the backbone of opposing strands of dsDNA to form DNA radicals\nthat, in the presence of oxygen, result in facile double-strand scission.11\u221213 The study of calicheamicin\u2019s many fascinating architectural\nand functional facets have led to numerous discoveries/advances in\nchemistry,14,15 enzymology,16\u221226 and anticancer drug development27,28 over the past\nthree decades. Yet, while the gene cluster encoding for calicheamicin\nbiosynthesis was cloned from M. echinospora and sequenced\nnearly a decade ago,16 there remain a number\nof genes (\u223c30%) within this locus annotated as \u201cunknowns\u201d\ndue to a lack of homologues and/or biochemical characterization of\ncorresponding gene products.", "Figure 1(A) Selected structures of naturally occurring\n10-membered enediynes.\nThe \u201cwarhead\u201d is highlighted in red.

Cumulatively, this work extends the body of work focused upon\nunderstanding how bacteria construct and control highly reactive and\nlethal metabolites and expands the number of known \u201cself-sacrifice\u201d\nenediyne resistance proteins.

However, the ability of calC (and presumably other\nself-sacrifice resistance protein encoding genes) to confer resistance\nupon E. coli provides a convenient indicator for\nputative function. As a preliminary assessment of potential CalU16/19\nfunction, the genes encoding each protein were expressed in E. coli and the corresponding recombinant strains tested\nfor 1 resistance in a manner reminiscent to that previously\nreported for CalC.18 To do so, calU16 and calU19 were cloned into pET28a\nto provide pSECalU16-E. coli and pSECalU19-E. coli, respectively, and the corresponding heterologous\nproduction levels of both CalU16 and CalU19 in E. coli were confirmed via SDS-PAGE to be comparable (Supporting Information Figure S8). A subsequent disc diffusion\nassay was used to test for 1 resistance of pSECalU16-E. coli, pSECalU19-E. coli, pET28a-E. coli (an empty vector negative control), and pJB2011-E. coli (a calC-expressing positive control).18 Figure 4 illustrates\nthe rank order of in vivo resistance to be CalC \u2248\nCalU19 > CalU16 with no resistance in the empty vector-containing\nnegative control. Consistent with this qualitative assessment, the\ndetermination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Table 3, Supporting Information Figure\nS9), revealed both pJB2011-E. coli and pSECalU19-E. coli to be 330-fold more tolerant to 1 than\nthe pET28a-E. coli empty vector control while pSECalU16-E. coli was 80-fold more resistant than the control strain.\nImportantly, this supports the contention that CalU16/19 function\nin a manner similar to CalC. To further confirm that the 1-resistance pattern of CalC, CalU16, and CalU19 is specific and not\nan artifact related to general proteins encoded by genes in the calicheamicin\ngene cluster, an identical study using the unknown-encoding gene calU17 revealed no resistance toward 1 (Supporting Information Figure S10).

For example, many members of the START domain family function as\nmolecular chaperones as exemplified by the Coq10 homologue CC1736,\nresponsible for transporting ubiquinone to or within the respiratory\nchain complexes and contributes to dramatically higher biosynthetic\nefficiency.54 Although the precedent for\nmolecular chaperones in the context of the structurally related 9-membered\nenediynes is well established,5,55 it remains to be determined\nwhether such proteins play additional roles beyond stabilizing the\nhighly reactive 9-membered enediyne chromophore. Preliminary evidence,\nbased upon the location of the key glycines in CalC, CalU16, and CalU19,\nsuggest that CalC binds 1 in a manner distinct from CalU16/CalU19\nwhich, in the context of a molecular chaperone model, suggests different\nregions of the cargo would be accessible to putative associated partner\nproteins (Figure 5A\u2013C). While CalC homologues\nlack apparent polyketide aromatase/cyclase TcmN Aro/Cyc catalytic\nresidues based upon sequence (Supporting Information\nFigure S21) and structural (Supporting\nInformation Figure S22) alignments, this relationship raises\nthe intriguing possibility of CalC homologues as the long sought after\ncontributors to enediyne polyketide core folding/cyclization.
