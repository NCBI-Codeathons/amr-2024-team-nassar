Summary Edeines, a group of cationic antimicrobial peptides produced by the soil bacterium Brevibacillus, have broad biological effects, such as antimicrobial, anticancer and immunosuppressive activities. However, the yield of edeines in wild‐type (WT) Brevibacillus is extremely low, and chemical synthesis of edeines is a time‐consuming process. Genetic engineering has proven to be an effective approach to produce antibiotics with high yield. In this study, the edeine biosynthetic gene cluster (ede BGC), which is involved in edeine production, was identified and characterized in Brevibacillus brevis X23. To improve edeine production in B. brevis X23, the ede BGC promoter was replaced with six different promoters, Pmwp, Pspc, PxylA, Pshuttle‐09, Pgrac or P43, through double‐crossover homologous recombination. The new promoters significantly increased the expression of the ede BGC as well as edeine production by 2.9 ± 0.4 to 20.5 ± 1.2‐fold and 3.6 ± 0.1to 8.7 ± 0.7‐fold respectively. The highest yield of edeines (83.6 mg l−1) was obtained in B. brevis X23 with the Pmwp promoter. This study provides a practical approach for producing high yields of edeines in B. brevis.

The highest yield of edeines (83.6 mg l−1) was obtained in B. brevis X23 with the Pmwp promoter. This study provides a practical approach for producing high yields of edeines in B. brevis. Microb. Biotechnol. (2022) 15(2), 577–589 Introduction Introduction Edeines are a group of linear pentapeptides produced by the soil bacterium Brevibacillus (Westman et al., 2013). Edeines A, B, D and F, which exhibit remarkable antibiotic activities, exist as two isomers, the active isomer α and the inactive isomer β (Fig. 1). Among them, edeines A1 and B1 have broad inhibitory activity against Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas and cancer cells (Hill et al., 1994; Czajgucki et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2020) as well as substantial immunosuppressive activity in mice (Kierońska et al., 1976). Edeines inhibit DNA synthesis at low concentrations (≤ 15 μg ml−1) and suppress protein synthesis at high concentrations (≥ 150 μg ml−1) through binding to the P‐site of the 30S ribosomal subunit to block t‐RNA binding, contributing to their antimicrobial activities (Kurylo‐Borowska and Szer, 1972; Pioletti et al., 2001). In addition, edeines have been widely used as transcriptional inhibitors to study ribosomal function and protein synthesis (Polikanov et al., 2018). However, use of edeines as drugs in human and animals is limited due to their toxicity in animal models (Czajgucki et al., 2007). The continuous emergence of multi‐drug resistant pathogens is a great challenge to public health, which highlights the re‐investigation of obsolete antibiotics such as edeines for new medical applications (Kierońska et al., 1976; Szaflarski et al., 2008).

Edeines are pentapeptides with a unique backbone, composed of a glycine, four nonproteinogenic amino acids and a C‐terminal polyamine (spermidine in edeine A1 and guanyl‐spermidine in edeine B1) (Fig. 1) (Mazerski et al., 1981; Czerwinski et al., 1983; Gumieniak et al., 1983). The biosynthesis of natural products has advantages over chemical synthesis in laboratories due to its low cost and high intensity (Kunga Sugumaran et al., 2016). B. brevis X23, an excellent biocontrol agent isolated by our lab (Chen et al., 2012), can produce edeines A1 and B1 under propriate conditions (Lu, 2014). A previous study has demonstrated broad inhibitory activities of edeines A1 and B1 against a large number of plant pathogens (Lu, 2014). While the production of edeines in B. brevis X23 could be slightly improved through optimization of media (data not shown), the low yield of edeines produced by B. brevis limits their broad application in agriculture as microbicides.

Genetic engineering, such as promoter modification, deletion or overexpression of regulatory factors, feeding with key precursors and increasing BGC copy number, has significantly improved the production of antibiotics (Marahiel et al., 1987; Keeney et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). Promoter engineering (native promoter replacement with stronger ones) is one of the most effective ways to improve antibiotic production. The strong promoters P43, Pglv and PluxS improved the yield of sublancin in Bacillus subtilis 1A747 by 11.5‐fold (Ji et al., 2015). Production of surfactin in B. subtilis fmbR was increased by 10.2‐fold by replacing the original promoter of surfactin BGC with the inducible promoter Pspac (Sun et al., 2009).

Studies examining the biosynthetic pathway of edeines were initiated in the 1960s. Borowska et al. hypothesized that edeines were synthesized by non‐ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs; Borowska and Tatum, 1966). However, this hypothesis was not confirmed for decades. Based on genome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, Westman et al. recently identified a hybrid NRPS‐PKS BGC that is likely to be responsible for the biosynthesis of edeines in B. brevis Vm4 (Westman et al., 2013). The predicted edeine biosynthetic gene cluster (ede BGC) encodes four NRPSs and one hybrid PKS–NRPS, which is consistent with the pentapeptide structure of edeines. Additionally, the edeQ gene on the ede BGC was verified to be the self‐resistance gene because its product, EdeQ, could convert edeine to inactive N‐acetyledeine in vitro. However, the ede BGC has not been experimentally confirmed in B. brevis due to difficulties associated with the genetic manipulation of this organism. To confirm and characterize the ede BGC, we initially cloned the predicted ede BGC (45.1 kb) from B. brevis X23 and integrated it into the chromosome of B. subtilis via Red/ET recombination (Liu et al., 2016). However, edeine was not detected in the culture of the genetically modified B. subtilis. We recently successfully established a stable genetic manipulation system for B. brevis X23 and improved edeine production by disrupting the regulatory factor AbrB (Zhang et al., 2020).

In the present study, we confirmed the ede BGC of B. brevis X23 by gene disruption and increased the production of edeines A and B by 3.6 ± 0.1 to 8.7 ± 0.7‐fold by replacing the original promoters of the ede operon with six stronger promoters. The highest yields of edeines A and B were obtained in B. brevis X23 isolated with Pmwp promoter replacement.

While the ede BGC was identified in B. brevis Vm4 based on bioinformatics prediction (Westman et al., 2013), no functional studies have yet been conducted. To confirm whether the predicted ede BGC was responsible for the biosynthesis of edeines, we knocked out the promoter region and the starter module edeP (RS18545) of the ede operon to generate the mutant strain B. brevis X23Δede (Fig. 2B and C). Then, both the wild‐type X23 (X23‐WT) and mutant strains were subjected to antimicrobial activity and comparative metabolomic analyses. The X23‐WT strain exhibited considerable antimicrobial activities against Ralstonia solanacearum and B. subtilis in the plate assay. However, the X23Δede culture supernatant had completely lost antimicrobial ability against R. solanacearum (Fig. 2D‐1) and B. subtilis (Fig. 2D‐2). High‐performance liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS) analysis demonstrated abolished production of edeines A and B in the crude extract of the supernatant of X23Δede culture compared with X23‐WT (Fig. 2E and F). Taken together, these results suggested that the identified ede BGC was responsible for the production of antibiotic edeines A and B in B. brevis X23.

High‐performance liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS) analysis demonstrated abolished production of edeines A and B in the crude extract of the supernatant of X23Δede culture compared with X23‐WT (Fig. 2E and F). Taken together, these results suggested that the identified ede BGC was responsible for the production of antibiotic edeines A and B in B. brevis X23. While the ede BGC was identified in B. brevis Vm4 based on bioinformatics prediction (Westman et al., 2013), no functional studies have yet been conducted. To confirm whether the predicted ede BGC was responsible for the biosynthesis of edeines, we knocked out the promoter region and the starter module edeP (RS18545) of the ede operon to generate the mutant strain B. brevis X23Δede (Fig. 2B and C). Then, both the wild‐type X23 (X23‐WT) and mutant strains were subjected to antimicrobial activity and comparative metabolomic analyses. The X23‐WT strain exhibited considerable antimicrobial activities against Ralstonia solanacearum and B. subtilis in the plate assay.

Construction of promoter‐engineered B. brevis X23 strains Construction of promoter‐engineered B. brevis X23 strains Construction of promoter‐engineered B. brevis X23 strains The present study showed that all the edeine biosynthetic genes in B. brevis Vm4 (edeA‐edeP) were present on the same ede operon, which shared a single promoter, Pede (Fig. 3). Therefore, we hypothesized that it would be possible to improve the expression of the edeine BGC by replacing the original promoter Pede with stronger promoters. Thus, six strong promoters that are commonly used in B. brevis and B. subtilis, including three constitutive promoters (Pshuttle‐09 (Yang et al., 2013), P43 (Ye et al., 1999) and Pmwp (Mizukami et al., 2010)) and three inducer‐free promoters from inducible promoters (PxylA (Kim et al., 1996), Pgrac (Phan et al., 2006) and Pspc (Yansura and Henner, 1984)) generated by removing the repressor protein component, were selected to replace the original Pede promoter to improve edeine production (Tables S2 and S3). By double‐crossover homologous recombination via temperature‐sensitive integration vectors (Fig. S1) carrying the homologous regions from upstream and downstream of the Pede region of X23‐WT, the original promoter Pede was replaced with either one of the abovementioned six promoters (Fig. 3). The transformants were first identified by PCR (Fig. S2) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The transformants were designated X23 (Pede::Pmwp), X23 (Pede::PxylA), X23 (Pede::P43), X23 (Pede::Pshuttle‐09), X23 (Pede::Pgrac) and X23 (Pede::Pspc).

Promoter substitutions affected the growth of B. brevis X23 Promoter substitutions affected the growth of B. brevis X23 Promoter substitutions affected the growth of B. brevis X23 To evaluate the effects of promoter substitution on the growth of B. brevis, we compared the growth curves of the X23‐WT and its six promoter‐engineered strains by measuring the OD600 of the corresponding culture broths every 12 h (Fig. 4A). No significant difference in cell density was identified between the transformants and the X23‐WT strain at 12 h (exponential phase) and 24 h (stationary phase) of cultivation. However, the cell turbidity (OD600) of the six promoter‐engineered strains was 7.5–15.3% lower than that of the X23‐WT at 36 and 48 h (decline phase) (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the promoter substitution affected both the growth and biomass of B. brevis X23. The results also revealed that the increased antimicrobial activity observed was not due to the biomass increment.

Promoter substitutions significantly improved the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23 Promoter substitutions significantly improved the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23 Promoter substitutions significantly improved the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23 Given that ede BGC disruption abolished the antibacterial activity of B. brevis, we speculated that edeines were the major antibacterial substances in fermentation supernatants of X23‐WT when cultured in NB media. Thus, the yield of edeines was roughly consistent with the antimicrobial activity of B. brevis X23. Although edeines have broad inhibitory activity against Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria, B. subtilis was chosen to evaluate the antibacterial activity of all B. brevis strains because it exhibited the highest sensitivity to edeines based on our previous results (Lu, 2014). Therefore, to evaluate the effects of promoter substitutions on the yield of edeines, we first performed plate inhibition assay to assess the antibacterial activity of X23‐WT and six promoter‐engineered strains against B. subtilis 168 after 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 and 48‐h incubations. The results showed an increased radius of the inhibition zone for all six promoter‐engineered strains compared with X23‐WT (Fig. 5A). After 48 h of incubation, the radii of the inhibitory zones of X23(Pede::Pmwp), X23(Pede::Pgrac), X23(Pede::Pshuttle‐09), X23(Pede::Pspc), X23(Pede::PxylA) and X23(Pede::P43) were increased by 1.3 ± 0.2, 1.2 ± 0.2, 1.1 ± 0.2, 1.0 ± 0.1, 1.0 ± 0.2 and 0.9 ± 0.1‐fold, respectively, compared with the X23‐WT strain (Fig. 5B and C). Of note, there was no significant difference in the radius of inhibition zone between the promoter‐engineered X23(Pede::Pmwp) and X23(Pede::Pgrac) strains. Taken together, these results showed that promoter substitutions improved the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23 against B. subtilis 168, and promoters Pmwp and Pgrac achieved the highest antimicrobial activities among the six promoters. The results also suggested that the promoter‐engineered strains produced antimicrobial substances earlier than X23‐WT.

In the early growth stage (12 h), the level of ede BGC transcription in X23‐WT was extremely low because the expression of secondary metabolites such as edeines was repressed during the primary metabolic period by the global regulatory systems. In contrast, ede BGC expression in the promoter‐engineered strains was not limited by these regulatory systems, resulting in 2.9 ± 0.4 to 20.5 ± 1.2‐fold higher expression of the ede BGC in the early stage compared with X23‐WT. The highest (15.4 ± 1.9‐fold compared with X23‐WT) level of ede BGC expression after 12 h of culture was detected in X23(Pede::Pmwp). In the middle stage (24 h), expression of the ede BGC in X23‐WT was increased by 3.6 ± 0.8‐fold compared with that at 12 h.

In the late period (36 h), expression of the ede BGC in X23‐WT rapidly decreased to 0.4 ± 0.1 (compared with that at 12 h), while in the six promoter‐engineered strains, it was still 3.1 ± 0.2 to 20.5 ± 1.2‐fold higher than that in X23‐WT.

We purified edeines A and B from the culture broth of B. brevis X23 because the standard compounds are not commercially available. HPLC and high‐resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) were conducted to determine the purity of edeines A and B (Figs S3 and S4). The structure of edeine A was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figs S5 and S6). We further determined the absolute yield of edeines A and B using standard curve‐based quantitative analysis (Fig. S7). As shown in Fig. 7C, the amounts of edeines A and B were significantly higher in the fermentation broth of promoter‐engineered strains compared with X23‐WT after 48 h of culture, which was consistent with the antimicrobial activity assays. Compared with X23‐WT, the yields of edeines A and B produced by X23(Pede::Pmwp), X23(Pede::Pgrac), X23(Pede::Pshuttle‐09), X23(Pede::Pspc), X23(Pede::PxylA) and X23(Pede::P43) were increased by 8.7 ± 0.6, 8.0 ± 0.3, 4.4 ± 0.5, 7.2 ± 0.6, 7.9 ± 0.4 and 3.6 ± 0.1‐fold respectively (Fig. 7C and Table S4). The highest yield of edeine A (83.4 mg l−1) was detected in X23(Pede::Pmwp) compared with the X23‐WT strain (9.4 mg l−1), which was consistent with the antimicrobial test and gene expression of the ede BGC (Table S4). In contrast, an increased yield of edeine B was only detected in X23(Pede::PxylA) (0.3 mg l−1) compared with the X23‐WT strain (0.2 mg l−1). The total yield of edeines (edeine A and B) reached 83.59 mg l−1 in X23(Pede::Pmwp) (Table S4). Given that the yield of edeine B was much lower than that of edeine A and that edeine B contains an unusual guanyl‐spermidine reside rather than spermidine, we speculated that the availability of the precursor guanyl‐spermidine might limit edeine B production.

Discussion Discussion Although edeines were identified over 60 years ago, the biosynthetic pathway of edeines has remained ambiguous, thus limiting improvements of edeines yield through biosynthetic pathway modification. Westman et al. first identified the ede BGC in the B. brevis Vm4 genome based on genomic analyses (Westman et al., 2013). In this study, we confirmed the functionality of the ede BGC in B. brevis X23 through gene disruption. Identification and confirmation of the ede BGC allowed us to significantly improve the production of edeines through promoter engineering.

In this study, we confirmed the functionality of the ede BGC in B. brevis X23 through gene disruption. Identification and confirmation of the ede BGC allowed us to significantly improve the production of edeines through promoter engineering. We replaced the original promoter of the ede BGC with stronger constitutive promoters to increase expression of the ede BGC and improve edeine production. Transcriptomic analyses (data not shown) and the RT‐PCR assay (Fig. 6) indicated that the original promoter of ede BGC might be controlled by global secondary metabolic regulatory factors, and high‐level expression of ede BGC was not reached until the mid‐late stage (24 h). The three constitutive stronger promoters tested in this study, P43, Pmwp and Pshuttle‐09, mediate expression of genes that encode enzymes involved in primary metabolism and cell growth, which are active most of the time and are not controlled by secondary metabolic regulators (Ye et al., 1999; Mizukami et al., 2010). Therefore, the stronger constitutive promoters significantly increased the expression of ede BGC and the antimicrobial activity (edeine production) from the early growth stage.

Therefore, the stronger constitutive promoters significantly increased the expression of ede BGC and the antimicrobial activity (edeine production) from the early growth stage. Three chemically inducible promoters, including PxylA, Pspc and Pgrac, were also tested in this study. Specific stimuli (xylose for PxylA; IPTG for Pspc and Pgrac) are required to switch on these chemically inducible promoters (Yansura and Henner, 1984; Kim et al., 1996; Phan et al., 2006), which increases the cost of fermentation. Chemically inducible promoters are usually companied by a regulatory gene encoding a repressor protein that binds to the promoter upstream, blocking the transcription of downstream genes in the absence of inducers. Therefore, chemically inducible promoters may achieve constitutive expression when the repressor gene is disrupted. Tran et al. constructed an inducer‐free expression plasmid with the IPTG‐inducible promoter Pgrac for B. subtilis by disrupting the repressor lacI gene (Tran et al., 2017). We constructed a reporter gene plasmid system in B. brevis X23‐WT based on the green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene to explore whether the PxylA, Pspc and Pgrac promoters could be transformed into inducer‐free promoters in B. brevis. The results showed that the promoters without repressor genes resulted in constitutive expression of the gfp gene in the absence of their inducers (Fig. S8). Subsequently, RT‐PCR also revealed constitutive expression of the ede BGC in B. brevis promoter‐engineered strains containing the PxylA, Pspc or Pgrac promoter throughout the growth period (Fig. 6).

Subsequently, RT‐PCR also revealed constitutive expression of the ede BGC in B. brevis promoter‐engineered strains containing the PxylA, Pspc or Pgrac promoter throughout the growth period (Fig. 6). Of the six promoters, the Pmwp promoter resulted in the most significant expression of the ede BGC and the highest edeine production. This impressive power of the Pmwp promoter in driving the expression of ede BGC might be explained as follows. First, the promoter of the cell wall protein gene (HWP) in B. brevis HPD31 has long been regarded as an extremely strong promoter in the exponential period, and it is used in the Brevibacillus Expression System by TaKaRa Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd (Mizukami et al., 2010). This expression system has been widely applied for the robust expression of a large number of genes encoding enzymes, antigens and cytokines, such as α‐amylase, sphingomyelinase, xylanase, surface antigen, epidermal growth factor and interferon‐γ (Mizukami et al., 2010). The Pmwp promoter was derived from a middle cell wall protein (MWP) gene, which is the homolog of HWP (78% identity in B. brevis X23) (Ebisu et al., 1990). Second, based on transcriptomic analyses of B. brevis X23 in the exponential growth period, the MWP gene exhibited the highest transcription among all 6291 coding genes. The expression level of the MWP gene was 18.6 ± 0.8‐fold higher than that of the ede BGC (data not shown), suggesting that the MWP promoter is a strong promoter with the potential to improve edeine production in B. brevis. Indeed, the Pmwp promoter increased transcription of edeP in B. brevis X23 15.4 ± 1.9‐fold after 12 h of incubation, which was consistent with our previous abovementioned observation. Taken together, replacing the original promoter with stronger promoters is an efficient way to improve the production of natural products in bacteria.

Interestingly, the yield of edeine B was not significantly increased or even decreased after replacing the original promoter with stronger promoters. Previously, Shimotohno et al. identified and purified edeine B1 amidinohydrolase, which can transform edeine B to edeine A. They speculated that edeine B was the intermediate product of edeine A (Shimotohno et al., 1999). This speculation could explain the markedly reduced production of edeine B compared with edeine A or even its decrease following promoter engineering. In addition, edeine B contains an uncommon guanyl‐spermidine substituted by spermidine. Thus, we speculated that low contents of the guanyl‐spermidine might limit edeine B production. A number of strategies from previous studies, such as optimization of the culture media, overexpression of the precursor synthesis pathway and modification of regulatory factors (Zhang et al., 2016), can be applied to further improve the production of edeine A.

In this study, we successfully improved edeine A production in B. brevis X23 by replacing the original ede BGC promoter with strong promoters. Of the six strong promoters, Pmwp generated the highest yield of edeines (83.6 mg l−1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to examine the improvement of edeine production through genetic modification of the ede BGC. Based on these results, we are further exploring the edeine biosynthetic pathway and novel derivatives through structural modifications.

The threshold cycle (CT), melting curves and relative gene expression levels (−ΔCT) were automatically measured. The 16S rRNA gene was used as the internal reference gene. Real‐time PCR assay was repeated three times, and each sample was assessed in triplicate. We conducted qRT‐PCR using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (2× Universal SYBR Green Fast For qPCR Mix, Abclonal, China) and the ABI‐QS5 Real Time PCR detection system.
