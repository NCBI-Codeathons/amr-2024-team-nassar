Antibacterial peptides (AMPs) are the main antibacterial products of Brevibacillus. This study isolated a strain of Br. brevis HNCS-1 from tea garden soil, and the strain has an antagonistic effect against five types of pathogens of tea diseases, namely Gloeosporium theae-sinensis, Elsinoe leucospira, Phyllosticta theaefolia, Fusarium sp., and Cercospora theae. To determine the genetic characteristics implicated in the biocontrol mechanism, the genome sequence of the HNCS-1 strain was obtained and analyzed further, and the data are deposited in the GenBank repository (No. CP128411). Comparative genomics analyses revealed that the HNCS-1 strain and 17 public Br. brevis share a core genome composed of 3,742 genes. Interestingly, only one non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster annotated as edeine is present in the core genome. And UHPLC-MS/MS detection results showd that edeine B and edeine A were the principal antibacterial peptides in the HNCS-1 strain. This study proves that edeine is the main antibacterial peptide of Br. brevis, and provides a new strategy for the identification of antibacterial products from other biocontrol bacteria. Introduction Introduction The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an important cash crop, and its beneficial metabolites are valuable for human health (Pan et al., 2022). Similar to other plants, tea plants are vulnerable to many diseases throughout their life cycle. Among them, fungal diseases are the most serious hazards to tea plants, resulting in a decline in tea production and quality. For example, tea white scab disease occurs year-round in the Chinese tea host production area, generally resulting in a reduction of approximately 10% in production and a reduction of over 50% in the sick tea garden (Zhou et al., 2019). Tea gray blight can reduce tea production by 10–20% (Sanjay et al., 2008). For a long time, chemical control has been the main means to address tea plant diseases. However, there are fewer pesticides registered for tea plant diseases, and long-term single and excessive use of chemical pesticides has caused problems such as pathogen resistance, pesticide residues, and environmental pollution. Therefore, tea plantations urgently need a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and anti-drug-resistance plant disease control technology to replace traditional chemical control. Microbial pesticides have become one of the ideal strategies for the comprehensive control of tea plant diseases due to their persistence and environmental friendliness.

Brevibacillus spp. is an essential source of biocontrol microorganisms and is widespread in nature, having been discovered in soil, flora, seawater, and the intestinal tracts of animals (Ruiu, 2013). There are 20 species in the genus, including 10 Bacillus species discovered previously (the Br. brevis cluster). Br. brevis is the parent species of the genus Brevibacillus (Shida et al., 1996). It has been reported in the disciplines of biological control of plant maladies, pollution degradation, and heavy metal remediation (Samrot et al., 2015; Che et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Brevibacillus is one of the most studied bacterial groups, and it has been one of the most important producers of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (Yang and Yousef, 2018). AMPs play an important role in bacteriostasis (Xu et al., 2023). AMPs can be classified according to their biosynthetic pathways as ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (Ripps) and non-ribosomally synthesized peptides (NRPS). Currently, the preponderance of Brevibacillus AMPs are produced by non-ribosomal eptide synthetases. They consist of edeine (A, B, D, and F) (Czajgucki et al., 2006), gramicidin (A-C, S) (Govaerts et al., 2001; Kessler et al., 2004), gratisin (Tamaki et al., 1983), tyrocidine (A-D) (Mootz and Marahiel, 1997), BT1583 (Wu et al., 2005), tostadin (Song et al., 2012), tauramamide (Desjardine et al., 2007), brevistin (Shoji and Kato, 1976), spergualin (Takeuchi et al., 1981), loloatin (A-D) (Gerard et al., 1999), laterocidin (Xu et al., 2010), and tridecapeptide families (Yang et al., 2017). Brevibacillus spp. generate numerous Ripps, such as laterosporulin (Singh et al., 2012), laterosporulin10 (Baindara et al., 2016), and Bac-GM100 (Ghadbane et al., 2013). Most Brevibacillus AMPs exert their antimicrobial effect via cytoplasmic membrane damage, but edeine inhibits DNA synthesis and protein translation and synthesis at varying concentrations (Szer and Kurylo-Borowska, 1972; Dinos et al., 2004).

However, the diversity of types and structures of AMPs has also led to difficulties in the purification and identification of traditional chemical analysis techniques. Fortunately, the development of next-generation sequencing technology over the past two decades has consequently stimulated research on the comparative genomics of Br. brevis. More biocontrol strains of Br. brevis have had their entire genomes sequenced in order to investigate the relationships between antibacterial mechanisms and the underlying genetic diversity of Br. brevis genomes. With the advancement of bioinformatics prediction, AMP gene clusters have been continuously identified. The metabolic pathway database of AMPs, which can annotate the protein gene clusters of biocontrol bacteria at the gene level and predict the results of secondary metabolites, has been perpetually improved, making the rapid identification of AMPs feasible. In addition, with the continuous publication of multiple microbial genomes and the comparison of microbial genomes between different individuals of the same species, it is gradually recognized that a single reference genome cannot represent diversity within a species (Cuellar-Gaviria et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2023).

In this study, a strain of Br. brevis HNCS-1 with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was isolated from the tea garden soil. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biocontrol potential of strain HNCS-1, we sequenced the genome of Br. brevis HNCS-1. A comparative genomic analysis was conducted to characterize the pan-genome structure of this biocontrol bacterium, assembled with 17 public Br. brevis genomes. An NRPS gene cluster was found in the core genome, which may be related to the antibacterial ability of Br. brevis. This study provides a genetic context for future research on AMPs and provides a scientific basis for further optimizing the field applications of the microbial biopesticide derived from Br. brevis HNCS-1.

The pan-genome curve exhibited an asymptotic trend, indicating that 18 genomes were inadequate to characterize the complete gene repertoire of Br. brevis. According to the curve generated for these 18 genomes based on Heap's Law and least-square fit of exponential regression decay, the number of gene families in the pan-genome increases with the addition of each additional genome (γ = 0.22), indicating that the pan-genome of Br. brevis strains is currently open but may be closed soon (Figure 3B).

Analysis of genes encoding AMPs Analysis of genes encoding AMPs Analysis of genes encoding AMPs It is noteworthy that the cell-free supernatant fermentation of Br. brevis inhibited numerous bacterial and fungal diseases. Additionally, the core genome sequence of Br. brevis was mined for AMP-encoding genes. Only one gene cluster implicated in edeine NRPS was identified in the core genome after NR annotation. The gene cluster likely contributes significantly to antimicrobial activity. The sequence similarity between the genes and the predicted ede BGC of Br. brevis Vm4 was high (Westman et al., 2013). The identified ede BGC in the Br. brevis HNCS-1 genome was structured identically to the Br. brevis Vm4 genome. In brief, the ede BGC (43.57 kb) in Br. brevis HNCS-1 contained 17 open reading frames, designated edeA through edeQ based on the homologous sequences in Br. brevis Vm4 (44.12 kb) (Figure 4A).

Additionally, the genome sequence of Br. brevis HNCS-1 was mined by antiSMASH software for the presence of gene-encoding AMPs. A total of 13 putative biosynthetic gene clusters were identified by the HNCS-1 strain genome (Supplementary Figure 7). Four putative gene clusters shared a high degree of similarity (>70% of genes shared similarity) with the petrobactin, tyrocidine, bacillopaline, and gramicidin gene clusters. Three putative gene clusters displayed modest similarity (<30% of genes displayed similarity) to the previously reported zwittermicin A, aurantinin B-D, and pacidamycin (1–7, D) gene clusters.

The antibacterial potential of eluent extracts containing antibacterial compounds was evaluated. Using an agar well diffusion assay, the antibacterial potential of eluent extracts from distinct collection tubes against G. theae-sinensis was determined. With an increase in eluent volume, the bacteriostatic activity initially increased steadily and then decreased dramatically (Figure 5A). The sample with the highest antibacterial activity was analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS for additional confirmation. According to the total ion chromatogram, the majority of the ultraviolet absorption is of short wavelength.

Compound 1 (m/z 755), Compound 2 (m/z 797), Compound 3 (m/z 739), and Compound 4 (m/z 781) were extracted from the total ion current based on the ion mass spectral (m/z). Compound 1 (m/z 755) produced a [M+H]+ ion peak m/z 755.4132 (−1.7 ppm, C33H58N10O10) at a retention time of 1.182 min (Figure 5B-a). The electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry results indicated that its fragmentation pattern was identical to that of edeine A, including m/z 738, 737, 720, 667, 553, 536, 401, 390, and 203 (Figure 5C-a, Supplementary Figure 8).

Discussion Discussion Allelopathy is a pervasive natural phenomenon in ecosystems, promoting and inhibiting the proliferation of diverse organisms. People have always been interested in the rational application of biocontrol's antagonistic effect on agricultural resistance and disease control. Tea plant diseases are difficult to control, resulting in substantial losses in yield and quality. Although chemical fungicides have some effect on the control of tea plant diseases, their misuse has resulted in severe environmental pollution issues. Utilizing biocontrol microorganisms to combat plant maladies is a popular topic of discussion. In certain instances, biocontrol microorganisms have been shown to be as effective as chemical fungicides in preventing plant diseases. Several bacterial species, such as Bacillus, Brevibacillus, and Pseudomonas, have been commercialized as biological control agents (Zhang et al., 2005; Paterson et al., 2017). Because of their extensive colonization capabilities, spore-forming Bacillus and Brevibacillus preparations are preferred for the development of commercial products. In this study, we isolated strain HNCS-1 of Br. brevis from tea garden soil that exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to five fungal diseases of tea plants. The HNCS-1 strain is a beneficial microorganism with prospective biotechnological application potential.

The HNCS-1 strain is a beneficial microorganism with prospective biotechnological application potential. The HNCS-1 strain and 17 Br. brevis isolates from NCBI were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis using orthologous genes organized into four clusters. However, the strains of the same cluster originate from diverse habitats, indicating that Br. brevis is highly adaptable to its environment and can populate a variety of ecological niches. We examined the pan-genome of Br. brevis species. The results indicate that the pan-genome of Br. brevis is open and theoretically infinite, indicating that Br. brevis species tend to acquire new genes to improve adaptability. Bacteria could modify their genetic material to adapt to varying environmental conditions, resulting in increased niche diversity and larger pan-genomes (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004). The HNCS-1 strain has more protein-coding genes (6,342) than other Br. brevis strains, making it more environmentally adaptable.

In addition, the traditional separation methods of antimicrobial substances have limitations. According to previous studies, this study tried to extract antimicrobial substances through the organic solvent extraction method, hydrochloric acid precipitation method, and ammonium sulfate precipitation method but never succeeded. Genome sequencing analysis and pan gene analysis open a new door for the identification of antimicrobial substances, which can quickly and accurately target antimicrobial substances and lay a theoretical foundation for the separation and application of antimicrobial substances.

A comparison of Br. brevis HNCS-1 proteins with those of other Br. brevis strains revealed 3,742 core genes. There is only one NRPS gene cluster annotated as edeine in the core genes. It is demonstrated that edeine is the antibacterial peptide at the center of Br. brevis. After a blast comparison, it was determined that the gene cluster of the HNCS-1 strain was extremely similar to the Br. brevis Vm4 gene cluster for edeine NRPS (identity >97%). To validate the accuracy of comprehensive genomic analysis, we used the UHPLC-MS/MS technique to identify edeine A, B, and F from the crude extract of the HNCS-1 strain, with edeine B and edeine A serving as the principal AMPs. The main species of edeine in the HNCS-1 strain differ from Br. brevis X23 (Du et al., 2022), which may be owing to the evolutionary tree's distant genetic relationship.

The main species of edeine in the HNCS-1 strain differ from Br. brevis X23 (Du et al., 2022), which may be owing to the evolutionary tree's distant genetic relationship. Edeine, as an AMP of the core genes of Br. brevis, should be abundant in the organism's secondary metabolites. Edeine was extracted from Br. brevis Vm4 and X23 by resin adsorption, respectively (Westman et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2022). However, ethylparaben from Br. brevis FJAT-0809-GLX was extracted by solvent extraction (Che et al., 2015), tostadin from Br. brevis XDH was extracted by ammonium sulfate precipitation (Song et al., 2012), siderophore from Br. brevis GZDF3 was extracted by ethanol precipitation (Sheng et al., 2020), and surfactin from Br. brevis KN8(2) was extracted by hydrochloric acid precipitation (Krishnan et al., 2019). The inability to extract edeine from the secondary metabolites of Br. brevis may have been caused by a mismatch in extraction techniques. Due to the ability of Br. brevis to acquire new genes from the environment, its antimicrobial peptides are diverse. The pan-genome analysis identified 560 HNCS-1 strain-specific genes. The unique genomes of the HNCS-1 strain require additional study. Additionally, genetic engineering is an excellent research direction. For instance, using in situ promoter engineering, the production of edeine in Br. brevis X23 was increased. Br. brevis HNCS-1 requires additional research, including the one strain many compounds approach (OSMAC) and genetic modification, to investigate novel compounds and yield enhancement.
