We have previously reported the draft genome sequences of 59 endospore-forming Gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from Vietnamese crop plants due to their ability to suppress plant pathogens. Based on their draft genome sequence, eleven of them were assigned to the Brevibacillus and one to the Lysinibacillus genus. Further analysis including full genome sequencing revealed that several of these strains represent novel genomospecies. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated their ability to promote plant growth, as well as the strong biocontrol potential of Brevibacilli directed against phytopathogenic bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Genome mining identified 157 natural product biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs), including 36 novel BGCs not present in the MIBiG data bank. Our findings indicate that plant-associated Brevibacilli are a rich source of putative antimicrobial compounds and might serve as a valuable starting point for the development of novel biocontrol agents. 1. Introduction 1. Introduction Coffee and pepper are valuable products of Vietnamese agriculture. Their coffee production worldwide ranks second, after Brazil. Black pepper is of similar importance in Vietnam, and has been exported to more than 110 countries. However, during the last years, there has been a tendency of harvest yield reduction in the case of coffee of about 20% compared to the yield of 2014. Harvest losses are caused by plant pathogens such as fungi (e.g., Fusarium oxysporum), oomycetes (Phytophthora palmivora) and root-knot nematodes (e.g., Meloidogyne incognita). In the past, chemical pesticides were used to control the phytopathogens, but their use is no longer permitted due to their toxic remnants. The epidemic occurrence of fast death disease, which is damaging black pepper plantations, has led to a rural exodus of farmers. For this reason, the sustainable development of agriculture, which includes the applying of highly efficient and reliable biocontrol agents, useful for preventing and suppressing pests on black pepper and coffee, is an urgent need.

We recently isolated endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria strains with putative biocontrol functions from healthy Vietnamese crop plants (e.g., coffee and black pepper) grown in fields infested with plant pathogens [1]. Based on their draft genome sequences, 47 isolates were assigned as being representative of the genus Bacillus belonging either to the B. subtilis or the B. cereus group [2]. Twelve additional isolates were either representatives of the Brevibacillus (11) or the Lysinibacillus (1) genus [1]. The majority of these strains could not be assigned down to species level. Preliminary experiments revealed that the Brevibacillus strains exert a strong nematicidal activity, and were able to suppress the growth of fungal plant pathogens.

Preliminary experiments revealed that the Brevibacillus strains exert a strong nematicidal activity, and were able to suppress the growth of fungal plant pathogens. The genus Brevibacillus encompassing the historical Bacillus brevis cluster [3] belongs to the family Bacillaceae of the phylum Firmicutes. The genus currently comprises 30 validated species according to the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN; [4]). The members of the genus are characterized by the formation of spherical swollen sporangia, containing L-lysine in their peptidoglycan cell wall, and by their inability to utilize traditional carbohydrates. Although reports about the biocontrol activity of Brevibacilli against plant pathogens are rare [5,6,7], the application of antimicrobial compounds with medical importance produced by Brevibacillus spp. has a long tradition. Members of the Brevibacillus brevis cluster are a rich source of antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides (AMPs), including gramicidin A and gramicidin S. The cyclic decapeptide gramicidin S (Soviet gramicidin) was discovered as early as 1942 [8]. Linear gramicidin A is the first AMP used clinically, and has still medical importance in topical medications. Until today, many novel AMPs such as the non-ribosomally synthesized cyclic decapeptide tyrocidine, the linear lipo-tri-decapeptide brevibacillin, the atypical cationic peptide edeine, and the bacteriocins laterosporulin and laterosporulin10 have been described [8]. Brevibacillus Leaf182 has previously been characterized as the most powerful inhibitor in the Agrostemma thaliana phyllosphere, and harbors a large number of gene clusters putatively involved in the synthesis of AMPs and other antimicrobial compounds. Marthiapeptide A and the previously unknown polyketide macrobrevin were identified in Leaf182 [9].

The genus Lysinibacillus [10], with the type species Lysinibacillus boronitolerans, at present comprises 21 validly published species (24-10-2022 LPSN). L. sphaericus, formerly Bacillus sphaericus, is known as an entomopathogen able to act as a biological insecticide that is efficient against mosquitos. In addition, other beneficial abilities such as plant growth promotion, the biocontrol of plant pathogens, and bioremediation have been reported [11].

In this study, we have fully characterized a new Lysinibacillus isolate and three novel Brevibacillus strains which were isolated from Vietnamese crop plants. We could assign their genomes to novel genomospecies, and were able to identify more than 150 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) probably involved in the synthesis of a multitude of structurally diverse antimicrobial compounds.

Strain Isolation, Growth Conditions and DNA Isolation The plant-associated bacteria were isolated from healthy crop plants, such as coffee and pepper, from fields located at Dak Nong, Dak Lac provinces, Vietnam, and infested with plant pathogens such as Phytophthora palmivora, Fusarium oxysporum, and nematode Meloidogyne sp. [1]. Routinely, the leaf, stem and root of healthy plants were selected and taken to the laboratory for further processing. The plant organs were cut into 5 × 5 mm pieces and washed twice with sterile water. Afterwards, the plant parts were dipped into 75% ethanol for one min, and then into 0.1% mercury dichloride (HgCl2) for two min. The cuts were then washed three times with sterile water, and taken up in 10 mL sterile water. The suspension was grounded in a sterile and chilled mortar. After 30 min. incubation, 0.1 mL of the solution was transferred to LB plates and allowed to grow for 72 h at 28 °C. Finally, single colonies were purified, transferred to 50 mL fresh LB medium, and cultured in a shaker at 28 °C and 180 rpm for 24 h. Due to their slow growth, Brevibacillus spp. were found to be enriched when soil samples adherent to plant roots were incubated under shaking for two weeks, diluted to 10−9, and then plated either onto R2A agar (Oxoid Lim., Basingstoke, UK) or onto 1/5 diluted NPT agar consisting of 0.4 g/L nutrient broth, 1 g/L potato dextrose, 1.2 g/L tryptic soy broth, 2 g/L MES hydrate (2-morpholino-ethan sulfonic acid), and 15 g/L agar, pH 5.75. Colonies appeared after three to seven days incubation at 28 °C. The purified strains were maintained as glycerol stocks (20 %, w/v) at −80 °C.

Genome Sequencing, Assembly and Annotation The genome sequences of Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6, Brevibacillus parabrevis HD3.3A, Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A, and Brevibacillus sp. M2.1A were reconstructed using a combined approach of two sequencing technologies, which generated short paired-end reads and long reads. The resulting sequences were then used for hybrid assembly. Short-read sequencing was conducted in LGC Genomics (Berlin, Germany) using an Illumina HiSeqq in a paired 150 bp manner, as described previously [2]. Long read sequencing was done in house with the Oxford Nanopore MinION with the Flow Cell (R9.4.1) and prepared with the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109).

Biocontrol Activity against Plant Pathogens and Plant Growth Promotion 2.3. Biocontrol Activity against Plant Pathogens and Plant Growth Promotion Antibacterial activity was examined as follows: 0.5 mL of a stationary culture (around 109 cells) of the phytopathogenic indicator bacteria (Clavibacter michiganensis, Dickeya solani, Erwinia amylovora) were mixed with 2 mL liquid soft agar (0.7%) at 40 °C, and then added to Petri dishes with 1.5% LB-Agar. The test bacteria (Brevibacillus and Lysinibacillus strains) were grown in liquid culture for 48 h. under continuous shaking. 10 µL of the culture was allowed to soak into filter paper discs (2 mm in diameter), and were then placed onto the surface of the soft agar containing the indicator bacteria.

A bioassay of nematicidal activity was performed with Caenorhabditis elegans N2 (Carolina, U.S.A., https://www.carolina.com, accessed on 3 December 2022) fed with Escherichia coli OP50 cells. The culture and synchronization of the worms was performed as previously described [24]. The L4 stage was used for two different bioassays performed as described previously [25]. In the slow killing assay, around 40 L4 C. elegans worms were added to the nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plate containing the test bacteria.

Resequencing of Selected Lysinibacillus and Brevibacillus Strains Revealed the Presence of Genomic Islands and Extrachromosomal Elements Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6, Brevibacillus parabrevis HD3.3A, Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A, and Brevibacillus sp. M2.1A were sequenced using nanopore sequencing technology. The complete genome of Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6 consisted of two DNA elements: a single circular chromosome with 4,810,966 bps (CP085880.1), and a small DNA with 2485 bps (CP085881.1). The total size of both DNA elements was 4,813,451 bps harboring 4833 coding sequences. No genes with similarity to plasmid replication proteins were detected in the small DNA element, excluding its definition as a plasmid. A circular plot of the CD3-6 chromosome (4,810,966 bps) computed against the most related genome (Lysinibacillus sp. JNUCC-52) is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. CD3-6 was used as reference for computing the core genome against a set of 15 Lysinibacillus genomes representing the most related taxonomic groups (clusters A1-4, see Section 3.2). The core genome consisted of 2733 coding sequences (CDS). The pan genome consisted of 9100 CDS. A total of 187 singletons were detected in CD3-6 when compared with the other 15 genomes (Table 1). Genomic island (GI) prediction using the IslandViewer 4 webserver [17] revealed that the CD3-6 genome was rich in putative genomic islands, mainly characterized by the presence of site-specific integrases, HNH endonucleases, and phage proteins (Figure 1A). GI 1 (618,752–660,952) contained 31 genes including tnpA (IS200/IS605 family transposase) and a tyrosine-type recombinase/integrase encoding gene. GI 4 (1,776,323–1,805,601) contained 39 genes including several phage proteins and a gene encoding FAD dependent thymidylate synthase. A predicted class-ii lassopeptide was detected using the antiSMASH pipeline version 6 [29] in GI 5. The largest GI predicted in CD3-6 was GI 8 (2,649,327–2,738,124) harboring 119 genes including the type II toxin-antitoxin system (UED78437.1, UED78438.1) encoded by hicA and hicB. HicAB modules appear to be highly prone to horizontal gene transfer genes [31]. A complete list of the genes predicted in the CD3-6 GIs is given in Supplementary Table S1. Lysinibacillus sp.

Lysinibacillus CD3-6 Forms a Distinct Genomospecies Together with Lysinibacillus JNUCC-52 The 16S rRNA gene sequence was extracted using the TYGS server from the whole genome sequence of CD3-6 and used for phylogenetic analysis. We have also directly sequenced the 16S rRNA of CD3-6, which was deposited in the NCBI data base as MW820197.1. Both sequences differ by only one nucleotide. The resulting tree indicated a single species cluster formed by CD3-6 with Lysinibacillus sphaericus as the closest related species (Supplementary Figure S5).

Since16S rRNA sequences are often not sufficient for species discrimination, we used the genome sequences for taxonomical strain identification. We started our analysis with the CD3-6 genome (CP085880) and 112 Lysinibacillus genomes obtained from the NCBI data bank. The phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) suggested that the members of the Lysinibacillus genus can be divided into two major groups, A and B. Group B members were not always representatives of the Lysinibacillus genus, but were often classified as representatives of different Ureibacillus species. Thus, group B seemed to be heterogenous, and to contain different genera. Group A contained Lysinibacillus genomes related to the type strain Lysinibacillus sphaericus DSM 28 [10], formerly Bacillus sphaericus. Based on the cut-off values for species delineation using ANI (96%) and dDDH (70%) [38], 24 clusters (A1–A24) were distinguished (Supplementary Table S6). Ten of the clusters contained type strains of recognized Lysinibacillus species, but most of the clusters (14) did not contain type strains, and represented according to the definition given by EZBioCloud (https://help.ezbiocloud.net/genomospecies/, accessed on 3 December 2022) for unnamed genomospecies consisting of so far unclassified or wrongly labelled Lysinibacillus genomes.

The type strain Lysinibacillus sphaericus DSM 28 was classified as being a member of cluster A4. Due to its genome sequence, Lysinibacillus sp.

We conclude that CD3-6 represents, together with Lysinibacillus JNUCC-52, a novel genomospecies distinguished from the L. sphaericus species cluster. It should be noted that L. mangiferihumi, L. tabacifolii, and L. varians were recently characterized as later heterotrophic synonyms of L. sphaericus [39], and do not represent valid species.

Novel GS Were Assigned for Plant-Associated Brevibacillus Isolates The phylogenomic tree constructed with 134 Brevibacillus genomes, including the eleven Brevibacillus isolates obtained from Vietnamese crop plants, demonstrated that three different major clusters (A, B, C) can be distinguished (Figure 4). Group B consisted of Brevibacillus laterosporus strains, whilst group A was formed by representatives of Brevibacillus brevis and their closest relatives. Within group A, six major branches with a total of 23 clusters were distinguished. Only 14 of those clusters were covered by type strains, whilst nine clusters represent novel genomospecies without validly recognized type strains. The majority of strains obtained from Vietnamese crop plants clustered within the Brevibacillus A group at branch 6. Only the putative B. parabrevis strains HD3.3A and HD1.4A clustered within branch 5 (Supplementary Table S7).

According to the analysis routine performed by the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS), five of the Vietnamese Brevibacillus isolates clustered together with valid recognized type strains. The Brevibacillus strains HD1.4A, and HD3.3A were assigned as B. parabrevis, and HB1.1, HB1.2, HB1.4B formed a cluster with the B. porteri type strain.

Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6 was found to be inefficient against most of the Fusarium strains, but the Brevibacillus strains did suppress the growth of all phytopathogenic fungi and the oomycete P. palmivora, one of the most detrimental plant pathogens in Vietnam [47].

Nematicidal Activity Root-knot nematodes, such as Meloidogyne spp., are one of the most important plant pathogens in tropical and temperate agriculture, and are responsible for significant harvest losses of main Vietnamese crops, such as coffee and black pepper [48]. In order to analyze the antagonistic activity of the Brevibacillus strains and Lysinibacillus CD3-6, we first tested their suppressing effect against the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Fast and slow death rates were estimated in a bioassay under laboratory conditions. This ruled out the possibility that the Brevibacillus strains were much more efficient than Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6. Brevibacillus sp. M2.1A displayed the highest killing effect against C. elegans (Figure 6A). In order to examine the suppressing effects against phytopathogenic nematodes more directly, we isolated a representative strain of Meloidogyne sp. directly from the galls of infested black pepper plant roots according to the hypochlorite procedure [49]. The suppressing effect exerted by the test bacteria on disease development was examined in a greenhouse experiment. Ten weeks after the transplanting of the tomato plantlets in soil, the formation of root knots was visually registered and used as a measure for calculating the disease index according to [27]. The Brevibacillus strains were found to be efficient in reducing the disease severity to around 50% and less compared to the untreated control.

Genome Mining for Putative Natural Product Biosynthesis Gene Clusters 3.4. Genome Mining for Putative Natural Product Biosynthesis Gene Clusters 3.4. Genome Mining for Putative Natural Product Biosynthesis Gene Clusters The identification of biocontrol actions directed against phytopathogenic bacteria, fungi and nematodes prompted us to investigate the biosynthetic potential of the isolates using either their draft or their full genome sequences. Antimicrobial compounds belong to structurally diverse groups of molecules, such as nonribosomal peptides (NRP) and polyketides (PK), and ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides [53]. The antiSMASH 6.0 version [29] was used for the prediction and annotation of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). The antiSMASH results were subsequently compared against the MIBiG database [54] in order to identify characterized and uncharacterized BGCs. In total, 151 BGCs in the 11 Brevibacillus isolates, and 6 BGCs in Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6 were identified and separated into nine distinct classes (Supplementary Table S10). A total of 36 of them were not detected in the MIBiG database and might encode the biosynthesis of uncharacterized secondary metabolites. The edeine gene cluster, previously detected in Brevibacillus brevis Vm4 and X23 [55], but not listed in the MIBiG databank, was found to be widely distributed in the Brevibacillus spp. strains.

The complete gene clusters present in B. brevis (AJ566197), B. parabrevis HD3.3A (CP085874.1) HD1.4A (JABSUW010000001), and Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A (CP085876) were characterized by a formylation (F) domain in the first module (lgrA) and a final reductase (TD) domain in the last module (lgrD). Two different types were distinguished (Figure 8, Supplementary Figure S14). The gramicidin gene clusters in B. parabrevis HD1.4A and HD3.3A containing 16 modules were identical with the corresponding 74 kb lgr gene cluster in B. brevis ATCC 8185 (AJ566197). The product of the lgr gene cluster in ATCC 8185 is characterized as a linear gramicidin pentadecapeptide consisting of 15 hydrophobic amino acid residues with an alternating L- and D-configuration forming a β-helix-like structure. Module 16 is predicted to activate alanine (according to our antiSMASH prediction) or glycine (according to [64]), and subsequently to reduce alanine/glycine. Finally, N-formyl-pentadecapeptide-ethanolamine is released from the LgrD enzyme [64].

Finally, N-formyl-pentadecapeptide-ethanolamine is released from the LgrD enzyme [64]. Surprisingly, we detected a novel variant of the gramicidin gene cluster in Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A (GS A6-30) containing two additional modules in the 3′-region of the lgrB gene (Figure 8). Their adenylation domains were coding for Ala and D-Val, and the modules seem to be caused by a partial duplication in the 3′-region. We hypothesize that the 18-module gene cluster is coding for a linear heptadecapeptide (N-formyl-heptadecapeptide-ethanolamine) containing two additional amino acid residues, Ala and D-Val, in position 7 and 8. Other Brevibacillus strains harbored truncated forms of both gramicidin gene cluster variants. A truncated pentadecapeptide variant was detected in Brevibacillus sp. RS1.1, whilst gene clusters encoding truncated heptadecapeptides were detected in Brevibacillus sp. HB2.2, and MS2.2, belonging to genomospecies A6-33, and A6-34, respectively (Supplementary Table S11). Since the truncated gramicidin gene clusters were predicted from draft genomes (WGS), we cannot exclude the possibility that the deletions are due to incomplete sequences. The gramicidin gene cluster present in the MIBiG data bank, BGC0000367 (AP008955.1), was identified as a 13-module gene cluster bearing a 3′ deletion in the lgrD gene, probably encoding a truncated variant of the heptadecapeptide (Supplementary Table S11, Supplementary Figure S14). We propose to replace BGC0000367 by the gramicidin gene clusters from B. brevis ATCC8185, encoding the complete gramicidin pentadecapeptide, and Brevibacillus sp.

Gene Clusters Encoding PK-NRP Hybrids Gene clusters, exhibiting high similarity to the edeine gene cluster in Brevibacillus brevis Vm4 (Supplementary Figure S16B), were detected in nearly all the Brevibacillus strains representing B. porteri (HB1.1, HB1.2, HB1.4B), and novel genomospecies such as A6-29 (MS2.2), A6-30 (DP1.3A), A6-33 (HB1.3, RS1.1), and A6-34 (M2.1A), but not in the B. parabrevis strains (Supplementary Table S11). The six genes edeP, edeN, edeL, edeK, edeJ, and edeI encode NRPS and PKS-NRPS hybrids involved in the non-ribosomal synthesis of the atypical cationic edeine peptides (Supplementary Figure S16A). Edeines contain a ß-Tyr or a ß-Phe residue at the N-terminus and a spermidine-polyamine structure at the C-terminus, flanking five non-proteinogenic amino acids in the central part (Supplementary Figure S14A). Edeine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent acting against bacteria and fungi. DNA synthesis is inhibited at low concentrations <15 μg/mL [66]. Despite the fact that edeines have been discovered as early as 1959 [67], corresponding gene clusters have not been deposited in the MIBiG data bank until now.

Interestingly, we found a gene cluster in Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A, which strongly resembled the phn gene cluster in Paenibacillus polymyxa E681 (BGC0001728). The phn gene cluster is possibly involved in the non-ribosomal synthesis of the cyclic lipoheptapeptide paenilipoheptin [56]. Both gene clusters contain eight modules (Supplementary Table S11). The first module is involved in fatty acid synthesis, while the remaining modules, containing seven adenylation domains, were predicted to be responsible for the synthesis of a seven-member peptide chain containing D-ser- (1), D-phe- (5), tyr- (6), and glu-residues (7) (Figure 8B). The structure of paenilipoheptin synthesized by P. polymyxa was elucidated by MALDI-LIFT TOF/TOF MS as being C13-ß-NH2-FA—Ser (1)—Dab (2)—Trp (3)—Val (4)—Phe (5)—Tyr (6)—Glu (7) [56], which is compatible with the predicted structure of the gene cluster detected in Brevibacillus DP1.3A (Supplementary Figure S17). A thioesterase domain at the 3′ end of the phnE gene was missing in both gene clusters, indicating that cyclization might be accomplished by a free-standing TE enzyme as proposed by Vater et al.

Gene Clusters Representing RiPPs, and Bacteriocins In contrast to polyketides and peptides, which are synthesized independently from ribosomes, numerous secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity such as RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides) and (unmodified) bacteriocins are synthesized by a ribosome-dependent mechanism. Several groups are distinguished [68]. Some of them, such as lassopeptides, LAPs, lanthipeptides, UviB peptides, and sactipeptides, were detected applying the antiSMASH and BAGEL4 [30] toolkits in the Brevibacillus isolates and/or the Lysinibacillus sp.

The detection of RRE domains can be helpful in identifying gene clusters involved in the synthesis of novel classes of RiPPs [70], but does not necessarily identify a specific category of RiPPs. RRE containing domains with weak similarity to Pantocin-Microcin RRE (BGC 0000585) were found in nearly all Brevibacillus strains, but they were not associated with other genes involved in RiPP synthesis. In contrast, the gene for the lassopeptide RRE domain protein in Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6 was associated with the genes encoding the lassopeptide class ii core (leader) peptide with a putative macrolactam sequence, and the lasso peptide biosynthesis B2 protein (Supplementary Table S12).

Gene clusters encoding linear azol(in)e-containing peptides (LAPs) were detected in all 11 Brevibacillus isolates, and Lysinibacillus CD3-6 (Supplementary Table S12). Most of them were identified as being members of the TOMM class (thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins) characterized by a gene cluster consisting of a cyclodehydratase gene and associated genes encoding dehydrogenase and a maturation protein. A gene encoding a TOMM precursor leader peptide was detected upstream of these three genes (Supplementary Figure S16).

Slightly modified NRP scaffolds consisting of either six or seven modules, and always starting with Glu-Ser at their N-terminus, were present in nearly all representatives of the A6 branch (Supplementary Figure S25).

Preliminary experiments did not reveal hexa- or heptapeptides in the Brevibacillus strains, but pentapeptides with partial corresponding sequences were detected. At present, we cannot exclude the possibility that the scaffolds are responsible for the synthesis of the pentapeptides, but one or two of the modules might be overread or not expressed.

An interesting NRP gene cluster encoding for three cysteine residues was detected in B. parabrevis HD1.4A, HD3.3A, Brevibacillus DP1.3A, and B. porteri HB1.1, HB1.2, HB1.4B (Supplementary Table S13). Due to the presence of predicted methyltransferase domains, it can be assumed that the cysteine residues are methylated (Supplementary Figure S26). The cryptic nrs gene cluster of the model biocontrol bacterium Bacillus velezensis FZB42 also harbors three modules encoding for cysteine. Recently, trithiazole was identified as the product of the nrs gene cluster, and NrsB as the oxidizing enzyme of the thiazoline precursor [78]. However, a more careful comparison of the domain structure of both gene clusters revealed significant differences between both BGCs, excluding the possibility that the final product can be a polythiazole (Figure 10). Although no o Ox domain was detected, two genes involved in dihydroxybenzoate (dhb) synthesis were (Figure 10A). The 2,3-dhb-AMP ligase and an oxido-reductase, predicted to be involved in dhb synthesis, possess counterparts in the dhb gene cluster of FZB42 known to be responsible for the non-ribosomal synthesis of the siderophore bacillibactin (BGC0000616.1, Figure 10C). For this reason, we assume that the unknown gene cluster might be involved in the biosynthesis of a novel siderophore a with function in iron acquisition. An interesting NRP gene cluster encoding for three cysteine residues was detected in B. parabrevis HD1.4A, HD3.3A, Brevibacillus DP1.3A, and B. porteri HB1.1, HB1.2, HB1.4B (Supplementary Table S13). Due to the presence of predicted methyltransferase domains, it can be assumed that the cysteine residues are methylated (Supplementary Figure S26). The cryptic nrs gene cluster of the model biocontrol bacterium Bacillus velezensis FZB42 also harbors three modules encoding for cysteine. Recently, trithiazole was identified as the product of the nrs gene cluster, and NrsB as the oxidizing enzyme of the thiazoline precursor [78]. However, a more careful comparison of the domain structure of both gene clusters revealed significant differences between both BGCs, excluding the possibility that the final product can be a polythiazole (Figure 10).

Conclusions Recently a total of 59 endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from healthy crop plants within fields in Vietnam that were infested with plant-pathogenic nematodes and fungi. According to their draft genome sequences, the majority of the strains were classified as being members of the B. subtilis group, mainly B. velezensis, and the B.cereus group. The remaining 12 strains were provisionally classified as Brevibacillus sp. and Lysinibacillus sp., respectively [1]. In this study we have focused on the members of the Brevibacillus and Lysinibacillus taxon, and a special procedure for enrichment of Brevibacillus strains was developed. The sequencing of the whole genomes of Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6 and of three Brevibacillus strains allowed for a detailed genome analysis of the selected strains, and the identification of several extrachromosomal elements. The novel isolate Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A, for example, harbored three different plasmids, representing either the low-copy type, whose segregation was directed by ParM, or the high copy type, replicating according to the rolling circle model. The high plasticity of the genomes was also indicated by the presence of numerous genomic islands within the Lysinibacillus and Brevibacillus chromosomes, and the high number of genes present in the pan-genomes.

Furthermore, we have elucidated the taxonomic position of the eleven Brevibacillus strains, and of the Lysinibacillus strain on the base of their complete or draft genome sequences. Five of the Brevibacillus strains were classified as being members of the known species, B. parabrevis (2), and B. porteri (3). The other six Brevibacillus strains, and Lysinibacillus CD3-6 were, according to their ANI and dDDH values, classified as being members of five novel genomospecies.

The other six Brevibacillus strains, and Lysinibacillus CD3-6 were, according to their ANI and dDDH values, classified as being members of five novel genomospecies. The main outcome of this work was characterizing the Brevibacillus isolates as potent antagonists of important plant pathogens. Brevibacillus strains were found to be efficient in directly inhibiting the growth of bacterial phytopathogens, such as Clavibacter michiganensis, Xanthomonas campestris, Erwinia amylovora, Dickeya solani, and fungal pathogens, such as Fusarium oxysporum, and other representatives of the Fusarium genus. The direct antagonistic action of the Brevibacillus strains against the phytopathogenic oomycete Phytophthora palmivora was also observed. Brevibacilli displayed high nematicidal activity, and significantly suppressed the formation of root-knots in tomato plants infested with Meloidogyne sp. in greenhouse experiments under controlled conditions.

Brevibacilli displayed high nematicidal activity, and significantly suppressed the formation of root-knots in tomato plants infested with Meloidogyne sp. in greenhouse experiments under controlled conditions. The Brevibacillus genomes harbored a rich arsenal of known and hitherto uncharacterized BGCs predicted to synthesize ribosomally and non-ribosomally diverse classes of secondary metabolites with potential antagonistic action against plant pathogens. A total of 151 BGCs including 35 uncharacterized BGCs were identified by genome mining in the Brevibacillus genomes, whilst Lysinibacillus sp. CD3-6 harbored only six BGCs. The occurrence of important BGCs in the representatives of different genomospecies is shown in Figure 11. In several cases, it seems that the distribution of BGCs in Brevibacilli is dependent on their taxonomical position. Gene clusters for the synthesis of edeine and petrobactin, for example, were not detected in B. parabrevis, but were present in the species cluster A29, A30, A31, A33, and A34. The gene clusters devoted to tyrocidine synthesis were identified in all isolates. In contrast, gene clusters involved in the synthesis of marthiapeptide and paenilipoheptin were only detected in single strains representing the species cluster A29 and A30, respectively. The paenilipoheptin gene cluster exhibited striking similarity to a corresponding gene cluster in Paenibacillus polymyxa [56] Our results are in line with the previous finding that Brevibacillus sp. Leaf182 is the most potent antagonist within the Arabidopsis phyllosphere-microbiome consisting of 224 strains [9]. The BGC responsible for non-ribosomal synthesis of the antibacterial polyketide macrobrevin, originally described in Leaf182, was detected in three novel genomospecies (A29, A30, and A33). Its presence on the DP1.3A genomic islands suggested that the cluster could be transferred by horizontal gene transfer. Two types of gramicidin gene clusters were detected. One of them which harbored 18 modules has been not described previously. In summary, our genome mining results indicated that Brevibacilli are a treasure box of widely unexplored AMPs and other secondary metabolites. Biocontrol agents developed from plant-associated Brevibacillus strains should extend our present arsenal of bio-based plant protection agents that are necessary for a more sustainable agriculture.

Nematicidal activity of Brevibacillus strains and Lysinibacillus CD3-6. (A): Bioassay with Caenorhabditis elegans. Slow killing activity was determined on NGM plates, and fast killing activity in liquid medium. (B): Tomato plants were infested with the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne sp. and the root-knot-forming rate in the presence and absence of the bacterial strains was estimated after 10 weeks growth of the tomato plants under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. All experiments were carried out with three independent repetitions and a completely randomized design. Different letters at each treatment indicate the significance between inoculated and uninoculated conditions at the p ≤ 0.05 level after the t-test.

Figure 8Gene clusters involved in non-ribosomal synthesis of peptides and lipopeptides detected in Brevibacillus genomes by antiSMASH. (A): Two types of gramicidin gene clusters were detected in the Brevibacillus isolates: a 16-module gene cluster in B. parabrevis HD1.4A encoding a putative N-formyl-pentadecapeptide-ethanolamine, and an 18-module gene cluster in Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A encoding a putative N-formyl-heptadecapeptide-ethanolamine. (B): The gene cluster located in region 15 (4,380,935–4,341,529) of Brevibacillus sp. DP1.3A resembled BGC0001728, and is possibly involved in the non-ribosomal synthesis of paenilipoheptin in Paenibacillus polymyxa E681. Different modules are labelled in red. NRPS/PKS domains are indicated by filled circles. A: adenylation, C: condensation, CAL: co-enzyme A ligase, E: epimerization domain, KS: ketosynthase domain, T: thiolase.
