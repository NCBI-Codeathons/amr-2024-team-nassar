Here, we report the isolation of a new lichen-associating Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 from the tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna (Yunnan, China), which displayed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis. The draft genome sequence of this isolate strain revealed 18 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolites, which is an unusually low number compared to a typical streptomycete. Inactivation of a lantibiotic dehydrogenase-encoding gene from the BGC presumed to govern biosynthesis of a thiopeptide resulted in the loss of bioactivity. Using comparative HPLC analysis, two peaks in the chromatogram were identified in the extract from the wild-type strain, which were missing in the extract from the mutant. The compounds corresponding to the identified peaks were purified, and structure of one compound was elucidated using NMR. The compound, designated geninthiocin B, showed high similarity to several 35-membered macrocyclic thiopeptides geninthiocin, Val-geninthiocin and berninamycin A. Bioinformatics analysis of the geninthiocin B BGC revealed its close homology to that of berninamycins. Introduction Introduction The successful use of any therapeutic agent is compromised by the potential development of tolerance or resistance to that compound from the time it is first deployed. This concerns all agents used in the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral infections, as well as cancer (Davies and Davies, 2010). Infectious diseases caused by bacteria are among the top causes of mortality in the world, and if appropriate actions are not implemented, it is estimated that by year 2050 up to 10 million people could die each year because of infections caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens (de Kraker et al., 2016). A successful curative treatment of such common, yet frequently deadly illnesses, as pneumonia and tuberculosis, could be soon history, if measures to tackle the antibiotic resistance problems are not implemented. Apart from the reduction of overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents, identification of new antibiotics still plays an essential role in controlling bacterial infections.

The majority of antibiotics used in medicine, veterinary practice and agriculture originate from actinomycete bacteria, predominantly from those belonging to the genus Streptomyces (Barka et al., 2015). Streptomyces are Gram-positive bacteria with genomes of high GC content, widely distributed in terrestrial as well as in aquatic ecosystems, and have a complex life cycle, with a multicellular mycelial growth (Labeda et al., 2012). Their life cycle starts with the germination of a spore that grows out to form vegetative hyphae, and further differentiates from vegetative mycelium into the aerial mycelium. Morphological differentiation in Streptomyces is an intricately regulated process, which typically correlates with production of secondary metabolites (SMs), such as antibiotics (van Wezel and McDowall, 2011).

Morphological differentiation in Streptomyces is an intricately regulated process, which typically correlates with production of secondary metabolites (SMs), such as antibiotics (van Wezel and McDowall, 2011). Thiopeptide antibiotics are a prominent class of antimicrobials with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, produced primarily by Streptomyces species (Bagley et al., 2005). The interest in this family of antibiotics was recently renewed, since many members of this class show activity against various drug-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (Bagley et al., 2005). Recent success in generation of new thiopeptide analogs with significantly improved pharmacological properties may pave the way to the introduction of these types of compounds in drug development pipelines aimed at antibiotic resistant pathogens (Just-Baringo et al., 2014).

Thiopeptides belong to the group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) possessing unique thiazole rings and a six-membered tri-or tetra-substituted nitrogen heterocycle that can be present in one of the three oxidation states: a piperidine, dehydropiperidine, or pyridine. Biosynthesis of thiopeptides follows a relatively straightforward pathway: a precursor peptide consisting of an N-terminal leader and a C-terminal core peptide, encoded by a single gene, is synthesized and undergoes post-translational modifications. All thiopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) contain, in addition to the gene encoding the precursor peptide, a set of at least five genes that encode enzymes required for heterocyclization, dehydration, and the formation of the central six-membered nitrogen heterocycle (Morris et al., 2009; Burkhart et al., 2017).

Advances in genetics, genomics and computer science have changed the way of natural product discovery. The complete genome sequencing of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Streptomyces avermitilis in early 2000s revealed a yet unexplored biosynthetic potential of the members belonging to this genus (Bentley et al., 2002; Ikeda et al., 2003) and led to the idea of genome-guided prediction and isolation of SMs, the approach known as genome mining (Du and van Wezel, 2018). Comparison of BGCs encoded in newly sequenced genomes using software such as antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2017) helps to identify conserved genes for enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for known classes of compounds, and thus to predict types of SMs they specify. In some cases, even the structure of the target SM can be predicted to a certain extent (Winter et al., 2011). To make the production, isolation and identification of SM faster and easier, the genome mining approach is combined with comparative metabolic profiling (Winter et al., 2011). Many different techniques contributed to the successful characterization of new compounds, such as heterologous expression (Yamada et al., 2015), regulatory genes overexpression or inactivation (Jiang et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017), as well as knock-out of core scaffold-biosynthetic genes (Tian et al., 2016).

Here, we present the results of a genome mining linked to the metabolite profiling that led to identification of a new analog of the thiopeptide antibiotic geninthiocin, geninthiocin B, and its BGC from a Streptomyces sp. isolated from a lichen. By combining the classical bioassay-based screening with genome mining we could rapidly connect the thiopeptide BGC with the molecule it specifies.

Analysis of the Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 Genome Analysis of the Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 Genome Analysis of the Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 Genome Due to the fact that Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 appeared to be phylogenetically diverse from the closest type strain and was bioactive, we decided to obtain its genome sequence in order to reveal secondary metabolite biosynthesis potential of this strain. The high-quality draft genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 revealed a single linear chromosome of 8,025,327 bp, with no plasmids, and a G+C content of 70.75% (see Supplementary Table S1, Supplemental Material, for additional genome features). Analysis of the YIM 130001 genome sequence using antiSMASH 4.1.0 software (Blin et al., 2017) revealed 17 putative BGCs for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (Table 1), which is an unusually low number compared to a typical streptomycete with a 8-Mb genome. Whole genome sequencing of multiple Streptomyces species typically reveals between 25 and 50 BGCs per genome (Katz and Baltz, 2016). Due to the fact that Streptomyces sp.

Seven of the clusters identified in YIM 130001 genome contain genes encoding modular enzymes, such as polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPs). Cluster 17, a PKS type I BGC, was predicted to govern biosynthesis of a putative enediyene (Table 1). Up to now, only 12 natural enediyenes were characterized and two of them are approved as anticancer drugs and at least other four are in various stages of drug development, making this compound class attractive for drug discovery (Gredičak and Jerić, 2007). Cluster 10 was predicted to contain NRPS-encoding genes, which putative product is a griseobactin/bacillibactin-like siderophore. Four clusters were annotated as hybrid BGCs: the putative products from clusters 9 and 11 could not be predicted, while the BGC 12 has a homology to the cluster specifying streptogramins biosynthesis. Streptogramin-like antibiotics occur as two structurally different compounds that act synergistically to inhibit ribosomal peptidyl transfer during bacterial protein biosynthesis, while separately they exhibit only moderate antibacterial activity (Di Giambattista et al., 1989). antiSMASH initially predicted cluster 14 as being of terpene-NRPS hybrid type. However, closer inspection using BLAST and genetic context suggested that this locus is likely to comprise two separate BGCs, 14a for a carotenoid, and for 14b non-ribosomally synthesized peptide (Table 1).

In addition to the PKS- and NRPS- containing gene clusters, three BGCs for terpenoid biosynthesis were identified, one of them presumably responsible for hopanoids synthesis (Table 1). Hopanoids have a condensing effect on biological membranes due to their rigid ring structures, which help to stabilize the membranes once integrated. In S. coelicolor hopanoids are synthesized during formation of aerial hyphae to alleviate stress in aerial mycelium by diminishing water permeability across the membrane (Poralla et al., 2000). Cluster 16 was predicted to encode a putative lassopeptide, whereby manual inspection with Protein BLAST and MIBiG algorithms showed similarity to BGCs in many Streptomyces spp. The genes from cluster 15 showed high similarity (59–93%) to the genes from many other Streptomyces spp. that encode putative siderophore actinoferrin involved in iron acquisition (Sandy and Butler, 2009). A likely product from cluster 5 was predicted as ectoine, its BGC has high similarity with its counterpart in Streptomyces anulatus. Ectoines are most commonly found osmolytes in Streptomyces and help microorganisms to cope with osmotic stress (Sadeghi et al., 2014). Three BGCs were predicted to encode bacteriocins-like compounds. These clusters showed high similarity to other conserved clusters, the metabolic products of which are not known. Cluster 8, due to sequence gaps within the genome, was likely falsely annotated as a BGC (Table 1). The cluster 1 was predicted by antiSMASH software as a thiopeptide BGC, and after the manual Protein BLAST search, its high homology to the berninamycin gene cluster (Malcolmson et al., 2013) was noticed.

Analysis of Thiopeptide BGC and Identification of the Cognate Bioactivity Analysis of Thiopeptide BGC and Identification of the Cognate Bioactivity Analysis of Thiopeptide BGC and Identification of the Cognate Bioactivity Among the clusters identified in the Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 genome, cluster 1 was predicted by antiSMASH to specify biosynthesis of a thiopeptide, and manual inspection of encoded gene products using BLAST predicted that it could yield a berninamycin-like analog (Table 1). Due to the fact that the members of thiopeptide family are known for their antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria (Just-Baringo et al., 2014), we assumed that the product of cluster 1 might be responsible for the activity against B. subtilis in crude extract. In order to investigate this, genB gene encoding a putative lantibiotic dehydratase (Table 2) was inactivated via insertion of the pC1_KN vector into its coding region, yielding recombinant strain YIM 130001/KN. The correct insertion of the knock-out vector was subsequently confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Figure S1, Supplemental Material). The crude butanol extract from recombinant strain YIM 130001/KN was tested for antibacterial activity against B. subtilis and its metabolite profile was analyzed with analytical RP-HPLC in comparison with a butanol extract from the wild-type strain (Figure 2). YIM 130001/KN-extract, in contrast to that from the wild-type strain, failed to exhibit antibacterial activity against B. subtilis. Furthermore, using comparative analytical RP-HPLC it was shown that in the extract of YIM 130001/KN strain two chromatographic peaks at ca 22 and 25 min disappeared (Figure 2), indicating that those two peaks might correlate with both the antibacterial activity and the cluster 1 product.

The NMR structure elucidation of compound 1 showed clearly that the molecule contained a free primary amido-group (N-56, Supplementary Figure S3) and eight peptide bonds (Supplementary Table S4). In addition, five terminal double bonds indicated five didehydroalanine residues. Threonine residue, didehydrobutyrine and hydroxy valine were also easily identifiable. Identification of cyclic structures of thiazol, oxazol, and pyridine rings were somewhat more challenging because of relatively large number of non-protonated carbons/heteroatoms and distant protons. By combining data from DQF-COSY, HMBC, HSQC, ROESY, and 15N-HSQC, the connectivity between the previously identified fragments was established. Protons from two OH groups could not be detected and assigned, probably because of their strong involvement in H-bonding. The shift assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N (protonated) are shown in Supplementary Table S4. Based on NMR results, the molecular formula of compound 1 was determined as C47H46N14O14S, and the elucidated chemical structure indicated it closely resembles thiopeptide geninthiocin (Yun et al., 1994), albeit differing from the latter at the C-terminal part (Figure 3). Consequently, compound 1 was designated as geninthiocin B. The scaffolds from geninthiocin-like thiopeptides (geninthiocin and val-geninthiocin) are very similar to berninamycins (e.g., berninamycin A), which differ by one additional methyl-group on the oxazol ring (Figure 3). At the same time, geninthiocin B differs from two up to now characterized geninthiocins (Yun et al., 1994; Sajid et al., 2008) in lacking one Dha-residue on its C-terminus tail region. The macrocycle of newly discovered geninthiocin B is 35-membered, and because of its tri-substituted pyridine ring, it belongs to the series d thiopeptides (Just-Baringo et al., 2014).

Analysis of the Geninthiocin B Biosynthesis Gene Cluster Analysis of the Geninthiocin B Biosynthesis Gene Cluster Analysis of the Geninthiocin B Biosynthesis Gene Cluster The geninthiocin B biosynthesis gene cluster spans ca. 23.4 kb and contains 20 open reading frames (Table 2, Figure 4). BLAST analysis of this thiopeptide BGC showed similarity to Streptomyces atroolivaceus and Streptomyces wuyuanensis uncharacterized clusters. Its genes, especially their organization, were predicted to have a similarity to the BGC for berninamycin biosynthesis (Figure 4, Malcolmson et al., 2013). However, the comparison of the GenA core peptide sequence showed a closer similarity to geninthiocin isolated from Streptomyces sp. DD84 (Yun et al., 1994) and val-geninthiocin, originated from Streptomyces sp. RSF18 (Sajid et al., 2008). Up to now, only a few thiopeptides with 35-membered macrocycles have been described: geninthiocin, berninamycin, sulfomycin (Abe et al., 1988), thioplabin (Ohyama et al., 2002), and TP-1161 (Engelhardt et al., 2010a), and respective BGCs were reported for TP-1161 and berninamycin (Engelhardt et al., 2010b; Malcolmson et al., 2013).

Burkhart et al (2017) suggested that due to the structural similarity between geninthiocin and berninamycin, the biosynthesis of those two compounds is likely to be very similar. In silico prediction of enzymatic functions of individual gene products from genenthiocin B BGC allowed us to propose the biosynthesis of geninthiocin B (Supplementary Figure S4). The geninthiocin B structural gene (genA) encodes a 31-aa leader peptide linked to a C-terminal 15-aa core (Figure 4). Ten amino acids of the core peptide are represented by serine, whereby Ser15 is absent in the mature scaffold (Figure 3). The cleavage of Ser15 is needed to afford the C-terminus amide, and is presumably catalyzed by GenI, which is homologous to the NocA and NosA enzymes from nocathiacin and noshipeptide biosynthesis. It has been shown that NosA acts on an intermediate bearing a bis-dehydroalanine tail in noshipeptide and catalyzes an enamide dealkylation to remove the acrylate unit originating from the extended serine residue (Yu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015).

As in the berninamycin BGC, the unique feature of geninthiocin B cluster is that its genes for cyclodehydratase and dehydrogenase (most likely responsible for the formation of thiazole/oxazole rings), are split in a non-traditional way (Figure 4). The geninthiocin B biosynthesis YcaO “G” protein is split into GenG1/GenG2 and the protein “E” is split into GenE1/GenE2. The protein GenE2 probably has the partner function of the so-called E1-like proteins, which interact with a side chain of the leader peptide and promote GenG1 and GenG2 to perform the d cyclodehydration. In earlier studies it was observed that E1-like partner protein is required for substrate guiding and recognition by YcaO protein (Burkhart et al., 2015), as well as playing a crucial role in allosteric activation of the latter (Dunbar et al., 2012, 2014). This partner protein can either be represented by a discrete polypeptide or fused to the YcaO (Burkhart et al., 2017). Similarly to the berninamycin BGC, unusual is an appearance of the canonical E1-like protein fused to a dehydrogenase (GenE2), as well as the presence of another dehydrogenase component (GenE1) encoded by the gene near genE2. Due to this atypical genetic organization, it is unclear how the active azole-forming proteins function with each other. Burkhart et al. (2017) suggested that these proteins might catalyze the formation of a large 35-member macrocycle, since the spacing of azole/azoline heterocycles in the macrocycle region of berninamycin is nearly identical to that of the thiocillin-like thiopeptides, which have a 26-membered macrocycle after maturation.

(2017) suggested that these proteins might catalyze the formation of a large 35-member macrocycle, since the spacing of azole/azoline heterocycles in the macrocycle region of berninamycin is nearly identical to that of the thiocillin-like thiopeptides, which have a 26-membered macrocycle after maturation. As in the berninamycin BGC, the unique feature of geninthiocin B cluster is that its genes for cyclodehydratase and dehydrogenase (most likely responsible for the formation of thiazole/oxazole rings), are split in a non-traditional way (Figure 4). The geninthiocin B biosynthesis YcaO “G” protein is split into GenG1/GenG2 and the protein “E” is split into GenE1/GenE2. The protein GenE2 probably has the partner function of the so-called E1-like proteins, which interact with a side chain of the leader peptide and promote GenG1 and GenG2 to perform the d cyclodehydration. In earlier studies it was observed that E1-like partner protein is required for substrate guiding and recognition by YcaO protein (Burkhart et al., 2015), as well as playing a crucial role in allosteric activation of the latter (Dunbar et al., 2012, 2014). This partner protein can either be represented by a discrete polypeptide or fused to the YcaO (Burkhart et al., 2017).

Proteins GenB and GenC (Table 2) showed high similarity to lanthipeptide-like dehydratases and most likely catalyze the formation of the dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) functional groups. Reconstitution studies using purified enzymes have established both the nature and the timing of the modifications installed during the biosynthesis of the thiopeptide antibiotic thiomuracin in Thermobispora bispora (Zhang et al., 2016). It was shown that after formation of the Dha residues, the central six-membered nitrogenous heterocycle is assembled via a formal [4+2] cycloaddition between the two Dha groups (Zhang et al., 2016). We suggest that in geninthiocin B biosynthesis the serine Ser1 and Ser13 are the key amino acids in the final macrocycle formation (Figure 4). GenD protein showing high degree of similarity to BerD from berninamycin pathway, which was predicted to catalyze the formation of characteristic for thiopeptides series d tri-substituted pyridine ring, is most probably also involved in the macrocycle formation (Malcolmson et al., 2013).

The gene genH (Figure 4, Table 2) encodes a homolog of BerH from berninamycin BGC, a putative P450 hydroxylase family protein that is most probably involved in valine hydroxylation (Malcolmson et al., 2013). The characterization of two P450 cytochrome-like proteins of nosiheptide (NosB and NosC) in Streptomyces actuosus ATCC 25421 indicated that those are responsible for hydroxylation occurring most likely at the tailoring stage, after the main scaffold is formed (Liu et al., 2013). During this work we could detect two compounds: geninthiocin B and an uncharacterized compound 2, both products from the geninthiocin B gene cluster. Based on the high-resolution LC-MS analysis, the compound 2 differs from geninthiocin B by one oxygen atom (Supplementary Figure S2). We suggest that compound 2 has similar structure to geninthiocin B, but lacks a hydroxyl group on Val7-residue. The appearance of a thiopeptide intermediate is not surprising and was described before for berninamycin (berninamycins A and B) (Lau and Rinehart, 1994). Moreover, a desoxygeninthiocin (val-geninthiocin) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. RSF18, which has a similar structure as geninthiocin, but lacks a hydroxyl-group on Val7-residue. If our assumption for structural features of compound 2 is correct, it can be produced as a major metabolite from the geninthiocin B cluster upon inactivation of the genH gene. The overall yield of geninthiocin B-related compounds must be improved to allow for more detailed studies on these molecules. The latter can be achieved either via heterologous expression of the cluster in an engineered Streptomyces host (Myronovskyi et al., 2018), or re-factoring of the cluster in YIM 130001 via promoter replacement (Horbal et al., 2018).

Geninthiocin B gene cluster is flanked at both ends by the genes encoding ribosomal and translation-associated proteins (Figure 4, Table 2), which are presumably not involved in geninthiocin B and compound 2 biosynthesises, but may play a key role in self-resistance of Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001. Berninamycin, which like genintiocin B also possesses a 35-membered macrocycle, is known to target 50S ribosomal subunit by binding to the 23S/L11 complex, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (Reusser, 1969; Thompson et al., 1982). The mechanisms of self-resistance to 35-membered macrocyclic thiopeptides are still not completely understood (Just-Baringo et al., 2014), but for the berninamycin-producing Streptomyces bernensis it was shown that its respective BGC contains a gene encoding ribosomal RNA methylase. These proteins catalyze specific methylation of ribose on the 23S ribosomal RNA, preventing binding of thiopeptides to the modified ribosomes (Thompson et al., 1982). No genes encoding putative ribosomal RNA methylase could be identified in the geninthiocin B gene cluster or its flanking regions, suggesting that self-resistance in YIM 130001 may be achieved via different mechanism. This may also imply that the molecular target of geninthiocin B is different from that of berninamycin, despite very close similarity between their chemical structures and the same size of the macrocycle.

It has been speculated that some thiopeptides, including thiostreptone commonly used in veterinary medicine and research, may also serve at sub-inhibitory concentrations as signal molecules for physiological development or quorum-sensing in bacteria (Holmes et al., 1993). Keeping in mind the fact that thiopeptides at higher concentration have strong antibacterial activity (Bagley et al., 2005), a likely other ecological function of geninthiocin B could be defense against predatory bacteria and/or means of competition for nutritional sources.
