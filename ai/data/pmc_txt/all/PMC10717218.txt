Results Results SLCG_7083 protein contains a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain at the N-terminus, whose homologous proteins are highly distributed in Streptomyces. The inactivation of the SLCG_7083 gene indicated that SLCG_7083 promotes glucose utilization, slows mycelial growth and affects sporulation in S. lincolnensis. Comparative transcriptomic analysis further revealed that SLCG_7083 represses eight genes involved in sporulation, cell division and lipid metabolism, and activates two genes involved in carbon metabolism.

Keywords Background Background Streptomycetes are well known for their abundant secondary metabolites that are significant resource of candidate drug, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, anticancer, and immunosuppress agents [1]. Their complex life activities, including spore germination, mycelial growth and differentiation, primary and secondary metabolism, are strictly and precisely regulated by multiple levels of intertwined regulation [2]. The first step in the regulatory process is to sense physical or chemical signals, which perform by signal sensors. Streptomycetes are well known for their abundant secondary metabolites that are significant resource of candidate drug, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, anticancer, and immunosuppress agents [1]. Their complex life activities, including spore germination, mycelial growth and differentiation, primary and secondary metabolism, are strictly and precisely regulated by multiple levels of intertwined regulation [2]. The first step in the regulatory process is to sense physical or chemical signals, which perform by signal sensors. The Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain was first discovered in eukaryotes and named after three proteins: period circadian protein (Per), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter protein (Arnt) and single-minded protein (Sim). In various organisms, the PAS domain of proteins plays an important role in signal transmission and cellular regulation. PAS domain exists in many proteins and can bind with a variety of ligands, leading to the domain triggering specific cellular reactions or making proteins containing this domain sensitive to additional physical or chemical signals. Different PAS protein has the ability to sense redox potential, light, oxygen, energy level, carboxylic acid, fatty acid and other stimuli, and participates in cell development, virulence, sporulation, hypoxia adaptation, circadian rhythm, metabolism, and gene regulation and expression [3]. The PAS domains detect sensory input signals by binding cofactors or ligands. When stimulated, this domain can mediate or regulate protein-protein interactions by binding to cofactors in its hydrophobic center. Like other signal transduction systems, proteins containing PAS domains are modular: PAS sensor (input) domains detect various physical and chemical stimuli and correspondingly regulate the activity of effector (output) domains, such as catalysis or binding to DNA. PAS protein is usually intrasellar, but it can monitor the external and internal environment. One way for prokaryotic PAS proteins to sense the environment is to detect changes in the electron transport system as an early warning system for the decline of cell energy level. The PAS proteins usually combine with DNA binding domain, forming transcription regulators in prokaryotic. A PAS domain-containing regulator with a YheO-like PAS6 domain linked to a helix-turn-helix domain was identified in Campylobacter jejuni, which modulated the flagella-flagella interactions [4]. The PAS-LuxR regulator PteF cross regulates the biosynthesis of filipin and oligomycin in Streptomyces avermitilis [5]. Another PAS-LuxR regulator PimM, controls the polyene macrolide biosynthesis by directly binding eight promoters of pimaricin genes in Streptomyces natalensis [6].

Another PAS-LuxR regulator PimM, controls the polyene macrolide biosynthesis by directly binding eight promoters of pimaricin genes in Streptomyces natalensis [6]. The PAS domain-containing protein MmyB is a positive regulator on methylenomycin biosynthesis, and encoded by methylenomycin (mmy) BGC located in a giant linear plasmid (SCP1) in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [7]. MmyB is induced and activated by the extracellular signal molecule 2-alkyl-4-hydroxymethylfuran-3-carboxylic acids synthesized by S. coelicolor A3(2), thus initiating the synthesis of methylenomycin [8]. Besides PAS domain, MmyB also contains a xenobiotic response element (XRE) family transmembrane DNA binding domain [9]. The MmyB homologous proteins are widely distributed in actinomycetes and belong to a new transcription factor family, which all contain PAS domains named MmyB domains. MltR (PDB ID 3pxp) (Caur_2278) is the first protein with determined crystal structure in the MmyB transcription factor family, and it was reported to bind to fatty acid (myristic acid) ligand [10]. The active form of MLTR is homodimer, in which each monomer is composed of an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a PAS related domain involved in ligand binding at the C-terminal. Sequence analysis shows that the N-terminal DNA binding domain of MLTR contains a helix turn helix (HTH) structure, also belonging to the XRE transcription factor family. The C-terminal of MLTR is composed of a profilin-like fold core containing six strands that form an antiparallel β-sheet and nine α-helix, similar to the prototypical PAS domain. Bioinformatics analysis showed that MmyB family homologous proteins were related to antibiotics and fatty acid metabolism in actinomycetes. The homologous gene SGR_ 6891 in Streptomyces griseus is adjacent to A factor synthetase gene asfA, and is induced by A factor (γ-butyrolactone) regulating antibiotic synthesis and cell differentiation [11].

Streptomyces lincolnensis is well known for producing the clinically important antimicrobial agent lincomycin. The genomes of S. lincolnensis had been sequenced in three strains, S. lincolnensis NRRL 2936 [12], S. lincolnensis LC-G [13] and S. lincolnensis B48 [14], which facilitates the related research on genome-wide insights into metabolism and regulation. LmbU, encoded by lincomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (lmb cluster), was reported as a significant pleiotropic transcriptional regulator in lincomycin biosynthesis by entirely activating the lmb cluster and regulating nineteen non-lmb genes involved in multi-drug flux to self-resistance, nitrate and sugar transmembrane transport and utilization, and redox metabolisms [15]. The ATP-binding cassette family F ATPase LmrC encoded by the resistance gene in lmb cluster, in addition to its own resistance function, also participated in the regulation of lincomycin biosynthesis by antibiotic-driven signaling cascade transduction [16]. Six regulators encoded by non-lmb genes were all identified to participate in regulation of the lmb cluster, that are the nitrogen regulator GlnR [17], the TetR family regulator SLCG_2919 [18], the developmental regulator BldD [19], the A-factor AdpA [20], the leucine-responsive regulatory protein Lrp [21] and the developmental regulator RamR [22]. In addition, they also play other regulation roles in S. lincolnensis: GlnR up-regulates the transcription of nitrate-specific ABC transporter and nitrate assimilation genes [17]; SLCG_2919 negatively regulates its adjacent gene SLCG_2920 encoding a lincomycin resistance protein [18]; BldD positively regulates the sporulation [19]; AdpA activates the bldA gene for the cascade regulation of lincomycin biosynthesis [20]; Lrp is transcriptionally self-inhibited and activates its adjacent gene SLCG_3127 encoding LysE protein; RamR affects cell growth in S. lincolnensis [22]. Besides, the redox-sensing regulator Rex directly controls the expression of glnR and ramC, to indirectly regulate lincomycin biosynthesis and morphology, respectively [23].

Then 56 SLCG_7083-like proteins were used to construct a phylogenetic tree (Fig. S1). The phylogenetic tree showed that the SLCG_7083-like proteins are highly distributed regulators in Streptomyces (Fig. S2), and are conservative with a PAS domain (smart00091). Most of the proteins were located on the branches containing SLCG_7083 in S. lincolnensis, which were separated from the branch of DicA considered to be a transcriptional inhibitor.

Functionality of SLCG_7083 regulating mycelial growth and sporulation Functionality of SLCG_7083 regulating mycelial growth and sporulation Functionality of SLCG_7083 regulating mycelial growth and sporulation To characterize the SLCG_7083 gene, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated in-frame SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 was constructed (Fig. 2a), which was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 2b), and further verified by DNA sequencing (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the SLCG_7083 complementation strain ST718 and SLCG_7083 overexpression strain ST717 were also constructed. As shown in Fig. 3a, the mycelial growth and spore differentiation of the SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 were slightly faster than that of the original strain SyBE2901, and the mycelial and spore quantity of ST708 was also more abundant than that of SyBE2901. And when complementing the SLCG_7083 gene, that all restored. Overexpressing of the SLCG_7083 gene showed no obvious difference to SyBE2901. when cultured in liquid medium, the mycelia of ST708 strain were fluffier and slower settling, compare to that of SyBE2901 strain. The scanning electron microscope assay further indicated that the mycelia of ST708 strain were thinner than that of SyBE2901 (Fig. 3b).

Fermentation broth samples were collected at different times to detect the yield, dry cell weight and residual glucose. The curves of glucose concentration during fermentation with 4%~12% initial glucose concentration were shown in Fig. 5(a). Under the condition of low initial glucose concentration (4% and 6%), the glucose consumption of ST708 and was basically same to that of SyBE2901 (the curve coincided), and they were all consumed in the early stage of fermentation (2th or 3.5th day); Under the condition of medium initial glucose concentration (8% and 10%), the glucose consumption rate of ST708 was slower than that of SyBE2901, and was consumed on the 5th and 7th day respectively; Under the condition of high initial glucose concentration (12%), 23.52 g/L glucose remained in strain ST708 on the 7th day, while only 1.91 g/L glucose remained in strain SyBE2901.

When glucose was sufficient, the biomass of ST708 and SyBE2901 increased with time, but when glucose was insufficient, the biomass decreased. Under the initial glucose concentration of 6%, 8% and 10%, the SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 had relatively sufficient carbon source and higher biomass than the original strain SyBE2901.

Under the initial glucose concentration of 6%, 8% and 10%, the SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 had relatively sufficient carbon source and higher biomass than the original strain SyBE2901. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the lincomycin yield of SyBE2901 increased as the increasing of initial glucose concentration. When the initial glucose concentration was 4%, 6% and 8%, the lincomycin yield of SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 all reached the highest on 6th day. When the initial glucose concentration was increased to 10%, the lincomycin yield of ST708 reached the highest point on 6th day, which was even higher than that of SyBE2901 on 7th day. When the initial glucose concentration was increased to 12%, the lincomycin yield of SyBE2901 was still increasing due to the availability of sufficient carbon source, and the maximum yield reached 3.24 g/L on day 7, which was 21% higher than that of 10% initial glucose. Due to the abundant carbon source, the biomass of ST708 was increasing, and the mycelia was more inclined to grow by themselves and synthesize primary metabolites, resulting in relatively slowing down the synthesis of lincomycin, which is a secondary metabolite of S. lincolnensis.

Glucose is the main component of the fermentation medium, which provides carbon source and energy for S. lincolnensis. Since the initial glucose concentration was different, the yield of lincomycin was reanalyzed in combination with glucose consumption, and the amounts of lincomycin synthesis per unit glucose consumption were calculated shown in Fig. 5(d). Since the yield of lincomycin was not high with low initial concentration of glucose, only the initial glucose concentration of 8%, 10% and 12% was analyzed. According to the Fig. 5(d), on day 7, the amounts of lincomycin synthesized by SyBE2901 per unit glucose consumption all reached the highest with the initial glucose concentration of 8%, 10% and 12%, and the yields were basically equivalent. With 8% initial glucose concentration, SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 could synthesize 30.35 mg lincomycin per gram of glucose consumption on day 7, which was the highest yield of lincomycin compared to that with 10% and 12% initial glucose concentration. This result indicated that, for lincomycin production, deletion of SLCG_7083 gene could achieve more higher utilization rate of glucose.

To obtain insight into the changes in gene expression levels between SyBE2901 and ST708, RNA was isolated and subjected to whole-transcriptome sequencing via ssRNA-seq. Approximately 12.82 ~ 14.73 million 150 bp paired-end clean reads (1.92 ~ 2.21G data) per sample were obtained after cleaning and checking the reads quality. Approximately 95.21%~98.91% of clean reads were aligned uniquely to the S. lincolnensis genome. The correlation clustering among the two biological replicates of each sample was conducted based on the expression level of all genes. All biological replicates (three RNA samples for each strain) showed correlation coefficients over 0.8, indicating good reproducibility between biological replicates.

To investigate transcriptional regulation effects of SLCG_7083, the whole transcriptomes were compared. Volcano plot was presented to identify genes with both high fold change and significance between the original strain SyBE2901 and the SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 (Fig. 6). Compared to SyBE2901, the transcription expression of 11 genes were statistically different in the ST708. No reads mapped to the SLCG_7083 gene showing the successful deletion of the SLCG_7083 in strain ST708. Besides SLCG_7083 gene, 2 genes displayed decreased transcription levels, and 8 gene displayed increased transcription level in the ST708 compared toSyBE2901. Of which, six genes were selected to perform semi-quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. S3) of the original strain SyBE2901, the SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708, and the SLCG_7083 complemention strain ST718. semi-quantitative PCR analysis results in SyBE2901and ST708 were consistent with those of ssRNA-Seq. Furthermore, after complete SLCG_7083 gene to ST708, the expressions of those six were restored. Deleting SLCG_7083 did not cause transcriptional differences in lmb gene cluster, suggesting that SLCG_7083 didn’t control lincomycin biosynthesis, which was consistent with the previous fermentation results.

Besides SLCG_7083 gene, 2 genes displayed decreased transcription levels, and 8 gene displayed increased transcription level in the ST708 compared toSyBE2901. Of which, six genes were selected to perform semi-quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. S3) of the original strain SyBE2901, the SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708, and the SLCG_7083 complemention strain ST718. semi-quantitative PCR analysis results in SyBE2901and ST708 were consistent with those of ssRNA-Seq. Furthermore, after complete SLCG_7083 gene to ST708, the expressions of those six were restored. Deleting SLCG_7083 did not cause transcriptional differences in lmb gene cluster, suggesting that SLCG_7083 didn’t control lincomycin biosynthesis, which was consistent with the previous fermentation results. Volcano plot was presented to identify genes with both high fold change and significance between the original strain SyBE2901 and the SLCG_7083 deletion strain ST708 (Fig. 6).

SLCG_3180 gene encoded a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, involved in the phosphorylation on the serine/threonine and tyrosine residues of proteins in Streptomyces in response to developmental phases. It was predicted to be a membrane-bound protein for at least three transmembrane helical regions in its N-terminal, using the transmembrane helix prediction software TMHMM. As shown in the Fig. S4, the conserved domain analysis of SLCG_3180 showed that the 146–320 amino acid region was predicted to be stage II sporulation protein E (SpoIIE) domain (pfam07228), indicating that SLCG_3180 belonged to the characteristic SpoIIE domain phosphatase protein family. Previous report showed that SpoIIE is a bifunctional protein, which takes Mn2+ as a metal cofactor, and not only activates the forespore compartment-specific transcription factor σF by dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA-P, but also participates in oligomerization stabilizes FtsZ during asymmetric septum formation [24]. Therefore, it was speculated that SLCG_7083 affected the formation of correct membrane during S. lincolnensis sporulation and cell division by negatively regulating SLCG_3180.

SLCG_4162 gene encoded a SsgA regulator, which belong to actinomycete specific regulatory protein family that controls cell division and spore maturation in Streptomyces [25]. The morpho protein SsgA controls all processes of cell wall remodeling, such as spore germination, mycelial tip growth, branching and septum formation [26]. SsgA mediated localization of SsgB to recruit the tubulin FtsZ at the position where the septum will be formed, thereby activating the cell division of sporogenesis [27]. It was reported that overexpression of ssgA in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans led to a sharp increase in vegetative mycelium and fragmentation of the mycelial clumps, then significantly increased the growth rate [28]. This is consistent with the fermentation result of deleting SLCG_7083 in S. lincolnensis.

Therefore, SLCG_7083 regulated spore formation and mycelial division by inhibiting the expression of SpoIIE and SsgA protein in S. lincolnensis. Therefore, SLCG_7083 regulated spore formation and mycelial division by inhibiting the expression of SpoIIE and SsgA protein in S. lincolnensis. Therefore, SLCG_7083 regulated spore formation and mycelial division by inhibiting the expression of SpoIIE and SsgA protein in S. lincolnensis.

It was reported that four C7-cyclitol derived carbasugars were isolated from S. lincolnensis DSM 40,355 [32], suggesting that SLCG_5038 and SLCG_5041 were involved in C7-cyclitol biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis. Deleting SLCG_7083, resulted in down-regulated expression of SLCG_5038 and SLCG_5041 in C7-cyclitol BGC, which reduced use of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate as substrate, following by slowing down the consumption of glucose.
