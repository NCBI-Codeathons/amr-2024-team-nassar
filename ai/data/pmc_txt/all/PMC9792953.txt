The first part of the protocol is optimized from the QIAGEN genomic-tip extraction protocol2, where increased incubation times and mechanical treatment efficiently lyses the cells. The second part of the protocol describes the steps for sequencing by Oxford Nanopore using the SQK-RBK110.96 kit for rapid barcoding, optimized for running 12–16 genomes on a MinION flow cell in ∼ 24 h with an increased read length compared to the original protocol. The third part of the protocol describes assembly, polishing, and quality control (QC) of the finished genomes.

If contamination is present, one or more of the following signs may be observed in the culture after one day of inoculation:3.Under an optical microscope, the typical filamentous morphology of Actinobacteria is not observed (see Figure 1).Figure 1Comparison and examination of contamination under a bright field optical microscope in two different grown culturesIn the left slide (1000 ×, scale bar 10 µm), a mycelial bacterial morphology characteristic of Streptomyces can be observed. In the right slide (1000 ×, scale bar 10 µm), the bacillary morphology indicates that the culture does not correspond to Actinobacteria.

In the end, this should result in 250 mg of harvested cell pellet per sample.8.Inspect the growth of your liquid culture and note whether the cells tend to grow in an aggregated or turbid manner, Figure 2.a.In an aggregated culture the cells form small lumps and are not suspended in the medium. Thus, the culture exhibits little to no turbidity instead growing in a flocculent or sedimented manner. This is a common growth pattern for Actinobacteria.Note: Aggregation of the cells decreases the area available to enzymes during cell wall degradation, and as such, they must be ground to powder in liquid nitrogen (LN) as part of the extraction process.b.In a turbid culture the cells grow suspended in the medium producing the opaque/cloudy cultures common for many lab-grown bacterial cultures.

Ideally, samples with concentrations of ∼ 50 ng/μL (± 10 ng/μL) should be used to promote equimolarity. If the samples do not meet these guidelines, it is advisable to dilute the samples at least one day before preparing the libraries, allowing HMW DNA to be suspended in the final volume at 4°C, and remeasure the DNA concentration as HMW DNA dilutions are highly inaccurate.Note: The SQK-RBK110.96 protocol has been optimized for the present workflow by modifying the following elements: (1) The initial amount of HMW DNA per sample has been increased from 50 ng to 600 ng and is adjusted to a volume of 27 μL with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (instead of 9 μL and nuclease-free water). (2) To maintain the volume proportion, 3 μL of Rapid Barcode is added to the diluted samples.

Ideally, samples with concentrations of ∼ 50 ng/μL (± 10 ng/μL) should be used to promote equimolarity. If the samples do not meet these guidelines, it is advisable to dilute the samples at least one day before preparing the libraries, allowing HMW DNA to be suspended in the final volume at 4°C, and remeasure the DNA concentration as HMW DNA dilutions are highly inaccurate.Note: The SQK-RBK110.96 protocol has been optimized for the present workflow by modifying the following elements: (1) The initial amount of HMW DNA per sample has been increased from 50 ng to 600 ng and is adjusted to a volume of 27 μL with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (instead of 9 μL and nuclease-free water). (2) To maintain the volume proportion, 3 μL of Rapid Barcode is added to the diluted samples. Hence, the concentration of HMW DNA in relation to barcode has increased by a factor of 4 in comparison with the commercial protocol. (3) For the SPRI clean-up step, the quantity of beads has been modified from 1 × to 0.4 × times the library volume, to remove small fragments and other impurities. In addition, the release of HMW DNA during elution was increased by incubation for 2 min at 50°C.49.Preheat the thermocycler to 30°C and the heating block to 50°C.50.Handle kit components as shown in Table 2:Table 2Conditions for kit reagents (modified from the original Oxford Nanopore SKQ-RBK110.96 protocol)Reagent1st: Sample storage/handling2nd: Sample centrifugation3rd: Sample mixingRapid Barcode plate (RB96)Keep in the freezer until immediately before useSpin down brieflyMix by pipettingRapid Adapter F (RAP F)Keep in the freezer until immediately before useSpin down brieflyMix by pipettingSPRI beads (SPRI)Place at room temperature (∼ 24°C) for 30 min before useSpin down brieflyVortex immediately before useSequencing Buffer II (SBII)Thaw at room temperature (∼ 24°C)Spin down brieflyMix by vortexing and spin down brieflyLoading Beads II (LBII)Thaw at room temperature (∼ 24°C)Spin down brieflyMix by pipetting immediately before useElution Buffer (EB)That at room temperature (∼ 24°C)Spin down brieflyMix by pipettingFlush Buffer (FB)That at room temperature (∼ 24°C)Spin down brieflyMix by vortexing and spin down brieflyFlush Tether (FLT)That at room temperature (∼ 24°C)Spin down brieflyMix by pipetting51.Adjust the volume of each sample following the ratio of 600 ng template DNA to 3 μL of Rapid Barcode:a.In PCR tubes, transfer 600 ng genomic DNA per sample adjusting the volume to 27 μL with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0.52.Spin down the Rapid Barcode plate in a microplate centrifuge.

Thus, 12–16 samples can be sequenced per flow cell in <24 h.73.Allow the flow cell R9.4.1 to come to room temperature (∼ 24°C) for at least 5 min before inserting it into the MinION Mk1B device.74.Determine the number of active pores in the flow cell by selecting “Check flow cell” in MinKNOW.75.Open the priming port and check for a small air bubble under the cover.76.Draw back a small volume to remove any bubble:a.Insert a P1000 tip into the priming port.b.Turn the pipette’s thumbwheel anti-clockwise until the dial shows a gain of no more than 20–30 μL or until a small volume of storage buffer (yellow color) is entering the pipette tip.CRITICAL: The introduction of air bubbles into the flow cell in any step will permanently damage the integrity of the pore array.77.Prepare the flow cell priming mix by adding 30 μL of FLT to 1,170 μL of FB, and mix by pipetting, being careful to avoid foaming/air bubbles.Note: Keep the FB-FLT mix at room temperature (∼ 24°C), not on ice.78.Load 800 μL of the priming mix into the flow cell via the priming port and wait 5 min.79.In a new tube, prepare the library for loading as follows (total volume 75 μL):a.37.5 μL SBII sequencing buffer.b.25.5 μL LBII loading beads (mix immediately before use).c.DNA library 12 μL.80.Complete flow cell priming:a.Gently lift the SpotON sample port cover to make the SpotON sample port accessible.b.Load 200 μL of the priming mix into the flow cell via the priming port (not the SpotON sample port).81.Mix the prepared library gently by pipetting just before loading to resuspend the loading beads.82.Load all 75 μL of sample into the flow cell via the SpotON sample port in a dropwise fashion.83.Turn back the SpotON sample port cover, making sure the bung enters the SpotON port, close the priming port and close the MinION lid.

Potential solution Potential solution Potential solution •Use Filtlong (https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong) to remove the shortest and lowest quality reads. We suggest removing 30%, 50%, 75% or even 90% of data, aiming to remove the largest amount of data while still having a coverage of 50. When all replicons are assembled into contigs where any assembly repeat graph branching can be explained by biology (i.e., the inverted repeats of Streptomyces, see Figure 5, sample E), it is indicative of a completely assembled genome, as long as the coverage is still substantial. In some cases, a coverage <50 can yield a complete genome.•Use a different genome assembly program. Even though Flye performs consistently well, using another assembly program might help alleviate an assembly issue. We suggest using one of the assemblers benchmarked in Wick and Holt.12•Generate more data. After stopping a sequencing run, the flow cell can be washed and reloaded with sequencing libraries from samples, which did not fully assemble.

If this problem is not resolved by using a different assembly program, we suggest to manually concatenate the repeat graph edges and verify their orientation by mapping the Nanopore reads and inspecting the edge borders closely. Then, all three polishing steps (Flye, Polypolish, POLCA) needs to be repeated on the concatenated genome. •Use Filtlong (https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong) to remove the shortest and lowest quality reads.
