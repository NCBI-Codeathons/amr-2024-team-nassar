 Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases.
Unfortunately, the development of antibiotic resistance threatens
our current therapeutic arsenal, which has necessitated the discovery
and development of novel antibiotics against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Cyclomarin
A and rufomycin I are structurally related cyclic heptapeptides assembled
by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which show potent anti-Mtb activity with a new cellular target, the caseinolytic
protein ClpC1. An NRPS adenylation domain survey using DNA extracted
from ∼2000 ecologically diverse soils found low cyclomarin/rufomycin
biosynthetic diversity. In this survey, a family of cyclomarin/rufomycin-like
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) that encode metamarin, an uncommon
cyclomarin congener with potent activity against both Mtb H37Rv and multidrug-resistant Mtb clinical isolates
was identified. Metamarin effectively inhibits Mtb growth in murine macrophages and increases the activities of ClpC1
ATPase and the associated ClpC1/P1/P2 protease complex, thus causing
cell death by uncontrolled protein degradation. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a
major public health threat and is recognized by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as the leading infectious disease killer worldwide.1 The continued emergence of multidrug-resistant
and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has made the prevention and treatment of
TB very challenging.2 The discovery and
development of anti-Mtb drugs with new cellular targets
is therefore a high priority. Cyclomarin A and rufomycin I (ilamycin
C1) are chemically similar cyclic heptapeptide antibiotics3−6 (Figure 1a) that
are highly potent (nanomolar MIC) against multidrug-resistant Mtb as well as other pathogenic nontuberculosis mycobacteria.7,8 They have been of particular interest for the development of TB
therapeutics as they have a novel mode of action by targeting cellular
proteostasis via the protease regulatory chaperone ATPase (ClpC1).7−10 The biosynthesis of the cyclic peptide scaffolds for cyclomarin
A and rufomycin I follow the colinear extension model of modular NRPS
systems.11−13 The biosynthesis of cyclomarin A involves a heptamodular
NRPS that directly incorporates the nonproteinogenic amino acids N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)-Trp (prenylated-Trp, p-Trp) and
3-amino-3,5-dimethyl-4-hexenoic acid (ADH) into the growing peptide.
In contrast the β-hydroxy, δ-hydroxy and β-methoxy
substituents seen on p-Trp1, Leu2 and Phe4 (respectively) are thought to be installed while the proteinogenic
substrates are tethered to their PCPs.11 In rufomycin, the heptamodular NRPS uses three nonproteinogenic
amino acids p-Trp, 3-nitro-l-Tyr and L-2-amino-4-hexenoic
acid (AHA). The l-Leu residue incorporated at the seventh
position of the peptide undergoes post-NRPS cyclization with the amide
of neighboring l-Leu to generate the 6-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-amino-2-piperidinone
moiety.12,13 It should be noted that while ADH of cyclomarin
A and AHA of rufomycin I bear a structural resemblance to one another
and occur at analogous positions in the two peptides, they represent
convergent biosyntheses involving homologation of a valine-derived
isobutyraldehyde with pyruvate (cyclomarin A) and a trimodular polyketide
synthase assembly line (rufomycin I).11−13 Figure 1Sequence tag-based screen of cyclomarin/rufomycin-like BGCs. a)

here we focus on soil metagenomes. Due to the complexity of an individual
soil microbiome, it is challenging to sequence soil metagenomes to
a depth that permits the discovery of rare natural product BGCs.14−16 We have developed a culture-independent BGC discovery strategy that
uses degenerate PCR primers targeting conserved biosynthetic genes
to explore secondary metabolite diversity in complex metagenomes.17−19 In this method, sequenced PCR amplicons (Natural Product Sequence
Tags, NPSTs) derived from either metagenomic libraries or DNA extracted
directly from environmental samples are aligned to a reference collection
of domain sequences from characterized metabolites to identify BGCs
of interest.17−19 In this phylogenetic analysis, amplicons that cluster
together with domain sequences from BGCs of interest are used to guide
the recovery of new BGCs from metagenomic libraries. Natural products
are then accessed from metagenome-derived BGCs by heterologous expression.
In this study, NRPS A-domain sequence tags from ∼2000 ecologically
and geographically diverse soils were used to evaluate cyclomarin/rufomycin-family
biosynthetic diversity in the soil microbiome. This information was
used to guide the search for other cyclomarin/rufomycin-like structures,
resulting in the discovery of metamarin, a novel anti-Mtb compound that may represent a simplified evolutionary precursor
to cyclomarin A. Results

Survey of Cyclomarin/Rufomycin-Family Biosynthetic Diversity In the biosynthesis of cyclomarin A and rufomycin I, the same amino
acids are incorporated at three positions of their macrocyclic peptide
scaffolds. These include the use of p-Trp by the first A-domain, and
Leu by the third and sixth A-domains (Figure 1a).11−13 A phylogenetic analysis of all
cyclomarin/rufomycin A-domain sequences indicated that the domains
responsible for incorporating p-Trp are most highly conserved among
these two evolutionarily related BGCs (Figure 1b) and thus we focused on this domain to
track cyclomarin/rufomycin-like BGCs in NPST data from soil metagenomes.
DNA extracted from ∼2,000 soils was used as template in PCR
reactions with A-domain-specific degenerate primers (Figure 1c and Supporting Information (SI) Table S1). The resulting amplicons were sequenced
and soil A-domain NPSTs were compared by BlastN to the cyclomarin
A and rufomycin I p-Trp A-domain sequences. An A-domain phylogenetic
tree (Figure 1d) derived
from the sequence tags that are most closely related to these A-domains
contains three closely related clades that we predicted were derived
from cyclomarin/rufomycin congener BGCs. The largest group of sequences
falls into a clade that contains the cyclomarin A p-Trp A-domain and
a second smaller clade contains the rufomycin I A-domain sequences.
The third smaller clade contains no known p-Trp A-domain sequences,
which suggested to us that it might arise from BGCs that encode a
novel cyclomarin/rufomycin congener. To identify the potential new
congener encoded by BGCs associated with this new clade, and further
explore the existing cyclomarin/rufomycin clades, we turned our sequencing
efforts to a collection of archived metagenomic libraries from which
target BGCs can be readily recovered and the metabolites they produce

BGCs from Metagenomic Cosmid Libraries Cyclomarin/rufomycin-Like
BGCs from Metagenomic Cosmid Libraries As part of our ongoing
soil metagenomic-guided natural product discovery program, we have
constructed a series of saturated cosmid libraries to use for recovering
BGCs of interest.15,16 Each library contains more than
20-million unique cosmid clones that are arrayed in sets of 384 subpools
containing on average ∼25 000 unique clones. Purified
cosmid DNA from each pool was screened with the same A-domain degenerate
primers that were used to screen soil DNA. BlastN analysis of this
collection of library-derived A-domain amplicon sequences identified
eight cyclomarin/rufomycin-like p-Trp NPSTs from six different eDNA
libraries. These NPSTs span all three subclades we identified in the
original soil screen, suggesting that the BGCs captured in our archived
metagenomic libraries are representative of the cyclomarin/rufomycin-like
biosynthetic diversity that we identified in ∼2000 soil metagenomes
(Figure 2a). Using
the specific metagenomic libraries from which these sequences were
amplified, we recovered collections of overlapping cosmid clones associated
with two amplicons from the cyclomarin A clade, one from the rufamycin
clade, and two from the novel clade. Each was sequenced, assembled,
and annotated to reveal a cyclomarin/rufomycin-like BGC (Figure 2b). As part of our ongoing

libraries. As suggested by our NPST analysis, two recovered BGCs (DFD0097_w188_w594
and DFD0383_w617_w54) are predicted to encode cyclomarin. This prediction
is based on an A-domain substrate specificity analysis and the collection
of biosynthetic genes present in each BGC (Figure 2b). Although the entire BGC associated with
the rufamycin-like NPST was not recovered from the metagenomic library,
the portion we did recover (UT60_w205) closely resembles the rufomycin
BGC. Most of the proteins encoded by UT60_w205 show high sequence
identity (46–70%) to proteins found in the rufomycin BGC (SI Figure S1). In addition, the substrate specificity
prediction for the first A-domain together with the collection biosynthetic
enzymes encoded on this clone suggest that this eDNA BGC produces
all three of the rare building blocks found in rufomycin: p-Trp, 3-nitro-Tyr
and 2-amino-4-hexenoic acid (AHA) (SI Figure S1). Interestingly, this BGC is predicted to encode a ClpX-like ATPase.20,21 Considering that rufomycin targets the ClpC1 ATPase,7,10clpX might function as a self-resistance gene.22,23 The two BGCs recovered (DFD0097_w371_w80 and DFD1080_w495_w282),
that are associated with NPSTs from the clade without any previously
known sequences, are 90% identical to each other and predicted to
encode identical collections of tailoring enzymes. Based on A-domain
amino acid specificity predictions, they are predicted to encode a
novel cyclomarin-like heptapeptide with the following sequence: p-Trp1-N-Me-Leu2-Val3-Phe4-Val5-N-Me-Leu6-Val7 (Figure 2b).
We have called these the metamarin (metagenomic
cyclomarin) or met BGCs. Finally,
to determine whether other clades in the p-Trp A-domain phylogenetic
tree were derived from BGCs that might also encode cyclomarin/rufomycin-like
natural products, we recovered and sequenced cosmid clones associated
with five additional A-domain NPSTs distributed around the A-domain
phylogenetic tree (Figure 1d). All of these BGCs are predicted to encoded NPRS- or hybrid
NRPS-PKS-derived structures that are not related to cyclomarin or
rufomycin. While we did not exhaustively sample all clades in the
p-Trp A-domain phylogenetic tree, this analysis suggests that NPSTs
derived from cyclomarin/rufomycin-like BGCs are likely restricted
to the clades we have explored in this study. Based on the frequency
that we see NPSTs from different A-domain clades, the most common
BGCs from this family encode cyclomarin, followed by rufomycin and
finally metamarin (Figure 1d). This may explain why metamarin remained undiscovered in
previous natural product discovery efforts. Herein, we describe the
characterization of a new cyclomarin-like natural product that is
encoded by the met BGCs. As suggested by our NPST analysis, two recovered BGCs (DFD0097_w188_w594
and DFD0383_w617_w54) are predicted to encode cyclomarin. This prediction
is based on an A-domain substrate specificity analysis and the collection

Expression, Structure Elucidation and Predicted Biosynthesis of Metamarin In silico analysis of cosmids DFD0097_w371 and DFD1080_w495 suggested
that both contain entire cyclomarin-like BGCs (Figure 3a). The integration-resistance [ΦC31-acc(3)IV] cassette from the plasmid pOJ436 was separately
inserted into the two cosmids using traditional molecular cloning
methods,24 thus generating Streptomyces integrative cosmids, Int_DFD0097_w371 and Int_DFD1080_w495 (SI Figure S2). For heterologous expression, the
two integrative cosmids and the empty pOJ436 vector were individually
introduced into Streptomyces albus J1074. The exconjugants
were fermented in R5a medium, and mature cultures were extracted using
HP20 resin. LC-MS analysis indicated that both cultures produced a
BGC specific peak with the same retention time and mass (m/z 997.79) (Figure 3b), suggesting these two very closely related BGCs
(∼90% nucleotide sequence identity for homologous genes) confer
the production of the same metabolite to S. albus. As shown in Figure 3b, S. albus harboring Int_DFD0097_w371 had a higher
titer compared to that harboring Int_DFD1080_w495. The metamarin BGCs
in these clones have the same gene organization and show ∼90%
overall sequence identity. These small changes in sequence likely
cause the observed difference in titer. Culture broth extracts from S. albus harboring Int_DFD0097_w371 were used to purify

HP20 resin. LC-MS analysis indicated that both cultures produced a
BGC specific peak with the same retention time and mass (m/z 997.79) (Figure 3b), suggesting these two very closely related BGCs
(∼90% nucleotide sequence identity for homologous genes) confer
the production of the same metabolite to S. albus. As shown in Figure 3b, S. albus harboring Int_DFD0097_w371 had a higher
titer compared to that harboring Int_DFD1080_w495. The metamarin BGCs
in these clones have the same gene organization and show ∼90%
overall sequence identity. These small changes in sequence likely
cause the observed difference in titer. Culture broth extracts from S. albus harboring Int_DFD0097_w371 were used to purify
the clone-specific metabolite (23.3 mg/L), which we have named metamarin
(1). Figure 3Heterologous expression, structure and predicted biosynthesis of 1. (a) BGC of 1. (b) LCMS analysis of culture

(d) Chemical structure of 1. The structure of 1 was determined using a combination
of high-resolution MS and 1D/2D NMR data (SI Figures S3–12 and Table 1). The molecular formula of 1 was determined
to be C55H82N8O10 by high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) from m/z 997.6102 [M+H–H2O]+ (calcd for C55H81N8O9+, 997.6121) (SI Figure S3a). The 1H–15N HSQC NMR spectrum contained
only five cross-peaks, immediately indicating the presence of five
proton-attached 15N atoms (δH 7.11, 7.20,
8.09, 8.20, and 8.60) with δH values characteristic
of five amide groups/functionalities. The 1H NMR spectrum
contained two singlet methyl resonances (δH 2.74
and 2.82), consistent with N-methyl substituents.
The 1H–15N HMBC NMR spectrum confirmed
that these signals correlate to two distinct 15N atoms
that bear no protons. These data indicated the presence of seven amino
acid residues, which was corroborated by seven distinct cross peaks
in the 1H–13C HSQC NMR spectrum with
δH and δC values diagnostic of the
amino acid α-position (4.03–4.88 and 54.5–60.3,
respectively) and by seven carbonyl resonances in the 13C NMR spectrum (δC 168.7–172.5). The structure
of each amino acid side chain was determined using COSY, 1H–13C HSQC and 1H–13C HMBC NMR spectra. Of note, the N-1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl
substituent was placed using a 1H–13C
HMBC NMR correlation from H-4 to C-12, and also using 1H–15N HMBC NMR correlations from H-4, H-13, H-15,
and H-16 to N-1’. A hydroxy substituent was placed at the β-position
of this same residue on the basis of chemical shifts at this position
(δH 5.33 and δC 69.3). The connectivity
of these seven partial structures was established using HMBC correlations
from the nitrogen-attached amide protons (or N-methyls)
of each residue to the carbonyl of its N-terminal
neighbor. The structure of 1 was determined using a combination
of high-resolution MS and 1D/2D NMR data (SI Figures S3–12 and Table 1). The molecular formula of 1 was determined

of the three Val residues and one N-Me-Leu residue
in 1.25 Based on comparison
of retention times of FDAA-derivatized standard amino acids to FDAA-derivatized
amino acids in the hydrolysate of 1, all Val residues
as well as the N-Me-Leu residue were determined to
be L-configured in 1. Compound 1 differs
from cyclomarin A at three amino acid positions. The p-Trp at position
one contains a double bond in 1 instead of an epoxide.

systems, starting with AD01-p-Trp and ending with AD07-Val (SI Figure S14). Subsequent peptide release and
macrocyclization are predicted to occur via the C-terminal thioesterase
(TE) domain of MetE. Furthermore, the methyltransferase (MT) domains
in the second and sixth modules of MetE are predicted to carry out
the observed N-methylation of AD02-Leu and AD06-Leu,
respectively (SI Figure S14). In a BlastP
search, most proteins encoded by the BGC of 1 returned
top hits that corresponded to homologues encoded by the cyclomarin
A BGC from Salinispora arenicola CNS-205 (Figure 3c). The N-prenyltransferase, MetG, is predicted to be responsible for N-prenylation of the tryptophan residue, thus generating
the unique, nonproteinogenic p-Trp building block (SI Figure S14). Based on high sequence similarity to enzymes
from cyclomarin A BGC, the cytochrome P450, and methyltransferase,
MetC and MetB, are predicted to be jointly involved in the β-oxidation/methylation
of AD04-Phe. Two additional oxidative enzymes, MetD and MetH, are
predicted to be involved in the β-hydroxylation of AD01-p-Trp
and δ-hydroxylation of AD02-Leu, respectively (Figure 3c). The absence of an epoxide
in the structure of 1 is supported by the fact that the
BGC of 1 does not contain a close relative of the cytochrome
P450 that is responsible for introducing the p-Trp epoxide in cyclomarin.
It is interesting to note that this gene is also missing from one
of the cyclomarin-like eDNA derived BGCs (DFD0097_w188_w594) suggesting
that it may actually encode the production of an N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)-Trp version of cyclomarin.11,27 Based on our final structure, the biosynthesis of 1 is expected to follow the colinear extension model of modular NRPS

proteolysis mimics that of cyclomarin A (Figure 4b,c).9 Concluding
Remarks Concluding
Remarks Compound 1, like cyclomarin A, appears to bind ClpC1
and cause cell death by deregulation of the ClpC1/P1/P2 protease complex.9 The most significant difference between cyclomarin
A and 1 is the change of the seventh amino acid from
ADH to valine (Figure 1a and 3d). The ADH moiety in cyclomarin A
is encoded by a four-gene cassette that is not present in the met BGC.11 Interestingly, in
rufomycin I this position has a different long hydrophobic nonproteinogenic
amino acid (AHA) that is encoded by a distinct PKS cassette (Figure 1a,d).12,13 It is not clear from the structure of cyclomarin A bound to Mtb ClpC1 what evolutionary advantage the incorporation
of these large hydrophobic building blocks would have over valine.
However, the selective recruitment of different multigene cassettes
to the cyclomarin A and rufomycin I BGCs suggests the switch from
a valine to a larger hydrophobic residue may be evolutionarily advantageous.
The discovery of three structurally distinct hydrophobic amino acids
at this position suggests the optimization of this site may still
be an ongoing process in nature and future exploration of this position
by chemical synthesis could prove productive. Compound 1, like cyclomarin A, appears to bind ClpC1

soils for AD01-p-Trp-Like Tags of Cyclomarin/Rufomycin-Family Compounds Screening
soils for AD01-p-Trp-Like Tags of Cyclomarin/Rufomycin-Family Compounds eDNA was extracted from soil samples using a previously established
protocol.17−19 Briefly, 25 g of each soil was heated in lysis buffer
(100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM EDTA, 1.5 M NaCl, 1% CTAB, 2% SDS, pH 8.0)
at 70 °C with gentle mixing for 2 h. Soil particulates were removed
from the lysate by centrifugation and 0.6 volumes of isopropanol were
added to the resulting supernatant for eDNA precipitation. After centrifugation
(12 000 rpm/10 min), the eDNA pellets were washed with 70%
ethanol and dried at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the eDNA pellets
were resuspended in 500 μL of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0), which were screened with A-domain degenerate primers (SI Table S1). To distinguish PCR amplicons generated
from each soil sample, Illumina MiSeq sequencing adapters and a collection
of different 8 bp barcodes as well as 1–4 bp spacer sequences
were added into the degenerate primers. PCR reaction mixtures (12
μL): 1X FailSafe G Buffer (Lucigen), 0.5 μL of each primer
(10 μM), 0.1 μL OmniTaq (DNA Polymerase Technology) and
100 ng eDNA. PCR reaction conditions for A-domain amplification: 95
°C/5 min, (95 °C/30 s, 63.5 °C/30 s, 72 °C/45
s) × 35 cycles, 72 °C/5 min. PCR reaction mixtures for each
soil sample were pooled and size-selected for ∼700-bp PCR products
by gel electrophoresis. The mixed PCR products were sequenced using
a MiSeq Reagent Nano Kit v3 on a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). The amplicons
were demultiplexed into the corresponding soil samples and trimmed
to 416 bp of the combined reads (240 bp of the forward read, a single
“N” spacer and 175 bp of the reverse-complemented reverse
read). Then, the trimmed reads were clustered at 95% identity across
the same soil samples, thus generating NPSTs of soil metagenomes.
These NPSTs were then searched using BlastN against the two manually
curated AD01-p-Trp sequences from cyclomarin A and rufomycin I BGCs.
A-domain amplicons that matched cyclomarin A or rufomycin I AD01-p-Trp
at an e-value <10–20 were considered as hits.
A multiple sequence alignment of all qualifying hit sequences was
generated using MUSCLE,31 and the resulting
alignment file was used to generate a maximum-likelihood tree with
FastTree. eDNA was extracted from soil samples using a previously established

mouse macrophages (Sigma-Aldrich) with the mc2 6206 strain
of Mtb harboring the mLux plasmid based on published
protocols.34,35 Briefly, the macrophages were
suspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich) to a
concentration of (4–5) × 105 cells/mL. Flat
bottom 96-well white plates were seeded with 100 μL of the macrophage
suspension and incubated overnight to allow cells to adhere to the
plates. The strain mc2 6206 with the mLux plasmid was grown
to mid log phase (OD600 = 0.5–0.7). Then, Mtb cultures were spun down, washed once in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich), and resuspended in DMEM containing 10%
FBS, pantothenic acid (50 μg/mL) and leucine (50 μg/mL).
The assay plates were then inoculated with 100 μL of mc2 6206 with the mLux plasmid at a multiplicity of infection
of 1:10. The plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow Mtb to infect the macrophages.
Then, the infection was washed with 100 μL PBS, and 100 μL
of DMEM containing 10% FBS, pantothenic acid and leucine was added
and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed twice with 100 μL
of PBS. Then 1 with serial dilutions (from 64 to 0.0004
μg/mL) in 100 μL per well of DMEM containing 10% FBS,
pantothenic acid and leucine were added to the plates at the desired
concentrations. Rifampicin was used as the control. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Residual Mtb cell
viability inside macrophages was determined by luminescence measurement
on a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). Dose response curves
were generated by nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism v8 and plotted
as the logarithm of concentration vs normalized percent cell viability.
The 1 concentration that caused inhibition of 50% cell
viability (IC50) was determined from the dose–response
curves. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate and the entire

concentrations. Rifampicin was used as the control. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Residual Mtb cell
viability inside macrophages was determined by luminescence measurement
on a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). Dose response curves
were generated by nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism v8 and plotted
as the logarithm of concentration vs normalized percent cell viability.
The 1 concentration that caused inhibition of 50% cell
viability (IC50) was determined from the dose–response
curves. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate and the entire
experiment was repeated twice. The activity of 1 against
intracellular Mtb was determined by infecting J774A.1
mouse macrophages (Sigma-Aldrich) with the mc2 6206 strain
of Mtb harboring the mLux plasmid based on published
protocols.34,35 Briefly, the macrophages were
suspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich) to a
concentration of (4–5) × 105 cells/mL. Flat
bottom 96-well white plates were seeded with 100 μL of the macrophage
suspension and incubated overnight to allow cells to adhere to the
plates. The strain mc2 6206 with the mLux plasmid was grown
to mid log phase (OD600 = 0.5–0.7). Then, Mtb cultures were spun down, washed once in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich), and resuspended in DMEM containing 10%
FBS, pantothenic acid (50 μg/mL) and leucine (50 μg/mL).
The assay plates were then inoculated with 100 μL of mc2 6206 with the mLux plasmid at a multiplicity of infection
of 1:10. The plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow Mtb to infect the macrophages.
Then, the infection was washed with 100 μL PBS, and 100 μL
of DMEM containing 10% FBS, pantothenic acid and leucine was added
and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed twice with 100 μL
of PBS. Then 1 with serial dilutions (from 64 to 0.0004
μg/mL) in 100 μL per well of DMEM containing 10% FBS,
pantothenic acid and leucine were added to the plates at the desired
concentrations. Rifampicin was used as the control. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Residual Mtb cell

and Purification of ClpC1 Overexpression
and Purification of ClpC1 The Mtb ClpC1
ORF was obtained by PCR from the genomic DNA of Mtb H37Rv using the primers Mtb-ClpC1-F and Mtb-ClpC1-R. The PCR product was ligated into the expression
vector pET28c between the Nde I and Hind III sites to generate pET28c-clpC1, which was verified
by Sanger sequencing. ClpC1 overexpression and purification were performed
as previously described.36 Briefly, the E. coli BL21(DE3) strains harboring the plasmid pET28c-clpC1 were grown in 200 mL LB medium at 37 °C to an
OD600 of 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) was added into the medium to induce the protein expression
at 16 °C and the final concentration of IPTG was 1 mM. Then,
the cells were harvested, disrupted and centrifuged to remove the
debris. The supernatants were loaded on a Ni-NTA agarose column (GE
healthcare). After washing the column by buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl,
500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9) with gradient imidazole (20, 50,
and 75 mM), the ClpC1 proteins bound to the beads were eluted with
buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol,
pH 7.9). The elution buffer was exchanged with protein storage buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9) using
the PD-10 desalting column (GE healthcare). The purities of ClpC1
