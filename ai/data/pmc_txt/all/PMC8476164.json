["Abstract", "Reconstructing the histories of complex adaptations and identifying the evolutionary mechanisms underlying their origins are two of the primary goals of evolutionary biology. Taricha newts, which contain high concentrations of the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) as an antipredator defense, have evolved resistance to self-intoxication, which is a complex adaptation requiring changes in six paralogs of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) gene family, the physiological target of TTX. Here, we reconstruct the origins of TTX self-resistance by sequencing the entire Nav gene family in newts and related salamanders. We show that moderate TTX resistance evolved early in the salamander lineage in three of the six Nav paralogs, preceding the proposed appearance of tetrodotoxic newts by \u223c100 My. TTX-bearing newts possess additional unique substitutions across the entire Nav gene family that provide physiological TTX resistance. These substitutions coincide with signatures of positive selection and relaxed purifying selection, as well as gene conversion events, that together likely facilitated their evolution. We also identify a novel exon duplication within Nav1.4 encoding an expressed TTX-binding site. Two resistance-conferring changes within newts appear to have spread via nonallelic gene conversion: in one case, one codon was copied between paralogs, and in the second, multiple substitutions were homogenized between the duplicate exons of Nav1.4. Our results demonstrate that gene conversion can accelerate the coordinated evolution of gene families in response to a common selection pressure.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Fitting evolutionary models to molecular sequences in a phylogenetic context can help piece together the key steps in adaptive evolution and uncover the relative contributions of selection and other evolutionary mechanisms to adaptive phenotypic evolution (Smith et al. 2020). Comparative studies of convergence, or the repeated evolution of characters within different lineages undergoing the same environmental challenges, provide powerful evidence of both adaptation and connections between genetic and phenotypic change (Losos 2011). Investigations into the molecular basis of convergence have revealed multiple occurrences of parallelism, where different lineages have evolved changes within the same proteins, and occasionally at the same amino acid sites, in response to shared selective pressures, such as insects that have evolved the ability to feed on toxic plants (Zhen et al. 2012) and populations of ducks and humans living at high elevations (Graham and McCracken 2019). Such patterns support important roles for both positive selection and constraint in the origin of complex adaptations (reviewed by Storz 2016).", "Fitting evolutionary models to molecular sequences in a phylogenetic context can help piece together the key steps in adaptive evolution and uncover the relative contributions of selection and other evolutionary mechanisms to adaptive phenotypic evolution (Smith et al. 2020).

The genetic basis of TTX resistance, which is well established in tetrodotoxic puffer fish (Jost et al. 2008) and in snakes that consume TTX-bearing prey (Geffeney et al. 2002; Feldman et al. 2012; McGlothlin et al. 2014, 2016), involves amino acid substitutions in the toxin\u2019s target, voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav). Although Nav are commonly abbreviated as SCNA genes and Nav proteins, hereafter, we simplify this nomenclature by abbreviating both as Nav. Nav channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells and are composed of four domains (DI\u2013DIV), each comprising six transmembrane helices and a pore-loop region (the P-loop; Fux et al. 2018). The four P-loops, one in each domain, form a pore within the membranes of excitable cells to selectively allow sodium ions to cross when the channel is open. TTX exerts its effects by binding to the P-loops of sensitive channels and preventing sodium entry into cells, thus blocking action potentials. Gene duplication events have resulted in six Nav paralogs, each with tissue-specific expression, that are shared across all tetrapods (table 1), with additional lineage-specific duplications occurring in amniotes (Widmark et al. 2011; Zakon 2012).

The extreme toxicity of Taricha, which has been elaborated by the ongoing coevolutionary arms race with garter snakes, builds upon lower levels of toxicity that evolved \u223c30 Ma within \u201cmodern\u201d newts (tribe Molgini; Hanifin and Gilly 2015; divergence date estimated by Hime et al. 2021). The evolution of toxicity necessitates the evolution of toxin autoresistance so that a prey species is not incapacitated by its own antipredator defense (Jost et al. 2008; Toledo et al. 2016; Tarvin et al. 2017; M\u00e1rquez et al. 2019). Understanding the timing and details of this autoresistance can shed light on the genetic processes underlying the predator-prey arms race. Hanifin and Gilly (2015) compared the sequences of one sodium channel gene, the muscle paralog Nav1.4, across several salamander species and identified substitutions in the P-loops of DIII and DIV that provide extreme TTX resistance to the muscles of TTX-bearing newts. Importantly, the sister group of these toxic newts had substitutions in the same gene providing more moderate resistance, indicating that the evolution of autoresistance in a common ancestor paved the way for the evolution of extreme toxicity.

However, although substitutions conferring moderate TTX resistance are present in some nontoxic salamander genomes, only the TTX-bearing newts have substitutions conferring high resistance across all six of their Nav paralogs, and several of these channels harbor multiple resistant substitutions in more than one domain. Many of the substitutions conferring resistance to toxic newts are also present in Nav paralogs of TTX-resistant pufferfish (Jost et al. 2008) and snakes (McGlothlin et al. 2016). Similar to pufferfish, newts appear to require resistance within all of their brain/nerve channels in addition to their hearts and muscles. This feature apparently distinguishes toxic prey from their predators, whose brain channels lack resistant substitutions (McGlothlin et al. 2014). This molecular parallelism emphasizes the strong structural and functional constraints on this gene family, which appear to limit the evolution of TTX resistance to a small number of predictable pathways, leading to convergent and parallel changes across multiple taxa (Feldman et al. 2012). We show that the evolution of extreme TTX resistance is accompanied by a shift in signatures of selection in four out of six paralogs, with suggestive evidence of positive selection acting directly on TTX-binding sites. Finally, the evolution of physiological resistance appears to have been facilitated by at least two instances of nonallelic gene conversion, which acted to introduce TTX-resistance substitutions from one paralog (or exon duplicate) to another, providing a rare example of the facilitation of adaptive evolution via nonallelic gene conversion.", "Here, we show that TTX-bearing newts have evolved resistance to their own toxicity through multiple parallel changes in their Nav genes and that, similar to snakes that consume TTX-containing prey (McGlothlin et al. 2016; Perry et al. 2018), some of the resistance in this taxon is ancient, first appearing in an early salamander.

Finally, the evolution of physiological resistance appears to have been facilitated by at least two instances of nonallelic gene conversion, which acted to introduce TTX-resistance substitutions from one paralog (or exon duplicate) to another, providing a rare example of the facilitation of adaptive evolution via nonallelic gene conversion.", "Our reconstruction of the history of TTX resistance in salamanders reveals the ancient origins of moderate resistance in nerve channels Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 and high resistance in the heart channel Nav1.5, which arose \u223c160 Ma. Resistant substitutions in the muscle channel Nav1.4 evolved later, becoming fixed in the clade including all newts and S. salamandra between 75 and 130 Ma. This was followed by the accumulation of additional substitutions in DIII, DIVa, and DIVb of Nav1.4 within members of the highly toxic newt clade, providing their muscles with resistance to much higher concentrations of TTX relative to salamanders lacking these mutations (Hanifin and Gilly 2015). Substitutions in DI conferring extreme TTX resistance to the brain/nerve channels Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 also evolved more recently (\u223c30 Ma) and they are limited to the toxic newt clade with only one exception, Nav1.1 of P. cinereus, which may have arisen independently in this lineage. Toxic newts also have unique substitutions in DIV of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2, which may provide additional resistance to their brain channels or may compensate for structural or functional changes resulting from resistant substitutions in DI or in other regions of the protein. The widespread presence of TTX in modern newts suggests that possession of TTX evolved in the common ancestor of this clade (Hanifin 2010). This is supported by our observation of shared TTX-resistance substitutions across all Nav paralogs in highly toxic newts. However, the highly toxic newts included in this study are limited to North American species and do not include Asian or European newts (e.g., Cynops and Triturus spp.) known to have TTX (Hanifin 2010).

In ancestral salamandrids, resistance in three or four of the six Nav proteins may have provided tolerance to low levels of TTX, facilitating the evolution of extreme toxicity in the modern newts, although it is unclear whether these substitutions arose in response to TTX exposure or as a side effect of selection for another aspect of channel function. Environmental exposure to TTX could potentially occur from TTX-bearing prey, such as terrestrial Bipalium flatworms (Stokes et al. 2014) or from TTX-producing bacteria (Vaelli et al. 2020). In a feeding study on B. adventitium flatworms, Ducey et al. (1999) demonstrated that although all salamanders rejected the flatworms when they were first presented, some habituated Ambystoma and Plethodon individuals were able to consume them with only minor symptoms of TTX poisoning, including apparent mucus production and numbing of the mouth.

However, our analyses provided evidence consistent with positive selection acting on TTX-binding sites, including sites implicated in the extreme TTX resistance of salamander muscle fibers. Our branch models indicate that several Nav paralogs have higher \u03c9 ratios within the tetrodotoxic newt clade relative to other salamanders. This increase in \u03c9 ratio appears to be mainly the result of relaxed purifying selection rather than positive selection, as few sites were estimated to have \u03c9\u2009>\u20091 by branch-site models. Muscle channel Nav1.4 had the highest \u03c9 ratio in toxic newts, coinciding with a relatively high proportion (\u223c0.06) of sites detected as undergoing positive selection in toxic newts and purifying selection in other salamanders, although the likelihood ratio test was nonsignificant (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). This pattern may derive from ongoing positive selection on Nav1.4 resulting from the coevolutionary arms race between newts and snakes. Increased \u03c9 ratios in toxic newts coincide with the appearance of highly TTX-resistant substitutions within the DI P-loops of Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6, DIV of Nav1.1, and the DIII, DIVa, and DIVb P-loops in Nav1.4.

This may be due to the statistically conservative nature of the branch-site model and the tendency of PAML to detect ongoing diversifying selection rather than rare positive selection events (Yang and dos Reis 2011). Furthermore, the site and branch-site models do not distinguish between biochemically conservative and nonconservative amino acid changes.

Both Hanifin and Gilly (2015) and Du et al.

However, the pattern of TTX resistance evolution in newts also displays important differences from that of their predators. First, perhaps because of the constitutive presence of TTX, newts display extreme levels of resistance even in channels that are expressed in the central nervous system, which are protected by the blood-brain barrier in species that encounter TTX in their diet. Second, our analysis indicates that many substitutions may have become fixed relatively close to one another in evolutionary time within the clade of modern newts. This is in contrast to snakes, where key changes were separated by millions of years. Due to our lack of sampling of newt species outside of North America, however, further work is necessary to understand the timing of these changes on a finer scale.

This increased the power of detecting gene conversion from multiple pairwise comparisons. We also performed a separate search for gene conversion events between duplicate exons 26a and 26b of Nav1.4. For this analysis, we used a codon alignment of Nav1.4 exons 26a and 26b from ten salamander species.
