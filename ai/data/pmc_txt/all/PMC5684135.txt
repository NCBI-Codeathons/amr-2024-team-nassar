GyrI-like proteins are widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and recognized as small-molecule binding proteins. Here, we identify a subfamily of these proteins as cyclopropanoid cyclopropyl hydrolases (CCHs) that can catalyze the hydrolysis of the potent DNA-alkylating agents yatakemycin (YTM) and CC-1065. Co-crystallography and molecular dynamics simulation analyses reveal that these CCHs share a conserved aromatic cage for the hydrolytic activity. Subsequent cytotoxic assays confirm that CCHs are able to protect cells against YTM. Therefore, our findings suggest that the evolutionarily conserved GyrI-like proteins confer cellular protection against diverse xenobiotics via not only binding, but also catalysis. GyrI-like proteins are small-molecule binding proteins that are widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with functions that are poorly characterized. Here, the authors identify GyrI-like proteins as cyclopropanoid cyclopropyl hydrolases that can confer resistance to cytotoxic cyclopropanoid compounds. Introduction Introduction Cyclopropanoid natural products possess a common-strained, three-membered cyclopropane ring, which frequently show excellent biological activities, and may serve as potential drug leads1, 2. Yatakemycin (YTM, 1), CC-1065 (2), and duocarmycins (3 and 4) belong to a family of cyclopropapyrroloindole compounds that exhibit remarkably potent DNA-alkylating activities3, 4 (Fig. 1a); these have been harnessed to develop antibody-drug conjugates5. For example, the duocarmycin-derived ADC MDX-1203 has entered Phase I clinical trials for treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma5. Microorganisms that synthesize these cytotoxic cyclopropanoids must evolve efficient strategies to avoid suicide. Exploration of resistance genes from their producers is not only beneficial for drug discovery, but also for assessing the lifespan of drug utility6–8. Our previous biosynthetic studies on 1 revealed that a DNA glycosylase YtkR2 repairs the N3-YTM-alkylated adenine residues and confers self-resistance against 1 in the last resort9, 10. Here, we show an additional level of resistance regarding YTM cyclopropyl hydrolysis catalyzed by a subfamily of GyrI-like proteins exemplified by YtkR7, a gene product coded for within the same biosynthetic gene cluster of 1. We define this subfamily of GyrI-like proteins as cyclopropanoid cyclopropyl hydrolases (CCHs), and demonstrate that they share a conserved aromatic cage for the hydrolysis of 1 and 2, and thereby confer cellular protection. The results presented here suggest that the evolutionarily conserved GyrI-like proteins are involved in cellular detoxification against diverse xenobiotics via not only binding, but also catalysis.Fig. 1Structures of cyclopropapyrroloindole compounds and characterization of cyclopropanoid cyclopropyl hydrolases (CCHs). a Structures of yatakemycin (YTM), CC-1065, and duocarmycins. 1 L, 1 M, and 1 R indicate the three subunits of YTM, respectively.

The GyrI-like proteins possess a duplicate βαββ configuration and appear to have been adapted for small-molecule binding11. However, the limited knowledge about the binding properties of these proteins is mainly gained from the SMBD of the MerR-like transcription activator BmrR, which can accept structurally diverse inducers to control the expression of the multidrug transporter Bmr11, 14–19. The vast number of GyrI-like sequences in databases (12,304 sequences as of September 2016 (Supplementary Fig. 1)) from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggest that these proteins perform some evolutionarily conserved biological functions. To investigate the function of YtkR7, we inactivated the ytkR7 gene and obtained the ΔytkR7 mutant TG1310 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Comparison of the metabolite profiles of the wild type with the mutant showed that the inactivation of ytkR7 did not affect the production of 1, but two compounds (5 and 6) that were present in the wild type disappeared in TG1310 (Fig. 1b, ii). Additionally, complementation of native ytkR7 in trans into TG1310 could restore the generation of 5 and 6 (Fig. 1b, iii). We then isolated and characterized both as YTM cyclopropyl hydrolyzed derivatives (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs 3–6). Compound 6 was later found to be a spontaneously oxidized product from 5. The unexpected structure of 5 led us to speculate that YtkR7 is an enzyme capable of catalyzing YTM cyclopropyl hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, we expressed and purified YtkR7 from E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 7). As expected, incubation of YtkR7 with 1 afforded 5, which was not observed for the control assay (Fig. 1d). Notably, both a high concentration of DMSO and acidic buffers promote the enzymatic hydrolysis activity (Supplementary Fig. 8). Collectively, our genetic and biochemical results demonstrate that YtkR7 functions as a CCH. Bioinformatic analysis showed that YtkR7 bears high homology to the GyrI-like small-molecule binding domain (SMBD), members of which share sequence similarity with SbmC (also designated as GyrI)11, a protein that can protect Escherichia coli from DNA replication inhibitors (e.g., microcin B1712) and DNA-damaging agents (e.g., mitomycin C13).

Collectively, our genetic and biochemical results demonstrate that YtkR7 functions as a CCH. Using YtkR7 as a query, 1695 similar proteins found exclusively in prokaryotes20 were retrieved to generate a sequence similarity network (Supplementary Fig. 9). Seven of these GyrI-like proteins were chosen from a variety of bacteria and archaea (from diverse environments, including soil and the human microbiota: SHJG_8481, Chte2144, ETI84332.1, C10R6, lin2189, SSDG_03674, and MA1133) and tested for their enzymatic activity, and all were found to convert 1 to 5 (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Figs 10 and 11), suggesting that a great number of prokaryotic GyrI-like proteins can be classified as CCHs.

When we tested the enzymatic activity of C10R6 in the mutant strain TG1310, we found that it can restore the production of 5 and 6 in vivo (Fig. 1b, iv). Given the fact that C10R6 is encoded by the biosynthetic gene cluster of 2
21, this protein may function to catalyze CC-1065 cyclopropyl hydrolysis. Indeed, incubation of C10R6 with 2 showed that C10R6 could convert 2 to a new derivative 7 (Fig. 1f, ii). This derivative was also present in the strain that produces 2 (Fig. 1f, iii); isolation and structural elucidation revealed 7 to be a CC-1065 cyclopropyl hydrolyzed product (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Figs 12 and 13). Next, 2 was used to probe the substrate specificity of YtkR7 and the other selected CCHs, and in vitro enzymatic assays showed that SSDG_03674, lin2189, Chte2144, and SHJG_8481 could hydrolyze 2 (Supplementary Fig. 14), while YtkR7, ETI84332.1, and MA1133 could not. Our in vitro and in vivo studies showed that all of the tested CCHs could hydrolyze 1, but were variously promiscuous with other structurally related substrates.

Structural and MD simulation analyses of CCHs Structural and MD simulation analyses of CCHs Structural and MD simulation analyses of CCHs To probe the catalytic mechanism of CCHs, we carried out co-crystallography and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation experiments on lin2189, a CCH protein from Listeria innocua that can hydrolyze both 1 and 2. The apo structure of lin2189, which was solved previously (PDB ID: 3B49), is comprised of three α-helices and six β-strands (Supplementary Fig. 15). Co-crystallization of native lin2189 with 1 or 5 turned out to be extremely difficult, owing, respectively, to rapid hydrolysis and low affinity. Previous structural and biochemical studies of BmrR revealed that the glutamate residue Glu-253 has a noticeable effect on its ligand binding and transcription activation17. This acidic residue is highly conserved among the GyrI-like proteins11, we thus constructed a lin2189 variant (E185L). Interestingly, this variant lost the enzymatic activity and allowed us to obtain a complex structure of lin2189 E185L and 1 in which the electron density for the substrate is partially visible. Detailed investigation of the electron density map implicated that several residues in the solvent-accessible channel (e.g., E157) potentially interfered with substrate binding. Therefore, we designed a series of variants based on E185L. As expected, we successfully solved the complex structure of a catalytically deficient form lin2189 E157A E185L and 1 with complete density at a resolution of 1.2 Å. The structure is composed of two monomers, each of which binds one molecule of 1 at the crevice. The 1L- and 1M-subunits of 1 are stretched into an aromatic cage consisting of Y46, W85, W99, F154, and Y187, while the 1R-subunit is exposed to the solvent and stabilized by Y54 and Y58 through π–π stacking interactions (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Figs 16a and 17). Surprisingly, we did not observe any catalytic residues close to the cyclopropane moiety, which is contrary to canonical ring opening mechanisms that require general acid/base1, 22.Fig. 2Structural and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses of lin2189-YTM. a The molecular details of the lin2189 E157A/E185L-YTM crystal structure.

Previous structural and biochemical studies of BmrR revealed that the glutamate residue Glu-253 has a noticeable effect on its ligand binding and transcription activation17. This acidic residue is highly conserved among the GyrI-like proteins11, we thus constructed a lin2189 variant (E185L). Interestingly, this variant lost the enzymatic activity and allowed us to obtain a complex structure of lin2189 E185L and 1 in which the electron density for the substrate is partially visible. Detailed investigation of the electron density map implicated that several residues in the solvent-accessible channel (e.g., E157) potentially interfered with substrate binding. Therefore, we designed a series of variants based on E185L. As expected, we successfully solved the complex structure of a catalytically deficient form lin2189 E157A E185L and 1 with complete density at a resolution of 1.2 Å. The structure is composed of two monomers, each of which binds one molecule of 1 at the crevice. The 1L- and 1M-subunits of 1 are stretched into an aromatic cage consisting of Y46, W85, W99, F154, and Y187, while the 1R-subunit is exposed to the solvent and stabilized by Y54 and Y58 through π–π stacking interactions (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Figs 16a and 17). Surprisingly, we did not observe any catalytic residues close to the cyclopropane moiety, which is contrary to canonical ring opening mechanisms that require general acid/base1, 22.Fig. 2Structural and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses of lin2189-YTM. a The molecular details of the lin2189 E157A/E185L-YTM crystal structure.

The residue numbers correspond to those of lin2189 To probe the catalytic mechanism of CCHs, we carried out co-crystallography and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation experiments on lin2189, a CCH protein from Listeria innocua that can hydrolyze both 1 and 2.

The residue numbers correspond to those of lin2189 Subsequently, we used a protein–ligand docking approach to computationally construct the lin2189-1 complex structure and validated our model with MD simulations. In the lin2189-1 model, 1 was in the same aromatic cage observed in the co-crystal structure. However, the reactive methylene group in the cyclopropyl ring was next to the acidic residue E185 (4.5 Å) that is very close to another acidic residue E157 (2.8 Å) (Fig. 2b, c; Supplementary Fig. 16b), providing a likely electrostatic mechanism to explain both our difficulty in crystallizing the native complex and our ability to crystallize the double-mutant form. Consistent with the binding model for lin2189-1, we found that substrate 2 fit well in the same aromatic cage as 1 in the lin2189-2 model (Supplementary Fig. 18). We next conducted well-tempered metadynamics simulation (metaMD) to identify the substrate entrance pathway for 1. Principal component analysis showed that both loop B and loop C undergo noticeable fluctuations (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Movie 1). We therefore chose the mass center distances between loop B and loop C and between the substrate and residue E185, as the collective variables (CVs) for these simulations. During the metaMD simulation of the lin2189-1 complex, the substrate first approached the vicinity of Y187 next to loop C. Next, loop C shifted outward, yielding a large space in the pocket suitable for substrate binding (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Movie 2). Such large movements are probably due to the induced fit effect which has been observed in various biological processes23, 24. Notably, the position of the complex crystal structure has been observed in the snapshots of our metaMD simulation (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Movie 2), which further confirms our identification of this substrate entrance. An additional metaMD simulation aiming to explore the product exit (with the same CVs) revealed that both loop B and loop C move outward markedly and suggested that the product leaves the binding pocket from the vicinity of loop B (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Movie 3). Subsequently, we used a protein–ligand docking approach to computationally construct the lin2189-1 complex structure and validated our model with MD simulations. In the lin2189-1 model, 1 was in the same aromatic cage observed in the co-crystal structure.

The importance of the catalytic pocket to hydrolysis activity is further strengthened by the fact that the catalytic residues are very highly conserved among CCHs (Fig. 2g), and mutagenesis experiments confirmed that the acidic residues E157 and E185 are essential for the catalysis (Supplementary Fig. 20). The conserved aromatic residues W85 and Y187 in the binding pocket also have critical effects on the hydrolytic activity. Consistent with these findings, distantly related GyrI-like proteins lacking the pair of acidic residues and aromatic cage (e.g., SbmC12, BmrR14, and Rob25) were not able to hydrolyze 1 to 5 (Supplementary Fig. 21). Based on these data, we propose the following catalytic mechanism for CCHs (Fig. 3). In apo CCHs, E157 is protonated and E185 is deprotonated, due to the fact that both of them are buried in the deep pocket and engage with each other via an H-bonding contact. This has also been confirmed by pKa calculations on the MD trajectory (Supplementary Fig. 22). As the substrate enters the CCH, it leads to an outward shift of loop C, which facilitates further entry into the catalytic pocket. After the substrate is situated in the pocket in an activated binding mode, E185 attacks the methylene group in the cyclopropyl ring. This leads to transformation of the quinone moiety into a deprotonated phenol, which acquires a proton from water. With the assistance of E157, the transitional substrate is then hydrolyzed by a water molecule. The hydroxyl group from water is transferred to E185, and a proton is gained by E157. Finally, outward fluctuations of loop B and loop C facilitate product exit from the catalytic pocket.Fig. 3The catalytic mechanism of CCHs. a In an apo CCH, the three loops (loop A, B, and C) next to the catalytic pocket are very flexible and the size of the pocket can be fluctuated to a large extent.

The E185 residue returns to its deprotonated state The catalytic mechanism of CCHs. a In an apo CCH, the three loops (loop A, B, and C) next to the catalytic pocket are very flexible and the size of the pocket can be fluctuated to a large extent. E157 is protonated, whereas E185 is deprotonated. b The entry of substrate into the CCH leads to the outward shift of loop C, resulting in a large space in the binding pocket.

Indeed, in vitro activity assays demonstrated that 5 is not toxic to Jurkat cells or E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 23a, b). Furthermore, bacterial growth inhibition assays confirmed that E. coli cells expressing ytkR7, lin2189, ETI84332.1, or MA1133 are much more tolerant to 1 than the control strain (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 23c). Domain analysis of the 12,304 GyrI-like sequences revealed that 4706 proteins consist of only a GyrI-like domain (e.g., SbmC12 and the tested CCHs) according to the InterPro database20 (Supplementary Fig. 24). The majority of the GyrI-like sequences are either AraC-like (5498; e.g., Rob25) or MerR-like (1824; e.g., BmrR14) transcriptional regulators. Although SbmC and Rob have been reported to be involved in cellular protection against toxic chemicals, their ability to bind small molecules is not as yet confirmed. Our further binding assays on 17 antibiotics showed that SbmC and Rob, as well as YtkR7, could bind 3–6 antibiotics (Supplementary Fig. 25). The finding that these distantly related GyrI-like proteins each have the ability to bind xenobiotics suggests that using the GyrI-like proteins for cellular detoxification appears to be an ancient strategy.Fig. 4CCHs can protect E. coli against the potent DNA-alkylating agent YTM.

In this study, we have identified a subfamily of prokaryotic GyrI-like proteins as CCHs that can hydrolyze the cyclopropyl moieties of YTM and CC-1065, and thereby confer cellular resistance against these cytotoxic cyclopropanoids. Thus, these GyrI-like proteins directly function as antibiotic resistance proteins. Moreover, in vitro binding assay confirms that GyrI-like proteins each still retain the ability to bind several structurally diverse xenobiotics (Supplementary Fig. 25). Our results also provide strong support for the very recent proposal that GyrI-like proteins have potential multidrug resistance functions26. Structural studies of BmrR for drug binding and multispecificity reveal that aromatic side chains lining the drug pocket form a rigid, aromatic platform for diverse drugs to dock18. Subsequent structural comparison of lin2189, BmrR, SbmC, and Rob revealed that they each possess a different solvent-accessible cage formed by a set of aromatic and hydrophobic residues, which might in turn determine the ligand specificity of GyrI-like proteins (Supplementary Figs 26 and 27). Therefore, it can be concluded that GyrI-like proteins may be regarded as an intracellular scavenger for xenobiotics, and that organisms harness GyrI-like proteins for cellular protection as an ancient strategy.

Currently, antibiotic resistance is one of the major global concerns. Studies on antibiotic resistance genes located within their biosynthetic gene clusters will facilitate our understanding about the antibiotic resistome in the environment. Therefore, in addition to shedding new light on the vast capacity of organisms to deal with various toxic xenobiotics, our findings are very promising for future rational drug discovery.

Interaction fingerprint calculations Interaction fingerprint calculations Interaction fingerprint calculations The interaction fingerprint between protein and ligand was done with PLIP tool48. We first extracted snapshots of the final 20 ns MD simulation. We then used PLIP to convert protein−ligand coordinates into a bit-string fingerprint (TIFP) registering the corresponding molecular interaction pattern. TIFP fingerprints have been calculated for 500 protein−ligand complexes for each case, enabling a broad comparison of relationships between interaction pattern similarities and ligand or binding site pairwise similarities49. In this work we kept the default parameters of PLIP and focused on three types of interactions: H-bond interaction, π stacking and hydrophobic contact.
