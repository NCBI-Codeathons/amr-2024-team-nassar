gene cluster that encodes ClaR. This protein is a putative regulator of the late steps of
clavulanic acid biosynthesis. The aim of this research is the molecular cloning of claR,
isolated from the Iranian strain of Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus). The clavulanic acid regulatory gene (claR) is in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic

isolated from the Iranian strain of Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus). Materials and Methods: Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, two different strains of S. clavuligerus
were used (PTCC 1705 and DSM 738), of which there is no claR sequence record for
strain PTCC 1705 in all three main gene banks. The specific designed primers were subjected
to a few base modifications for introduction of the recognition sites of BamHI and
ClaI. The claR gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using DNA isolated
from S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705. Nested-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP), and sequencing were used for molecular analysis of the claR gene.
The confirmed claR was subjected to double digestion with BamHI and ClaI. The cut claR
was ligated into a pBluescript (pBs) vector and transformed into E. coli. In this experimental study, two different strains of S. clavuligerus

as an appropriate tool for site directed mutagenesis and sub-cloning. At this time, claR
has been cloned accompanied with its precisely selected promoter so it could be used in
expression vectors. Hence the ClaR is known as a putative regulatory protein. The overproduced
protein could also be used for other related investigations, such as a mobility

bacteria readily isolated from soil (1,2).Streptomyces are unique among prokaryotes due
to their complicated morphological differentiation(3)These morphological changes are accompanied
by a wide range of physiological events, including
the production of secondary metabolites, many of
which have potentially important biological activities.
They include many useful antibiotics and other
products, such as antitumor drugs and herbicides(4-8).Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus)
produces the β-lactam antibiotic, cephamycin
C and theβ -lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid(9-11).Clavulanic acid is a clinically significant
inhibitor of β-lactamases, while the other clavam
metabolites produced by S. clavuligerus demonstrate
weak antibacterial and antifungal activities(1,9).Several other Streptomyces species have
also been determined to be producers of clavulanic(12,13).The combined use of clavulanic acid
and broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics such as
amoxicillin are an important therapeutic tactic to
combat the rapid increase in β-lactam resistance(14-17).The cluster of genes for clavulanic acid
biosynthesis is located downstream from the pcbC
gene of the cephamycin C cluster in S. clavuligerus(18,19).Most genes of the cephamycin and clavulanic acid clusters are known(20-24).All essential
genes of the clavulanic acid pathway are within a
12kb EcoRI DNA fragment of the S. clavuligerus
genome, because this fragment appears to confer
production of clavulanic acid when introduced in
Streptomyces lividans(25).Very little is known
about the regulation of the genes of the clavulanic
acid cluster. The transcriptional activators CcaR
and ClaR are known to regulate the expression of
clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes(26-28)The
 ccaR gene lies within the cephamycin biosynthetic
gene cluster. This gene is a pathway-specific transcriptional
regulator for cephamycin biosynthesis,
as well as a controlling expression of the claR gene
from the clavulanic acid gene cluster(21,29-31)Another regulatory gene, claR, is located immediately
downstream from orf-7 in the clavulanic acid
cluster and encodes a 431 amino acid protein(31,32).The regulatory nature of the ClaR protein has
been deduced from the presence of one helix turn
helix (HTH) motif and flanking sequences which
show significant similarity to LysR transcriptional
regulators(33). Finally, the absence of orf-7, orf-9
and orf-10 transcripts in a claR mutant blocked in
clavulanic acid production confirmed the regulatory
role of ClaR(32-34). Streptomyces species are mycelial, aerobic grampositive

role of ClaR(32-34). To increase the amount of clavulanic acid produced
by S. clavuligerus, different tactics have been employed
by researchers. Enhancement of clavulanic
acid production was seen in S. clavuligerus in the
presence of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) seed flour
and its fractions(35). Random mutagenesis was
performed on S. clavuligerus. The new mutated
strains were able to produce the elevated level of
clavulanic acid(36). To increase the amount of clavulanic acid produced

fermentation using S. clavuligerus, the regulation
of clavulanic acid biosynthesis is a point of great
interest. It has been shown that the cloning of the
claR gene in the S. clavuligerus resulted in a threefold
increase in clavulanic acid production(31).In
our previous work, an isolated claR gene was ligated
to a Streptomyces specific vector (pMA::hyg).

knowledge of the regulation of antibiotic production
in Streptomyces (the producer of two thirds of
all known microbial antibiotics). Genetic engineering
of the clavulanic acid producing strains could
be done afterwards, in order to increase the capacity
of clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus.
It has been reported that cdaR, the regulatory gene
for the production of a calcium dependent antibiotic
(CDA), positively regulates its own transcription.
As a result, introducing extra copies of cdaR
into different strains of Streptomyces coelicolor
MT1110, S. coelicolor 2377 and Streptomyces
lividans has led to overproduction of this antibiotic
(41). Designing novel antibiotics, on the other
hand, is greatly dependent on the structural analysis
of the gene cluster for each antibiotic. Clavulanic
acid is a multi-billion-dollar per annum product
useful for its β-lactamase inhibitory activity.
While the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid has been
the subject of intense investigation in recent years,
the details of its production and regulation are still
not completely worked out. The overall aim of this work was to expand our

While the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid has been
the subject of intense investigation in recent years,
the details of its production and regulation are still
not completely worked out. Amplification of the ccaR gene, a regulatory gene
in the cephamycin gene cluster, resulted in an almost
threefold increase in the production of both
cephamycin and clavulanic acid in S. clavuligerus
(20). The formation of clavulanic acid is controlled
by a LysR-type regulatory protein encoded by the
claR gene. The claR gene was then chosen because
this is a putative regulatory gene in the production
pathway of clavulanic acid (33). The claR gene,
which is located downstream from the gene encoding
clavaminate synthase in the clavulanic acid
biosynthesis gene cluster, is involved in regulation
of the late steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis
(32-34).
. Amplification of the claR gene using
multi-copy plasmids and under its own promoter
in S. clavuligerus results in a three-fold increase in
clavulanic acid production(31). Amplification of the ccaR gene, a regulatory gene

. Amplification of the claR gene using
multi-copy plasmids and under its own promoter
in S. clavuligerus results in a three-fold increase in
clavulanic acid production(31). We precisely amplified the coding sequence of claR
accompanied with its promoter by using a specifically
designed primer and an error proof PCR. In
this case, only the promoter sequence of the gene
comes with the claR. Since the distance between the vector born promoter and the claR transcription
start point is not too great, the expression of
the cloned gene could also be started by two individual
promoters that exist in the vector. Therefore,
the usage of three promoters (one native claR
gene and two vector-born) leads to an elevated
level of claR gene expression. Prior to this study
and in contrast to other regulatory genes in S. clavuligerus,
 claR has not been isolated by PCR, but
has been previously cloned via restriction enzyme
digestion (31). For the first time, in the present
study, the claR gene was isolated from an Iranian
strain of S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705. The PCR isolated
claR was initially compared with the claR sequence
of S. clavuligerus DSM 738, using nested
PCR and restriction digestion analysis. The claR
isolated from the S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705 was
finally sequenced. Thus the entire sequence of S.
clavuligerus claR was determined. The sequencing
data was subjected to bioinformatics analysis
for further comparison with the claR sequence of
S. clavuligerus 738 and other species. Complete
similarity was found between the sequence of
claR isolated from PTCC 1705 andS. clavuligerus
DSM 738. We precisely amplified the coding sequence of claR

S. clavuligerus 738 and other species. Complete
similarity was found between the sequence of
claR isolated from PTCC 1705 andS. clavuligerus
DSM 738. In our previous work, claR was ligated into a Streptomyces
specific vector, pMA::hyg (39). However
that vector does not have any inducible promoter.
On the other hand, pMA::hyg does not contain any
other cut sites for other restriction enzymes (39),
so the subcloning of claR was practically impossible.
To overcome these problems, new primers
were designed with new incorporated cut sites for
BamHI and ClaI. The amplified claR was then
cloned in E.coli by using a newly constructed
vector called pZSclaR (Fig 4). This unique vector
contains a greatly expanded multiple cloning
site (MCS), which makes it suitable for different
purposes of gene cloning. Furthermore, this new
construct is expression and inducible. In the same
way, increasing the copy number of certain clavulanic
acid-specific biosynthetic genes, by the introduction
of multiple copy expression plasmids,
resulted in positive effects on the production of
clavulanic acid (42). In our previous work, claR was ligated into a Streptomyces
specific vector, pMA::hyg (39). However
that vector does not have any inducible promoter.
On the other hand, pMA::hyg does not contain any
other cut sites for other restriction enzymes (39),
so the subcloning of claR was practically impossible.
To overcome these problems, new primers
were designed with new incorporated cut sites for
BamHI and ClaI. The amplified claR was then
cloned in E.coli by using a newly constructed
vector called pZSclaR (Fig 4). This unique vector
contains a greatly expanded multiple cloning
site (MCS), which makes it suitable for different
purposes of gene cloning. Furthermore, this new
construct is expression and inducible. In the same
way, increasing the copy number of certain clavulanic
acid-specific biosynthetic genes, by the introduction
of multiple copy expression plasmids,
resulted in positive effects on the production of
clavulanic acid (42). Conclusion Conclusion Characterization of isolated claR from an Iranian
strain of S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705 was carried
out using molecular studies. This gene was cloned
in E. coli via a multiple copy expression vector.
The constructed recombinant cassette (pZSclaR)
may also be utilized as an appropriate tool for site
directed mutagenesis and sub-cloning. The ClaR
is recognized as a putative regulatory protein, so the overproduced protein could also be used for
other related investigations, such as an enzyme assay
and a mobility shift assay. The claR gene could
also be expressed in Streptomyces by sub-cloning
it into different varieties of Streptomyces specific
expression vectors. Characterization of isolated claR from an Iranian
