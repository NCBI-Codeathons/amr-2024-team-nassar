In this work, an Fe3O4/Cu/CuO (FC) antibacterial nano-agent was synthesized in a “one-pot” approach using copper sulfate and ferric chloride as raw materials, and it was studied using TEM, XRD, XPS, UV-vis, and VSM methods. The antibacterial activity and mechanism of FC were studied, using a commercially available Bordeaux mixture as a control. The effects of an FC on mung bean development and its toxicity to human mammary epithelial cells were also investigated. The results revealed that FC could break the cell walls of E. coli and S. aureus, quadrupling the antibacterial activity of the Bordeaux combination. Furthermore, it was shown that FC might improve the germination, root development, and chlorophyll content of mung bean seeds while being 1/8 as hazardous to human mammary epithelial cells as the Bordeaux combination. The as-prepared FC can replace the Bordeaux combination in the management of agroforestry pathogens.

Introduction Introduction Copper ions, as trace elements in plants, are required for various physiological functions, including photosynthesis, cellular respiration, antioxidant defenses, and hormone signal transduction.1–6 Due to its exceptional biocompatibility, it has a wide range of applications. According to their biological value, copper ions can not only boost plant development but also have antibacterial properties due to their toxicity. On the other hand, being a heavy metal, copper may be harmful to plants, bacteria and viruses to a certain extent.3,4,6–8 Copper ions, as trace elements in plants, are required for various physiological functions, including photosynthesis, cellular respiration, antioxidant defenses, and hormone signal transduction.1–6 Due to its exceptional biocompatibility, it has a wide range of applications. According to their biological value, copper ions can not only boost plant development but also have antibacterial properties due to their toxicity. On the other hand, being a heavy metal, copper may be harmful to plants, bacteria and viruses to a certain extent.3,4,6–8 Cu2+ is the primary component of commercial inorganic antibacterial agents such as Bordeaux mixture, green depot, and double spirit, which are extensively used in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry as a disposable dosage for disease prevention and control.2,3,5 Cu2+ ions can adsorb on the surface of bacteria, destroying the potential difference between the surface membrane and the bacterial cell walls.9,10 When paired with a sulfur iron cluster in the cell membrane, trace levels of Cu2+ can alter the secondary structure of the protein in the ion channel, resulting in the rupture of bacterial cell walls.9,11 Proper amounts of Cu+ drifting through the cytoplasm (cell walls contain functional reductase, which can reduce Cu2+ to Cu+ and transport it into the bacterial interior via the copper ion channel protein) can combine with the cytoplasm to form oxides such as oxygen free radicals, peroxides, and oxygen ions, which can damage critical organelles, such as mitochondria,12,13 nucleic acid and plasmids, ultimately killing the bacteria. Thus, when the concentration of Cu ion is greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteria but less than the maximum inhibitory concentration for plants, it can be used to prevent and control agricultural pathogens due to its antibacterial properties and growth-promoting properties.11,14 Cu2+ is the primary component of commercial inorganic antibacterial agents such as Bordeaux mixture, green depot, and double spirit, which are extensively used in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry as a disposable dosage for disease prevention and control.2,3,5 Cu2+ ions can adsorb on the surface of bacteria, destroying the potential difference between the surface membrane and the bacterial cell walls.9,10 When paired with a sulfur iron cluster in the cell membrane, trace levels of Cu2+ can alter the secondary structure of the protein in the ion channel, resulting in the rupture of bacterial cell walls.9,11 Proper amounts of Cu+ drifting through the cytoplasm (cell walls contain functional reductase, which can reduce Cu2+ to Cu+ and transport it into the bacterial interior via the copper ion channel protein) can combine with the cytoplasm to form oxides such as oxygen free radicals, peroxides, and oxygen ions, which can damage critical organelles, such as mitochondria,12,13 nucleic acid and plasmids, ultimately killing the bacteria.

Copper nanoparticles (NCs, Table 1) exhibit significant surface plasmas. After absorbing a given amount of energy, electrons on its surface often escape and interact with the surrounding medium to form reactive oxygen species (ROS, Table 1), which can cause irreparable damage to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi and mycoplasma.13–15 Meanwhile, NCs create Cu2+ when they release electrons, which in conjunction with ROS, confers on NCs significant antibacterial characteristics.

However, NCs are difficult to prepare and recover, and it is unstable when exposed to the environment. Wang et al.16 demonstrated that Fe2+ included in Fe3O4@Cu@Cu2O composites accelerated electron transport and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), endowing the composite with increased stability and catalytic activity. Liu et al.17 produced Fe3O4@Cu@CuO composites to investigate their electrochemical characteristics. They discovered that Fe3O4@Cu@CuO had a high electron transfer efficiency and could be recycled more than 550 times.

Fe and Cu ions can work synergistically as trace elements in plants to promote plant metabolism and stem and leaf development. Given the excellent biocompatibility of Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu0 and Cu2+, ROS created by electron migration can potentially not only oxidize the seed coat, but boost aerobic respiration. To increase seed germination efficiency, the ions can also cause irreparable harm to bacteria when combined with Cu2+.

Results and discussion Results and discussion Morphology and crystal type Morphology and crystal type Morphology and crystal type TEM was used to describe the morphology and size of the produced material, and the findings are displayed in Fig. 1a–c. The generated FC has a monodisperse spherical shape with a particle size of 230 ± 20 nm and a rough surface, as shown in the picture. The primary explanation for this is that copper chloride and ferric chloride were progressively converted to FC nuclei at elevated temperatures using ethylene glycol and sodium citrate. The FC nuclei progressively gathered and developed into a spherical shape with a rough surface as the reaction continued. Powder X-ray diffraction was used to further investigate the crystal structure of the FC (XRD). The findings are depicted in Fig. 1d.

As trace elements in microorganisms,11,13,20 Cu and Fe demonstrated early adaption and self-resistance and later inhibition when the external concentration exceeded their minimal inhibitory concentration. The material inhibits S. aureus more effectively than E. coli because S. aureus cell walls have a high proportion of phospholipid bilayers and a low proportion of protein.22,27,29 Due to the fact that bacterial resistance mechanisms depend on the expression of resistance genes in plasmid DNA proteins, the more protein in the cell wall, the more probable that resistance gene expression is activated.29 As a result, S. aureus is more susceptible to the FC.

PI staining analysis PI staining analysis PI staining analysis PI may selectively bind DNA and RNA as a fluorescent dye in bacteria. When bacteria die, PI penetrates the bacterium and acts on nucleic acid, generating a red spot-like material that may be seen under an inverted fluorescence microscope, as seen in Fig. 5c–f. The presence of red spot-like compounds was lower in the control group of E. coli and S. aureus, which can be related to the natural aging process of bacteria. With the addition of the FC, more red spots were noticed in E. coli and S. aureus.

Cytotoxic analysis Cytotoxic analysis Cytotoxic analysis To investigate the material biocompatibility, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Pictilisib (GDC-0941) has been used, a commercially available antitumor agent, as a reference, and human breast epithelial cells as simulation cells to investigate the material's half maximal inhibitory concentration, as shown in Fig. 5g. The IC50 of GDC-0941 was determined to be 308.18 μg mL−1. The IC50 values for the Bordeaux combination and the FC were 19.58 μg mL−1 and 249.97 μg mL−1, respectively. The results show that the toxicity level of the FC was 1.23 times higher than that of the agent GDC-0941 but significantly lower than that of the Bordeaux combination, representing 7.83% of the Bordeaux mixture's toxicity level. The explanation for this might be that Fe, as a trace element in eukaryotic cells, is less poisonous than Cu. As a result, FC is less hazardous.35–38 To investigate the material biocompatibility, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Pictilisib (GDC-0941) has been used, a commercially available antitumor agent, as a reference, and human breast epithelial cells as simulation cells to investigate the material's half maximal inhibitory concentration, as shown in Fig. 5g.

During this step, metabolism speeds up, and more nutrients are required to hasten seed germination. Fig. 6 depicts the outcomes of using FC in mung bean germination (a and b). The concentration of the Bordeaux combination (tested at 10, 50, 100 and 200 μg mL−1) increased root elongation and thickness. Nonetheless, at a 400 g mL−1 dosage, they fell dramatically. When applied to mung bean seeds, FC revealed comparable capabilities in promoting germination, as well as an inhibitory impact on seed germination at a dosage of 400 μg mL−1. Still, the effect was smaller than that of the Bordeaux combination. Fig. 6c depicts the material impact on physiological indicators of mung bean seedlings. Capillary roots are more active and stems and leaves grow thicker when the concentration of the Bordeaux combination is 10 μg mL−1 and 50 μg mL−1, as shown in the picture.

When FC is administered at a concentration less than 10 g mL−1, it reacts with medium water to form ROS to oxidize the seed coat, causing the seed coat to rupture and allowing the seed to start the aerobic respiration process, hence speeding seed germination. As a result, mung bean sprouts get thicker.15,20,39 Because of the wrapping of the seed coat, seeds are in anaerobic respiration during the early stages of germination.

As a result, significant levels of Cu+ are retained in the vacuole, cytoplasm, or cell wall. Mung bean roots can store a high quantity of Cu+ and convey it to terrestrial tissues and organs via transfer proteins.4,7,11,13 As a result, the roots are more susceptible to FC concentrations.

Bacteria have a lower need for Cu than plants, therefore Cu ions at a particular concentration can boost plant development and cause harm to bacteria.8,10,39,41 Because the bacterial surface has a high concentration of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, the surface is retained in an acidic environment, where FC performs the Fenton reaction, producing additional ROS to boost antibacterial activity.

When too much Cu2+ penetrates the bacterial wall, it attaches to the iron–sulfur cluster proteins in the cell membrane, causing secondary structural degeneration. When the FC concentration is less than 100 μg mL−1, it may not only kill bacteria but also stimulate mung bean seed germination, root activity, and chlorophyll content in mung bean sprouts.

Furthermore, the components of FC are mainly Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu0 and Cu2+ with strong electron migration rate and antibacterial activity, and because it contains Fe and Cu elements, it can have a certain promotion effect on plant growth at moderate concentrations, and plants have different requirements for Fe and Cu elements during the growth process, and the application of different elements at the growth stage for the application of different elements at the growth stage has important research and practical value for plant growth, which we will explore in further studies. In addition, if Fe3O4 is used as the nucleus and Cu0 and Cu2+ or Cu2+ and Cu0 are loaded on the surface in turn due to Fenton reaction and interfacial effect can produce a certain amount of ROS,42–44 theoretically, it can have some antibacterial activity because Cu0 and Cu2+ have different redox potentials and can spontaneously carry out redox reactions to produce more free electrons and Cu intermediates and cause more damage to bacteria, so it is important for bacterial inhibition research and application. However, this material needs to be synthesized by layer assembly, multi-step reaction, and exhaustive characterization and antibacterial activity testing, while the present material is a composite of four elements, Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu0 and Cu2+.

Conclusion Conclusion The antibacterial efficiency of the FC against E. coli and S. aureus was 100% within 20 minutes at a concentration of 100 μg mL−1, which is four times greater than that of the Bordeaux mixture at the same concentration, with better antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. The antibacterial investigations revealed that the FC could kill germs and severely destroy bacterial cell walls. The material toxicity to mammalian cells was 1/8 that of the Bordeaux combination. Mung bean seeds may also benefit from the material's germination and development. With toxicity of 1/8 that of the Bordeaux combination, the FC has the potential to be more useful in agricultural planting.
