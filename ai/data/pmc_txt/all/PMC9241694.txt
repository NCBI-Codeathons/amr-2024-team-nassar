The effectors of these mechanisms are proteins that inactivate the antibiotic, facilitate its transport, or modify the target to render it insensitive to the molecule. Streptomyces bacteria biosynthesize various bioactive natural products and possess resistance systems for most metabolites, which are coregulated with antibiotic biosynthesis genes. Streptomyces olindensis strain DAUFPE 5622 produces the antitumor antibiotic cosmomycin D (COSD), a member of the anthracycline family. In this study, we propose three self-resistance mechanisms, anchored or based in the COSD biosynthetic gene cluster. These include cosIJ (an ABC transporter), cosU (a UvrA class IIa protein), and a new self-resistance mechanism encoded by cosP, which shows response against peroxides by the enzyme mycothiol peroxidase (MPx). Activity-based investigations of MPx and its mutant enzyme confirmed peroxidation during the production of COSD. Overexpression of the ABC transporter, the UvrA class IIa protein, and the MPx led to an effective response against toxic anthracyclines, such as cosmomycins. Our findings help to understand how thiol peroxidases play an antioxidant role in the anthracycline producer S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622, a mechanism which has been reported for neoplastic cells that are resistant to doxorubicin (DOX). IMPORTANCE Anthracycline compounds are DNA intercalating agents widely used in cancer chemotherapeutic protocols. This work focused on the self-resistance mechanisms developed by the cosmomycin-producing bacterium Streptomyces olindensis. Our findings showed that cysteine peroxidases, such as mycothiol peroxidase, encoded by the gene cosP, protected S. olindensis against peroxidation during cosmomycin production. This observation can contribute to much better understanding of resistance both in the producers, eventually enhancing production, and in some tumoral cell lines. KEYWORDS INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Anthracyclines are part of the polyketide type II family and are an important group of natural compounds produced by actinobacteria. The basic structure contains an aglycone skeleton and 6-deoxyhexose moieties, biosynthetically derived from glucose-1-phosphate. The two anthracyclines reported first were isolated from the pigment producer Streptomyces peucetius and were named doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DNR) (1). Anthracyclines are clinically important compounds and are widely used to date for the treatment of different cancers, such as breast cancer, lymphomas, acute leukemia, neuroblastomas, and bone and soft tissue sarcomas (2–4). Streptomyces olindensis strain DAUFPE 5622 produces a purple-pigmented anthracycline with both antimicrobial activity (e.g., a MIC of 0.01 μg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 29213) and antitumoral activity (e.g., a 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 0.110 μg/mL against the HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line) (5). Structural studies determined that the molecule, called cosmomycin D (COSD), is an aromatic complex with two trisaccharide chains attached at positions C-7 and C-10 on the aglycone (5, 6). Cosmomycins are an interesting group of compounds because they show one of the most complex glycosylation patterns found in anthracyclines, with position C-10 less frequently glycosylated than position C-7 (7).

Antitumor-antibiotic-producing microorganisms must be protected from the lethal effects of their own products. The ability inherent in the producer organisms is called self-resistance. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria and self-resistance mechanisms of antitumor-antibiotic-producing microorganisms is important to develop therapeutic drugs for the treatment of infectious diseases (8, 9). Antibiotic-producing microorganisms have a system that leads to transcription of the antibiotic-biosynthesizing genes at an appropriate time. To act effectively for self-resistance to its own antibiotic, antibiotic-modifying enzymes, target-protecting enzymes, antibiotic excretion systems, or DNA repair mechanisms must be present in the producer organisms when the biosynthetic pathway begins to produce the antibiotic (9–11).

The resistance mechanisms found in some anthracycline producers, such as S. peucetius, occur by the action of DrrA and DrrB, members of the ABC family of membrane transporters, which influence the efflux of DOX and DNR by the formation of an ABC transporter complex comprised of an ATPase and a transmembrane protein (10, 12–14). The second mechanism involves an inhibition or destabilization of the binding of DOX and DNR to genomic DNA by the action of the gene product of drrC, which codes for a protein with similarity to bacterial UvrA (10, 13–15).

In comparison with other anthracyclines, COSD exhibits a high toxicity (16), which leads to the hypothesis that this strain must possess additional or optimized self-resistance strategies. In the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), we identified a gene encoding a mycothiol peroxidase (MPx) inside the cosmomycin cluster, adjacent to other resistance genes that were very similar to those reported in other actinobacteria that use the low-molecular-weight thiol mycothiol (MSH) (17). MPx is a thiol peroxidase that belongs to the cysteine glutathione peroxidase (CysGPx)-like enzyme family, having the S-mycothiolation of the MPx as part of its H2O2 catalytic mechanism involved in controlling the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (17). There are two MPx paralog genes in the S. olindensis genome, while other species, such as Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces avermitilis, have only one MPx.

There are two MPx paralog genes in the S. olindensis genome, while other species, such as Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces avermitilis, have only one MPx. We observed for the first time that MPx can reduce a cysteine–MSH mixed disulfide, using a dithiol disulfide exchange mechanism, during the biosynthesis of COSD. Purification and identification of the MPx protein provided evidence that ROS-detoxifying proteins are employed by anthracycline producers. We describe in this study three self-resistance mechanisms against COSD in S. olindensis. The genes cosI and cosJ encode the first mechanism, an ABC transporter efflux system, while the second mechanism, encoded by cosU, is similar to drrC of S. peucetius and UvrA class IIa homologue proteins. Finally, a novel third mechanism, a mycothiol peroxidase (MPx) encoded by cosP, is involved in the detoxification of H2O2.

RESULTS RESULTS Self-resistance genes allocated within the cosmomycin D cluster. Self-resistance genes allocated within the cosmomycin D cluster. Self-resistance genes allocated within the cosmomycin D cluster. Analysis of the COSD biosynthetic gene cluster, located at contig 2 of the genome assembly of S. olindensis (JJOH00000002.1), enabled the assignment of each gene based on their homology to genes coding for proteins of known functions. The genes cosI (DF19_23560), cosJ (DF19_23565), cosP (DF19_23570), and cosU (DF19_23575) were identified as four candidate genes that might play a role concerning self-resistance. The products of cosI and cosJ are part of a superfamily of transport proteins (ABC transporters) that is one of the largest groups of proteins in nature (18). In detail, cosI codes for a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The amino acid sequence encoded by cosI shows the same features found in the prototypal anthracycline resistance protein DrrA from S. peucetius, such as the Walker A motif, Q loop, signature motif, Walker B motif, switch region, GATE (glycine loop and transducer element) domain, and DEF motif (19). This component is associated with transmembrane proteins that are responsible for the formation of pores through which substances are transported, known as transmembrane domains (TMDs) (20). The analysis of the product of cosJ shows a typical conformation of the TMD, composed of alpha helices organized as homodimers (21). Both proteins form part of the ABC transporter complex, which has 95.14% identity to the ABC transporter of Streptomyces purpurascens (accession numbers WP_189725841.1 and WP_189725842.1, respectively) (Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). For CosJ, six transmembrane helices, forming a transmembrane domain, can be predicted using Phyre and TMHMM (Fig. S1).

In close proximity to cosI and cosJ, cosP could be identified as another plausible resistance determinant. It encodes an enzyme (accession number KDN80073.1) that shows 88.34% identity on the amino acid level with the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) from S. purpurascens (accession number GHA30648.1).

Since KDN80073.1 was not in the UniProt database, first a small SSN with 100 proteins, denominated “seed,” was generated with the Enzyme Similarity Tool (22) and the FASTA sequence of KDN80073.1 (Fig. S5), with the aim of identifying close relatives of KDN80073.1 within the GPx family in Pfam. Since an identity level of 60% or higher was assumed to be sufficient to identify isofunctional protein clusters (22), we chose a level of 70% identity as the threshold in the seed SSN, where cluster 2 contained KDN80073.1 and a further 12 members, listed in Table S2.

A first SSN of Pfam family PF00255 was obtained using a threshold of about 55% similarity (Fig. S6); a large main cluster of 39,799 peroxidases included almost all actinobacterial proteins, together with those from other phyla, including known prokaryotic (e.g., BtuE of Escherichia coli [accession number P06610]) and eukaryotic (e.g., GPx1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [accession number P36014]) GPx proteins.

A complementary tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of COSD, executed on its [M + 2H]2+ ion, produced fragment ions that were in full agreement with the expected structure (Fig. S9 and Table S1).

The mycothiol peroxidase (MPx) from S. olindensis consists of 163 amino acids, three of which are Cys residues (C38, C66, and C84). Additionally, we purified a C38S mutant enzyme of MPx (bearing a mutation of Cys to Ser at position 38), obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. S11). We evaluated the peroxidase activity of both enzymes by ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX) assay to quantify H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) reduction within a time frame of 180 s. The WT MPx consumed the majority of H2O2 within 15 s, whereas the C38S mutant enzyme remained catalytically inactive, demonstrated by a constant amount of H2O2 remaining in the assay over the time used. The FOX assay performed with tBOOH showed a significant decrease in the concentration of tBOOH, although the consumption rate was slower than in the case of H2O2, as only half of the tBOOH was reduced after 180s (Fig. 4).

We also evaluated the MICs of H2O2 against S. olindensis, S. peucetius, and S. lividans (1 to 512 mM). For the concentrations tested, both of the anthracycline producers S. olindensis and S. peucetius survived 128 mM H2O2, thereby confirming a good response against H2O2. S. lividans was very sensitive to H2O2 (MIC of 8 mM) (Table 2), but its resistance to H2O2 improved notably when it contained a vector expressing cosP, showing a MIC of 32 mM (Fig. 5 and Table 2). This result indicates that MPx relieves this stress on S. olindensis, allowing it to survive persistent oxidative conditions.

To understand the role of CosP in S. olindensis H2O2 consumption, we evaluated the capacity of COSD producer S. olindensis and nonproducer S. lividans to reduce H2O2 over time, under conditions that favor COSD production. For this, we measured the rates of H2O2 consumption of total protein extracts at 24, 48, and 72 h of growth (Fig. 6). While both S. olindensis and S. lividans improved their H2O2 consumption rates at later growth stages, it was obvious that the cosP producer S. olindensis reduced H2O2 faster (Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION DISCUSSION In this work, we highlighted that S. olindensis has an extra MPx copy encoded by the cosmomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), acting in complementarity with the previously studied ABC transporter and UvrA class IIa anthracycline resistance proteins as a possible self-resistance factor during the production of COSD. Since other anthracycline BGCs containing the same genes are described in the literature—for example, a cytorhodin BGC (accession number MF773975.1) and other BGCs listed in Fig. S8—our findings can most likely be extended to some anthracycline-producing bacteria.

The protein encoded by cosI belongs to the superfamily of ATP-dependent ABC transporters. The organization of this protein includes two motifs, Walker A and Walker B, providing an ATP-binding site, and contains the unique signature motif in ABC transporters that is located upstream from the Walker B motif. For S. olindensis, it was classified as type I: the transporter system consists of two proteins encoded by independent genes, with CosI (NBD) containing the nucleotide-binding domains (Walker A and Walker B) and CosJ (TMD), the hydrophobic membrane protein, containing six transmembrane (TM) helices (Fig. S1).

ABC transporters belonging to this class have been so far reported solely in organisms that are producers of several antitumor agents (25). Daunorubicin and doxorubicin are anthracycline drugs produced by S. peucetius. Two genes (drrA and drrB) whose products form a type I transporter system have been cloned and found to confer resistance to daunorubicin/doxorubicin and mithramycin (mtrA and mtrB genes) (13, 14, 26–29).

In Gram-positive bacteria, such as actinobacteria, it has been reported that MPx is a novel CysGPx peroxidase family that degrades hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides in the presence of either the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR) or mycoredoxin 1/mycothiol/mycothione reductase (Mrx1MSH/Mtr) reducing systems. MPx protects against the damaging effects of ROS induced by multiple stressors, using thioredoxin or related redoxins as reductants (17, 30, 31). The S. olindensis genome has two putative genes that code for peroxidase-type proteins (accession numbers KDN80073.1 and KDN79115.1) and are involved in the general detoxification of H2O2. The protection is not only related to anthracycline production, in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 5 for the challenge with H2O2, in which S. olindensis and S. peucetius show a good detoxification response that is not related to any type of response against anthracycline production. Despite S. olindensis possessing two proteins that could cooperate in ROS depuration, the activity against H2O2 almost disappears in the KDN80073.1 mutant, indicating that this protein is an important scavenger of this peroxide in the cell, while S. peucetius has just one MPx annotated in its genome; however, it is more closely related to KDN79115.1 (67.82% identity) than to KDN80073.1 (56.33% identity).

It is known that anthracyclines produce free radicals that may, in association with ferric compounds, cause oxidative stress (32). Oxidative stress depends on reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated by the action of xenobiotics and because of metabolic processes (33). The oxidizing power of O2.− and H2O2 is harmful to cells. These species can inactivate important metabolic enzymes or alter their catalytic activity. H2O2 can cross the cell membrane and initiate lipid oxidation by deprotonation of fatty acids (34).

H2O2 can cross the cell membrane and initiate lipid oxidation by deprotonation of fatty acids (34). Biochemical and physiological data lead to the hypothesis that anthracyclines like DOX or, in our case, COSD can cause the formation of free radicals that stimulate lipid peroxidation and alter cellular integrity (35, 36). This hypothesis supports the premise that the oxidative metabolism of the anticancer quinones represents a significant contribution to the cytotoxic effects of these compounds (37). These species can inactivate important metabolic enzymes, altering their catalytic activity. In the case of H2O2, it can cross the cell membrane and initiate lipid oxidation by deprotonation of fatty acids (34), similar to findings reported for DOX during the redox cycle of anthracyclines (38).

Interestingly, the study of Westman and collaborators (39) correlated the biological activity of 7-deoxydoxorubicinolone in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The authors could show that the levels of expression of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in bacterial cells are higher than the levels in human cells from cardiac tissue. They concluded that bacterial cells are much more competent at dealing with the outcomes of anthracycline semiquinone oxidation-reduction cycling and the resulting reactive oxygen species (ROS) that evolve and that Streptomyces bacteria are generally well equipped to deal with reactive oxygen stress (39). The aglycone molecules may accumulate in membranes due to their hydrophobicity; the rapid growth and division of bacterial cells relative to that of eukaryotic cardiac tissue may also explain the differential effects of anthracycline aglycones on prokaryotes and eukaryotes (39).

Based on our present findings, we hypothesize that anthracyclines, such as COSD, are determinant in the production of ROS and that the recruitment of additional antioxidant enzymes coded in BGCs, such as KDN80073.1, can increase the self-resistance of antitumor antibiotics with potential cell toxicity. Another line of evidence is that KDN80073.1 groups with an independent protein cluster in the Pfam PF00255 family SSN, wherein all members belong to cosmomycin-like clusters (Fig. S7), which could also indicate that these proteins boost the protection against anthracycline-generated intracellular ROS.

COSD reportedly binds DNA more tightly than DOX (40), but it causes less DNA damage than DOX; even so, the levels of apoptosis induced by both drugs in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts are similar (16). CosU is responsible for minimizing the interaction between COSD and DNA, thereby avoiding damage.

Normally, DNA damage recognition is performed by the protein UvrA, which belongs to the ABC ATPase superfamily. Bacterial UvrA is a dimeric protein, unique among DNA repair enzymes. This feature enables UvrA to detect various DNA lesions by using an indirect readout mechanism. Other proteins, namely, UvrB, UvrC, and UvrD, are components of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and are essential for the survival of almost every living bacterium (41, 42).

Other proteins, namely, UvrB, UvrC, and UvrD, are components of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and are essential for the survival of almost every living bacterium (41, 42). The protein encoded by the cosU gene has a high similarity to UvrA proteins; however, it contains deletions of the UvrB-binding domain and the first zinc finger motif. For this reason, the protein function is not involved in NER and it is classified as a UvrA-like class IIa protein (43). Proteins of the latter class have been shown to behave in vitro like ATP-dependent DNA-binding proteins, such as that of S. peucetius from the daunorubicin cluster (10, 15), the nogalamycin produced by Streptomyces nogalater (44), the product of cmrX that confers resistance to chromomycin in Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus (45), and the product of mtrX, which is a UvrA-like protein involved in mithramycin resistance in Streptomyces argillaceus (46).

Interestingly, the most common characteristic of these antitumor antibiotics is that they intercalate to DNA and could represent a DNA-binding protein that plays a role in self-resistance, inhibiting or destabilizing the interaction of these drugs with genomic DNA, thus preventing intercalating antibiotics from interfering with cell transcription and/or replication. This suggests in turn that the function of UvrA class IIa proteins is associated with the removal of noncovalent DNA-binding agents.

Finally, we propose a model (Fig. 7) for the self-resistance in S. olindensis strain DAUFPE 5622 during cosmomycin D biosynthesis. This compound is recognized by the ABC transporter CosI/CosJ, and then mycothiol peroxidase (CosP) participates in the protection against H2O2 and lipid peroxidation caused by anthracyclines. The UvrA-like protein is important for reducing the interaction between DNA and the antibiotic. This mode of resistance represents an advantage for the producer strain for survival during antibiotic biosynthesis; the organism avoids the interaction of the harmful compound COSD with its intracellular target. Streptomyces evolution developed different strategies of self-resistance, and these depend on the form of action of the active compound. It is important to understand those mechanisms in producer microorganisms to evaluate plausible horizontal transfer in pathogenic strains and to develop therapeutic alternatives.

For the initial submission of PF00255, all settings were kept at the default, and a first SSN was generated using a Score threshold of 50, which means each edge joins nodes with at least 55% similarity. The second SSN used a slightly higher score threshold of 60 (nodes are joined if they share about 61% or more identity). Using the EFI Genome Neighborhood Tool (EFI-GNT tab) of the same website, a genome neighborhood network (GNN) and genome neighborhood diagrams (GNDs) of the second SSN were obtained using as parameters Neighborhood Size = 20 and Cooccurrence Percentage Lower Limit = 20.
