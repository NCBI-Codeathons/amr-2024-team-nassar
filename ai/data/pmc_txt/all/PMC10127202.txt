 In
this study, an unprecedented myxobacterial siderophore
termed
sorangibactin was discovered by heterologous expression of a coelibactin-like
nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster from the Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622. De novo structure elucidation
uncovered a linear polycyclic structure consisting of an N-terminal
phenol group, an oxazole, tandem N-methyl-thiazolidines,
and an unusual C-terminal γ-thiolactone moiety. Except for the
unprecedented oxazoline dehydrogenation to form an oxazole, which
we show to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, other
tailoring steps were found necessary for efficient downstream processing.
The unusual thioesterase (TE) domain is proposed to select homocysteine
or methionine for offloading involving an intramolecular γ-thiolactone
formation. Its active site comprises a rare cysteine, which was found
essential for product formation by point mutation to alanine or serine,
which both abolished its activity. This unusual release mechanism
and the resulting rare thiolactone structure can serve as a starting
point for detailed biochemical investigations. Introduction Introduction Myxobacteria are Gram-negative
δ-proteobacteria featuring
unique morphological characteristics, complex life cycles, large genomes,
and a particularly huge biosynthetic potential for secondary metabolite
production.1 Hundreds of structurally interesting
scaffolds and bioactive compounds from myxobacteria were discovered
over the past decades.2 Despite this rich
collection of characterized secondary metabolites, genome sequencing
as well as biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) annotation have revealed
that the majority of the myxobacterial biosynthetic potential is still
untapped.3−5 Thus, a “gene to compound” strategy
can shed light on assigning secondary metabolites to their BGCs and
finding unprecedented structures. As myxobacteria, especially the Sorangiineae suborder, are usually slow growing and barely
tractable for genetic manipulation, heterologous expression is particularly
promising to explore them, as it facilitates not only genome mining
for natural product discovery but also biosynthetic pathway engineering
and detailed biosynthesis studies.6 One
prolific starting point for the examination of cryptic BGCs are so-called
broad cosmid libraries,7 which can comprise
the entire genome of a selected bacterial strain in the form of plasmid
DNA and facilitate high-throughput heterologous expression.8 This approach also enables the unambiguous correlation
of BGCs with their products. Myxobacteria are Gram-negative

of BGCs with their products. One interesting structural class
of natural products are bacterial
siderophores, which are small-molecular-weight Fe(III)-specific ligands
that scavenge iron from their environment and enable uptake into the
cell through outer-membrane transporters.9 Siderophores from myxobacteria belong to two main categories, namely,
the catecholate-type such as the myxochelins10 and hyalachelins11 and the citrate-hydroxamate-type
such as the nannochelins.12 On the contrary,
over 500 congeners of diverse siderophore families have been described
from actinobacteria.13 One particularly
puzzling actinobacterial siderophore is coelibactin, the existence
of which has only been proposed based on the presence of the respective
BGC and for which only a hypothetical chemical structure is found
in the literature. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the respective
BGC found in the model species Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)14 enabled a prediction of the core
structure based on the predicted sequence of the nonribosomal peptide
synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster, yet isolation of coelibactin or derivatives
thereof failed for unknown reasons.15 One interesting structural class

secondary metabolite with siderophore-like behavior termed sorangibactin
from the Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 by heterologous
expression of a promoter-engineered NRPS gene cluster, which resembles
the coelibactin BGC. This coelibactin-like NRPS gene cluster was prioritized
due to the following reasons: (1) its bioinformatically predicted
structure resembles coelibactin from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2),14 which raises hope to contribute
to solving the puzzle of the coelibactins, (2) its regular operon
organization, which is suitable for promoter engineering, and (3)
multiple tailoring genes surrounding the core NRPS part, which indicates
auxiliary modifications before or after chain release and may endow
the final product with structural novelty and diversity. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel myxobacterial

NRPS Gene Cluster According to the antiSMASH prediction,16 the myxobacterial Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 exhibits a great biosynthetic potential of 62 biosynthetic
gene clusters and thus was prioritized for natural product discovery.
The strain was already explored using an OSMAC (one strain many compounds)
metabolomics approach in our laboratory, but even altered cultivation
conditions did not reflect its full biosynthetic potential making
this strain particularly interesting for genome-based discovery. Despite
several efforts, MSr11367 proved to be intractable for in situ genetic
manipulation. Therefore, a genomic DNA library in the form of cosmids
was generated for systematic screening of biosynthetic gene clusters
by heterologous expression in the genetically amenable host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622.17 Among the 62 BGCs encoded in the strain’s genome, we prioritized
a coelibactin-like NRPS gene cluster that showed widespread occurrence
of homologous BGCs in Sorangium cellulosum, Streptomyces, and Pseudomonas strains (Figure 1A), presumably indicating a conserved function of the correlating
secondary metabolites during evolution. The MSr11367 coelibactin-like
gene cluster (sorangibactin BGC) has been deposited in the GenBank
under the accession number OQ368584. The respective annotation of
the gene cluster is provided in Supporting Table S1. According to the antiSMASH prediction,16 the myxobacterial Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 exhibits a great biosynthetic potential of 62 biosynthetic

cosmid library
of the Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 and transferred
to the host M. xanthus DK1622 for expression;
however, no heterologous product was detected. Thus, a km-vanR-Pvan cassette was inserted between the two main operons (Figure S1), after which the first operon consisting
of transporter genes shares a strong constitutive promoter with the
kanamycin resistance gene and the second operon consisting of biosynthesis
genes is under the control of a vanillate-inducible Pvan promoter.
Principal component analysis (PCA) of high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) datasets revealed several molecular
features exclusively present in M. xanthus DK1622 mutants containing the promoter-engineered gene cluster and
absent in the M. xanthus DK1622 wild-type
host (Figure 1B–D).
The major component (termed sorangibactin A) could also be found in Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 extracts in equal concentrations
when cultivated under iron-deficient conditions, indicating it as
the final product of the respective BGC (Figure 1E). Isolation for structure elucidation was
performed utilizing the heterologous host, as besides its less complex
metabolome that was beneficial for the purification process, it also
shows faster growth rates reducing possible contamination issues during

exhibit an [M + H]+ peak for the
mixture of sorangibactins A1 and A2 at m/z 507.1190 matching the molecular formula C22H27N4O4S3+ (m/z calcd for [M + H]+ 507.1189, Δ0.2 ppm) featuring 12 double-bond equivalents (DBEs).
Combined one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra
uncovered a system comprising four heterocycles and one phenol, starting
from the N-terminus with a phenol substituted by an oxazole group
in the ortho-position, which is further connected
to two consecutive N-methylated thiazolidines linked
via an amide bond to a cyclic γ-thiolactone as the C-terminal
end (Figure 2). The
assignment of the oxazole moiety and the unusual C-terminus was underpinned
by 1H-15N HMBC experiments (see the SI) as well as the comparison of the chemical
shifts for the homocysteine thiolactone part to already published
NPs like thiolactomide.18 The two signal
sets for sorangibactins A1 and A2 were identical besides the signal
area of the isomerization of the C-terminal homocysteine thiolactone
upon purification. The corresponding methine signal for atom 4 of
sorangibactin A1 is located at δ(1H) = 4.09 ppm and
of A2 at δ(1H) = 4.16 ppm, whereas the adjoining
diastereotopic methylene group (atom 3) of sorangibactin A1 shows
a signal at δ(1H) = 2.10/1.92 ppm and A2 features
a methylene group without any diastereotopic effect at δ(1H) = 2.04 ppm. It is worth noting that, in the thiolactone
part, the HMBC correlation between the methylene group (atom 2) at
δ(1H) = 3.01 ppm and the carbonyl group (atom 1)
at δ(13C) = 179.5 ppm could not be identified. Nevertheless,

to well-described
siderophores; however, it features some uncommon modifications. The ortho-phenol moiety originating from salicylic acid incorporation
is also present in yersiniabactin produced by Yersinia
pestis(19) and predicted
for coelibactin from Streptomyces coelicolor.14 Furthermore, yersiniabactin features
one thiazolidine moiety and two dihydrothiazoles, whereby the thiazolidine
in contrast to sorangibactin is not N-methylated
and no dihydrothiazoles are present in sorangibactin. The oxazole
moiety in sorangibactin is different from the methylated dihydrooxazole
predicted for coelibactin. Finally, the main structural difference
of sorangibactin to published siderophores is clearly the uncommon
homocysteine thiolactone at the C-terminus, reflecting the unprecedented
structure of sorangibactin. This structural moiety impeded the purification
procedure and also sheds light on possible obstacles that might have
hindered structure elucidation of coelibactin: sorangibactins A1 and
A2 undergo hydrolysis during the standard purification setup with
formic acid as a modifier, resulting in the C-terminally ring-opened
sorangibactin B. The α-proton of the acid labile homocysteine
thiolactone tends to isomerize even when using the adapted purification
workflow leading to a mixture of the two isomers sorangibactins A1
and A2 (see the Methods section). Even though
we could not separate these two isomers, the corresponding NMR data
set of the mixture enabled the structural assignment of both of them. Several structure parts of sorangibactin show similarities

moiety in sorangibactin is different from the methylated dihydrooxazole
predicted for coelibactin. Finally, the main structural difference
of sorangibactin to published siderophores is clearly the uncommon
homocysteine thiolactone at the C-terminus, reflecting the unprecedented
structure of sorangibactin. This structural moiety impeded the purification
procedure and also sheds light on possible obstacles that might have
hindered structure elucidation of coelibactin: sorangibactins A1 and
A2 undergo hydrolysis during the standard purification setup with
formic acid as a modifier, resulting in the C-terminally ring-opened
sorangibactin B. The α-proton of the acid labile homocysteine
thiolactone tends to isomerize even when using the adapted purification
workflow leading to a mixture of the two isomers sorangibactins A1
and A2 (see the Methods section). Even though
we could not separate these two isomers, the corresponding NMR data
set of the mixture enabled the structural assignment of both of them. Several structure parts of sorangibactin show similarities
to well-described
siderophores; however, it features some uncommon modifications. The ortho-phenol moiety originating from salicylic acid incorporation
is also present in yersiniabactin produced by Yersinia
pestis(19) and predicted
for coelibactin from Streptomyces coelicolor.14 Furthermore, yersiniabactin features
one thiazolidine moiety and two dihydrothiazoles, whereby the thiazolidine
in contrast to sorangibactin is not N-methylated
and no dihydrothiazoles are present in sorangibactin. The oxazole

only Marfey’s derivatization assay was applicable since this
molecule is a peptide without any functionalities accessible for Mosher
esterification and due to its instabilities not attainable for crystallization
experiments as exemplarily performed to solve the stereochemistry
of the related siderophore yersiniabactin.20 Marfey’s analysis however could also only provide limited
information for three main reasons: (1) the hydrolysis of thiazolidines
is known to lead to the oxidation state of an aldehyde instead of
the free acid, which is instable and degrades,21 (2) the stereocenters at positions 9 and 15 originate from
the former carboxyl function of the cysteine before cyclization to
the thiazolidine group and thus would lose stereo information again
upon hydrolysis, and (3) the mixture of sorangibactins A1 and A2 contains
both R- and S-configurations of
the α-proton of the C-terminal homocysteine thiolactone, which
cannot be separated. Consequently, only positions 7 and 12 could reasonably
be accessible by Marfey’s analysis, but they were found to
isomerize during hydrolysis. HPLC-HRMS analysis displayed a mixture
of four enantiomers with a mass of m/z 430.14 ± 0.02 corresponding to FDLA-derivatized N-methyl cysteine and homocysteine (Figure S2). Hence, we can solely present the flat structure with a bioinformatic
prediction of all S-configurations due to the absence
of an epimerase in the respective modules. For the stereochemical assignment of sorangibactins A1 and A2,

a second congener of the sorangibactin family
through provoking hydrolysis of the rather labile thioester yielding
the ring-opened product sorangibactin B (Figure 2). HPLC-HRMS experiments show an [M + H]+ peak for sorangibactin B at m/z 525.1298 with a predicted molecular formula C22H28N4O5S3+ (m/z calcd for [M + H]+ 525.1295,
Δ0.6 ppm) featuring 11 double-bond equivalents (DBEs). Noteworthily,
more than five isomers of sorangibactin B are present in fractions
that underwent the hydrolyzing isolation conditions using formic acid
during purification. The presumably isomerizing stereocenters are
most likely the ones belonging to the homocysteine and the two thiazolidine
parts exhibiting five stereocenters. Thus, the following structure
elucidation belongs to the most abundant isomer unveiling the most
intensive NMR correlations. In contrast to sorangibactins A1 and A2,
the cyclic homocysteine thiolactone is opened, which shows an impact
on the corresponding shifts due to the more shielded free carboxylic
acid (atom 1) with a shift at δ(13C) = 176.6 ppm
compared to the former thioester function. The HMBC spectrum exhibits
two correlations to the free carboxyl group (atom 1) from methylene
groups (atoms 2 and 3) at δ(1H) = 2.27 and 1.59 ppm.
The more downfield-shifted signal can be explained by the close neighborhood
to the thiol function. Corresponding COSY correlations from the more
shielded methylene group (atom 3) to the homocysteine α-proton
(atom 4) at δ(1H) = 4.68 ppm can be observed. Furthermore,
HMBC correlations evince from atom 4 as well as the methine group
of the adjacent thiazolidine ring (atom 7) at δ(1H) = 3.57 ppm to the connective amide group (atom 6) at δ(13C) = 173.0 ppm. Comparing the remaining data set to sorangibactins
A1 and A2, the signals corresponding to the N-terminal part from atom
8 to 26 are similar with ≤0.1 ppm deviation for 1H and ≤2.1 ppm for 13C shifts. We also obtained

A2, and B. Just as for the structurally related siderophores yersiniabactin,
ulbactin B, and escherichelin, characteristic fragmentation behavior
can also be observed for sorangibactins.22 The three main fragment ions of sorangibactin B are in accordance

from salicylic
acid is further
supported by feeding 2-hydroxybenzoic acid-d6, resulting in a +4 mass shift of the respective fragment
(Figure 3B). Feeding l-serine-13C3,15N and l-cysteine-13C3,15N resulted in the
+4 and +8 mass shift, respectively, which indicates the NRPS to incorporate
one serine and two cysteines and is consistent with the proposed sorangibactin
structure containing one oxazole and two thiazolidine substructures.
Interestingly, feeding l-methionine-13C5,15N not only showed a +1 mass shift indicating a methyl
transfer but also a +5, which indicated the incorporated homocysteine
originating from methionine at the C-terminus, which is additionally

and A2 showed no obvious bioactivity against
our test panel of bacterial and fungal pathogens and selected cell
lines (Table S2). However, siderophore-like
behavior was observed during UHR-TOF measurements even before the
purification of sorangibactin. Besides the double charged species
at m/z 254.0632 and the [M + H]+ signal at m/z 507.1190,
the MS spectrum of sorangibactins A1 and A2 exhibits a peak at m/z 560.0307. With a mass distance of m/z 52.9117 to the [M + H]+ peak,
it equals [M – 2H + Fe3+]+ with the predicted
sum formula of C22H24FeN4O4S3+ (m/z calcd
for [M – 2H + Fe3+]+ 560.0304, Δ0.5

evidence about sorangibactin being a siderophore is obtained by cultivation
of MSr11367 under iron-deficient conditions using RGAE2 medium and
iron-rich conditions by supplementing 1 mM FeCl3. As a
result, iron limitation during cultivation induced the production
of sorangibactin, whereas external addition of iron suppressed the
production (Figure S4). This is a well-established
indicator for siderophore features of molecules.24,25 Apart from that, possibilities to determine the exact affinity to
iron in terms of binding properties is commonly conducted via competition
experiments with a strong binder like EDTA.26 However, this approach was not possible for the sorangibactins due

from which 17 proteins are annotated (Table S1) and proposed to be involved in biosynthesis (SrbA–SrbK),
transportation (SrbL–SrbP), and regulation (SrbR). Besides
in silico analysis, gene deletion and point mutation by Redαβ
recombineering (see the Methods section and Figure S1) were carried out using the heterologous
expression system. Based on those experiments, we present the following
biosynthesis hypothesis of the sorangibactins. The sorangibactin BGC spans approximately 32 kb of DNA sequence,

recombineering (see the Methods section and Figure S1) were carried out using the heterologous

biosynthesis hypothesis of the sorangibactins. Biosynthesis
of the sorangibactins was initiated by salicylic acid formation catalyzed
by SrbB, which shows 48.5% similarity with Irp9, a bifunctional salicylate
synthase from Yersinia enterocolitica that can convert chorismate to salicylic acid in yersiniabactin
biosynthesis.27 Deletion of srbB abolished heterologous production of sorangibactins in M. xanthus DK1622, whereas feeding salicylic acid
to the srbB knockout mutant restored the production
(Figure S5). The salicylic acid was then
adenylated and loaded to the first carrier protein of SrbC by SrbK
(Figure 4A), a stand-alone
A domain-containing protein, which is predicted to use salicylic acid
as a substrate (Table S3). Deletion of srbK completely abolished the heterologous production of
sorangibactins in M. xanthus DK1622
(Figure S6). SrbC and SrbD are nonribosomal
peptide synthases, which comprise seven and five domains, respectively
(Figure 4A). Each adenylation
domain was predicted by antiSMASH to use cysteine as a substrate (Table S3); however, our biosynthesis model rather
suggests the first adenylation domain in SrbC to activate serine instead,
which is further modified to form the oxazole incorporated in the
sorangibactin structure. This is consistent with the above-mentioned
result from feeding l-serine-13C3,15N (Figure 3B). The terminal thioesterase (TE) domain utilizes a cysteine as
the active-site nucleophile instead of commonly used serine (Figure S7), which is not unprecedented but rare.28 Point mutation of this cysteine to alanine or
serine (Figure S8) abolished the heterologous
production of sorangibactin A in M. xanthus DK1622 (Figure S6), which indicates its
essential role. Besides, this TE domain was proposed to select homocysteine
or methionine as an intermolecular nucleophile for chain release resulting
in one more amino acid incorporation at the C-terminus, which was
confirmed by feeding l-methionine-13C5,15N (Figure 3B). Use of a free amino acid for chain release was previously
found in threonine-tagged lipopeptide biosynthesis, where the TE domain
selects the intermolecular nucleophiles threonine hydroxy or amino
groups yielding ester- and amide-linked threonine tags.29 However, the complete C-terminal homocysteine
thiolactone formation in sorangibactin biosynthesis is still unclear
and may involve other tailoring enzymes, which is still under investigation. Biosynthesis
of the sorangibactins was initiated by salicylic acid formation catalyzed
by SrbB, which shows 48.5% similarity with Irp9, a bifunctional salicylate

peptide synthases, which comprise seven and five domains, respectively
(Figure 4A). Each adenylation
domain was predicted by antiSMASH to use cysteine as a substrate (Table S3); however, our biosynthesis model rather
suggests the first adenylation domain in SrbC to activate serine instead,
which is further modified to form the oxazole incorporated in the
sorangibactin structure. This is consistent with the above-mentioned
result from feeding l-serine-13C3,15N (Figure 3B). The terminal thioesterase (TE) domain utilizes a cysteine as
the active-site nucleophile instead of commonly used serine (Figure S7), which is not unprecedented but rare.28 Point mutation of this cysteine to alanine or
serine (Figure S8) abolished the heterologous
production of sorangibactin A in M. xanthus DK1622 (Figure S6), which indicates its
essential role. Besides, this TE domain was proposed to select homocysteine
or methionine as an intermolecular nucleophile for chain release resulting
in one more amino acid incorporation at the C-terminus, which was
confirmed by feeding l-methionine-13C5,15N (Figure 3B). Use of a free amino acid for chain release was previously
found in threonine-tagged lipopeptide biosynthesis, where the TE domain
selects the intermolecular nucleophiles threonine hydroxy or amino
groups yielding ester- and amide-linked threonine tags.29 However, the complete C-terminal homocysteine
thiolactone formation in sorangibactin biosynthesis is still unclear
and may involve other tailoring enzymes, which is still under investigation. Biosynthesis
of the sorangibactins was initiated by salicylic acid formation catalyzed
by SrbB, which shows 48.5% similarity with Irp9, a bifunctional salicylate
synthase from Yersinia enterocolitica that can convert chorismate to salicylic acid in yersiniabactin
biosynthesis.27 Deletion of srbB abolished heterologous production of sorangibactins in M. xanthus DK1622, whereas feeding salicylic acid
to the srbB knockout mutant restored the production
(Figure S5). The salicylic acid was then
adenylated and loaded to the first carrier protein of SrbC by SrbK
(Figure 4A), a stand-alone
A domain-containing protein, which is predicted to use salicylic acid
as a substrate (Table S3). Deletion of srbK completely abolished the heterologous production of
sorangibactins in M. xanthus DK1622
(Figure S6). SrbC and SrbD are nonribosomal

are proposed to be tailoring enzymes that work in trans. SrbE is a
putative oxidoreductase containing a saccharopine dehydrogenase NADP-binding
domain (PF03435.17) and SrbF/G are proposed to be methyltransferases.
Gene deletion of SrbE/F/G was achieved by replacing them with an ampicillin
resistance gene, followed by a Ptet promoter to drive the downstream
expression avoiding polar effects (Figure S1), which resulted in the abolishment of sorangibactin A production
and indicated their essential role for biosynthesis (Figure S6). SrbH is a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, sharing
remarkable similarity with the CYP105N1 from the S.

of CYP105N1 revealed an unexpected wide open substrate binding pocket,
which was proposed to bind the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-bound
substrate; however, the reaction catalyzed by CYP105N1 is still unclear.30,31 Deletion of srbH abolished sorangibactin A production
in M. xanthus DK1622, whereas another
compound, termed sorangibactin C, was found accumulated (Figure S6). Molecular ion clusters [M + H]+ (m/z 509.1332) and [M +
2H]2+ (m/z 255.0716)
in ESI-HRMS revealed the elemental formula C22H28N4O4S3 of sorangibactin C, which
shows a highly similar fragmentation pattern with sorangibactin A
and contains two more atoms of hydrogen in the first two cyclic moieties
(Figure S10). Feeding l-serine-2,3,3-d3 revealed that these two atoms of hydrogen
originated from serine, and therefore, oxazoline instead of oxazole
is proposed for the sorangibactin C structure (Figure 4B). SrbH therefore presumably targets the
carrier protein-bound substrate and catalyzes oxazoline dehydrogenation
to form an oxazole on the assembly line (Figure 4A). However, the accumulation of sorangibactin
C could also indicate SrbH to be a post-tailoring enzyme. SrbI shows
47.9% similarity with Irp3 from Yersinia enterocolitica (PDB: 5KVQ) and is assigned as trans-acting thiazolinyl imine
reductase, catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of a CP-tethered
thiazoline ring.32,33 Deletion of srbI abolished sorangibactin A production, whereas the shunt product
sorangibactin D observed at [M + H]+m/z 376.0422 (calculated C16H14N3O4S2+ 376.0420, Δ0.5
ppm) was accumulated (Figure S11), which
indicates that the thiazoline reduction is necessary for downstream
processing, otherwise resulting in early hydrolytic release. SrbJ
is proposed to belong to the VOC (vicinal oxygen chelate) superfamily
that catalyzes diverse reactions.34 The
function of SrbJ in sorangibactin biosynthesis is unclear but indispensable,
as of srbJ deletion abolished sorangibactin A production
(Figure S6). At this moment, we cannot
fully assign each of these biosynthesis enzymes to the structure,
as the obvious accumulation of intermediate was not observed in each
gene knockout, presumably due to the non-native intermediates stalling
the whole machinery or chemical instabilities of the resulting shunt

were all
experimentally confirmed to be directly involved in sorangibactin
biosynthesis, seven additional genes were found in the sorangibactin
BGC. SrbA is a proposed tailoring enzyme containing an α/β
hydrolase domain. Deletion of srbA by Redαβ
recombineering (see the Methods section and Figure S1) had no obvious influence on heterologous
production of sorangibactins in M. xanthus DK1622 (Figures S5 and S6), which can
either be explained by a functional homologue of srbA present in the M. xanthus DK1622
chromosome or srbA being not involved in sorangibactin
biosynthesis. SrbR is an LysR family transcriptional regulator, and
SrbL–SrbP are all transporter related. Whether or how the regulator
and these transporters are correlated to sorangibactin production,
however, was not investigated here. In addition to the 10 core genes described above that

heterologous expression enabled the
discovery of a novel myxobacterial natural product termed sorangibactin
from the myxobacterial strain MSr11367. This genomics-guided approach
highlighted the accessibility of its biosynthetic potential that was
not reflected in its metabolome in our previous studies. De novo structure
elucidation of sorangibactin revealed the presence of an unprecedented
γ-thiolactone at the C-terminus, which may help to solve the
puzzle of the chemical structure of coelibactin based on their gene
cluster similarity via the adapted purification route reducing putative
degradation and isomerization issues as well as by providing reference
data for comparison to facilitate the structure elucidation. Both
biosynthetic pathways contain conserved cytochrome P450 enzymes, and
the coelibactin P450 CYP105N1 protein was structurally characterized;
however, their functions remained elusive before this study. Here,
we discovered the sorangibactin P450-dependent enzyme SrbH, which
is proposed to oxidize oxazoline to oxazole, representing the first
P450-mediated oxazoline dehydrogenation in NRPS biosynthesis. Furthermore,
both gene clusters involve an unusual TE domain containing a rare
active-site cysteine instead of the commonly used serine. For the
sorangibactin biosynthesis, we propose that homocysteine or methionine
is incorporated into the C-terminus by this unusual TE domain, most
probably together with other unassigned tailoring enzymes, resulting
in γ-thiolactone moiety formation in a manner that is not yet
fully understood. Therefore, the bioinformatically predicted coelibactin
structure remains to be experimentally characterized. Future studies
could address the indispensable SrbE (saccharopine dehydrogenase NADP-binding
domain-containing protein, also present in the coelibactin biosynthetic
pathway with yet unknown function) and SrbJ (glyoxalase-like domain-containing
protein, absent in the coelibactin biosynthetic pathway but conserved
in many other BGC homologues), both of which are rare in natural product
biosynthesis and worthy for further biochemical investigations. Homologous
gene clusters are widespread not only in myxobacteria but also in Streptomyces and Pseudomonas strains, which
indicates conservative functions across bacteria and potential for
further discovery and characterization of sorangibactin analogues. Genome mining and subsequent

containing the promoter-engineered gene cluster was
used for large-scale fermentation (see the SI). The myxobacterial extract in methanol was partitioned three times
with hexane, dried, and redissolved in water to be partitioned three
times with first ethyl acetate and later chloroform. Subsequently,
the obtained chloroform phase was redissolved in methanol and fractionated
with an Isolera Spektra One (Biotage) system. Respective fractions

the mixture of sorangibactins A1 and A2 was obtained and stored under
nitrogen at −20 °C until further use. For isolation of

Separation was achieved with an Acquity BEH C18 column (100 mm ×
2.1 mm, 1.7 μm dp) (Waters) in combination with a Waters VanGuard
BEH C18 1.7 μm guard using a linear 5–95% gradient of
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid in ddH2O with 0.1% formic
acid for 18 min. Detection was conducted by a diode array detector
at 200–600 nm, the flow rate adjusted to 0.6 mL/min, the column
heated to 45 °C, and the LC flow split to 75 μL/min before
entering the mass spectrometer. Following MS settings were applied
for standard measurements: capillary voltage 4000 V, end plate offset
−500 V, nebulizer gas pressure 1 bar, dry gas flow rate 5 L/min,
dry gas temperature 200 °C, and mass scan range m/z 150–2500. MS/MS measurements were carried
out in collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation mode with
a collision energy of 5 eV. The mass spectrometer was calibrated in
quadratic + HPC calibration mode on the masses of the first isotope
signal of sodium formate clusters, which are formed in the ion source
after co-injection of a mixture of 1 mM sodium hydroxide in 1:1 water/isopropanol
+ 0.1% FA. Additional lock mass calibration was performed on m/z 622.0277, m/z 922.0103, and m/z 1221.9960. All HPLC-HRMS
measurements were conducted on a maXis 4G UHR-TOF system (Bruker Daltonics)
equipped with an ESI source and coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000
rapid separation liquid chromatography (RSLC, Thermo Fisher) system.
