Objective Objective In order to isolate and identify bacteria that produce potentially novel bactericidal/bacteriostatic compounds, two ponds on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) were targeted as part of a bioprospecting effort. In order to isolate and identify bacteria that produce potentially novel bactericidal/bacteriostatic compounds, two ponds on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) were targeted as part of a bioprospecting effort. Results Results One of the unique isolates, RIT 452 was identified as Exiguobacterium sp. and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The genome was assembled and in silico analysis was performed to predict the secondary metabolite gene clusters, which suggested the potential of Exiguobacterium RIT452 for producing antibiotic compounds. Extracts of spent growth media of RIT452 were active in disc diffusion assays performed against four reference strains, two Gram-negative (E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and two Gram-positive (B. subtilis BGSC 168 and S. aureus ATCC 25923). Differential extraction and liquid chromatography was used to fractionate the extracts. Efforts to identify and elucidate the structure of the active compound(s) are still ongoing.

Keywords Introduction Introduction Antibiotic resistance was first discovered in the 1940s, when it was observed that bacteria were become increasingly resistant to measures taken against them [1]. However, this development did not become a global issue until antibiotic abuse in medicine and animal husbandry became more widespread [2–4]. Antibiotic resistance dramatically increased in the 1980s and 1990s due to a discovery void. The progressive increase of antibiotic resistance and the decline in research and development of antibiotics combined to produce the current crisis [5]. Since there have been few developments in the creation of new antibiotic classes for many years, bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to those that are currently in use [1, 6]. The targets of antibiotics are diverse; protein synthesis, DNA replication, RNA synthesis and the cell membrane are common targets [4]. Antibiotics with novel targets need to be developed for replacing the existing drugs.

Antibiotics with novel targets need to be developed for replacing the existing drugs. The β-lactam core structure is part of a number of antibiotic classes, but β-lactam resistance is widespread and is conferred by over 300 types of β-lactamases, of which 200 are able to hydrolyze extended spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics [7]. Therefore, increasing the structural diversity of antimicrobial compounds becomes important. Estimates of all possible small molecules are pegged at 1063 distinct molecules, of which many may not be accessible by synthesis [8]. Only a small fraction of these molecules are biologically relevant [9]. However, natural compounds offer better chances of finding bioactive molecules with entirely new chemical scaffolds than combinatorial chemistry libraries, since they have evolved to be bioactive, and can often enter cells via transmembrane transporters rather than by passive diffusion [10]. Statistical analysis reveals the continuing trend of chemical novelty in natural products as de-replication tools are increasingly being implemented [11]. In this context, shifting to less known bacterial phyla, rather than over-represented phyla such as the Actinobacteria might increase diversity of the antibiotics identified by prospecting [12]. The goal of our study is to identify novel bacteria that yield potentially novel compounds, which may become starting points to develop more specific and potent antibiotics.

RIT452 was identified during the screening of bacterial isolates from a campus pond, with potential bacteriostatic/bactericidal properties, and its genome was sequenced. The genome was subjected to secondary metabolite analysis via the antibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell 5.0 (antiSMASH) [13] and the antibiotic resistance target seeker (ARTS) platforms [14]. Organic compounds extracted from the spent growth media of RIT452 were shown to inhibit the growth of Gram negative and Gram positive reference strains.

The data presented here shows that Exiguobacterium sp. RIT452 produces a broad spectrum antibiotic, which after fractionating by differential extraction and chromatography, was not structurally characterized. The facultative anaerobic Gram-positive genus Exiguobacterium consists of motile, non-spore forming species [15], widely distributed in the environment, including extremophiles growing in high altitude salt plains [16], hot springs [17, 18], oceans, Antarctic dry valleys and permafrost [18], while others tolerate gamma radiation [19], organic solvents [20], chromium and mercury [21–23], arsenic [16, 24–26], pesticides [27], alkaline wastewater [28], and heat [29–32]. All of this is accomplished without the ability to form spores, suggesting other physiological changes help them cope with these stresses. The data presented here shows that Exiguobacterium sp.

The “putative antibiotic” BGC identified at locus 897206–908755 shares sequence similarity with a Lugdunin locus, an antibiotic first isolated from S. lugdunensis, a commensal of the human nasal cavity [40]. This novel thiazolidine-containing cyclic peptide antimicrobial was shown to be effective against S. aureus. Using the genome sequence of RIT 452, ARTS predicted three BGCs, out of which two show “proximity hits” (Table 1).

This suggests that cell elongation might be a generic stress response in the Exigobacterium genus. However, it is not known if this response also occurs as a result of interaction with other bacteria. Exiguobacterium strains have been previously reported to nearly triple their cell length after exposure to organic solvents [20], whereas RIT452 also undergoes cell elongation upon starvation. This suggests that cell elongation might be a generic stress response in the Exigobacterium genus. However, it is not known if this response also occurs as a result of interaction with other bacteria. An Indian rhizosphere Exiguobacterium strain produces a broad spectrum with an unusual dihydroergotamine-type antibiotic [42], apart from which little is known about bioactive compounds produced by the genus Exiguobacterium. The diversity of microbial metabolites may be partly underestimated, since each BGC does not necessarily produce only one metabolite, and growth conditions may change the metabolite produced by altering the expression of the same BGC [43]. Sequence identity at the level of genes in BGC producing similar compounds were reported to range between 58 and 80% [44]. By these criteria, the similarity to known BGC for our data is not very high, suggesting potential novelty.

The suggestion of metabolite novelty is encouraging since the RIT 452 extract contains compound(s) inhibiting a Gram positive clinical strain (MRSA) at lower concentrations (apparent MIC) than Gram negative clinical strains (Additional file 1: Table S1). Fractionation of the extracts using a non-clinical S. aureus strain shows that the activity is concentrated in the range of 95% acetonitrile, which hints at a relatively non-polar compound. Further “wet lab” experiments are needed to identify the bioactive compound(s) to verify the predictions made by bioinformatics analysis.

RIT452 extracts (on discs) inhibit the growth of (A) E. coli, (B) S. aureus, (C) P. aeruginosa, and (D) B. subtilis. On each plate from top left to right the discs have 20 µl Tetracycline at 10 mg/ml (1), 10 µl extract (2), 20 µl extract (3), 40 µl extract (4), 60 µl extract (5), and 20 µl methanol as a negative control (6). (E) The inhibition zones in each case show a graded increase in the diameter of the zone of inhibition with increasing amounts of extract. Error bars from triplicate readings are shown and it can be seen that the linear range goes approximately up to 20 µL. Table S1. Estimated apparent MICs of the RIT 452 crude extracts computed according to the CLSI guidelines. Additional file 1: Figure S1. A–D: Disc diffusion assay.
