Dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins are conserved transcriptional enhancers found in all eukaryotes. A recently reported and novel function for bZIPs is association of these proteins with secondary metabolite production in filamentous fungi. In particular a Yap-like bZIP termed RsmA (restorer of secondary metabolism A) was identified in Aspergillus nidulans that positively regulates the carcinogen sterigmatocystin. To assess for conserved function for RsmA, we examined a role of this protein in secondary metabolism in the pathogen A. fumigatus. RsmA was found to positively regulate gliotoxin where overexpression (OE) of rsmA led to 2–100 fold increases of twelve gli cluster metabolites in culture medium including the newly identified gli metabolite cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser). Lungs from both wild type and OErsmA infected mice contained gliotoxin (2.3 fold higher in OErsmA treatment) as well as the gliotoxin precursor cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) (3.2 fold higher in OErsmA treatment). The data here presents a conserved role for RsmA in secondary metabolite cluster activation and suggests cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) may serve as an alternative marker for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Introduction Introduction Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen of immunosuppressed individuals. In immunosuppressed hosts, invasive aspergillosis (IA) represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with mortality rates ranging from 40% to 90% [1], [2]. Part of the virulence of A. fumigatus is associated with its ability to produce a variety of toxic natural products. The natural product pathways in fungi result in the production of structurally diverse and low-molecular-weight compounds referred to as secondary metabolites (SMs) [3]. Although the functions of many fungal SMs remain to be determined, the known SMs of the genus Aspergillus have a tremendous impact on society. Compounds such as lovastatin (antihypercholesterolemic agent) and penicillin (antibiotic) are of clinical importance whereas the carcinogen, aflatoxin, causes both short term toxicities and long term liver cancer when humans eat contaminated crops [3].

Compounds such as lovastatin (antihypercholesterolemic agent) and penicillin (antibiotic) are of clinical importance whereas the carcinogen, aflatoxin, causes both short term toxicities and long term liver cancer when humans eat contaminated crops [3]. Biosynthetic genes for individual SMs are typically clustered, and regulation of these clustered genes is often dependent on pathway-specific transcription factors. For example, the aflatoxin and related sterigmatocystin gene clusters contain one gene, aflR, that encodes a transcription factor regulating expression of the remaining biosynthetic genes [4], [5]; similarly gliZ encodes the transcription factor required for expression of the gliotoxin (gli) cluster genes in A. fumigatus
[6]. In addition, SM cluster activation is also regulated at a higher hierarchic level by the nuclear protein LaeA [7]. Overexpression of laeA results in increase in the production of a multitude of SMs while deletion of laeA yields opposite results in many fungi [7]–[10]. Studies of the human pathogen, A. fumigatus, showed SMs such as gliotoxin are upregulated when laeA is overexpressed, and that deletion of laeA results in decreased virulence in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic murine models [6], [11].

The well-known A. fumigatus SM gliotoxin, a mycotoxin readily detected in IA, has immunosuppressive and apoptotic activities in the host [12]–[14]. Deletant strains of either gliZ or gliP (encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, NRPS, required for gliotoxin synthesis), are less damaging to host tissue during in vitro studies and insect model studies [15]–[17]. Additionally, these mutants show reduced virulence in non-neutropenic murine models but not neutropenic models [6], [18]–[20]. This toxin and/or its derivatives are also considered for use for diagnosis of IA [21], [22]. Aside from gliZ, no other transcription factors have been described to regulate the gli cluster.

This toxin and/or its derivatives are also considered for use for diagnosis of IA [21], [22]. Aside from gliZ, no other transcription factors have been described to regulate the gli cluster. Recently, several bZIP transcription factors have been found to regulate secondary metabolism in several fungal genera [23]–[27]. For example, a suppressor mutagenesis in A. nidulans identified rsmA, encoding a bZIP transcriptional enhancer, that when overexpressed could partially restore secondary metabolism in ΔlaeA strains [28]. Overexpression of rsmA (OErsmA) increased sterigmatocystin production in A. nidulans more than 40 fold through transcriptional activation of aflR
[29]. Here we find that overexpression of the A. fumigatus rsmA ortholog, also called rsmA, increases gliotoxin synthesis to a similar fold as sterigmatocystin in OErsmA strains of A. nidulans. This increase is mediated via transcriptional activation of gliZ. In addition to gliotoxin, the gli cluster derivative cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) was found to accumulate in murine lungs from both OErsmA and wild type infected mice and may represent an alternative marker for diagnosis of IA. Furthermore, supporting previous research data that indicates gliotoxin negatively impacts neutrophil migration [30] we found that supernatants of A. fumigatus OErsmA but not those of OErsmAΔgliZ or wild type inhibit human neutrophil chemotaxis.

To construct a pyrG1 complementation plasmid, a 2.0-kb A. parasiticus pyrG PCR product was amplified from pJW24 [34] using primers JP Apara pyrG Short For and JP Apara pyrG Short Rev and subsequently cloned into pBluescript II SK- (Fermentas) to generate pJMP7. A plasmid to over-express rsmA was created by fusion PCR [35] of the gpdA promoter (JP gpdA(p) EcoRI For and MK Afumi Bzip Fusion Rev) and a 1.5-kb rsmA product (MK Afumi Bzip Fusion For and MK Afumi Bzip EcoRI Rev). The resulting 3.0-kb fusion PCR product was cloned into pJMP7 with EcoRI to generate pRS1. Construction of Fungal Strains Construction of Fungal Strains Construction of Fungal Strains Fungal transformation was done as previously described [36]. Gene replacement constructs for laeA, rsmA, and gliZ were made using double-joint PCR [35], [37].

Neutrophil Recruitment Neutrophil Recruitment Neutrophil Recruitment Neutrophil recruitment assays were performed using a microfluidic chemotaxis platform developed and described in more detail elsewhere [39]. In brief, the device is able to generate a linear gradient of soluble factors between a source channel containing the compounds to be tested and a sink channel containing the neutrophils. The gradient is generated in a thin cross-channel in which neutrophils from the sink channel can invade. The quantification was performed using software developed in-house (source code and software can be obtained upon request). The neutrophil purification was performed with a gradient centrifugation process using Polymorphprep solution, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Nycomed, Sheldon, UK). The neutrophils were re-suspended to a concentration of 4 million per mL in PBS, and kept no more than 2 h at 4 degrees Celsius. The microfluidic devices were prepared by filling them with modified HBSS (HBSS solution containing 2% HEPES buffer and 0.1% HAS), after which 4 µL of neutrophil suspension was added in each sink channel of each device, and finally 3 µL of the crude supernatants was inserted into each source channel of each device. The negative control was performed by adding blank GMM (the fungal growth medium) to the source channel, and the positive control was performed by adding a solution of 100 nM fMLP (F3506, Sigma Aldrich) in GMM.

OErsmA Mutants are Resistant to Menadione OErsmA Mutants are Resistant to Menadione OErsmA Mutants are Resistant to Menadione An examination of RsmA function in A. nidulans showed that RsmA binds a Yap1 DNA-binding site [29]. Although A. nidulans RsmA showed no response to oxidative stress [40], other fungal Yap-like bZIP proteins are often associated with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) response [41], [42]. To assess any possible role of A. fumigatus rsmA on oxidation stress, conidia of OErsmA, OErsmAΔlaeA, OErsmAΔgliZ and ΔrsmA mutants and their controls were inoculated on GMM with varying concentrations of menadione and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. All strains containing an OErsmA allele grew better than their respective controls on 20 and 30 µM menadione, regardless of the absence of either the laeA or gliZ allele, thus showing increased resistance of these strains to ROS induced by menadione (Figure 2).

OErsmA Increases Production of Multiple gli Pathway Metabolites OErsmA Increases Production of Multiple gli Pathway Metabolites OErsmA Increases Production of Multiple gli Pathway Metabolites In A. nidulans, overexpression of rsmA increased the production of sterigmatocystin 40–100 fold dependent on culture condition [28]. To examine any possible conserved role of RsmA in A. fumigatus, we examined SM production in several cultural conditions. First strains were grown in gliotoxin inducing conditions (liquid GMM for 3 days, shaking at 25°C). Here the OErsmA strain produced more gliotoxin than wild type, and no gliotoxin was visibly detected in ΔlaeA background strains by thin layer chromatography, nor was gliotoxin production rescued in the OErsmAΔlaeA double mutant (Figure S4). As expected the increase of gliotoxin was dependent on presence of the gliZ gene as observed by gliotoxin loss in the OErsmAΔgliZ mutant. By eye, ΔrsmA produced a similar TLC profile as wild type. Extracts from strains grown at 37°C on solid medium did not exhibit noticeable differences in SM profiles (data not shown).

An examination of gliZ, gliI (a biosynthetic gene in the gli cluster) and gliT (encoding a gliotoxin oxidase providing endogenous protection against gliotoxin) expression at gliotoxin inducing conditions verified a positive impact of rsmA on gliotoxin gene expression where all three genes were upregulated in the OErsmA background (Figure 3A).

Collection of gliZ-dependent metabolites profiled in this study, structures and gliZ-dependency in A. fumigatus was previously established in [38]. The increased expression of gliZ in the OErsmA strain was of considerable interest as GliZ has been found to be required for the production of a multitude of gli cluster metabolites, including the family of diketopiperazines shown in Figure 4C (1–13)
[38]. We found that compounds 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, and the gliotoxins 1 and 3 are at least 10-fold up-regulated in OErsmA, whereas the methylsulfanyl containing compounds 4, 5, and 8 are much less or not at all upregulated (Figure 4B). The methylsulfanyl groups in compounds 4, 5, and 8 likely arise from SAM-dependent methylation of free thiols. Their relatively lower abundance compared to the other compounds in OErsmA logically follows that of overexpression of gliT in OErsmA (Figure 3A), the gene encoding the oxidase responsible for disulfide formation from dithiol-containing metabolites. Overexpression of gliT would be expected to prevent the accumulation of large amounts of free thiols. We further found that production of the four sulfur atom-containing gliotoxin G (3) is dramatically increased in OErsmA whereas the three sulfur atom-containing gliotoxin E (2) is only modestly up-regulated, suggesting that the biosynthesis of different gliotoxin derivatives may be regulated independently.

Results show that neutrophils are strongly recruited to the supernatant of A. fumigatus wild type, in a magnitude on par with the recruitment towards a known chemotactic compound, fMLP at 100 nM (Figure 4). The supernatant of OErsmA, however, induces a significant decrease in neutrophil migration. The decrease is rescued in the OErsmAΔgliZ strain. These results suggest that gliotoxin, or a metabolite in the gliotoxin pathway, is the cause of the neutrophil migration defect observed in the over-expressing rsmA strain.

Detection of Cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) in Murine Infection Detection of Cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) in Murine Infection Detection of Cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) in Murine Infection Gliotoxin has previously been isolated from the murine lung environment [43], however it is unknown if gliotoxin intermediates also accumulate in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a neutropenic IA mouse assay with wild type and OErsmA strains and assayed for the presence or absence of compounds 1–13 from murine lungs. There was no significant difference in virulence between wild type versus OErsmA in the neutropenic model of IA (Figure S5). Lungs from wild type and OErsmA-infected mice were homogenized and extracted and HPLC-ESI+-SIMMS analysis showed that gliotoxin (1) and cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) (6), were present in lung tissue from both wild type and OErsmA treated mice. Both compounds were present in higher amounts (2- and 3-fold, respectively) in OErsmA lungs (Figure 5A and 5B). Compound 6 has not previously been observed in A. fumigatus-lung infection models. The absence of the remaining gliZ-dependent compounds, 2–5 and 7–13 in the wild type and OErsmA-infected lung tissue suggests that these compounds are not produced in amounts large enough for detection or that they were not detected due to decomposition, as the methylsulfanyl groups in 4, 5, and 7–11 are easily substituted by other nucleophiles, including water [38].

Lungs from wild type and OErsmA-infected mice were homogenized and extracted and HPLC-ESI+-SIMMS analysis showed that gliotoxin (1) and cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) (6), were present in lung tissue from both wild type and OErsmA treated mice. Both compounds were present in higher amounts (2- and 3-fold, respectively) in OErsmA lungs (Figure 5A and 5B). Compound 6 has not previously been observed in A. fumigatus-lung infection models. The absence of the remaining gliZ-dependent compounds, 2–5 and 7–13 in the wild type and OErsmA-infected lung tissue suggests that these compounds are not produced in amounts large enough for detection or that they were not detected due to decomposition, as the methylsulfanyl groups in 4, 5, and 7–11 are easily substituted by other nucleophiles, including water [38]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0062591.g005Figure 5Infected mouse lung extracts (IMLE) HPLC- single ion monitoring (SIM)MS ion chromatograms.HPLC-SIMMS analysis of crude mouse lung extracts corresponding to mice infected with wild type, or OErsmA.

Discussion Discussion Our interest in exploring RsmA in impacting secondary metabolism in A. fumigatus arose from studies using the model genetic system, A. nidulans. RsmA (restorer of secondary metabolism A) was identified in a mutagenesis screen of an A. nidulans ΔlaeA strain where overexpression of rsmA (OErsmA) partially rescued secondary metabolism in a ΔlaeA genetic background and greatly over produced the carcinogen sterigmatocystin in a laeA wild type background [28]. LaeA, a conserved protein in filamentous fungi, governs the production of multiple SMs that contribute to virulence in all pathogenic fungi examined to date including A. fumigatus
[6], [8], [10], [44]. Here we found that although OErsmA did not restore gliotoxin synthesis in the ΔlaeA background in A. fumigatus, rsmA overexpression did have a profound effect on gli cluster gene expression and concomitant metabolite production, mediated by GliZ, the gli gene cluster transcription factor.

In A. nidulans, RsmA binds to the promoter and activates expression of aflR, encoding the transcription factor required for sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin synthesis [29]. The A. fumigatus RsmA ortholog shares overall 58% identity to that of A. nidulans and 100% identity in the DNA binding region suggesting that both proteins bind to the same DNA sites, several of which are found in the gli gene cluster and possibly involved in the activation observed in this study. Several bZIP proteins have recently been found to regulate fungal SM clusters – both positively and negatively - including the bZIPs AtfB and ApYap1 regulating aflatoxin in A. parasiticus
[24], [25], AoYap1 regulating ochratoxin in A. ochraceus
[23], MeaB regulating bikaverin in Fusarium fujikuroi
[26] and BcAft1 regulating botrydial, botryendial and botcinin A in Botrytis cinerea
[27]. A distinguishing characteristic of RsmA, in both A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, is the extreme up-regulation of a primary SM in each species. In A. nidulans OErsmA led to 40-fold induction of sterigmatocystin, an anti-predation metabolite protecting this species from fungivory [29]. Here OErsmA increased production of a multitude of GliZ dependent metabolites 10 to near 100 fold over wild type. Gliotoxin is a potent anti-fungal thought to help establish a niche for A. fumigatus in natural settings [45]; it may be that RsmA represents a bZIP pathway hardwired for defensive SM production in these species [29].

One difference between OErsmA in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus was the role of this protein in the stress response of the two species. bZIP factors are associated with the stress response in fungi, such as NapA in A. nidulans
[41] and Afyap1 in A. fumigatus
[42], [46]. Despite the lack of a stress response in the A. nidulans rsmA mutants [40], the A. fumigatus strains containing an OErsmA allele showed increased resistance to menadione, an indicator of resistance to reactive oxidative species (ROS), than the control strains. This was irrespective of presence of gliZ or laeA (Figure 2), the latter result in contrast to the non-affect of OErsmA on secondary metabolism in the ΔlaeA background. These observations suggest that RsmA directly or indirectly activates genes that are involved in oxidative stress response of A. fumigatus. In the animal host, the fungus faces a variety of toxic environmental challenges, which are aimed at eliminating the fungus. For example, neutrophils produce high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative burst. However, pathogenic fungi possess oxidative-stress response genes that help to evade the otherwise lethal elevation of ROS. However, because the OErsmA strain showed no difference compared to the WT in the murine model, this factor of enhanced resistance to ROS likely has small impact on virulence of OErsmA. This is reminiscent of the A. fumigatus Afyap1 mutant which while Afyap1 is important for resistance to ROS, the deletant strain did not exhibit a pathogenicity defect [42]. Possibly these two proteins play a redundant role in A. fumigatus ROS resistance.

The inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis with OErsmA extracts supports earlier studies where gliotoxin or A. fumigatus extracts were found to diminish PMN chemotaxis [30], [47]. Currently the mechanism of this impact of chemotaxis is not known and could simply be attributable to the apoptotic properties of gliotoxin and, perhaps, other gli cluster metabolites. The great increase in gli cluster metabolites as observed in culture grown OErsmA was tempered in the animal model (ca. 10 fold less increase in murine lung). This may explain differences in the results from the in vivo (no difference in pathogenicity in the murine model) and in vitro (inhibition of chemotaxis) results of the OErsmA strain in this study.

In terms of gli cluster regulation, the greatly enhanced production of numerous gli cluster metabolites in OErsmA was striking and supported and extended our earlier studies showing that gliotoxin is not the only metabolite produced by the gli gene cluster [38]. Here we show that in addition to gliotoxin, cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) (6) accumulates in lungs of IA mice. Two pertinent observations from this study include further support for GliT as an oxidase responsible for disulfide formation from dithiol-containing metabolites. Notably, the lesser accumulation of the methylsulfanyl containing compounds (4, 5, and 8) would be expected in the OErsmA as gliT expression was particularly upregulated in this strain. GliT is also responsible for A. fumigatus self-resistance to gliotoxin, and likely other gli metabolites [48], [49] and, along with bis(dethio)bis(methylthio)gliotoxin (4)
[22], has been proposed as an antigen for diagnosis of IA [50]. Our work here reveals an additional metabolite, cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) (6), that could serve as a marker for IA diagnosis. This compound, along with gliotoxin, is produced in high amounts by the fungus both in vivo and in vitro and, at least in vitro, is chemically more stable than gliotoxin or bis(dethio)bis(methylthio)gliotoxin (4).
