["In the world of microorganisms, the biosynthesis of natural products in secondary metabolism and the self-resistance of the host always occur together and complement each other. Identifying resistance genes from biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) helps us understand the self-defense mechanism and predict the biological activity of natural products synthesized by microorganisms. However, a comprehensive database of resistance genes is still lacking, which hinders natural product annotation studies in large-scale genome mining. In this study, we compiled a resistance gene database (RGDB) by scanning the four available databases: CARD, MIBiG, NCBIAMR, and UniProt. Every resistance gene in the database was annotated with resistance mechanisms and possibly involved chemical compounds, using manual annotation and transformation from the resource databases. The RGDB was applied to analyze resistance genes in 7432 BGCs in 1390 genomes from a marine microbiome project. Our calculation showed that the RGDB successfully identified resistance genes for more than half of the BGCs, suggesting that the database helps prioritize BGCs that produce biologically active natural products.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Natural products are secondary metabolites produced by organisms such as microbes and plants. They are usually small molecules not essential for their primary metabolism but often play important roles in ecological interactions and defense against predators or competitors. For example, many bacteria produce secondary metabolites with antibiotic properties that help them to compete for resources in their environment [1]. Almost a hundred years ago, the active-guide discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming\u2019s serendipitous isolation of a new natural product called penicillin, produced by Staphylococcus colonies, occurred, which was proved to control bacterial growth by inhibiting cell division [2,3]. The tremendous clinical success of penicillin fueled the search for new chemicals from microorganisms, plants, and other natural resources over the past century, which led to the discovery of a large number of biologically active natural products, including \u03b2-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide, lipopeptide, and other essential antibiotic skeletons and agrochemicals [4,5,6]. In the activity-guided approach to natural product discovery, highly efficient methods for activity screening, enrichment, and chemical isolation have been developed over the years to isolate pure bioactive compounds. Still, their discovery rate lags far behind the demand [7,8,9].", "Natural products are secondary metabolites produced by organisms such as microbes and plants.

The results of high-throughput sequencing have created a wealth of biological genomic data. For example, data analysis has shown that genes involved in natural product biosynthesis are closely aligned in the genome, forming so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [11,13,14]. In addition to genes encoding enzymes for the synthesis and modification of product backbone, metabolite transporters, and genes involved in the regulation of BGC expression, BGCs typically carry one or more genes, called self-resistance genes, encoding proteins that confer resistance to the natural product [15,16]. The basic logic behind self-resistance genes is that an organism must develop a mechanism to defend itself against possible damage caused by its metabolites, which, due to their biological activity, act on other organisms around it, thus ensuring that the organism gains an advantage over the competition [17]. This remarkable feature of BGCs has been used to develop the so-called Targeted Genome Mining (TDGM) methods, which first identify self-resistance genes and associated BGCs in the genome, and then predict the mode of action of natural products based on the mechanism of action of the resistance genes [16,18].", "The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology profoundly changed the traditional method of natural product discovery to the genome mining approaches [10,11,12].

Indeed, the lack of novel antibiotics with new modes of action makes finding new compounds to combat drug-resistant pathogens a critical task in the current drug development process [21]. On the other hand, long before humans began the mass production of antibiotics to prevent and treat infectious diseases, bacterial species had evolved self-resistant genes to tolerate antibiotics, thus allowing them to survive in crowded and harmful environments. Drug-resistant genes result from sanitation pollution from the massive improper use of antibiotics and provide a direction for discovering new antibiotics. Therefore, detecting resistance genes from the genome or metagenome becomes a critical step in identifying BGCs of bioactive products. This requires first compiling a knowledge database of all known antibiotic resistance genes [22], including sequence, structure, function, site of action, antibiotic compounds, and resistance mechanisms, and then using this database to mine genomes for possible resistance genes. So far, there are a variety of resistance gene databases available. One example of a resistance gene database is the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) [23], which provides a centralized resource for researchers to access and analyze data on antimicrobial resistance genes. The CARD database includes over 2000 resistance genes, associated mutations, mobile genetic elements, and other relevant data. This database has been used to identify new resistance mechanisms and to track the spread of resistant organisms across different environments.

These identified resistance genes were classified according to their resistance mechanisms, the most common being efflux pumps, with a total of 4183. Most efflux pumps are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. Some efflux pumps have narrow substrate specificity, such as tetracycline efflux, while others are relatively broad. As the most typical mechanisms of product inactivation, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, and glyoxylate/bleomycin resistance proteins repeatedly appear in these MarRef BGCs. Vancomycin resistance genes were found to be the most frequently occurring genes for target-related mechanisms. It is worth mentioning that the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase used for fatty acid biosynthesis is present in many BGCs.

They are among the highest percentage of proteins encoded by resistance genes. In natural product modification, resistance genes encode enzymes able to add chemical entities (e.g., phosphates or acetates) to the small molecule structure of the natural product, causing structural changes that affect the binding to the targets, thus producing self-resistance to the products [47,48]. Natural products often contain chemical bonds such as amide and ester bonds that are susceptible to breakdown and whose integrity is critical for biological activity. Some enzymes in organisms can target the cleavage of such bonds, providing natural product degradation, a means of self-resistance for the organism [49]. As a typical example, bacteria can develop resistance to the antibiotic penicillin by producing an enzyme called beta-lactamase, which breaks down the penicillin molecule and renders it ineffective [50]. In this work, product modification and product degradation are regarded as types of product inactivation. Target protection employs a resistance protein that physically interacts with an antibiotic target to rescue it from the antibiotic-mediated inhibition [51]. Target alteration involves mutating and modifying the target proteins of action of the natural-product small molecule, thereby interfering with the binding of the small molecule to the target and thereby conferring resistance [52]. Examples include point mutations, deletions, and insertions in RNA polymerase [53] and those in DNA gyrase mutations [54], resulting in resistance to rifamycins and quinolones, respectively.

Conclusions", "This study presented a comprehensive resistance gene database (RGDB) by collecting data from four major databases: CARD, MIBIG, NCBIAMR, and UniProt. The database was designed for the analysis of the self-resistance genes in BGCs in target-driven genome mining. Both possible resistance mechanisms and compounds involved in the bioactivities of the resistance gene in the database were annotated. Scripts were provided for scanning the database to identify resistance genes in query BGCS and the relevant compounds involving the resistance mechanisms. We applied RGDB-based annotation to analyze resistance genes in 7432 BGCs in 1390 genomes in the MarRef database and found 7079 resistance genes in 3878 BGCs, of which, 59% are efflux pumps. Excluding these pumps, 3% of these resistance-gene carrier BGCs were found to have more than one type of resistance gene and mechanism. Notably, most of the resistance genes in the database were prepared using terrestrial microorganisms. However, it could still identify resistance gene candidates for more than half of all the marine microbial BGCs studied. All five types of resistance mechanisms were found in marine microorganisms, and the associated compound of the resistance genes provides the starting point for inferring the possible products of BGCs. We also note that nearly half of the tested marine BGCs have no resistance genes identified by the current RGDB. This suggests that unique self-protection mechanisms may exist in these marine microorganism BGCs that need to be discovered in future studies using new resources.", "This study presented a comprehensive resistance gene database (RGDB) by collecting data from four major databases: CARD, MIBIG, NCBIAMR, and UniProt.

Regarding the fact that organisms follow the environment to evolve new resistance genes, they may not be detected, but a preliminary judgment can be made based on the similarity of gene sequences. In the process of co-evolution of resistance genes with the host, the original ones may be invalid, and the host will rapidly change its genome composition through mutation or recombination to ensure its adaptation to the current environment, so the resistance genes detected according to this database may not be the current effective resistance genes. Therefore, the database of resistance genes should be able to keep up with the real-time research information and make timely supplemental adjustments to the annotation information to ensure the usability of the database annotation results.
