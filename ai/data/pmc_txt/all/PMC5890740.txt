Abstract Objectives Objectives To characterize NAI-107 and related lantibiotics for their in vitro activity against Gram-negative pathogens, alone or in combination with polymyxin, and against non-dividing cells or biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. NAI-107 was also evaluated for its propensity to select or induce self-resistance in Gram-positive bacteria. To characterize NAI-107 and related lantibiotics for their in vitro activity against Gram-negative pathogens, alone or in combination with polymyxin, and against non-dividing cells or biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. NAI-107 was also evaluated for its propensity to select or induce self-resistance in Gram-positive bacteria. Methods Methods We used MIC determinations and chequerboard experiments to establish the antibacterial activity of the examined compounds against target microorganisms. Time–kill assays were used to evaluate killing of exponential and stationary-phase cells. The effects on biofilms (growth inhibition and biofilm eradication) were evaluated using biofilm-coated pegs. The frequency of spontaneous resistant mutants was evaluated by either direct plating or by continuous sub-culturing at 0.5 × MIC levels, followed by population analysis profiles.

Results Results The results showed that NAI-107 and its brominated variant are highly active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and some other fastidious Gram-negative pathogens. Furthermore, all compounds strongly synergized with polymyxin against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and showed bactericidal activity. Surprisingly, NAI-107 alone was bactericidal against non-dividing A. baumannii cells. Against S. aureus, NAI-107 and related lantibiotics showed strong bactericidal activity against dividing and non-dividing cells. Activity was also observed against S. aureus biofilms. As expected for a lipid II binder, no significant resistance to NAI-107 was observed by direct plating or serial passages.

Introduction Introduction The increasing incidence of MDR pathogens has led to the dire prediction that humanity will soon enter the post-antibiotic era, when today's routine surgical procedures will become high-risk endeavours.1,2 This worrisome scenario is exacerbated by the paucity of new antibiotics reaching the market, and in particular of new chemical classes suitable for systemic administration and not affected by prevailing resistance mechanisms. Indeed, since the beginning of the century most antibacterial drugs introduced into human use or under advanced clinical development represent improved analogues of marketed compounds.3 The increasing incidence of MDR pathogens has led to the dire prediction that humanity will soon enter the post-antibiotic era, when today's routine surgical procedures will become high-risk endeavours.1,2 This worrisome scenario is exacerbated by the paucity of new antibiotics reaching the market, and in particular of new chemical classes suitable for systemic administration and not affected by prevailing resistance mechanisms. Indeed, since the beginning of the century most antibacterial drugs introduced into human use or under advanced clinical development represent improved analogues of marketed compounds.3 Of particular concern are infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens, which include Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.4 In particular, infections by MRSA are associated with community and hospital infections, and up to 80% of all MRSA infections in the USA have been ascribed to the MRSA clone USA300, which is also highly resistant to other antibiotics.5 Given the limited options available to treat ESKAPE pathogens, it is important to develop new antibiotics that are not affected by prevailing resistance mechanisms, while at the same time devising strategies that minimize the spread of antibiotic resistance.

One class of antibiotics that has been receiving increasing attention is represented by the lantibiotics. These compounds, which belong to the growing family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, are characterized by the presence of (methyl)-lanthionine bridges that confer rigidity and stability on the peptide.6 The prototype lantibiotic is nisin, which has been used for decades as a food preservative. One class of antibiotics that has been receiving increasing attention is represented by the lantibiotics. These compounds, which belong to the growing family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, are characterized by the presence of (methyl)-lanthionine bridges that confer rigidity and stability on the peptide.6 The prototype lantibiotic is nisin, which has been used for decades as a food preservative. One of the most potent lantibiotics is NAI-107 (Figure 1), a chlorine-containing compound active against MDR Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), VRE and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.7,8 Lantibiotics with similar antibacterial properties have been obtained after incorporation of Br into NAI-107, leading to NAI-108,9 or after semi-synthetic conversion, leading to NAI-857DA and related compounds.10 NAI-857DA and NAI-107/108 share a similar peptide scaffold and identical topology of thioether rings, with the first two N-terminal rings shared with nisin (Figure 1). A rapid bactericidal activity9–11 and a prolonged half-life in plasma12 are consistent with the efficacy of NAI-107 in different experimental models of infection in rodents13 and insects.14 The ratio between the area under the concentration–time curve and the MIC has been proposed as the pharmacodynamic index predictive of efficacy in the mouse.12 One of the most potent lantibiotics is NAI-107 (Figure 1), a chlorine-containing compound active against MDR Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), VRE and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.7,8 Lantibiotics with similar antibacterial properties have been obtained after incorporation of Br into NAI-107, leading to NAI-108,9 or after semi-synthetic conversion, leading to NAI-857DA and related compounds.10 NAI-857DA and NAI-107/108 share a similar peptide scaffold and identical topology of thioether rings, with the first two N-terminal rings shared with nisin (Figure 1).

Results Results Activity against fastidious Gram-negative pathogens Activity against fastidious Gram-negative pathogens Activity against fastidious Gram-negative pathogens Most antibiotics targeting lipid II are large molecules that cannot cross the outer membrane barrier present in Gram-negative bacteria.15 However, in contrast to most clinically used drugs targeting Gram-positive pathogens, NAI-107 extends its antibacterial spectrum to some fastidious Gram-negative bacteria (Table 1), including Neisseria meningitidis (MIC range 0.06–1 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC range 0.25–1 mg/L) and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC range 8–16 mg/L). Although only a few strains were tested in comparison, NAI-107 was considerably more active than nisin (Table 1), suggesting that the activity against these bacterial species is not a general property of lantibiotics. No activity was seen against individual strains of Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (data not shown).

Against 18 tested strains, the observed MICs ranged from 0.015 to 2 mg/L (Table 2), with no apparent correlation to a strain's susceptibility to penicillin. Similar results were observed with NAI-108, which, as previously observed with Gram-positive pathogens,9 was usually twice as active as NAI-107 (Table 2). In contrast, NAI-857DA was substantially less active than the other two lantibiotics (Table 2).

NAI-107 was essentially inactive against three strains each of the Gram-negative pathogens Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, with no measurable MICs at the highest concentration tested (Table 3). Some activity could, however, be observed against A. baumannii, with one strain showing an MIC of 32 mg/L (Table 4).

Therefore, the activity of NAI-107 against Gram-negative species should be achievable via permeabilization of the outer membranes.

Synergism with polymyxin Synergism with polymyxin Synergism with polymyxin Antibiotics (e.g. vancomycin, daptomycin) that are not effective against Gram-negative bacteria can become active if the permeability barrier provided by the outer membrane is weakened by sub-inhibitory concentrations of polymyxin or colistin.21–24 These drugs have become the last options to treat infections by MDR Gram-negative pathogens, but they also have significant toxicity. If polymyxin or colistin concentrations could be substantially reduced in effective combinations with NAI-107, the toxic effect would be less severe.

If polymyxin or colistin concentrations could be substantially reduced in effective combinations with NAI-107, the toxic effect would be less severe. We thus tested combinations of NAI-107 and polymyxin against three independent isolates each of the target pathogens A. baumannii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Against A. baumannii, the fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) of polymyxin and NAI-107 were 0.03–0.125 and 0.016–0.06, respectively, with FIC indexes ranging from 0.09 to 0.14 (Table 3). Similarly, polymyxin and NAI-107 formed synergistic combinations against all the tested strains of the other examined species: the lowest FICs of polymyxin against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were 0.03–0.06, 0.06–0.25 and 0.125–0.25, respectively, with growth inhibition requiring NAI-107 concentrations of 2–8, 2–16 and 4–32 mg/L, respectively (Table 3). Since NAI-107 was inactive against these strains, FIC indexes were essentially determined by the polymyxin FIC and ranged from 0.28 (for K. pneumoniae L3392) to 0.04 (for E. coli L47). We thus tested combinations of NAI-107 and polymyxin against three independent isolates each of the target pathogens A. baumannii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Against A. baumannii, the fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) of polymyxin and NAI-107 were 0.03–0.125 and 0.016–0.06, respectively, with FIC indexes ranging from 0.09 to 0.14 (Table 3). Similarly, polymyxin and NAI-107 formed synergistic combinations against all the tested strains of the other examined species: the lowest FICs of polymyxin against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were 0.03–0.06, 0.06–0.25 and 0.125–0.25, respectively, with growth inhibition requiring NAI-107 concentrations of 2–8, 2–16 and 4–32 mg/L, respectively (Table 3). Since NAI-107 was inactive against these strains, FIC indexes were essentially determined by the polymyxin FIC and ranged from 0.28 (for K. pneumoniae L3392) to 0.04 (for E. coli L47).

Since NAI-107 was inactive against these strains, FIC indexes were essentially determined by the polymyxin FIC and ranged from 0.28 (for K. pneumoniae L3392) to 0.04 (for E. coli L47). We also evaluated the lowest polymyxin concentration required to inhibit the growth of the analysed strains in the presence of 2 mg/L NAI-107, a concentration that can be readily maintained after systemic administration in rodents.12,13 With the exception of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, for which the polymyxin concentration was 0.125 mg/L (i.e. 0.5 × MIC), in all other cases ≤0.06 mg/L polymyxin was sufficient to inhibit growth in the presence of 2 mg/L NAI-107 (Table 3). We also evaluated the lowest polymyxin concentration required to inhibit the growth of the analysed strains in the presence of 2 mg/L NAI-107, a concentration that can be readily maintained after systemic administration in rodents.12,13 With the exception of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, for which the polymyxin concentration was 0.125 mg/L (i.e. 0.5 × MIC), in all other cases ≤0.06 mg/L polymyxin was sufficient to inhibit growth in the presence of 2 mg/L NAI-107 (Table 3).

Polymyxin is known to rapidly kill susceptible Gram-negative bacteria,25 as does NAI-107 for Gram-positives.11 We thus tested different growth-inhibiting combinations of polymyxin and NAI-107 for their ability to reduce the viable bacterial counts in dynamic chequerboards. We did observe a decrease in viable counts in combinations containing NAI-107 and sub-inhibitory concentrations of polymyxin but not in cultures treated with polymyxin alone. At 0.031 mg/L polymyxin (i.e. 0.25 × MIC), the viable count for A. baumannii L3030 was undistinguishable from that of the untreated control (Figure 2a). However, addition of as little as ≤0.5 mg/L NAI-107 was sufficient to decrease viable counts by at least four orders of magnitude (i.e. below the detection limit of 50 cfu/mL) for up to 20 h (Figure 2a and Table S1). Similarly, in the presence of 0.016 mg/L polymyxin, NAI-107 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in viable counts, with 2 mg/L NAI-107 being sufficient to decrease the viable counts below the detection limit, whereas 1 mg/L NAI-107, despite an initial decrease in viable counts, was unable to prevent full growth at 20 h (Figure 2a). In bactericidal combinations viable counts decreased in a time-dependent manner, with 1 h of incubation sufficient to decrease cfu/mL by 2.5–3.5 log, whereas a 3 h incubation was required to reduce cfu/mL below the detection limit (Figure 2a).

The limit of detection was 50 cfu/mL. Next, we used A. baumannii L3030 to test the effects of the lantibiotics NAI-108 and NAI-857DA, and of vancomycin. As seen for NAI-107, NAI-108 showed time- and concentration-dependent killing, with 2 and ≤0.5 mg/L NAI-108 being sufficient to decrease viable counts below the detection limit in the presence of 0.016 and 0.031 mg/L polymyxin, respectively (Figure 2b). In contrast, at least 2 mg/L NAI-857DA (Figure 2c) or 2 mg/L vancomycin (Figure 2d) was necessary for reducing viable counts of A. baumannii L3030 below the detection limit in the presence of 0.031 mg/L polymyxin. Lowering the concentration of polymyxin to 0.016 mg/L required 4 and 64 mg/L NAI-857DA (Figure 2c) and of vancomycin (Table 5), respectively, for observing a complete bactericidal effect for the entire duration of the experiment. Only when polymyxin concentrations were raised to 0.062 mg/L (i.e. 0.5 × MIC) did we observe a bactericidal effect at vancomycin concentrations of ≤0.5 mg/L (Figure 2d). It should be noted that 0.062 mg/L polymyxin alone did have a transient effect on cell viability, with a small decrease in viable cells up to 3 h, followed by full growth by 20 h (Figure 2d). Overall, these results are consistent with the general trend observed with the lantibiotics shown in Figure 1, with the hydrophobic lantibiotics NAI-107 and NAI-108 showing comparable activities, whereas the hydrophilic NAI-857DA was slightly less active than the other two compounds.8 Vancomycin was less potent than NAI-107 in synergistic combinations with polymyxin. Table 5 describes a summary of the results observed with growth and viable counts in chequerboard experiments. Usually, in the presence of a given polymyxin FIC, the lowest concentration of antibiotic able to reduce viable counts below the detection limit at 3 h coincided with the concentration that was able to prevent growth (Table 5).

We next expanded the evaluation of NAI-107 using selected strains from Table 3. As seen with A. baumannii L3030, within 1–3 h NAI-107 was able to significantly reduce viable counts (below or close to the detection limit) of A. baumannii L373 (Figure 2e), E. coli ATCC 25922 (Figure 2f), E. coli L47 (data not shown), K. pneumoniae ND484 (Figure 2g) and P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 (Figure 2h), most of the time at the same concentrations as those sufficient to cause growth inhibition (Table S2). With P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, 0.5 × MIC polymyxin caused a transient decrease in viable counts, followed by regrowth. The addition of ≥0.125 mg/L NAI-107 prevented regrowth (Figure 2h).

Activity against S. aureus biofilms Activity against S. aureus biofilms Activity against S. aureus biofilms NAI-107 and related lantibiotics are active against most Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA and GISA.7,9,10 In order to evaluate activity against biofilms, four S. aureus strains were selected for their ability to form biofilms (Table S1). Against these strains, NAI-107, NAI-108 and NAI-857DA were able to inhibit growth of planktonic cells detaching from the biofilms, with minimal biofilm-inhibiting concentrations (MBICs) comparable to MICs (Table 6). The minimal biofilm-eradicating concentration (MBEC) values were usually 16–32 mg/L, with the exception of NAI-857DA, which showed an MBEC of 2 mg/L against a single strain. Rifampicin and amoxicillin, used as positive and negative controls, respectively, behaved as expected (Table 6).

Against Mu50, vancomycin showed an effect pronouncedly different from that seen against USA300 (Figure 3b).

In contrast, the response of USA300 and Mu50 to the lantibiotics was similar: at 3 × or 5 × MIC, NAI-107, NAI-108 and NAI-857DA reduced viable counts of Mu50 (Figure 3d, f and h). Against Mu50, vancomycin showed an effect pronouncedly different from that seen against USA300 (Figure 3b).

We next examined the activity of NAI-107, NAI-108 and NAI-857DA against non-dividing cells resuspended in PBS at ∼5 × 105 cfu/mL. In these experiments, we also included the GISA strain Mu3.28 NAI-107, NAI-108 and NAI-857DA were tested at 3 ×, 5 × and 10 × MIC, whereas vancomycin, which was expected to have little activity, was used as a control at 10 × MIC only. Against USA300, NAI-107 showed time- and concentration-dependent killing of non-dividing cells, with cfu/mL decreased by 99% within 5 h at 5 × MIC and within 1 h at 10 × MIC (Figure 4a). Against Mu50 (Figure 4b) and Mu3 (Figure 4c), NAI-107 treatment resulted in ≥99% reduction of viable cells within 1–5 h, with the effect lasting the remainder of the experiment.

When exposed to NAI-108, viable cells of USA300 (Figure 4d) and Mu50 (Figure 4e) dropped below the detection limit within 1 h at all concentrations tested. Only with Mu3 did we observe concentration-dependent killing, with 10 × MIC NAI-108 required to reduce viable counts below 0.1% of the starting titre (Figure 4f). When exposed to NAI-857DA, USA300 cells were killed within 3 h at all tested concentrations (Figure 4g), Mu50 cells were resistant to killing (Figure 4h) and strain Mu3 appeared to have an intermediate behaviour, with time-dependent and concentration-independent killing (Figure 4i). When exposed to NAI-108, viable cells of USA300 (Figure 4d) and Mu50 (Figure 4e) dropped below the detection limit within 1 h at all concentrations tested. Only with Mu3 did we observe concentration-dependent killing, with 10 × MIC NAI-108 required to reduce viable counts below 0.1% of the starting titre (Figure 4f).

Altogether, the above results indicate that dividing and non-dividing cells of the MRSA strain USA300 are rapidly killed by NAI-107 and by NAI-108 at equivalent multiples of the MIC, whereas this strain is able to eventually escape killing by NAI-857DA in growth medium but not in PBS. Under non-dividing conditions, the GISA strains Mu3 and Mu50 are rapidly killed by NAI-107 and by NAI-108, but only partially and slowly by NAI-857DA.

NAI-107 effectively kills non-dividing A. baumannii cells NAI-107 effectively kills non-dividing A. baumannii cells NAI-107 effectively kills non-dividing A. baumannii cells Inspired by the above results, we exposed non-dividing cells of A. baumannii L3030 in PBS to combinations of NAI-107 and polymyxin. Under these conditions, the untreated strain was stable (just a few duplications observed during the incubation period) and killed by ≥0.5 mg/L polymyxin (Figure 5). Notwithstanding an MIC of 128 mg/L, NAI-107 alone was able to kill the strain within 3 h at ≥16 mg/L, with no detectable cells observed after 20 h. A similar killing effect by 16 mg/L NAI-107 was observed against non-dividing cells of A. baumannii L2859 (data not shown). It should be noted that the activities against dividing and non-dividing cells were measured under similar conditions, with the main difference represented by the presence of growth medium versus PBS. Furthermore, NAI-107 in PBS led to a decrease in cfu/mL after 3 h (Figure 5), at the same time that an increase in viable counts was observed in growth medium (Figure 2a). None of the other Gram-negatives tested (E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae L3392 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) was killed by NAI-107 under non-dividing conditions (data not shown).

Using 12 strains (1 MSSA, 2 MRSA, 3 GISA, 3 E. faecalis VanA and 3 E. faecium VanA), 20 serial subcultures in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations yielded only modest increases in the NAI-107 MIC, which appeared to stabilize at 2- or 4-fold the initial value, with isolated spikes at 8-fold (Figure 6).

Discussion Discussion Gram-negative bacteria can be sensitized to different antibiotics by sub-inhibitory concentrations of polymyxin or colistin.30 We could find only a few reports addressing the ability of polymyxin-based combinations to kill the target pathogens: these studies were performed at 1 mg/L polymyxin and at a single, high concentration (20 mg/L) of vancomycin,21 teicoplanin31 or telavancin.22 In this study, we show that, in addition its strong synergism, essentially the same combinations of NAI-107 and polymyxin that inhibit growth also reduce viable counts below the detection limit of the Gram-negative pathogens.

Few studies have investigated antibacterial activity against non-dividing S. aureus cells. Mascio et al.27 demonstrated that daptomycin kills MRSA in stationary phase, with a mechanism that does not require energy or protein synthesis. In their elegant studies, Müller et al.32 demonstrated that daptomycin binds to high-fluidity regions in the membrane, thus preventing the function of proteins that specifically localize to those regions. Combining the two observations, we surmise that high-fluidity regions are present in non-dividing cells. Unlike vancomycin, oritavancin kills non-dividing S. aureus cells, and septum staining of stationary phase cells is affected by oritavancin and not by vancomycin.26 Few studies have investigated antibacterial activity against non-dividing S. aureus cells.

In whole cells, NAI-107 does not form nisin-like pores in the bacterial membrane, but binding of NAI-107 to lipid II is followed by a slow membrane depolarization.11 Current evidence indicates that NAI-107, like nisin, binds to the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid II,11 a site distinct from the binding site of glycopeptides. Indeed, vancomycin does not kill non-dividing S. aureus,26 as confirmed here, consistent with the fact that the d-Ala-d-Ala moiety (i.e. vancomycin’s target) is not present in mature peptidoglycan.33 NAI-107 forms 1:1 or 2:1 complexes with bactoprenol–pyrophosphate-coupled precursors of the bacterial cell wall, such as lipid II.

In the case of NAI-107, we believe this interaction occurs after an initial docking on lipid II or other bactoprenol–pyrophosphate-based intermediates. Indeed, it has been recently reported that peptidoglycan recycling is important for survival in the stationary phase of Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus.34 Although not demonstrated by these authors, such recycling might involve pyrophosphate-based carriers similar to lipid II, and would explain NAI-107's activity against non-dividing cells. A similar explanation might apply also to the reported killing of non-dividing cells by oritavancin.26 Altogether, the observed killing by NAI-107 of MRSA and GISA cells under non-dividing conditions is consistent with the hypothesis that killing requires interaction with the membrane.

This phenomenon might be a general feature of this species, as it was not observed with E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the permeability of the A. baumannii outer membrane might change as the cells go from a non-dividing to a dividing state, allowing NAI-107 to reach its target under the former conditions. Among the four pathogenic species in Table 3, A. baumannii is the only species for which NAI-107 showed occasionally a measured MIC. In this respect, it has been reported that A. baumannii is generally more permeable to large antibiotics such as novobiocin and erythromycin, possibly connected with the ability of Acinetobacter spp. to use long-chain fatty acids as growth substrates.35 We were surprised to observe that NAI-107 can also kill non-dividing cells of two A. baumannii strains at sub-MIC values.

In addition, the activity of NAI-107 against N. gonorrhoeae, its ability to kill non-dividing A. baumannii and its strong synergism with polymyxin might provide additional therapeutic options for treating infections by A. baumannii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. From the limited comparisons reported here, it appears that NAI-108 shares the same properties as NAI-107.
