To explore the signal transmission mechanism of the arbuscular mycorrhizal network against root rot of Salvia miltiorrhiza. In this experiment, the arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal network was established among Salvia miltiorrhiza plants, and a two plant three-compartment culture model was established. The root of the donor Salvia miltiorrhiza was inoculated with the pathogenic fungi Fusarium solani. The changes of hormone signals such as jasmonic acid and salicylic acid and the expression of related defense genes in the recipient Salvia miltiorrhiza plants in different periods were measured, to study the underground disease resistance signal transmission mechanism among medicinal plants. Salvia miltiorrhiza can transmit the signal of resistance to root rot through the jasmonic acid pathway; When plants suffer from disease stress, the content of JA increases significantly, and the increase of JA content will inhibit the content of SA in plants; The gene expression of PR-10 gene in the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza with arbuscular mycorrhizal network infected by pathogenic fungi was 17.56 times higher than that inoculated only with pathogenic fungi; Changes in hormone content will also cause changes in the expression of related defense genes, such as SnRK2 is inhibited by ABA in the signal transduction pathway, while JA and ABA show antagonistic changes after inoculation of pathogenic fungi in Salvia miltiorrhiza, so JA may positively regulate the expression of SnRK2 gene. Plants can transmit signals through AM hyphal network after being stressed by the pathogen Fusarium solani. In the arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal network, JA has important significance for the signal transmission of resistance to root rot and disease resistance of Salvia miltiorrhiza, which can make Salvia miltiorrhiza ready for stress resistance and improve the stress resistance of Salvia miltiorrhiza. This experiment is of great significance to further analyze the signal transmission mechanism of the arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal network. Subject terms Introduction Introduction Salvia miltiorrhiza bge. (Can be abbreviated as S. milliorrhiza) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine in China. Its rhizome is used as medicine and has medicinal values such as activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis1, improving heart function2,3, and delaying aging4. With the research on the pharmacological effects of S. miltiorrhiza, the market demand for S. miltiorrhiza is increasing, the planting regulations of S. miltiorrhiza are expanding, and the phenomenon of root diseases and pests caused by continuous cropping is becoming more prominent. Relevant studies showed that with the gradual rise of the prevalence of root rot of S. miltiorrhiza, the yield, and quality of S. miltiorrhiza showed a significant downward trend5,6. Therefore, the soil-borne diseases mainly caused by the root rot of S. miltiorrhiza have seriously endangered and restricted the further development and utilization of S. miltiorrhiza resources.

Therefore, the soil-borne diseases mainly caused by the root rot of S. miltiorrhiza have seriously endangered and restricted the further development and utilization of S. miltiorrhiza resources. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi are a kind of soil fungi that widely exist in nature and coexist with plants7. Studies have shown that inoculation of AM fungi on plants significantly improves the disease resistance of host plants8, and has a certain inhibitory effect after the occurrence of soil-borne diseases on plants9. Plants can combine with AM fungi to form mutualistic symbionts10. The extraradicular hyphae of AM fungi can infect the adjacent roots of S. miltiorrhiza and carry out hyphal fusion. The adjacent roots of S. miltiorrhiza are connected by extraradicular hyphae, thus forming arbuscular mycorrhizal networks (AMNS)11.

The adjacent roots of S. miltiorrhiza are connected by extraradicular hyphae, thus forming arbuscular mycorrhizal networks (AMNS)11. Plants will face various survival problems in the growth and development stage, such as abiotic stresses, cold, and drought and biological stresses such as microorganisms, diseases, and pests, which affect the growth and reproduction of plants. Plants have evolved a series of signal transmission and defense mechanisms in response to different stresses. Studies have shown that salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) play important regulatory roles in plant biological stress responses. For example, when plants are fed by insects, a large amount of jasmonic acid (JA) will rapidly accumulate in the plant body, forming a conjugate JA ILE with isoleucine. JA IIE active molecules act on the JA pathway, promoting the receptor to combine with proteins to form a complex, and promoting the expression of downstream insect resistance-related genes to change in response to insect feeding and reduce damage to plants12. SA usually participates in defense responses against pathogenic fungi, including PTI (PAMP-triggered immunity) pathway and ETI (effector triggered immunity) pathway13,14. At the same time, SA is an essential signal molecule for SAR (systemic acquired resistance). Plants can respond to SA signals and rapidly initiate immune defense after being stimulated by pathogenic fungi15,16. Abscisic acid (ABA) can affect the transcriptional and post transcriptional modification of downstream regulators in the ABA signaling pathway, control plant responses to biological stress, and enhance plant resistance17,18. This shows that hormones play an important role in plant signal transmission, but the signal transmission mechanism of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under soil-borne disease stress is less studied at present.

This shows that hormones play an important role in plant signal transmission, but the signal transmission mechanism of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under soil-borne disease stress is less studied at present. When plants are under stress, pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) in plants will be produced and accumulated. PR proteins form an important part of the plant defense system. Plant hormones and disease resistance signals have a certain effect on the expression of PR genes. In different plants, PR genes are induced by different hormones. For example, studies have shown that when exogenous hormone MeJA is applied to bamboo root ginger, the activity of PR protein in bamboo root ginger seedlings inoculated with pathogenic fungi Ralstonia solanacearum is rapidly enhanced, which improves the disease resistance of bamboo root ginger19; when cassava was infected by whiteflies, various PR genes in the body showed different changes in response to whiteflies infection, and these PR genes were largely regulated by SA and JA20. After the infection of potato late blight and melon downy mildew on potato and melon, exogenous application of JA and SA can induce potato and melon to produce PR protein and other proteins, which is helpful for plants to improve disease resistance21. SnRK2 is only a protein kinase in plants. When ABA binds to the receptor protein to form a complex, SnRK2 protein kinase is activated and participates in the process of plant stress resistance22. Therefore, the study of the SnRK2 gene is of great significance for the study of ABA signal transduction in mycorrhizal symbiotic plants. In this experiment, plant endogenous hormones JA, SA, and ABA were used as detection hormones. The expression levels of the disease-related gene PR-10 and the SnRK2 gene in the differentially expressed genes annotated in the transcriptome data were studied under different conditions of inoculation with AM fungi and pathogenic fungi.

However, due to the presence of waterproof barriers between B-ST and B-G2, will hinder the transmission of Fusarium solani between B-ST and B-G2. Therefore, a mycelial network cannot be formed between B-ST and B-G2. In group D, although Fusarium solani can be transmitted from D-G1 to D-G2 through the root of S. miltiorrhiza, and the screen between D-G2 and D-ST can carry out signal transmission, due to the absence of AMF fungi in the soil, a mycelium network cannot be formed between D-G and D-ST.

As can be seen in Fig. 4, B-ST is symbiotic due to the application of AM fungi. Without receiving external stimuli, the contents of JA, SA, and abscisic acid (ABA) of S. miltiorrhiza itself were significantly higher than those of D-ST without AM fungi.

Under the stimulation of no pathogenic fungi, the hormone content of S. miltiorrhiza with AM fungi was much higher than that of S. miltiorrhiza without AM fungi, which indicated that a certain amount of endogenous hormones would accumulate after the participation of S. miltiorrhiza in the symbiosis of AM fungi. JA27, SA28, and ABA29 as important signaling molecules in the process of plant disease resistance, are closely related to various physiological and biochemical reactions of plants. The accumulation of JA and SA can effectively improve the disease resistance of plants30. The accumulation of ABA can also improve the ability of plants to resist stress. ABA signaling also plays an important role in plant disease resistance. Therefore, the symbiosis of AM fungi and S. miltiorrhiza can effectively improve the resistance of S. miltiorrhiza and the tolerance to diseases. C-GT and C-ST applied AM fungi, but were not inoculated with Fusarium solani, so the change of hormone content is consistent with that of B-ST, which can be used to exclude the influence of AM fungi and S. miltiorrhiza after forming mycorrhizas.

From the expression level of JA in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the JA content of C-G1 without the application of pathogenic fungi is stable, while the JA content of A-G1 and B-G1 shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, indicating that the application of pathogenic fungi can indeed increase the JA content. Compared with D-G1, A-G1, B-G1 both applied pathogenic fungi, with the difference being that D-G1 did not apply AMF fungi. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the variation trend of JA content in A-G1, B-G1, and D-G1 is consistent. However, it is evident that at the same time, the JA content in A-G1 and B-G1 is approximately twice that of D-G1 without the application of AMF.Figure 5JA content in the root system of donor G1. ****p ≤ 0.0001, nsp > 0.05.

After AM fungi were applied to group A, a hyphal network could be formed between A-G2 and A-ST for signal transmission. The JA content in donor G1 increases from 24 to 72 h, and the JA content of S. miltiorrhiza roots after applying pathogenic fungi showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, and the JA content of A-G1 was always higher than that of D-G1 without AM fungi. In group A, the JA content of G1 increased significantly at 72 h and then decreased slowly. However, through the analysis of G2, it was found that the JA content continued to increase from 24 to 120 h, and then decreased at 144 h, in the group with Fusarium solani, the change of hormone content in G2 lagged behind that in G1. It can be found that hormones play an important role in signal transmission. Meanwhile, this also indicates that S. miltiorrhiza can rapidly induce its own JA content to increase after infection with pathogenic fungi. The JA content of D-G1 infected by pathogenic fungi was higher than that of B-ST of S. miltiorrhiza inoculated with AM fungi. This is because when S. miltiorrhiza is invaded by pathogenic fungi, JA content as an important signal molecule in the process of plant disease resistance will significantly increase, thus playing a role in disease resistance in the root system31. The JA content of S. miltiorrhiza has been at a high level after being inoculated with AM fungi in advance. When the plant is under disease stress, it can rapidly increase JA content to enhance the resistance to root rot. After AM fungi were applied to group A, a hyphal network could be formed between A-G2 and A-ST for signal transmission. The JA content in donor G1 increases from 24 to 72 h, and the JA content of S. miltiorrhiza roots after applying pathogenic fungi showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, and the JA content of A-G1 was always higher than that of D-G1 without AM fungi.

The JA content of S. miltiorrhiza has been at a high level after being inoculated with AM fungi in advance. When the plant is under disease stress, it can rapidly increase JA content to enhance the resistance to root rot. As shown in Fig. 6, when A-G1 was subjected to disease stress, the JA content of the A-G2 S. miltiorrhiza root showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. At 120 h, the JA content of A-G2 reached the highest point, but at the same time, the JA content in A-G2 is always lower than that in A-G1. Compared with the JA content of D-G2 roots, the JA content of A-G2 roots was always higher than that of D-G2 without AM fungi inoculation, but the difference was not as obvious as that of A-G1, and the JA content of D-G2 reached the highest point at 144 h. This may be because the stress occurs in the G1 root system, but not directly in the G2 root system. When AM fungi are applied to S. miltiorrhiza, AM fungi and S. miltiorrhiza are symbiotic. Both B-ST and D-ST did not apply Fusarium solani fungi, but B-ST applied AMF fungi, while D-ST did not. From the comparison of the hormone levels in Fig. 4, it can be seen that the three hormone levels in B-ST with AMF fungi were higher than those in D-ST. Therefore, Under the condition of not applying pathogenic fungi, JA accumulates in a certain amount in S. miltiorrhiza. When S. miltiorrhiza is under disease stress, the disease resistance signal can be transmitted to neighboring plants through the hyphal network, so that the JA content of neighboring plants increases rapidly, so that plants can prepare for disease defense in advance and cope with stress.Figure 6JA content in the root system of Salvia miltiorrhiza donor G2. ****p ≤ 0.0001, ***p ≤ 0.001, **p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.05, nsp > 0.05.

This may be because the stress occurs in the G1 root system, but not directly in the G2 root system. When AM fungi are applied to S. miltiorrhiza, AM fungi and S. miltiorrhiza are symbiotic. Both B-ST and D-ST did not apply Fusarium solani fungi, but B-ST applied AMF fungi, while D-ST did not. From the comparison of the hormone levels in Fig. 4, it can be seen that the three hormone levels in B-ST with AMF fungi were higher than those in D-ST. Therefore, Under the condition of not applying pathogenic fungi, JA accumulates in a certain amount in S. miltiorrhiza. When S. miltiorrhiza is under disease stress, the disease resistance signal can be transmitted to neighboring plants through the hyphal network, so that the JA content of neighboring plants increases rapidly, so that plants can prepare for disease defense in advance and cope with stress.Figure 6JA content in the root system of Salvia miltiorrhiza donor G2. ****p ≤ 0.0001, ***p ≤ 0.001, **p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.05, nsp > 0.05.

As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, after the pathogen infection treatment of S. miltiorrhiza donor G1, the receptor JA content in groups B, C, and D had been stably expressed without obvious change. Although A-ST was not directly threatened by the pathogen, it showed a trend of first stable change and then increasing., which indicated that S. miltiorrhiza was induced to activate JA in vivo after suffering from the pathogen Fusarium solani, and the JA content increased to resist stress. When there is a hyphal network connection between the donor and the recipient S. miltiorrhiza, JA can stimulate the recipient healthy S. miltiorrhiza to receive defense signals, so that JA in the recipient’s S. miltiorrhiza is activated and expressed, and the content gradually increases in response to stress. By comparing the JA content of B-ST with four samples of C-G1, C-G2, and C-ST, which were only treated with AMF fungi and not with Fusarium solani fungi, as shown in Fig. 8, the JA content remained unchanged, while B-G2 showed an increase from 24 to 120 h and a decrease thereafter. Moreover, the JA content of B-G1 reaches its peak at 72 h, while B-G2 only reaches its peak at 120 h, indicating that the transmission of disease resistance signals from B-G1 to B-G2 takes time. When one side of the root system is attacked by pathogenic fungi, the disease resistance signal will be transmitted from one side of the root system to the other side of the healthy root system, and then through the hyphal network, the disease resistance signal will be transmitted to the adjacent nonstressed plants. After receiving the disease resistance signal, the plants will make a defense mechanism in advance. In group D, no AM fungi were applied to S. miltiorrhiza, so there was no hyphal network connection between the recipient and the donor, and the JA content in D-ST showed a low-level change.Figure 7JA content in root system of Salvia miltiorrhiza receptor ST.

However, different from the changes in JA, the content of SA in S. miltiorrhiza after the application of pathogenic fungi was lower than that of S. miltiorrhiza without pathogenic fungi, which may be due to the antagonistic effect of JA and SA. When plants suffer from disease stress, the content of JA increases significantly, and the increase of JA content will inhibit the content of SA in plants32 .

There is a hyphal network between the recipient and the donor of S. miltiorrhiza in group A, so A-ST can receive the disease resistance signal transmitted by the donor S. miltiorrhiza. Before the disease resistance signal is transmitted to the recipient, the SA content of A-ST is not much different from that of B-ST inoculated with AM fungi alone.

Only S. miltiorrhiza inoculated with Fusarium solani could induce the expression of the PR-10 gene at 72 h, and the gene expression reached the highest at 120 h. For the roots of S. miltiorrhiza inoculated with Fusarium solani, the amount of gene changes showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The expression of the PR-10 gene changed in different groups. The highest expression of A-G1 was 2.16 times that of D-G1; The expression level of PR-10 gene in the root system of C-G1 S. miltiorrhiza, which was only treated with AMF fungi, was similar to that of D-ST, which was not treated with both, and the expression level of PR-10 gene in C-G1 increased only after 24 h. Due to the absence of pathogenic fungal infection in C-G1, the defense mechanism for disease resistance was not induced, and the gene expression level of PR-10 showed a low level of change.Figure 11PR-10 gene expression of four groups.

The expression of PR-10 gene changed steadily and was at a low level. In the root system of recipient S. miltiorrhiza, there were roots connected by hyphal network with donor S. miltiorrhiza. After the pathogen Fusarium solani was inoculated into donor S. miltiorrhiza G1, the expression of PR-10 gene showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, and reached the highest level at 120 h. However, the root G1 was only inoculated with S. miltiorrhiza of Fusarium solani, because no AM fungi were applied, and there was no hyphal network connection between donor S. miltiorrhiza and recipient S. miltiorrhiza, the expression of PR-10 gene in D-ST root system remained unchanged, and the highest expression of A-ST was 11.25 times of its highest expression.

The above data show that the expression of PR-10 gene can only be induced after inoculation of S. miltiorrhiza with the pathogenic fungi Fusarium solani. In S. miltiorrhiza without inoculation of the pathogenic fungi Fusarium solani, the PR-10 gene expression of S. miltiorrhiza inoculated with AM fungi and without AM fungi has always been low.Under the condition that the recipient S. miltiorrhiza in group A was not directly infected by the pathogen fungi, the PR-10 gene showed a high expression, which was different from that of the other three groups. This showed that the hyphal network between the recipient and the donor could transmit the signal of resistance to root rot. after the infection of Fusarium solani, the defense response of S. miltiorrhiza was rapidly activated, and the relevant disease resistance signal was transmitted to the recipient S. miltiorrhiza through the hyphal network, making it start the relevant defense response in advance, In response to the upcoming coercion.

The symbiosis between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plants forms a mycorrhizal hyphal network, which is a reciprocal effect for plants and fungi. The formation of mycorrhizas not only increases the absorption of mineral elements in the soil, but also improves the disease resistance of plants33. This study proved that the defense response of S. miltiorrhiza inoculated with AM fungi was rapidly activated when the plant was subjected to disease stress.

According to the comparison of ABA content in Figs. 4 and 13, we can get that the ABA content of S. miltiorrhiza inoculated with AM fungi is 2.50 times that of uninoculated.

Therefore, when no pathogenic fungi were applied to S. miltiorrhiza, the ABA content of B-ST inoculated with AMF fungi is higher than that of D-ST not inoculated with AMF fungi, indicating that AM fungi can promote the accumulation of ABA content in S. miltiorrhiza. The ABA content of C-G1, which was only applied with AM fungi and not inoculated with pathogenic fungi, had not changed significantly, but after the application of pathogenic fungi to S. miltiorrhiza, the ABA content of S. miltiorrhiza had interesting changes.

The ABA content of C-G1, which was only applied with AM fungi and not inoculated with pathogenic fungi, had not changed significantly, but after the application of pathogenic fungi to S. miltiorrhiza, the ABA content of S. miltiorrhiza had interesting changes. As shown in Fig. 14, in treatment group A, the ABA content of A-G1 increased first and then decreased, but the change was not obvious, and its content was greater than that of the other groups. Although D-G1 was not inoculated with AM fungi, it may be that Fusarium solani was applied at the G1 end, so the content was also high. The opposite phenomenon occurred in the G2 root system of S. miltiorrhiza34. The ABA content of the D-G2 root system was always at the highest level, which may be because S. miltiorrhiza without AM fungi was not resistant to disease stress, but when it was stressed by pathogenic fungi, S. miltiorrhiza might enhance its disease resistance by controlling its own stomatal movement and water content changes. The study showed that the closure of stomata and the reduction of ion permeability are conducive to plants' resistance to the invasion of fungi, and when plants are stressed by bacteria, fungi, and viruses, the endogenous ABA level of plants will increase35. The low ABA content in A-G2 may be due to the application of AM fungi by S. miltiorrhiza, which improved the resistance of S. miltiorrhiza through symbiosis when no stress occurred, so the ABA content in the root system of S. miltiorrhiza G2 did not significantly increase during this period. The data of recipient S. miltiorrhiza showed that the ABA content of A-ST roots was lower than that of B-ST. Increasing the content of ABA and jasmonic acid can improve plant biological activity36 and enhance plant resistance to insect pests37, but many evidences also indicate that ABA and jasmonic acid signaling pathway may antagonize each other. In the study of resistance to cabbage clubroot disease, it was found38. When exogenous hormone MeJA was applied to cabbage, the JA content of the cabbage itself increased, while the ABA content decreased. So the ABA content of donors in group A was lower than that of donors in group B, probably because the JA content of donors in group A was significantly increased, which inhibited the synthesis and accumulation of ABA.Figure 14Changes in root ABA content in each group. As shown in Fig. 14, in treatment group A, the ABA content of A-G1 increased first and then decreased, but the change was not obvious, and its content was greater than that of the other groups.

The data of recipient S. miltiorrhiza showed that the ABA content of A-ST roots was lower than that of B-ST. Increasing the content of ABA and jasmonic acid can improve plant biological activity36 and enhance plant resistance to insect pests37, but many evidences also indicate that ABA and jasmonic acid signaling pathway may antagonize each other. In the study of resistance to cabbage clubroot disease, it was found38. When exogenous hormone MeJA was applied to cabbage, the JA content of the cabbage itself increased, while the ABA content decreased. So the ABA content of donors in group A was lower than that of donors in group B, probably because the JA content of donors in group A was significantly increased, which inhibited the synthesis and accumulation of ABA.Figure 14Changes in root ABA content in each group.

As the most important stress resistance hormone of plants, ABA has the functions of promoting plant dormancy, reducing plant water loss, inhibiting plant growth and development39, inducing the expression of stress-related genes40, etc., which can promote the adaptation of plants to the stress environment. Nowadays, studies have shown that the ABA signaling system also interacts with many hormone pathways during transcription41–43. Our research group completed the sequencing of the transcriptome of S. miltiorrhiza symbiosis with mycorrhiza in the previous experiment and screened the resistance gene SnRK2. As a gene related to the self-resistance response of S. miltiorrhiza, SnRK2 type protein kinase can phosphorylate arebs / ABFs and transcription factor ABI5, and then induce the expression of the target gene through arebs in the promoter, promoting ABA response44.

As shown in Figs. 15, 16, SnRK2 gene changes were also different in the four S. miltiorrhiza treatment groups with different treatment methods. It can be seen that for the treatment group D without AM fungi, the expression of the SnRK2 gene is up-regulated relative to the other three groups with AM fungi, which is consistent with our results obtained in transcriptome sequencing. If there is no communication between the S. miltiorrhiza donor and the recipient, the gene expression of group A recipients should be consistent with that of group B recipients. If the change of gene expression is caused by mycorrhizal infection, the receptor S. miltiorrhiza in group A and group C should have the same change, but relative to the receptors in group B and group D, the expression of A-ST is higher than that of b-st and lower than that of D-ST, which indicates that there is one or more transmission of disease resistance signals between the donor S. miltiorrhiza and the recipient S. miltiorrhiza connected by the hyphal network, which makes the SnRK2 gene of S. miltiorrhiza make corresponding changes.Figure 15Changes in SnRK2 gene expression between miltiorrhiza donors and recipients.Figure 16SnRK2 gene changes in each group. ****p ≤ 0.0001, ***p ≤ 0.001, **p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.05, nsp > 0.05.

The data results of the detection of plant endogenous hormones JA, SA, and ABA showed that after inoculation with pathogenic fungi, JA showed antagonistic changes with SA and ABA, the increase of JA content inhibited the expression of SA and ABA hormones, SnRK2 was inhibited by ABA in the signal transduction pathway, so we speculated that JA might positively regulate the expression of SnRK2 gene. When the root of S. miltiorrhiza is subjected to stress, the JA content increases, and the SnRK2 gene is positively regulated by it, thereby inhibiting ABA signal transduction in the plant body, reducing the inhibition of root growth, promoting the decomposition of proteins, sugars, and other substances in the plant body, and improving the plant's resistance.

Conclusion and discussion Conclusion and discussion In nature, abiotic stress and biotic stress are the main threats to plant growth and development. At present, most studies are aimed at abiotic stresses, such as drought stress45. Plants need water for growth. For their growth and development, plants have formed a mechanism to resist drought stress after long-term evolution46. We have little knowledge about the signaling mechanisms by which plants respond to abiotic stress, but in this experiment, we found that plants respond much faster to pathogenic fungi when containing mycorrhizal hyphal networks than we imagine.

We have little knowledge about the signaling mechanisms by which plants respond to abiotic stress, but in this experiment, we found that plants respond much faster to pathogenic fungi when containing mycorrhizal hyphal networks than we imagine. This research shows that plants and plant roots can form a huge mycorrhizal hyphal network through the hyphal bridge between the soil. When the plants on one side are given drought stress, the plants can sense the stress signal in advance, and then prepare for drought and drought resistance in advance, which is conducive to the plants' resistance to the adverse environment. Biological stress is mainly caused by various diseases, such as leaf spots47,48, blight49, etc. Fruitful research achievements have been made in model plants and important crops such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, rice, soybean, corn, etc., but the research on disease resistance signal transmission of medicinal plants is still relatively backward. This experiment to some extent compensates for this deficiency. This research shows that plants and plant roots can form a huge mycorrhizal hyphal network through the hyphal bridge between the soil.

This experiment to some extent compensates for this deficiency. After plants and AM fungi form symbionts, the cell structure in plant roots changes and is rich in abundant Arbuscular structures50. It is the existence of Arbuscular structures that makes the communication between plants and fungi more favorable. Through hyphal connection, it can realize distant communication between plants. The mycorrhizal structure enables plants to transmit signals to adjacent roots faster when they encounter stress51.

The mycorrhizal structure enables plants to transmit signals to adjacent roots faster when they encounter stress51. This experiment confirmed that the inoculation of AM fungi can increase the content of JA, SA, and ABA in S. miltiorrhiza. JA and SA are important signal molecules in plants. The increase in hormone content can enhance the ability of plants to resist external stress. In the analysis of PR-10 gene expression, it was found that S. miltiorrhiza, which formed a mycelial network between AM fungi and plant roots, could promote healthy roots to transmit disease resistance signals to recipient S. miltiorrhiza through mycelial bridges when infected by pathogenic fungi. The SnRK2 gene is down-regulated in mycorrhizal symbiotic plants. When the pathogenic fungi threaten the donor plants, it will also cause a series of corresponding changes in the receptor plant SnRK2 gene: ABA accumulation inhibits the expression of SnRK2, and SnRK2 is in the ABA transduction pathway. When SnRK2 is inhibited, it weakens the ABA signal transduction in the root, resulting in ABA reducing the inhibition of root growth and other biological processes, which may be the response feedback of ABA hormone signal to AM fungi and pathogenic fungi.

S. miltiorrhiza can transmit the signal of resistance to root rot through the jasmonic acid pathway; When plants suffer from disease stress, the content of JA increases significantly, and the increase of JA content will inhibit the content of SA in plants; The gene expression of PR-10 gene in the roots of S. miltiorrhiza with arbuscular mycorrhizal network infected by pathogenic fungi was 17.56 times higher than that inoculated only with pathogenic fungi; Changes in hormone content will also cause changes in the expression of related defense genes, such as SnRK2 is inhibited by ABA in the signal transduction pathway, while JA and ABA show antagonistic changes after inoculation of pathogenic fungi in S. miltiorrhiza, so JA may positively regulate the expression of SnRK2 gene.

With the development of ecological agriculture, more and more local planting enterprises begin to pay attention to environmental protection and the good quality of products. In future agriculture, the use of AM fungi for biological prevention and control has a good industry prospect. Therefore, modern scientific and technological means should be used to promote the greening of agriculture and develop green agriculture in the future.
