Emerging and re-emerging microbial pathogens, together with their rapid evolution and adaptation against antibiotics, highlight the importance not only of screening for new antimicrobial agents, but also for deepening knowledge about existing antibiotics. Primycin is a large 36-membered non-polyene macrolide lactone exclusively produced by Saccharomonospora azurea. This study provides information about strain dependent primycin production ability in conjunction with the structural, functional and comparative genomic examinations. Comparison of high- and low-primycin producer strains, transcriptomic analysis identified a total of 686 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), classified into diverse Cluster of Orthologous Groups. Among them, genes related to fatty acid synthesis, self-resistance, regulation of secondary metabolism and agmatinase encoding gene responsible for catalyze conversion between guanidino/amino forms of primycin were discussed. Based on in silico data mining methods, we were able to identify DEGs whose altered expression provide a good starting point for the optimization of fermentation processes, in order to perform targeted strain improvement and rational drug design.

Introduction Introduction Actinomycetales are known as natural producers of a wide range of biologically active secondary metabolites that exhibit remarkable clinical importance (Jakubiec-Krzesniak et al. 2018; Solecka et al. 2012). Primycin, produced by a Gram-positive (G+) filamentous bacteria Saccharomonospora azurea, is a 36-membered marginolactone antibiotic that possesses high antimicrobial activity against frequent Gram-positive pathogens, including clinically prevalent multidrug-resistant strains (Feiszt et al. 2014). In the last decade complete genome sequences have been obtained for several species of Saccharomonospora genus, however the available genomics information regarding biologically active metabolite production is still underrepresentated compared to other members of Pseudonocardiaceae family. Primycin was first described in 1954 to be produced by Streptomyces primycini, and thereafter by Micromonospora galeriensis, but none of these species was validly published (Szabó et al. 1976; Vályi-Nagy et al. 1954). In recent times, only S. azurea is known to has the ability to produce primycin (Csepregi et al. 2012; Klenk et al. 2012).

In recent times, only S. azurea is known to has the ability to produce primycin (Csepregi et al. 2012; Klenk et al. 2012). It is well documented that several clinically important bioactive secondary metabolites are synthesized on modular polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) enzyme complexes via a conserved thiotemplate mechanism (Du and Lou 2010; Wang et al. 2014). Among them, macrolide antibiotics, represented by polyene and non-polyene compounds are one of the most effective antimicrobial agents. Primycin, like other guanidine-containing macrocyclic polyketides is also synthesized by the bacterial modular type I polyketide synthase pathway. In general, each PKS module minimally consists of a ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) catalytic domains, usually extended by ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), enolyreductase (ER) and thioesterase (TE) accessory domains. The 4-guanidinobutanoyl-COA starter unit of the primycin biosynthesis is derived from the three-step L-arginine precursor pathway, catalyzed by amine oxidase, amidohydrolase and acyl-CoA ligase enzymes (Hong et al. 2013). The activated 4-guanidinobutanoyl group is transferred to the loading ACP domain, performed by ACP S-malonyltransferase and subsequently the growing polyketide chain synthesis follows the canonical type I PKS biosynthetic logic. Finally, the TE domain catalyzes the release of the ACP-bound polyketide product through hydrolysis of the thioester bound. Although the modular genetic architecture of type I PKS is intensively reviewed (Hertweck 2009; Tsai and Ames 2009), knowledge about genetic factors controlling the yield and quality of secondary metabolites synthesis is limited.

The detailed genetic map of the extended primycin PKS gene cluster revealed the presence of glycosyltransferase and agmatinase encoding genes directly adjacent to the PKS. In the late step of primycin biosynthesis, transfer of the arabinosyl moiety onto the hydroxyl group of A1, A2 and A3 isoforms is catalysed by glycosyltransferase analogue to ECO-0501 biosynthesis pathway (Banskota et al. 2006). Agmatinase enzyme, as a member of the ureohydrolase superfamily, is responsible for catalyzing conversion between guanidino and amino forms of primycin, by a nucleophilic attack on the amidino carbon. The importance of agmatinase in primycin-like amino/guanidino marginolactones biosynthesis was highlighted by Hong and coworkers (Hong et al. 2016).

Even though a comparative structural genomic approach can provide important knowledge related to antibiotic gene clusters, it can not tell the whole story. To gain more insight into structure–function relationships beyond static analysis of biosynthetic gene cluster, the application of acombined approach of structural and functional genomics revealed several differentially expressed genes (DEGs), possibly involved in primycin biosynthetic pathway. Based on Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Gene Ontology (GO) systems, DEGs responsible for signal transduction, fatty acid synthesis and multidrug transport were emphasized.

Accordingly, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 test strain (approx. 106 CFU/mL) was inoculated into liquid phase (50 °C) Mueller–Hinton agar (Biolab). After solidification of culture media, sample holding wells were prepared (9 mm diameter, 5 mm depth). Original extracts were diluted ten times with BEW, and a subsequently twofold dilution series was prepared from each sample in ethanol-phosphate buffer (1.16% (w/v) K2HPO4; 0.91% (w/v) KH2PO4; 25% (v/v) ethanol; 75% distilled water (v/v)).

Reads of the whole transcriptome of S. azurea SZMC 14600 and S. azurea DSM 44631 were aligned to S. azurea SZMC 14600 genome using Bowtie2 alignment protocol. Transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis were performed according to the Cufflinks RNA-Seq workflow (Trapnell et al. 2010). DEGs represented at least twofold change (> 2 or < − 2 in log2) were functionally annotated using Blast2GO version 5.2.4. software (Götz et al. 2008). To determine GO terms, functional annotation of each transcript was performed against the non-redundant (nr) protein database compiled by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using BLASTx with 10e−3 e-value threshold. The set of DEGs were classified into COG categories based on the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes (IGM/M) system.

Results Results Primycin producing ability Primycin producing ability Primycin producing ability While S. viridis DSM 43017, S. glauca DSM 43769 and S. cyanea DSM 4410 strains can grow in the fermentation media, none of them were able to produce primycin, consequently no zone of inhibition was detected in the antimicrobial assay (Fig. 1). Each of the investigated S. azurea strains was primycin producer, nevertheless significant differences were observed in their production capacity. Based on agar well diffusion assay, calculated primycin concentration in case of S. azurea SZMC 14600 revealed approximately seven times more product (1173 ± 66.22 mg/L) compared to S. azurea DSM 44631 (168 ± 9.35 mg/L).

Based on overall similarities to antibiotic producer S. azurea strains, S. cyanea, S. galuca and S. viridis were selected for detailed in silico structural analysis. In order to further improve reliability of gene presence/absence polymorphism calling, the distribution of COG functional categories were determined. Protein characterized in COG represented on average 61.7% of total gene number (Table 2S). Comparative analysis of identified COG categories revealed 1221 proteins commonly present in all compared species. The graphical representation of COGs (Fig. 3) displays 40 S. azurea specific proteins which were not present in any additional member of the comparison. Among them 5 proteins were unique for S. azurea SZMC 14600, and 14 proteins were present only for S. azurea DSM 44631. Further genome mining efforts on previously reported high quality draft genome data of S. azurea SZMC 14600 revealed complete primycin biosynthetic gene cluster (PBGC) consisting of type I PKS core genes flanked by accessory genes (Fig. 4), however in case of S. cyanea, S. galuca and S. viridis the antiSMASH ‘in silico’ genome analysis revealed the absence of primycin biosynthetic gene cluster. The predicted primycin PKS model is composed of one loading and 18 separate extender modules, in good agreement with the chemical structure of primycin molecules (Fig. 5). The substrate specificity of PKS chain elongation is determined by AT domains. In case of primycin PKS, the amino acid sequence alignment of ATs revealed malonyl-CoA specific AT domains at module 4–10 and 12–16 having typical GHSx[LVIFAM]G and HAFH motifs (Fig. 1S). In modules 1–3, 11 and 17, methylmalonyl-CoA substrate specific motifs GHSx[QMI]G and YASH were observed (Fig. 2S) (Yadav et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2019). Interestingly, antiSMASH in silicio analysis predicted unusual ethylmalonyl-CoA incorporation in module 18, however the presence of GHSQG and GAGH motifs define butylmalonyl-CoA, pentylmalonyl-CoA or hexylmalonyl-CoA incorporation (Fig. 3S).Fig. 3Venn diagram representation of the distribution of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) in the five analyzed Saccharomonospora genomes.

The major forms of primycin complex determined by R1 and R2 side chains is shown at the bottom of the figure Comparative whole genome analysis revealed a high percentage identity (93.4%) within the HSPs (high-scoring segment pairs) between S. azurea SZMC 14600 and S. azurea DSM 44631, while in case of other species identity in HSPs ranged from 28.0 to 20.3% (Table 1S). Based on overall similarities to antibiotic producer S. azurea strains, S. cyanea, S. galuca and S. viridis were selected for detailed in silico structural analysis. In order to further improve reliability of gene presence/absence polymorphism calling, the distribution of COG functional categories were determined. Protein characterized in COG represented on average 61.7% of total gene number (Table 2S). Comparative analysis of identified COG categories revealed 1221 proteins commonly present in all compared species. The graphical representation of COGs (Fig. 3) displays 40 S. azurea specific proteins which were not present in any additional member of the comparison. Among them 5 proteins were unique for S. azurea SZMC 14600, and 14 proteins were present only for S. azurea DSM 44631. Further genome mining efforts on previously reported high quality draft genome data of S. azurea SZMC 14600 revealed complete primycin biosynthetic gene cluster (PBGC) consisting of type I PKS core genes flanked by accessory genes (Fig. 4), however in case of S. cyanea, S. galuca and S. viridis the antiSMASH ‘in silico’ genome analysis revealed the absence of primycin biosynthetic gene cluster. The predicted primycin PKS model is composed of one loading and 18 separate extender modules, in good agreement with the chemical structure of primycin molecules (Fig. 5). The substrate specificity of PKS chain elongation is determined by AT domains. In case of primycin PKS, the amino acid sequence alignment of ATs revealed malonyl-CoA specific AT domains at module 4–10 and 12–16 having typical GHSx[LVIFAM]G and HAFH motifs (Fig. 1S). In modules 1–3, 11 and 17, methylmalonyl-CoA substrate specific motifs GHSx[QMI]G and YASH were observed (Fig. 2S) (Yadav et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2019). Interestingly, antiSMASH in silicio analysis predicted unusual ethylmalonyl-CoA incorporation in module 18, however the presence of GHSQG and GAGH motifs define butylmalonyl-CoA, pentylmalonyl-CoA or hexylmalonyl-CoA incorporation (Fig. 3S).Fig. 3Venn diagram representation of the distribution of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) in the five analyzed Saccharomonospora genomes.

High throughput ligation based SOLiD V4 sequencing revealed 48 115 904 and 33 373 930 trimmed reads corresponding to 484 and 336-fold coverage of S. azurea SZMC 14600 and DSM 44631 genomes respectively. Following the Cufflinks RNA-Seq pipeline, transcriptomic analysis revealed 330 and 356 DEGs in a set of S. azurea SZMC 14600 vs. S. azurea DSM 44631 respectively at fold change cutoff of 2 in log2 scale. To identify functional categories of DEGs, GO enrichment analysis was performed. In case of high-primycin producer S. azurea SZMC 14600 strain, out of the 330 identified DEGs 253 were functionally annotated and classified into the three major GO categories as follows: 132 cellular component (C), 362 molecular function (F) and 231 biological process (P). Among cellular components, the most frequent categories were integral components of membrane (GO:0016021), cytoplasm (GO:0005737), plasma membrane (GO:0005886), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex (GO:0043190), and intracellular (GO:0005622). Regarding molecular functions, ATP binding (GO:0005524), DNA binding (GO:0003677), metal ion binding (GO:0046872), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), transferase activity (GO:0016740), and methyltransferase activity (GO:0008168) were the most numerous categories. The top five biological component categories included oxidation–reduction process (GO:0055114), transmembrane transport (GO:0055085), regulation of transcription, DNA-templated (GO:0006355), methylation (GO:0032259), and metabolic process (GO:0008152). In case of low-primycin producer strains, out of the 356 identified DEGs, 276 were functionally annotated and classified into: 133 cellular component (C), 332 molecular function (F) and 247 biological process (P). Representation of dominant GO categories in case of low-producer S. azurea DSM 44631 were practically identical (Fig. 4S).

Representation of dominant GO categories in case of low-producer S. azurea DSM 44631 were practically identical (Fig. 4S). The possible function of DEGs were also predicted and classified by aligning to the COG database. COG assignment resulted 294 and 313 DEGs in comparison of high- and low-primycin producer respectively, corresponding to 22 specific categories. Gene products without related COGs, predominantly encoding hypothetical proteins, or assigned into general function prediction only (R), and function unknown (S) categories were filtered out. Among functional categories amino acid transport and metabolism (E), transcription (K) and energy production and conversion (C) were predominant in S. azurea SZMC 14600. Interestingly, analysis of the low-primycin producer S. azurea DSM 44631 strain revealed orthologous sequences involved in different biological processes such as carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P), furthermore notable differences were also observed in a number of assigned genes (equal to up- and down-regulation) as it is summarized in Table 3S. Taking into consideration the most characteristics expressional changes of high- and low-antibiotic producer strains, the following COG categories were remarkably down-regulated in SZMC 14600: carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (M), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P), and coenzyme transport and metabolism (H). In contrast, the majority of DEGs belonging to COGs involved in nucleotide transport and metabolism (F), amino acid transport and metabolism (E), energy production and conversion (C) and defense mechanisms (V) were up-regulated in the high-producer strain (Fig. 6). The analysis of the primycin PKS core biosynthetic genes with respect to expression levels revealed no differences among the high- and low-primycin producer S. azurea due to the two strains had comparable expression levels. As we presented in the schematic genetic map of the primycin gene cluster (Fig. 4), the agmatinase encoding gene (EHK80172.1) is located at the 3′ end of the PKS. According to the RNA-Seq analysis, the agmatinase encoding gene belonging to the amino acid transport and metabolism (E) COG category was up-regulated in the primycin overproducer with 2.62 log2 fold-change. The up-regulation tendency of agmatinase gene in S. azurea SZMC 14600 was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5S).Fig. 6Representation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) functional categories of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in S. azurea SZMC 14600 and S. azurea DSM 44631.

Interestingly, analysis of the low-primycin producer S. azurea DSM 44631 strain revealed orthologous sequences involved in different biological processes such as carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P), furthermore notable differences were also observed in a number of assigned genes (equal to up- and down-regulation) as it is summarized in Table 3S. Taking into consideration the most characteristics expressional changes of high- and low-antibiotic producer strains, the following COG categories were remarkably down-regulated in SZMC 14600: carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (M), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P), and coenzyme transport and metabolism (H). In contrast, the majority of DEGs belonging to COGs involved in nucleotide transport and metabolism (F), amino acid transport and metabolism (E), energy production and conversion (C) and defense mechanisms (V) were up-regulated in the high-producer strain (Fig. 6). The analysis of the primycin PKS core biosynthetic genes with respect to expression levels revealed no differences among the high- and low-primycin producer S. azurea due to the two strains had comparable expression levels. As we presented in the schematic genetic map of the primycin gene cluster (Fig. 4), the agmatinase encoding gene (EHK80172.1) is located at the 3′ end of the PKS. According to the RNA-Seq analysis, the agmatinase encoding gene belonging to the amino acid transport and metabolism (E) COG category was up-regulated in the primycin overproducer with 2.62 log2 fold-change. The up-regulation tendency of agmatinase gene in S. azurea SZMC 14600 was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5S).Fig. 6Representation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) functional categories of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in S. azurea SZMC 14600 and S. azurea DSM 44631.

Even though a number of initiatives have been launched to reinvigorate the antibiotic research and development pipeline, an application of genome mining approach coupled with transcriptomic analysis and analytical methods is not yet common at industry level (Palazzotto and Weber 2018). On the basis of these innovative technologies, this study reports the result of a comparative structural and functional analysis of S. azurea strains in terms of primycin producing ability. Reexamination of primycin producing ability among representative species of the genus Saccharomonospora revealed that only S. azurea strains were capable of synthesizing primycin (Juhász et al. 2011), however the yield of antibiotic was significantly different according to agar well diffusion assay. Comparative HPLC–DAD-ESI/MS analysis of the two primycin producer S. azurea strains resulted in remarkable differences not only in yield, but also in dynamics of antibiotic production in each time points of batch fermentation. Enhancement of antibiotic producing ability of industrial strains remains the focus of industry driven research, nevertheless classical strain improvement and optimization of the fermentation process frequently suffers from limitations (Lal et al. 1996; Parekh et al. 2000). In order to assess the similarities and differences between S. azurea strains in regard to their potential to produce primycin, comparative whole genome analysis was performed. A wide range of biologically active natural products are synthesized by bacterial modular type I PKS assembly line (Hertweck 2015), such as 36-membered marginolactone primycin. Although our hypothesis, that structural differences of PKS gene clusters is responsible for elevated primycin production, was not supported by the comparative in silico analysis. Nevertheless, these efforts revealed the presence of unusual butlymalonyl-CoA, pentlymalonyl-CoA or hexylmalonyl-CoA substrate specificity in module 18. Similar AT domain characteristics were reported in case of stambomycin, thailandi, neoansamycin, antimycin and cinnabaramide biosynthesis (Greule et al. 2016; Li et al. 2015; Rachid et al. 2011; Ray et al. 2016). These findings were further supported by R2 side chain variability of primycin molecules (Fig. 5). Regarding quantitative differences in primycin producing ability, much effort has been made in investigating complex gene expression profiles of S. azurea strains. RNA-Seq of high- and low-primycin producer S. azurea strains resulted 686 DEGs with cutoff 2 and classified into diverse COGs, however metabolism-related COG categories were dominant, representing more than 50% of the total hits (Table 3S). Among them, the agmatinase encoding gene belonging to amino acid transport and metabolism (E) was up-regulated 2.62-fold in the primycin overproducer strain. The relevance of agmatinase gene overexpression highlights its importance in conversion of amino/guanidino marginolactones biosynthesis, as mentioned in an earlier study (Hong 2016). More recently, a case study focused on targeting mechanisms of azalomycin F5a produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. azalomyceticus revealed that the guanidyl side chain of the marginolactone antibiotic plays pivotal role in antibacterial effect. Consequently, modification of agmatinase enzyme encoding gene expression emerges as a promising target to enhance antibacterial activity (Yuan et al. 2019). Expression profiling revealed DEGs encoding enzymes responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis. The enzymatic machinery responsible for de novo biosynthesis of FAs and polyketides possess many common features, including the utilization of identical precursors (Cronan and Thomas 2009), therefore substrate competition effect theoretically could not be excluded. Our results were based on the actual experimental design, in which high- and low-primycin producer S. azurea strains were compared under identical culture conditions, and growth phase did not support the hypothesis that competition generally does not occur due to the time shift of the two biosynthetic process (Gago et al. 2011). The overexpression of FA synthesis related genes in low-producer S. azurea DSM 44631 strain suggests that biosynthetic activity of FA and polyketide related machinery is not a clear sequential process, rather should be considered an overlapping even at least partially. There is no doubt that antibiotic resistance is a global and serious issue nowadays (Payne et al. 2015). Even though a number of initiatives have been launched to reinvigorate the antibiotic research and development pipeline, an application of genome mining approach coupled with transcriptomic analysis and analytical methods is not yet common at industry level (Palazzotto and Weber 2018).

RNA-Seq of high- and low-primycin producer S. azurea strains resulted 686 DEGs with cutoff 2 and classified into diverse COGs, however metabolism-related COG categories were dominant, representing more than 50% of the total hits (Table 3S). Among them, the agmatinase encoding gene belonging to amino acid transport and metabolism (E) was up-regulated 2.62-fold in the primycin overproducer strain. The relevance of agmatinase gene overexpression highlights its importance in conversion of amino/guanidino marginolactones biosynthesis, as mentioned in an earlier study (Hong 2016). More recently, a case study focused on targeting mechanisms of azalomycin F5a produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. azalomyceticus revealed that the guanidyl side chain of the marginolactone antibiotic plays pivotal role in antibacterial effect. Consequently, modification of agmatinase enzyme encoding gene expression emerges as a promising target to enhance antibacterial activity (Yuan et al. 2019). Expression profiling revealed DEGs encoding enzymes responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis. The enzymatic machinery responsible for de novo biosynthesis of FAs and polyketides possess many common features, including the utilization of identical precursors (Cronan and Thomas 2009), therefore substrate competition effect theoretically could not be excluded. Our results were based on the actual experimental design, in which high- and low-primycin producer S. azurea strains were compared under identical culture conditions, and growth phase did not support the hypothesis that competition generally does not occur due to the time shift of the two biosynthetic process (Gago et al. 2011). The overexpression of FA synthesis related genes in low-producer S. azurea DSM 44631 strain suggests that biosynthetic activity of FA and polyketide related machinery is not a clear sequential process, rather should be considered an overlapping even at least partially. Primycin, a non-polyene marginolactone antibiotic produced by filamentous bacteria S. azurea, possesses high antimicrobial activity against frequent G+ pathogens, including clinically prevalent multidrug-resistant strains (Feiszt et al. 2014). To protect themselves against their own bioactive metabolites, self-resistance mechanism for antibiotic producers are crucial. Despite the fact that the history of primycin dates back more than 60 years, there is no available scientific knowledge of the regulation of self-resistance in S. azurea species. Among members of the ABC transporter superfamily, encoding genes involved in multidrug and self-resistance (Rees et al. 2009; van Veen and Konings 1998), tightly linked to the PBGC were up-regulated in overproducer strain. Similarly, six genes encoding TetR family of regulators (TFRs), associated with antibiotic resistance (Cuthbertson and Nodwell 2013; Deng et al. 2013), were also significantly overexpressed. These findings support the hypothesis that the expression of resistance genes is presumably induced by primycin or intermediate molecules in a concentration related manner.

A bacterial two component signal transduction system (TCS) is not only important for complex adaptive responses towards environmental changes, but also involved in the biosynthetic control of a broad range of secondary metabolites (Rodríguez et al. 2013; Zschiedrich et al. 2016). For instance the two component system AfsQ1/Q2 of Streptomyces coelicolor was found to be capable of stimulating actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin and calcium-dependent antibiotic production (Wang et al. 2013). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that orf22 and orf23 members of Streptomyces clavuligerus TCS positively regulate clavulanic acid biosynthesis, and their overexpression resulted in elevated yield of antibiotic production (Jnawali et al. 2008). To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate overexpression of HK and RR encoding genes related to elevated primycin biosynthetic capacity in S. azurea.

Transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolisms in Streptomyces has been extensively studied (Bibb 2005), however there is still room for improvement in case of industrially important rare Actinomycetes. Genes corresponding to Lrp/AsnC family transcriptional regulators were found substantially up-regulated in high-primycin producer strains. Present findings were in agreement with previously reported facts that, genes encoding the Lrp/AsnC family transcriptional regulators (SCO2140 and SCO3361) act as positive regulators of antibiotic production in S. coelicolor (Liu et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2016).

In summary, we have presented a comprehensive study based on multidisciplinary approaches e.g. traditional microbiology; analytical chemistry; structural, functional and comparative genomics supported by a wide variety of bioinformatics tools. The primary aim of the research was to gain insight into the difference and determinants of primycin producing ability via comparison of high- and low-antibiotic producer S. azurea strains. Even though an in silico analysis of PKS gene clusters did not revealed significant structural differences between the two strains, clear evidence was found for unusual substrate specificity of the AT domain in module 18. Concerning quantitative differences in primycin producing ability, the performed transcriptomic analysis resulted several DEGs, classified into various COG categories. Among them, genes related to fatty acid synthesis, self-resistance, regulation of secondary metabolism and an agmatinase encoding gene responsible for catalyze conversion between guanidino and amino forms of primycin were discussed. As a result our efforts to investigate PBGC and the regulation of primycin biosynthesis provides clues for antibiotic yield- and strain-improvement as well as laying the foundation for rational drug design.
