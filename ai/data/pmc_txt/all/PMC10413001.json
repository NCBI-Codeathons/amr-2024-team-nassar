["Microbial natural products have been one of the most important sources for drug development. In the current postgenomic era, sequence-driven approaches for natural product discovery are becoming increasingly popular. Here, we develop an effective genome mining strategy for the targeted discovery of microbial metabolites with antitumor activities. Our method employs uvrA-like genes as genetic markers, which have been identified in the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of several chemotherapeutic drugs of microbial origin and confer self-resistance to the corresponding producers. Through systematic genomic analysis of gifted actinobacteria genera, identification of uvrA-like gene-containing BGCs, and targeted isolation of products from a BGC prioritized for metabolic analysis, we identified a new tetracycline-type DNA intercalator timmycins. Our results thus provide a new genome mining strategy for the efficient discovery of antitumor agents acting through DNA intercalation.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Microbial specialized metabolites are rich sources of antibiotics and clinically used drugs [[1], [2], [3]]. These small molecules disrupt essential cellular processes through various modes of action. Historically, compounds of interest were isolated through large-scale screening of microbial culture extracts followed by activity tracking based on specific bioactivity assays. However, this traditional bioactivity-guided strategy is becoming less efficient due to the high rate of rediscovery of known compounds. In recent years, great efforts have been made to elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of microbial specialized metabolites with diversified structures and activities [4,5]. These studies not only revealed novel enzymology involved in the microbial specialized metabolism but also significantly increased our understanding of the self-resistance mechanisms of the producers, as it was found that self-resistance genes are frequently clustered with biosynthetic genes [6]. This co-localization property facilitates the identification of biosynthetic genes of a given microbial metabolite and offers genome mining approaches for the discovery of new compounds with predictable modes of action in the postgenomic era. Indeed, several self-resistance-guided strategies for identifying new bioactive compounds have been reported [[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]].", "Microbial specialized metabolites are rich sources of antibiotics and clinically used drugs [[1], [2], [3]].

Molecules from this class include chemotherapeutic anthracycline doxorubicin, enediyne C-1027, depsipeptide thiocoraline, and aurealic acid mithramycin [14]. These molecules are biosynthetically assembled by different enzymatic machinery and are structurally distinct from each other. It was found that the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of these compounds encode UvrA-like proteins that can confer self-protection to the producers. Examples include DrrC from the daunorubicin BGC [15], Ecm16 from the echinomycin BGC [16], and MtrX from the mithramycin BGC [17] (Fig. 1). Canonical UvrA is part of the UvrABCD nucleotide excision repair (NER) system [18]. UvrA participates in the initial ATP-dependent DNA scanning and damage recognition through direct UvrA-DNA interactions. This is followed by the recruitment of UvrB and UvrC for nucleotide excision. Although the detailed self-resistance mechanism of the UvrA-like protein family is still not fully understood, preliminary studies of DrrC and Ecm16 suggested that they also depend on ATP for their normal functions [19]. However, unlike canonical UvrA, they lack a UvrB-binding domain and can render self-protection independent of the host UvrABC system.Fig. 1Selected antitumor microbial natural products that target DNA through noncovalent interactions.

For the subsequent glycosylation steps, the four glycosyltransferases (TimGI/GII/GIII/GIV) are expected to catalyze the formation of five glycosidic bonds, which are analogous to those of the mithramycin and chromomycin pathways. More specifically, TimGIV and TimGIII, which are similar to CmmGIV (57% identity) and CmmGIII (53% identity) from the chromomycin pathway (Table S4), are assumed to sequentially transfer sugar C (by TimGIV), sugar D (by TimGIII), and sugar E (by TimGIV) to the aglycon, whereas TimGI and TimGII, which are more closely related to CmmGI (53% identity) and CmmGII (52% identity), are suggested to install sugars A and B, respectively. As the last steps in timmycin biosynthesis, the sugar O-methyltransferase TimF and the two acyltransferases TimKI and TimKII could further tailor the sugar moieties through methylation and acylations.Fig. 5The proposed biosynthetic pathway of timmycins.Fig. 5", "Fig. 5The proposed biosynthetic pathway of timmycins.Fig. 5", "Fig. 5The proposed biosynthetic pathway of timmycins.Fig. 5", "Fig. 5The proposed biosynthetic pathway of timmycins.Fig. 5", "The proposed biosynthetic pathway of timmycins.", "The proposed biosynthetic pathway of timmycins.", "The proposed biosynthetic pathway of timmycins.", "Biological activities of timmycins", "Biological activities of timmycins", "Biological activities of timmycins", "We next tested the antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of timmycins (Table 1, Table 2).

This method is based on the previous observation that the biosynthetic gene clusters of natural DNA intercalators encode a family of UvrA-like proteins for self-resistance, indicating the potential of the uvrA-like gene as a genetic marker to guide the identification of BGCs for new DNA intercalators. As a proof of concept, we successfully isolated a new tetracycline-type DNA intercalator, timmycin, from an Actinomadura strain. Although self-resistance gene-guided genome mining approaches have been described previously, this is the first time that the uvrA-like gene family is used for the targeted isolation of microbial bioactive metabolites. Considering that hundreds of new uvrA-like gene-containing BGCs were identified in this study, our genome mining strategy has great potential for the discovery of novel anticancer drug candidates.", "In this study, we developed a new genome mining strategy for the targeted discovery of bacteria-derived antitumor agents.
