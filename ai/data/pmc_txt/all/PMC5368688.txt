 This review focuses entirely on the
natural bengamides and selected
synthetic analogues that have inspired decades of research. Bengamide
A was first reported in 1986 from the sponge Jaspis cf. coriacea, and bengamide-containing sponges
have been gathered from many biogeographic sites. In 2005, a terrestrial
Gram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus virescens, was
added as a source for bengamides. Biological activity data using varying
bengamide-based scaffolds has enabled fine-tuning of structure–activity
relationships. Molecular target finding contributed to the creation
of a synthetic “lead” compound, LAF389, that was the
subject of a phase I anticancer clinical trial. Despite clinical trial
termination, the bengamide compound class is still attracting worldwide
attention. Future breakthroughs based on the bengamide scaffold are
possible and could build on their nanomolar in vitro and positive
in vivo antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties. Bengamide
molecular targets include methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP1 and MetAP2)
and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
(NF-κB). A mixed PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster appears
to be responsible for creation of the bengamides. This review highlights
that the bengamides have driven inspirational studies and that they
will remain relevant for future research, even 30 years after the
discovery of the first structures. Introduction Introduction The study of structurally unique small
molecules of the bengamide
class, first isolated from coral reef sponges, has been ongoing throughout
the world for more than three decades. The bengamide chronicle is
an example of research sustained by seeking new knowledge and outcomes
parallel to those realized from the chemical study of terrestrial
biota. The discovery of the bengamides illustrates that the shift
to examining the marine environment was a productive avenue for uncovering
biosynthetic products new to science and not discoverable from terrestrial
species. Such results have stimulated many laboratories to engage
in and develop the field of marine natural products. We view the finding
and continued study of the bengamides as a milestone in a subject
area rooted in part in the quest to build on past lessons learned
from studying communities of rainforest trees and microorganisms.
The research on the bengamides began through bioactivity-guided probing
of coral reef sponge metabolites and has been extended by examining
bengamide-producing terrestrial microorganisms. We predict and discuss
herein how such research will also continue into the future, driven
by the use of molecular genetic tools to examine the sponge and its
microbial associants for output of this compound class. The study of structurally unique small

and
chemical biology studies of bengamide analogues through isolation,
total synthesis, and biosynthetic engineering is the basis for this
review. The bengamides are headed by bengamide A (C31H56N2O8) and bengamide B (C32H58N2O8). These compounds were originally
isolated and described at the University of California, Santa Cruz
(UCSC), in the early 1980s1a−1d during research on an abundant Indo-Pacific marine
sponge, Jaspis cf. coriacea. Interestingly,
the lead molecules of this class have a ratio of C/(N + O) = 3.1 in
a framework containing six chiral centers. The bengamide molecule
consists of a fused polyketide and amino acid moieties,1e and a current awareness similarity search in
SciFinder (Chemical Abstracts Service, Columbus, OH, USA) reveals
more than 221 structures, most of which are synthetic bengamide analogues. The story of the structure elucidation, biosynthetic makeup,

the Sarabia laboratory.2 We believe it
is important to trace the pathway from discovery to therapeutic development
of the bengamides. The bengamide total structures were first proposed
and justified by a combination of NMR analyses, semisynthesis, and
formation of chiral derivatives. Subsequently, the structural hypothesis
was tested and verified through chiral total synthesis.3 In this review we will touch on how structure
elucidation methods and molecular biology-targeted approaches can
intersect to provide unexpected insights and prompt questions for
future investigations. Another goal is to illustrate the complex and
often tortuous path of investigating compounds isolated from sponges
for which the true producers may be a consortium rather than a single
macro- or microorganism. Our focus is very different from a review published in 2014 by

Leads Bengamide and Other Sponge Products as New
Medicinal Chemistry
Leads Marine natural products research begun in the 1970s
at UCSC was
mostly discovery driven, and the intent was to focus on sponges. After
much trial-and-error, the bengamides were discovered through a productive
academic–industry collaboration (established in 1984) between
the Crews laboratory at UCSC and that of Thomas R. Matthews, Ph.D.,
and his co-workers at the Institute of Antiviral and Antimicrobial
Chemotherapy at Syntex Research, Inc., Palo Alto, California. The
initial aim was to employ antiparasitic primary assays to screen Indo-Pacific
sponge extracts. A number of antiparasitic compounds were subsequently
purified and evaluated including the bengamides and bengazoles.4 The process involved aggressive compound purification
to jumpstart the nascent program seeking to overlay marine natural
products and pharmaceutical research. Today, the bengamides, for which
the names were inspired by the collection location for this sponge
[the Beqa Lagoon of Fiji (pronounced “benga”; still
considered to be among the world’s premier barrier reefs)],
continue to attract widespread interest as unique marine-derived molecular
probes and therapeutic leads. In addition to anticancer activity in
humans, the bengamides function as inhibitors of methionine aminopeptidase
(MetAPs 1 and 2) and have also been shown to target the NF-κB
pathway with the potential to function as potent and selective anti-inflammatory
agents. Marine natural products research begun in the 1970s

represent wonderful
study targets to initiate and extend multidisciplinary studies. Several
facets of our work on the sponges producing bengamides are useful
to briefly discuss because they illustrate general situations encountered
by other research teams. Most of the initial stages of work on sponges,
especially those producing bengamides, begin in Nature and sometimes
in remote locations. Sponges rich in bengamide constituents are sessile,
often prolific (in some but not all environments), have distinct recognizable
morphologies (see discussion below), and are easily collected by scuba
divers having a correct knowledge of their natural history. The physical
characteristics of chemically rich sponges also suggest interesting
roles for their constituent small-molecule products. Such sponges
will grow toward one another but not on top of each other, and few
organisms, with the exception of some nudibranchs and angelfish, graze
on sponges despite their high visibility and inability to escape a
potential threat! Another fundamental hypothesis is that sponges possess
an innate defense mechanism that allows them to occupy and thrive
in a fiercely competitive environment. A sampling of chemical scaffold
diversity of sponge-derived molecules beyond the bengamide A and B
structures includes unusual nucleoside and amino acid derivatives,
polyketides, cyclic peptides, macrolides, cyclic polyethers, steroids
and sterols, terpenoids, glycosides, and heterocyclic compounds. Recent
reviews have been published reinforcing the power of the phylum Porifera
as a source of biosynthetic products. Sponges, such as those that produce the bengamides,

on using a few marine sponge products to treat diseases afflicting
humans. Summarized in Figure 1 are four significant sponge-derived/inspired molecules in
current use as medicines; however, the bengamides have not risen to

but
dropped from clinical trials. The current list of 12 such compounds
is shown in Figure 2, and one of these, LAF389 (10), was inspired by the
bengamide A scaffold. A more detailed discussion on the pre- and postclinical
trial developments of LAF389 and its congeners is deferred until later
in this review.11 As a prelude to this
topic it is important to note that clinical trials are often discontinued
due to either insufficient efficacy or off-target toxicity. In the
case of LAF389, a bengamide analogue derived by total synthesis, the
phase I trial was discontinued due to unanticipated cardiotoxicity.
In looking toward the next steps, another structurally different bengamide
derivative was synthesized in 2015 (Table 3, benzLAF389) and has demonstrated nanomolar cellular potency, high
metabolic stability, and in vivo antitumor efficacy at nontoxic doses
in a melanoma mouse model. The bengamides are among sponge-derived products evaluated

expeditions
to Indo-Pacific coral reef environments. The initial goal was straightforward
and involved developing a natural history understanding about abundant
coral reef sponges and then establishing which taxa were consistently
rich in natural products. Today, such an environmental sampling endeavor
would be jumpstarted by consulting guidebooks written by experts.
However, at that time, the resources to properly orient scientific
diver collection teams did not exist and only appeared around 1995–1996.26a−26c Our initial expeditions from 1980 to 1983 to the Kingdom of Tonga27 afforded disappointing results, prompting a
recalibration of the strategies used. After engaging in discussions
with marine ecologists, our focus was shifted to Fiji. We believed
that sponges from this ecological zone would be higher in diversity
than those of the former area. This assumption proved to be correct
and was verified during comparisons of the inventory of abundant sponge
specimens observed and/or collected during a total of five six-week
expeditions to both areas. In 1980, the UCSC chemistry team began conducting annual

(B) Papua New Guinea; (C) Indonesia. The beginning of the bengamide story can be traced to a brief
expedition
by the UCSC team to Fiji in 1983. The first environmental site we
visited containing Jaspis cf. coriacea was the Beqa lagoon, which was home to numerous colorful freestanding
and encrusting sponges of varying morphologies. In 1984, the UCSC
team returned to this location in search of an abundant encrusting
orange sponge observed the prior year. The material (shown in Figure 3) was found again
and collected, but at that juncture it was not clear if any novel
secondary metabolites would be isolated from this specimen. However,
as further discussed below, during biological screening work it was
clear that very bioactive compounds were present in this specimen.
Rapidly, bengamides A and B were obtainable in high yield, but it

sponge, discussed above, guided multiple follow-up expeditions to
many Indo-Pacific sites where this sponge could be obtained, and these
included several locations in Fiji (Beqa Lagoon, Somo Strait, Taveuni/Tasman

Metabolites of Jaspis cf. coriacea Over several decades of surveying biosynthetic products
from sponges
with the morphology shown in Figure 3, the UCSC team always found multiple bengamide analogues.1a,1b,1e However, when two additional
classes of nitrogen-containing metabolites were isolated during second-generation
studies, it became clear that additional biosynthetic machinery was
at work. These added frameworks, shown in Table 1, included the bengazoles and simple diketopiperazines.27−32 At first glance, it is obvious that the biosynthetic pathway producing
the bengamides must involve both polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal
peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules. This view has been fine-tuned in
recent years and will be discussed more thoroughly later in the review.
Clearly, the diketopiperazines are cyclic dipeptide adducts, while
the bengazoles are composed of two isoxazoles coupled to a chiral
triketide. Surprisingly, at this point, little is actually known about
the biosynthetic machinery that assembles the bengazoles. The patterns
shown in Table 1 intimate
that the pathways producing both compounds seem to be at work in many
different sponge species. Over several decades of surveying biosynthetic products

was recognized by others
once the UCSC results were published. Eventually seven other laboratories
collected and examined specimens and described findings (from 1994
to 2011) parallel to those published by UCSC. The bengamides and bengazoles
can be considered “signature” compounds, and overall
outcomes from the worldwide examination of sponges producing this
pair of substances are shown in Table 1. An interesting pattern appears within these data
because the “signature” compounds are produced either
by (a) eight different sponge species or (b) closely related sponges
for which the taxonomic assignments were not rigorously determined.
Overall, six of the eight identifications listed for the genera of Table 1 (coded by a) do not seem credible, as vague taxonomic descriptions
are contained in the experimental sections of these publications.
It appears that situation (a) is valid for the J. coriacea and J. carteri entries because voucher specimens were assessed side by side,1e and they were concluded to be distinct species.
In addition, inspection of the voucher specimen of Pachastrissa sp. supported its revision to the genus Jaspis,
but no conclusion about its actual species could be made.1e It is highly likely that the Fijian orange sponge
described as Dorypleres splendens (aka Jaspis
splendens) was misidentified as this species and is a reliable
source of jasplakinolides28 and not bengamides.
Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, the 2014 review on the bengamides2 incorrectly showed an underwater picture of J. splendens (and not that of J. coriacea) as the source organism
for the bengamides. This situation illustrates the difficulty in correlating

core scaffold possesses significant structural variety,
illustrating the versatile biosynthetic capabilities of these sponges
(listed in Table 1).29−33 To date, 21 different bengamide analogues have been isolated from
marine sponges and are listed in Table 2. Regular variation includes a free or methylated caprolactam
amide nitrogen (as in bengamides A and B, C and D, for example), variation
of the functional group, if present, on C-13 (R2 position),
and the presence or lack of an ester at C-5 (R3 position).
Bengamide K and isobengamide E fall outside of this regular classification:
bengamide K lacks the entire polyketide portion of the molecule and
instead possesses an N-formyl group, and isobengamide
E is a structural isomer of bengamide E in which the polyketide region
is attached to the side chain nitrogen of the caprolactam as opposed
to the traditional backbone nitrogen. Interestingly, the first compounds

A/B. A Timeline Rich in Discoveries A Timeline Rich in Discoveries There were two developments
responsible for propelling research
forward leading to the first publication of the bengamides. First
was the chemistry and pharmacology program noted above that began
in 1984 between Syntex and UCSC. Second was the UCSC campaign to collect
and evaluate sponges from coral reefs of the mid-South Pacific (also
initiated in 1984). The initial series of annual summer expeditions
to Fijian coral reefs were undertaken to provide extracts for parallel
biological and chemical evaluation. One of the most prized sponge
samples gathered during 1984–1985 (collection codes 84-20 [0.5
kg] and 85-09 [1.4 kg]) was “an abundant, finger-like orange
sponge, which is an undescribed member of the Jaspidae family”.1a Excitement grew for this project because the
crude extract (collection code 84-20) exhibited complete in vitro
cytotoxicity to larynx epithelial carcinoma cells at 1.0 μg/mL,
along with activity against the bacterium Streptococcus pyrogenes and the nematode Nippostrongylus braziliensis.
Poor yields obtained from the first extract necessitated examination
of re-collected material, which provided an extract subsequently concentrated
to an oil (7.4 g). Examination of this extract by 1H NMR
spectroscopy (CDCl3, 300 MHz) showed many signals including
prominent low-field diagnostic peaks: δ 5.78, 5.44, 4.60, 4.21;
all are assignable to regions of the bengamide structure core (see Figure 3 of ref (1e)). The promising initial
bioactivity and easily visualized signature 1H NMR peaks
portended significant therapeutic potential and provided an NMR handle
to identify members of the bengamide family that facilitated many
decades of continued discovery. A timeline appears in Figure 4 of the outcomes based on an
exploration trajectory including (a) examination of producing organisms,
(b) compound discovery, (c) evaluation for potential as a molecular
tool, (d) therapeutic development, and (e) formulating hypothesis
for compound biogenesis. There were two developments

not until 1992 that the UCSC team sent samples
of bengamides A, B, and P (see Table 2) for evaluation in vitro in the National Cancer Institute’s
(NCI) 60 cell line screen. The bengamides were found to have a unique
activity profile when compared to other agents in the NCI’s
database.1e This initial investigation
into the cytotoxicity properties of the bengamides elevated the class
to a high priority as a potential therapeutic lead and spurred further
investigation once a National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groups (NCDDG)
project was formalized with Sandoz in 1995. In the late 1990s, the
oncology department of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, in collaboration
with UCSC, confirmed that the bengamides possess significant antiproliferative
activity against transformed and nontransformed cells.34a,34b This was the beginning of the most dedicated exploration of the
bengamide class of compounds as potential commercial therapeutics.
The unveiling of the therapeutic potential of the bengamides sparked
an explosion of bengamide-related citations starting in the mid 1990s.

the time course for the publication of 94 papers from multiple laboratories
that all explore facets of the chemistry and biology of the bengamides.

Fiji were acquired in 19971e to further
therapeutic investigations at Novartis.
The sponge collections provided approximately 88 g of a crude mixture
of bengamides, afforded sufficient amounts of bengamides B, E, and
Z to test against MDA-MB-435 carcinoma cells grown as xenografts in
nude mice,35 and provided additional new
analogues such as bengamides M–R. The most significant outcome
of this preliminary study was the observation that bengamides with
a lipophilic ester moiety on the caprolactam (C-13/R2 position),
such as bengamides A, B, M, and O, are >100-fold more potent than
the nonesterified counterparts and that methylation of the caprolactam
nitrogen has little effect on in vitro potency. Significant re-collections of J. coriacea sponge from five different locations in

the very poor water solubility of bengamide B (0.002
ng/mL at pH 6.8) limited intravenous administration. This information,
coupled with a finite natural supply and a daunting 14-step, low-yielding
total synthesis, precluded bengamide B from further preclinical testing.
Insights gleaned from the systematic analysis of natural structures
and their bioactivities allowed for synthetic efforts to begin. This
effort was spearheaded by Kinder at the U.S. Novartis Institute for

was made possible by an optimized convergent large-scale chiral synthesis
carried out by the Process Research and Development team at Novartis.12 It involved seven linear steps and provided
the LAF389 polymorph E (133.6 g, mp 148–9 °C) in 79% yield.

including the bengamides, arise from genetically encoded processes.
By contrast, understanding of the true source organisms responsible
for the production of sponge-derived compounds continues to be unresolved.
Four distinct hypotheses have appeared in publications describing
the pathway responsible for the assembly of the bengamides, and these
are shown in Figure 6. An initial biosynthetic proposal appeared in 1989 and involved
dissection of the iso-bengamide E structure1c into three constitutive units: S-Lys-diketide-Leu.
The idea of a Leu moiety was favored over that involving a branched
ketide to explain the isopropyl-containing terminus. All chiral sponge-derived natural products,

A and E could be annotated with similar biosynthetic subunits.1e This was inspired by the experimental proof
showing that barbamide A36 arises from
the union of Leu-monoketide-Cys-Phe. In 2014, this 2001 analysis was
recycled in the Garcia-Ruiz and Sarabia2 review as shown by the entry in Figure 6 and a passage from that paper, “...biosynthetic
origin of the bengamides seems to be a result of a symbiotic interaction
between this class of sponges and bacteria...”. Alternatively,
in 2006 it seemed plausible to the Crews group that the insights of

proved to be rudimentary and in part an oversimplification. In 2015,
the Muller–Bronstrup team published the definitive results
that were described in Figure 4 of the paper.38 Molecular genetics
experiments resulted in isolation of the bengamide gene cluster (a
731 kDa protein of about 25 kbp and nine genes: coded BenA to BenG)
from cultures of the Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus virescens. This organism produces four bengamides (E/E′, F/F′)
and was isolated initially in 2005 from a terrestrial soil sample
by scientists at Sanofi Adventis,39 and
subsequently a sample of this strain was obtained and cultured at
UCSC.40 The idea of a polyketide-nonribosomal
peptide hybrid as being responsible for the production of the bengamides
was validated, as was the assumption that a lysine unit was incorporated
late in the pathway. Totally stunning was the finding that the entire
gene cluster could be transferred into a more robust myxobacterial
host, Myxococcus xanthus, to yield bengamide analogues
in yields up to 5–10 mg/L. The success of three different groups
in obtaining useable yields of bengamides from laboratory culturing
of Gram-negative microorganisms is an important development.38−40 It also sets the stage for future investigations of the microbiome

this juncture, it is tempting to conclude an organism related
to the so-called “metabolically talented” bacterium
endosymbiont Entotheonella, believed to be responsible
for the production of many mixed biogenetic molecules isolated from Theonella sponges,41a could also
be at work in producing the bengamides. The current state of understanding

relationship (SAR) cytotoxicity trends can be divided into four different
categories (see Table 2) according to substitution patterns on the caprolactam. The groupings
depend on the presence or absence of functional groups shown on the
general structure at the top of Table 2 as follows: type I, lipophilic esters attached at
R2, headed by bengamides A and B; type II, polyketide esters

no substituent at R2, headed by bengamides E and F, and
type IV, attached to the caprolactam ring nitrogen, exclusively as
iso-bengamide E.1e While most of the preclinical
development and subsequent phase I clinical trial work was focused
on the type I scaffold, important initial insights were gained by
examining in vitro IC50 potencies of structures from the
type III category. A first key overview on functionality and configurations
required for optimal in vitro activity within type III is shown in

on the type I scaffold, important initial insights were gained by
examining in vitro IC50 potencies of structures from the
type III category. A first key overview on functionality and configurations
required for optimal in vitro activity within type III is shown in
the boxed structure at the bottom of Figure 7. Figure 7SAR cytotoxicity activity patterns for 5R,6S,7R,8R-bengamide E and
selected analogues provide a landscape for many lessons learned. Figure 7SAR cytotoxicity activity patterns for 5R,6S,7R,8R-bengamide E and

features in the type III bengamide
scaffold that impart activity, or inactivity, can be assessed from
examining a selection of 10 type III structures shown in Figure 7.1e,3,38,42−48 Compounds with single-digit nanomolar or subnanomolar activity against
MDA-MB-435 or HCT-116 tumor cell lines represent important inputs
for the design of a potential clinical candidate. Alternatively, minor
modifications of the polyketide OCH3 group, changing the
absolute configurations at positions C-5 to C-8, or replacing the
caprolactam with unoptimized subunits can be disastrous. In this regard,
the following structures comprise the set of potent entities and include
(a) a natural E3,4-bengamide (IC50 = 3.8 nM)/synthetic
Z3,4-bengamide E not shown in Figure 7 (IC50 = 14 nM45); (b) the 5S,6R,7S,8S synthetic bengamide E (IC50 = 4 nM); (c) a benzene-fused synthetic analogue (IC50 = 9 nM); (d) cyclopentyl-substituted synthetic bengamide E (IC50 = 0.4 nM45); and (e) the synthetic
N-substituted bengamide E (IC50 = 4 nM). There are several
remarkable features associated with these data including the following:
(i) the methoxy group at position 8 is essential; (ii) one entry represents
the most potent in-vitro-active (IC50 = 0.4 nM) bengamide
analogue ever examined; (iii) carbon atoms at positions 11–13
can be deleted (but only when the ring nitrogen has also been modified),
as shown by comparing the trio of compounds at the bottom of Figure 7; and (iv) benzene
ring annulation to C-13 or C-14 can be beneficial. An appreciation of structural

to revisit a fundamental conclusion discussed above
for the polyketide side chain and highlighted in the box of Figure 7. The in vitro nanomolar
IC50 value activity can be greatly diminished by small
changes in the configurations of the side chain attached at C-10.
Similar potency is observed for 5R,6S,7R,8R,10S (natural
bengamide E IC50 = 3.8 nM) and 5S,6R,7S,8S,10S (synthetic bengamide E diastereomer, IC50 = 4 nM), but
no activity is observed for 5S,6R,7S,8S,10R (synthetic ent-bengamide E, HCT115 IC50 > 50 μM).
The results in the report on ent-bengamide E48 are curious. First, the activity for bengamide
E vs HCT-116 IC50 = 600 nM indicates potency but not on
par with data against MDA-MB-435 (see Figure 7). Second, the activity parameters for ent-bengamide E vs those for the 5S,6R,7S,8S,10S bengamide E diastereomer are dramatically different and merit further
investigations. The key requirement of the 5R,6S,7R,8R,10S configuration for potency in the type III structures served as a
starting point in all SAR studies of the type I analogues. The ester-bearing
type I compounds are supremely active and are headed by the 1–2
nM activity of bengamides A and B against MDA-MB-435 cells. As discussed
in detail below, this was the scaffold chosen for development in the
phase I clinical trial. Highlights of the additional structure–activity
relationships from type I compounds are shown in the box of Figure 8.The most important
new insights involve the SAR impact of chemical space changes in two
regions: (a) O vs N substitution at C-13 and (b) deletion of the caprolactam
ring while retaining the myristate. It is important

I bengamides
against MDA-MB-435 human tumors were carefully examined by Kinder
et al.35 and were the basis for selecting
LAF389 for the phase I clinical trial. Examining the original data
for the 17 compounds shown in the Kinder publication (Figure 1 and Tables 2 and 3) is essential.
Relative to bengamide B, there were two structural changes: (a) replacement
of isopropyl with tert-butyl and (b) retention or
inversion of the 15-myristoyloxy with 14 other ester arrays. These
results led to the important conclusion “...over 2/3 of the
analogues...inhibited in vivo tumor growth as well as or better than
that of bengamide B...”. This prompted an extensive investigation
of the antitumor properties of LAF389. Trends for in vitro and in vivo responses of type

to the SAR understanding that was accumulated
for type I analogues. The essential role of the ester attached at
C-13 was discussed above, and, relative to the potency of tert-butyl bengamide (13R) (IC50 = 10 nm), there were nine compounds with similar potencies. Overall,
modification of the myristoyl ester is generally well tolerated, as
long as the ester and a sufficient number of aliphatic carbons are
present, which presumably increases membrane permeability. Alternatively,
replacement of the C-13 ester with an amide (bengamde A 13S amide) obliterates activity.47 Dramatic reduction of potency was observed with the synthetic compound
of Figure 8 (IC50 = 190 nm), where the myristoyl ester is retained but the
ring is opened.48−52 There is another dimension

trial took many years of bench-scale syntheses, where its chiral total
synthesis was optimized to be safe and convergent. The important next
step involved development of a large-scale pilot-plant-type synthesis.12 This task proceeded via a key modification that
used a modified Julia olefination50 rather
than the formerly employed Takai procedure.51 Conversion of the olefinic isopropyl group in the natural sponge-derived
bengamide compounds to a tert-butyl group, as in
LAF389, was a strategic, common modification that greatly increased
synthetic yields in the olefination reaction and had little effect
on activity.12,35 The journey to designate the lead compound, LAF389 (10, Figure 2), for clinical

ester that is hydrolyzed intracellularly
to the alcohol.11 Interestingly, the in
vivo potency of the alcohol is lower than that of LAF389, presumably
based on the increased membrane permeability of the lipophilic cyclohexyl
ester. LAF389 was found to have comparable activity to bengamide B
and bengamide Z in vitro and superior activity in vivo, causing significant
tumor regression at 100 μmol/kg during preclinical investigation.
Animal studies demonstrated that repeat bolus administration of LAF389
was effective and well tolerated, and thus, in 2000, the phase I clinical
investigation of LAF389 began.11 LAF389 possesses a labile

and pharmacokinetic profile of LAF389 and to determine the maximum
tolerated dose.11 Patients were those with
a histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced cancer for whom
no standard therapy existed. LAF389 was provided by Novartis Pharma
(Basel, Switzerland) as a 30 mg/mL solution in propylene glycol, which
was diluted 30 times with saline to afford a 1 mg/mL solution and
administered intravenously or via a central indwelling catheter as
a slow bolus injection. A total of 33 patients were treated from May
2000 to April 2002, and 31 of these patients reported adverse effects.
Additionally, eight patients suffered unexpected cardiovascular toxicity
not predicted by preclinical testing in rats and dogs. The phase I
clinical investigation of LAF389 was terminated for safety considerations
together with the lack of clear evidence of clinical effectiveness. Phase I study began in 2000 with assessment of the safety, tolerability,

Targets of the Bengamides Molecular
Targets of the Bengamides By 2001, it was clear that the
natural bengamides, especially A/B
(MDA-MB-435 IC50 = 1.0/2.4 nM) and a synthetic bengamide,
LAF389 (MDA-MB-435 IC50 = 40 nM), were exquisitely potent
against cancer cell lines.1e An important
next study of these promising therapeutic leads involved molecular
target identification guided by proteomics. The experimental design
was successful and involved challenging H1299 human non-small-cell
lung carcinoma cells with bengamide E and LAF389.53 Gel electrophoresis (2D) showed modulation of the family
of 14-3-3 γ proteins in comparison to that of untreated cells.
Specifically, the 14-3-3 γ family of ubiquitous cytosolic proteins
lacked N-terminal processing due to the retention of the initiator
methionine, suggesting that LAF389 reduced the activity of methionine
aminopeptidases (MetAP). Experimental and in silico binding experiments
involving human MetAP2 and bengamide analogues were also carried out
as shown in Figure 9. Panel B shows a nice fit of LAF389 in a putative binding pocket.
More definitive insights came from cocrystallization studies shown
in Figure 9 (panel
C), which involved the bengamide analogue LAF153 and provided visualization
of the interaction between the three OH groups and the dicobalt moiety
in the active site. Eventually, it was demonstrated that LAF389 nonselectively
inhibited both isoforms of human methionine aminopeptidases, MetAP1
(IC50 = 0.7 μM) and MetAP2 (IC50 = 0.4
μM). A surprising outcome was that another synthetic bengamide,
LBM648 (Figure 9),
was MetAP2 selective [MetAP1 (>10 μM) and MetAP2 (IC50 = 0.38 μM)].55 Additional
second-generation
experiments54 were driven by siRNA depletion
of MetAP2 without inhibition of endothelial cell growth. The conclusion
advanced by Phillips et al. in 2004 that “MetAP2 function is
not required for endothelial cell proliferation”54 implies that the idea the MetAP2 inhibition
is not the full story and that further target finding experiments
are needed. By 2001, it was clear that the

later.53 Liu and co-workers believed that
MetAP1 may
also be an important cancer target and have suggested (unpublished)
that small molecules selective for MetAP1 vs MetAP2 might represent
a better therapeutic lead. This team used natural bengamides (A, B,
G, M, N, O) to probe the downstream physiological functions of MetAPs.53 Interesting results were obtained during the
IC50 profiling of this set against MetAP1 vs MetAP2 as
follows: (a) similar IC50 μM data were observed for
bengamide A vs B (M1 vs M2 bengamide A = 2, 11; bengamide B = 29,
18, and (b) selectivity was observed against MetAP1 (M1 vs M2 bengamide
O = 3, >50). These results demonstrated MetAP1 selectivity. Overall,
these results are similar to those (see above) obtained by Phillips
et al.54 for LAF389 (MetAP unselective)
but different than that observed for LBM648 (MetAP2 selective). It
was also shown that nonselective inhibition of MetAPs by bengamide
A alters the subcellular concentrations of the proto-oncogene c-Src, which is essential for tumor growth. Bengamide A
significantly decreased the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src and caused a delay in cell cycle progression through the G-2/M phase.
As a final important conclusion, the Liu team stated, “c-Src...dysfunction is likely to account for the cell cycle
effects of MetAP inhibitors including bengamide A.” Examined
in a separate section below are key SAR effects of a variety of bengamides;
the outcomes of this work are essential for the creation of effective

about the modulation of both human and bacterial MetAPs by the bengamides.
The reader is directed to an interesting quote contained in a 2015 Angewandte Chemie press release shown in the bottom of Figure 10. The complex network
of structures, arrows, and boxes below this quotation can be explained
as follows. After the discovery that the bengamides are also produced
by the terrestrial myxobacterium Myxococcus virescens ST200611 (DSM 15898),38−40 a campaign to supply bengamides
by fermentation was launched, resulting in elucidation of the responsible
biosynthetic gene cluster.38 Further analysis
of the biosynthetic pathway showed that Leu154 of the myxobacterial
MetAP confers bacterial self-resistance to bengamide inhibition via
steric hindrance. The entire gene cluster was then successfully transferred
to a robust strain of M. xanthus DK1622 for
large-scale fermentation. Subsequent semisynthesis of microbially
produced bengamides and total synthesis yielded the optimized bengamide
derivative benzLAF389 (Table 3). This new clinical candidate
exhibits nanomolar potency, high metabolic stability, and an improved
pharmacokinetic profile. Moderate in vivo efficacy (T/C = 31% at the
highest nontoxic dose) was demonstrated in a murine tumor bearing
model (early stage B16 melanoma) with a limited therapeutic window
between toxicity and antitumor efficacy. A collection of several recent papers provides some new understandings

and both belong to type 1 MetAPs. Seven MetAP inhibitors were designed
and synthesized based on natural bengamides and tested against purified
tubercular MetAPs, and some also demonstrated initial antitubercular
activity.55 Two of the newly designed inhibitors
were complexed with MtMetAP1c to elucidate the binding
mode and to optimize inhibitor design. In subsequent work, three new
X-ray structures of MtMetAP1c in complex with two
different inhibitors in the Mn(II) form and the Ni(II) form were presented.56 Four of the seven designed MetAP inhibitors
were also complexed with a human MetAP1 (HsMetAP1)
in the Mn(II) form, and the X-ray structures were solved at high resolution
(1.47–1.75 Å).57 The binding
mode of the bengamide derivatives in these four structures is significantly
different from the previous HsMetAP1 structures in
the protein databank. Overall, the structural information gleaned
from studies of the interactions of the various inhibitors at the
active sites in the five X-ray structures of tubercular MtMetAP1c and the four X-ray structures of human HsMetAP1 has provided additional important insights for the design
of bengamide inhibitors with improved selectivity and potency in both
antibacterial and anticancer applications.58 Another potential application
for bengamide derivatives is the
treatment of tuberculosis, a disease caused in humans mainly by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Unlike eukaryotic cells, most
bacteria have only a single essential MetAP gene (type 1) that may
serve as a target for the development of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

the
bengamide molecular targets. A UC Santa Cruz–UC Berkeley collaboration
identified the bengamides as an interesting new class of immune modulators
through use of a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) luciferase
assay.40 The bengamides showed comparable
or superior activity to the known NF-κB inhibitor celastrol
(Table 3 of ref (40)). NF-κB has also
been implicated in the development and metastasis of some human cancers.59 The bengamides may thus prove to be a valuable
new scaffold for the development of treatments of immune disorders
and cancers that are shown to have elevated NF-κB activity. There is yet another development in the quest to fully define

the initial discovery of the bengamides was made possible through

results arose through the UCSC–Novartis collaboration, leading
to the description of in vitro nanomolar active bengamides eventually
shown to have in vivo efficacy. A three-way collaboration between
UCSC, UC Berkeley, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center revealed NF-κB
as a molecular target of the bengamides. Recently, the collaboration

the study of 21 natural analogues from sponges (shown in Table 2) and were augmented
by the four additional compounds isolated by the culture of Myxococcus virescens (DSM 15898), a Gram-negative bacterium.38−40 There are approximately 116 non-natural bengamides, reviewed by
Garcia-Ruiz and Sarabia2 and prepared during
campaigns to test innovations in total organic synthesis, verify hypotheses
of absolute configuration assignments, and expand the understanding
of SAR patterns. Added to this are greater than 50 bengamides that

compound libraries, could the trajectory of obtaining useful findings
be at an end? Possibly, but new opportunities offered by molecular
genetics studies may provide some fresh stimuli, especially from insights
on the bengamide E/F biosynthetic machinery.38,40 The recent characterization from Myxococcusvirescens of the bengamide gene cluster provides powerful
insights about how this process proceeds and could be further manipulated.38 The first biosynthetic step involves (see Figure 11) loading of a
2-methylbutyrl-CoA starter unit, which is subsequently modified by
a BenA–D assembly of the key glycolate unit and further transformed
by BenE–H. This latter cassette installs the functionality
and chirality at bengamide positions C-5 to C-8 required for nanomolar
bioactivity (see Figures 7 and 8). Synthetic biology efforts
envisioning the creation of modifications in this region using BenE–H
that can be expressed in a different host (see Figure 11) were explored, but without success.38 After decades of exploration using the natural material and

opportunities that could
provide the next generation of discoveries. Disentangling toxic side
effects from the therapeutic advantages associated with the MetAp
target of the bengamides continues to be a challenge. The MetAP isoforms,
1 and 2, are present in all eukaryotic cells and catalyze N-terminal
methionine excision, an essential pathway of cotranslational protein
maturation. There is intense interest and debate about how to exploit
compounds that inhibit these enzymes for drug development. In 2013,
Liu et al. highlighted the MetAP–bengamide situation with the
following analysis: “...the clinical study of...LAF389 in patients
with advanced cancer was terminated due to its cardiovascular toxicity,
which might be caused by the simultaneous inhibition of MetAP1 and
MetAP2”.60 A current hypothesis
is that compounds selective for MetAP1 over MetAP2 will be successful
as nontoxic therapeutics. The reproducible MetAP inhibition IC50 data in Table 3 for bengamide A and LAF389 provide the benchmark data illustrating
that both MetAPs are inhibited equally by both compounds. In contrast,
there are natural products and synthetic compounds that have been
identified with selectivity against each MetAP isoform. The list of
potential examples is growing, and some are summarized in Table 3 including (a) MetAP2
selective: LBM648, fumagillin,49 and its
analogue beloranib (not shown) and (b) MetAP1 selective: bengamide
O, IV-43 (aka ZNQ-6),49 and piperazinquinazoline.61 The fumagillin analogue beloranib, a MetAP2
angiogenesis inhibitor, was recently (July 2016) withdrawn from a
phase III clinical trial (antiobesity) by Zafgen because of two patient
deaths possibly due to the drug treatment. An obvious path forward
is to now focus on MetAP1-selective agents with nanomolar cytotoxicity
properties, and bengamide O is a potential example. It is tempting to speculate on additional

metabolic stability and pharmacophore redesign will be
essential for future bengamide therapeutic lead development. The Muller
group38 has created a vision of the ideal
future clinical candidate and has proposed a compound shown in Table 3, named here as benzLAF389.
This compound exhibited nanomolar cellular potency, improved pharmacokinetic
properties, good metabolic stability, and promising in vivo activity
in a mouse model. However, the MetAP selectivity of this compound
is currently unknown. Shifting the focus back to type III bengamide
structures that do not possess the labile ester moiety, headed by
bengamide E/E′, also merits consideration. Several examples
of bengamide analogues that bind to MtMetAP1 and
also possess reduced pharmacophore complexity are shown at the bottom
of Figure 10. The
obvious next steps for this chemical space is to assess their in vitro
cytotoxicity and measure MetAP selectivity. It is important to note
that a complete understanding of the various methionine aminopeptidase
isoforms in humans and in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their role(s) as anticancer or antitubercular targets is still
under investigation. A current awareness search in the Chemical Abstracts
Service Sci-Finder tool on the topic “MetAP” revealed
899 peer-reviewed publications and patents, and there were 30 citations
from the year 2016 alone. We conclude that the relevance of this target
and how to harness it for drug discovery is still evolving at a rapid
pace. Increased

circumstance involving
the bengamide family of PKS–NRPS hybrid natural products first
published in 1986. Overall, these moderately complex compounds have
provided excellent opportunities for multidisciplinary natural products
discovery and development projects. Work to build on the initial bengamide
structure elucidation reports began quickly in many laboratories because
the absolute configuration of the six chiral centers and the geometry
of the double bond were accurately established at the outset. Subsequently,
numerous total synthetic and medicinal chemistry efforts provided
the basis for LAF389, the phase I anticancer clinical candidate. In this review, we have highlighted a special

and bengamide synthetics suggest that, in the next decade, a new analogue
will be included among the successful sponge-inspired therapeutics
shown in Figure 1.
However, the trajectory for such an outcome can be lengthy. For example,
it took 26 years to capitalize on the discovery of halichondrin B,
isolated from the sponge Halichondria okadai and
published in 1985. Its structure paved the way to the creation of
eribulin mesylate (aka Halaven), which was approved by the U.S. FDA
in 2010 as a clinical anticancer agent. The process to develop marine
natural products with significant biological activity and structural
complexity into useful entities, such as a molecular tools and therapeutics,
takes patience, persistence, and luck. Setbacks always arise and must
be overcome. In the case of eribulin mesylate, early supply problems
and poor understanding about its true pharmacophore were dealt with
through heroic synthetic optimization endeavors. We are hopeful for
the same outcome in the coming years with the bengamides, but time
could be running out. The persistent interest and continued investigations of the bengamides

an understanding of the
natural history of the bengamide-producing sponge provides an example
of how such insights can overcome challenges involved in collecting
or re-collecting specimens that possess important biosynthetic products.
Grappling with the distinctive sponge phenotypes and features in the
environment near Jaspis cf. coriacea has not been easy. Many of the publications on the bengamides contain
evidence that the scientific divers involved in those projects were
not fully versed on how to collect and properly assign the taxa of
bengamide-containing sponges. In this review we have attempted to
set the record straight. Our review also highlights the value of collaboration
among teams located at various institutions, in this case academic
research groups, the National Cancer Institute’s Developmental
Therapeutics Program (NCI-DTP), Syntex, Sandoz, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Corporation. Another factor stimulating bengamide research discoveries

mining genomic
data extended discoveries and provided valuable insights into the
assembly of the bengamides. These methods allowed for the advancement
of knowledge from the initial 1989 hypothetical analysis of the biosynthetic
pathway to the impressive 2015 elucidation of the true biosynthetic
gene cluster (BGC). The new in-depth understanding of this pathway
will advance bengamide research as well as that generally focused
on the origin of polyketide–nonribosomal peptide hybrid compounds.
The successful transfer of the bengamide BGC to a robust production

to the bengamide
story are massive. Approximately 200 synthetic bengamide analogues
have been created and evaluated against cancer cell lines, allowing
for a detailed SAR scenario to be constructed. The SAR has been significantly
buttressed by several (at least 10) cocrystal structures of bengamide

off-target effects encountered were very unfortunate, but recent developments
in predictive model systems using various cell types to test candidate
compounds will help to alleviate this problem in the future. Predicting

and a novel cyclic amino acid residue merge in the bengamide class
to produce a beautiful molecular framework. Paired with meaningful
results in MetAP and NF-κB activity screens, the bengamides
remain attractive lead compounds for therapeutic discovery, molecular
biology, and biosynthetic research endeavors. It is for this reason
that today, more than three decades after the UCSC team of Quinoa,
Adamczeski, and Crews initiated the first phase in the bengamide structure
elucidation, this family persists in inspiring research ventures.
The interesting natural history of the sponges, the isolation of a
bengamide-producing bacterium, and the elucidation of the biosynthetic
production mechanisms add depth and new applications to this powerful
story of natural products discovery. The authors are confident that
the record of meaningful findings is not complete. In particular,
new samples of Jaspis cf. coriacea will undoubtedly be obtained and pursued for molecular genetics
experiments. Thus, the bengamides will continue to endure as an inspiration
