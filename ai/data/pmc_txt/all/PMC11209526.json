Fumonisins are presumed virulence factors of plant pathogens, but may also play a role in interactions between competing fungi. We observed higher resistance to added fumonisin B1 (FB1) in fumonisin-producing Fusarium verticillioides than in nonproducing F. graminearum, and likewise between isolates of Aspergillus and Alternaria differing in production of sphinganine-analog toxins. It has been reported that in F. verticillioides, ceramide synthase encoded in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster is responsible for self-resistance. We reinvestigated the role of FUM17 and FUM18 by generating a double mutant strain in a fum1 background. Nearly unchanged resistance to added FB1 was observed compared to the parental fum1 strain. A recently developed fumonisin-sensitive baker\u2019s yeast strain allowed for the testing of candidate ceramide synthases by heterologous expression. The overexpression of the yeast LAC1 gene, but not LAG1, increased fumonisin resistance. High-level resistance was conferred by FUM18, but not by FUM17. Likewise, strong resistance to FB1 was caused by overexpression of the presumed F. verticillioides \u201chousekeeping\u201d ceramide synthases CER1, CER2, and CER3, located outside the fumonisin cluster, indicating that F. verticillioides possesses a redundant set of insensitive targets as a self-resistance mechanism.", "Key Contribution", "Using a recently described fumonisin-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, evidence has been obtained that not only one FUM cluster-encoded ceramide synthase gene (FUM18), but also CER1, CER2, and CER3 of F. verticillioides encode insensitive enzymes involved in fumonisin self-resistance.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Sphingolipids are abundant in the membranes of eukaryotes but also exist in some prokaryotes [1]. In eukaryotes, they are involved in processes like membrane trafficking, cell signaling, apoptosis, and others. Furthermore, disturbances in sphingolipid metabolism have been implicated in a variety of human diseases [2]. The sphingolipid core structure consists of a long acyl chain amide, which is linked to a fatty acid by ceramide synthase [3]. The long chain base in animal ceramides is sphingosine, while in plants and fungi, sphingolipid biosynthesis starts by the condensation of the tri-hydroxylated long chain base phytosphingosine with an alpha-hydroxylated very long chain fatty acid [4]. Phosphosphingolipids have a polar headgroup linked to ceramide via a phosphodiester bond. Highly complex structures [5,6] exist in different organisms with different roles due to the attachment of inositol(-phosphates) and different sugar moieties.", "Sphingolipids are abundant in the membranes of eukaryotes but also exist in some prokaryotes [1].

The double mutant lag1 lac1 is lethal in most yeast strains. The FUM17 plasmid did not complement the conditional yeast mutant [31] when doxycycline was added in order to switch off the expression of the integrated tetracycline-regulated promoter PTET-LAG1 gene in the \u0394lac1 background. In agreement with this finding, we did not observe increased resistance compared to the empty vector in our sensitive yeast strain. It has been reported that FUM17 is obviously non-functional in two other strains of the F. fujikuroi species complex [41], and more subtle mutations may also lead to the inactivity of the F. verticillioides FUM17 gene product. While FUM18 is sufficient to confer resistance in yeast, it is surprisingly not necessary for the high-level resistance to FB1 in F. verticillioides. The knockout mutants (fum17-18 double mutant, similar to that described but with a different selection marker, fum17-18\u0394::HSVtk-nptII) in the fum1::hygB background are hardly inhibited in growth on solid medium by added FB1 (Figure 3). The observed effect of inactivating the cluster ceramide synthases on FB1-mediated growth inhibition is minor, but unexpectedly, differences in the amount and timing of pigment formation were observed between independent fum1 fum17-18 and fum1 mutants. Since both strains are fum1 mutants, this should not be due to an alteration of the metabolic flux from fumonisin into a different metabolite that is responsible for this phenotype. Further research would be necessary to elucidate which changes occur at the level of the transcriptome or metabolome. The result that FUM18 is not necessary for fumonisin resistance can be explained by our finding that other ceramide synthases of F. verticillioides also confer high-level resistance in yeast. A surprising result is the high level of resistance conferred by CER3 (FVEG_15375), as it was reported that this gene is not able to complement the yeast ceramide synthase\u2019s loss of function [41].
