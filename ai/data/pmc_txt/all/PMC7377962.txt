Several nucleoside antibiotics are structurally characterized by a 5′′-amino-5′′-deoxyribose (ADR) appended via a glycosidic bond to a high-carbon sugar nucleoside, (5′S,6′S)-5′-C-glycyluridine (GlyU). GlyU is further modified with an N-alkylamine linker, the biosynthetic origins of which have yet to be established. By using a combination of feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors and characterization of recombinant proteins from multiple pathways, the biosynthetic mechanism for N-alkylamine installation for ADR-GlyU-containing nucleoside antibiotics has been uncovered. The data reveal S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) as the direct precursor of the N-alkylamine, but unlike conventional AdoMet- or decarboxylated AdoMet-dependent alkyltransferases, the reaction is catalyzed by a pyridoxal-5′-phophosate (PLP)-dependent aminobutyryltransferase (ABTase) using a stepwise γ-replacement mechanism that couples γ-elimination of AdoMet with aza-γ-addition onto the disaccharide alkyl acceptor. In addition to utilizing a conceptually different strategy for AdoMet-dependent alkylation, the newly discovered ABTases require a phosphorylated disaccharide alkyl acceptor, revealing a cryptic intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway. Introduction Introduction Nucleoside antibiotics are a large family of natural products that have diverse biological activity and frequently complex structures requiring unparalleled biochemistry for their synthesis. Many nucleoside antibiotics inhibiting translocase I (TL1) involved in peptidoglycan synthesis have recently been discovered1, and several biochemical studies have already established numerous examples of the latter2. One group of TL1 inhibitors is structurally characterized by a disaccharide core consisting of a 5′′-amino-5′′-deoxyribose (ADR) linked to a high-carbon sugar nucleoside, (5′S,6′S)-5′-C-glycyluridine (GlyU), represented by FR-900493 (1), caprazamycin B (2), A-90289 B (3), sphaerimicin A (4), and muraymycin D1 (5) and D2 (6) (Fig. 1)3–7. The structures of 1–5 diverge outside of the shared ADR-GlyU disaccharide core, with each appended via a 6′-N-alkylamine linker to a unique glycosylated fatty acid, polyketide, or peptide moiety. Compound 1, the structurally simplest of this nucleoside group with antibiotic activity, is modified with a methylated aminopropyl (C3N) group attached to the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core. Structural inspection of 5 reveals the identical C3N group, while 2 and 3 contain an aminobutyryl (C4N) group that is further modified to a diazapenone ring.

Compound 1, the structurally simplest of this nucleoside group with antibiotic activity, is modified with a methylated aminopropyl (C3N) group attached to the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core. Structural inspection of 5 reveals the identical C3N group, while 2 and 3 contain an aminobutyryl (C4N) group that is further modified to a diazapenone ring. The assembly of the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core has been previously delineated in vitro using the recombinant enzymes involved in 3 and 5 biosynthesis8–11. The pathway requires six enzymes that convert UMP and l-Thr to the ADR-GlyU disaccharide (Supplementary Fig. 1a), and bioinformatic analysis suggests these steps are shared for 2 and 4 (the gene cluster for 1 is unknown)6,12. However, the origin of the C3N or C4N units in these TL1 inhibitors and the mechanism for their incorporation onto the ADR-GlyU disaccharide scaffold has not been defined. Similar C3N and C4N units are found in several unrelated metabolites, for example various polyamines and siderophores, and they are known or hypothesized to be derived from either S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) or, less frequently, l-Asp-β-semialdehyde13–15. Here we provide evidence to support a shared mechanism for the insertion of the C3N group of 5 and the C4N group of 3 that employs AdoMet as the direct metabolic precursor. Unlike other AdoMet-dependent alkylations, however, the process is highlighted by a fundamentally different catalytic strategy that involves γ-replacement by a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. Furthermore, the alkyl acceptor was unexpectedly determined to be the phosphorylated version of the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core, which was recently identified as the product of the kinase Mur28 from the 5 biosynthetic pathway16. Although not readily apparent from the structure, the same alkylation strategy is also shown to initiate the biosynthesis of the highly unusual dihydroxylated piperidine ring of 4.

Results Results Metabolic origin of C3N and C4N units Metabolic origin of C3N and C4N units Metabolic origin of C3N and C4N units The metabolic origin of the alkylamine linker was initially examined using feeding experiments with isotopically labelled potential precursors. Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30475—a mutant strain of the native producer of muraymycins7,16—was chosen as the model system due to the reproducible and relatively acceptable titers of 5 (Supplementary Note). Compound 5 contains a peptide that is predicted to be assembled by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase complex from l-Val, l-Arg, l-Leu and bicarbonate precursors (Supplementary Fig. 1b)17. Consequently, l-[1-13C]Leu was fed as a positive control, and 5 was isolated and confirmed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 2a). High resolution-mass spectrometry (HR-MS) revealed ~34% of 5 was enriched with a single 13C atom (Supplementary Fig. 3). Comparison of the 13C-NMR spectra revealed a clear enhancement of the 174.8 ppm signal that corresponds to the amide carbon of the Leu component, the expected site of incorporation (Supplementary Fig. 2b). HR-MS/MS was likewise consistent with the regioselective incorporation of l-[1-13C]Leu (Supplementary Fig. 4). Subsequently, l-[13C5,15N]Met, an established precursor of AdoMet, or l-[13C4,15N]Asp, an established precursor of l-aspartate β-semialdehyde, were individually fed to the strain, and the isolation of 5 was confirmed by1H-NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 5). HR-MS analysis of 5 derived from the l-[13C5,15N]Met feeding experiments revealed ~31% consisting of a +5-amu isotopologue (Supplementary Fig. 6). Comparison of the 13C-NMR spectra suggested no substantial enrichment upon feeding l-[13C4,15N]Asp, while an increase in the signal intensity of four peaks was observed when feeding l-[13C5,15N]Met (Fig. 2). The peak signal at 58.0 ppm, previously assigned as the 2′′ methyl ether, was enriched, which is consistent with alkylation catalyzed by an AdoMet-dependent O-methyltransferase. The remaining three signals at 45.6 (d), 25.0 (t), and 35.8 (dd) ppm—corresponding to C1′′′-C3′′′ of the aminopropyl linker of 5, respectively—were similarly enriched, which is consistent with AdoMet as the direct precursor. HR-MS/MS further supported these findings (Supplementary Fig. 7). The 1JCC splitting pattern and value (35.5 Hz) from l-[13C5,15N]Met feeding suggested an intact incorporation of the C3N unit. Importantly, the peak corresponding to C3′′′ had a second coupling (7.8 Hz), which is consistent with expectations for 1JCN coupling in this chemical environment.

Aminobutyryltransferase functional assignment Aminobutyryltransferase functional assignment Aminobutyryltransferase functional assignment C3N and C4N transferases with established functions have sequence and structural similarity to AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases13–15,18–20. The gene cluster for 5 encodes for a single protein (Mur11) with an AdoMet-dependent MTase domain. Homologous genes, however, are not found in the 2–4 biosynthetic gene cluster, and the gene product was tentatively assigned as the catalyst for 2′′-O-methylation to convert 6 to 5. Armed with the knowledge that AdoMet or an l-Met-derived metabolite would ultimately need to undergo decarboxylation to generate 5, similar to polyamine biosynthetic pathways that proceed through AdoMet decarboxylation prior to C3N group transfer13, the gene cluster for 5 was further analyzed for the presence of any remaining gene encoding a putative PLP-dependent decarboxylase. This search uncovered Mur23, which has similarity to proteins annotated as diaminopimelate decarboxylases belonging to the conserved domain family of COG0019 (Supplementary Fig. 8). A Mur23 homolog is not encoded in the 2 and 3 gene cluster, as expected, if Mur23 is indeed a decarboxylase. Another putative PLP-dependent protein Mur24, with sequence similarity to proteins annotated as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthases, is encoded immediately downstream of mur23. The similarity of Mur24 to ACC synthases, which are PLP-dependent enzymes that utilize AdoMet to catalyze intramolecular Cα–Cγ bond formation with concomitant Cγ–S bond cleavage to produce ACC and methylthioadenosine (MTA)21, was intriguing due to the evidence that l-Met—likely by way of AdoMet—serves as the C3N source of 5. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Mur24 occupies a separate clade, and hence might harbor a distinct activity, when compared to plant ACC synthases or the recently characterized bacterial ACC synthase, GnmY (Supplementary Fig. 9)22. In contrast to mur23, genes homologous to mur24 were identified within the 2 (cpz13) and 3 (lipJ) gene clusters, suggesting that this enzymatic step is shared in these pathways12,23. A gene (sphL) encoding a protein with sequence similarity to Mur24 was also identified within the 4 gene cluster6. The Mur24 homologs, which range from 34–50% in sequence identity using pairwise alignments, are part of the class I aminotransferase superfamily, and all retain a conserved Lys (corresponding to Lys234 for Mur24 and Lys229 for LipJ) that is predicted to be critical for PLP binding and enzymatic activity (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Recombinant Mur24, purified to near homogeneity from Streptomyces lividans TK24 (Supplementary Fig. 11), was initially screened for activity with two potential alkyl acceptors: (5′S,6′S)-GlyU (7), the demonstrated isomeric product of LipK and Mur17 involved in 3 and 5 biosynthesis, respectively; and ADR-GlyU (8), the disaccharide product of the six-enzyme pathway that was previously characterized (Fig. 3a)9–11. The acceptors were prepared by both chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis, and the identity was confirmed by spectroscopic analyses (Supplementary Note). Based on the results from the isotopic enrichment experiments, l-Met, dcAdoMet, and AdoMet were tested as potential alkyl donors. Analysis of the reactions performed under a variety of conditions including with or without exogenously supplied PLP, however, failed to reveal a new peak. Reactions with recombinant LipJ and SphL (Supplementary Fig. 11) also gave negative results.

Mur28 was previously shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of the 3′′-OH of 6 and 8, the latter generating 3′′-O-phospho-8 (9) (Fig. 3a). Single-substrate kinetic analysis revealed an approximately 60-fold higher catalytic efficiency with 8, suggesting that phosphorylation occurs prior to the attachment of the C3N-linked peptide component. Consequently, ATP and Mur28 were included in the Mur24 activity screen to generate 9 in situ as a potential alkyl acceptor for Mur24. HPLC analysis revealed the formation of a new peak that was dependent upon the inclusion of AdoMet (Fig. 3b). MS analysis was consistent with Mur24-catalyzed alkylation of 9 to generate 10 (Supplementary Note). Subsequently, 9 was enzymatically prepared and purified, and comparison of the MS and NMR spectra was consistent with 3′′-OH as the site of phosphorylation as previously reported (Supplementary Note)16. Using purified 9 as the alkyl acceptor, the identical result was obtained (Fig 3c). HR-MS analysis of the product 10 yielded an (M + H)+ ion at m/z = 630.1643, which is consistent with the molecular formula for C4N-modified-9 [expected (M + H)+ ion at m/z = 630.1660 for C20H32N5O16P]. Analysis by NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Note) further supported the structure of the Mur24 product 10 (Fig. 3a), and 1H-13C HMBC correlations between C6′ of GlyU and C1′′′ of the C4N group supported the expected regiochemistry for C4N attachment. The formation of 10 suggests 5′-deoxy-5′-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA) is generated as the co-product, which was detected by HR-MS (Supplementary Fig. 12). High background levels of MTA as a consequence of nonenzymatic AdoMet degradation, however, precluded a quantitative assessment (Fig. 3). Overall, the data are consistent with the functional assignment of Mur24 as an AdoMet:9 aminobutyryltransferase (ABTase), generating 10 and likely MTA as co-products.

The activity of the Mur24 homologs LipJ and SphL, which are involved in the biosynthesis of 3 and 4, respectively, was next interrogated. The gene cluster for 4 does not encode for a Mur28 phosphotransferase homolog, suggesting the possibility that phosphorylation of 8 is not a prerequisite for C4N transfer by SphL. Conversely, the gene cluster for 3 encodes two Mur28 homologs, LipX (36% sequence identity) and LipI (23%), suggesting that LipJ has the same substrate specificity with respect to the alkyl acceptor as Mur24. Activity tests of LipJ with 9 and AdoMet revealed the formation of 10, and the reaction was dependent upon a phosphorylated acceptor as the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). Contrary to expectations, SphL catalyzed the same reaction wherein activity was strictly dependent upon a phosphorylated acceptor 9 as the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 13c), despite the absence of a phosphotransferase candidate. Overall the results establish the functional assignment of this group of proteins as AdoMet:9 ABTases that catalyze γ-replacement of AdoMet, thereby breaking the Cγ–S bond while generating a new Cγ–N bond. Furthermore the results suggest that the biosynthesis of 3–5 occurs through 10, an unexpected phosphorylated intermediate and the likely last shared intermediate of these pathways.

Biochemical characterization Biochemical characterization Biochemical characterization Following the functional assignment of the newly discovered ABTases, the biochemical properties were examined primarily using Mur24 as the model enzyme. When PLP was omitted from the reaction, a trace amount of 10 was detected (Fig. 3c). Subsequently, a Mur24(K234A) mutant was prepared, and the activity was abolished with or without the addition of PLP (Supplementary Fig. 14). The same result was obtained with LipJ(K229A). Thus, the data are consistent with an important role for PLP in catalysis and that the Lys—predicted through bioinformatics analysis to form an internal aldimine with PLP—is essential (Supplementary Fig. 10). Potential alternative alkyl donor substrates that are known to be (or hypothetically could be) derived from l-Met—including (S)-methylmethionine (SMM), ACC, 2-amino-3-butenoic acid [commonly referred to as l-vinylglycine (l-VG)], l-homoserine lactone, and the AdoMet analogue sinefungin (Supplementary Fig. 15a)—were next tested with Mur24. Cystathionine and O-succinyl-l-homoserine were also screened as potential C4N donors. Only SMM, an abundant plant metabolite that can be metabolized by some animals and bacteria24, was able to substitute for AdoMet as an alkyl donor (Supplementary Fig. 15b). The relative activity with SMM was substantially reduced (9% yield of 10 relative to AdoMet), suggesting that AdoMet is the substrate in vivo. Using precolumn modification with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazine hydrochloride (MBTH), a relatively minor amount of l-VG was converted to α-ketobutyrate (αKB) and NH3 by Mur24. Time-course analysis gave a specific activity of 0.05 min−1 for this reaction (Supplementary Fig. 15c), a 54-fold reduction compared to the calculated turnover for the alkyl transfer reaction with AdoMet (vide infra). Thus, similarly to ACC synthase, l-VG serves as an alternative yet inferior substrate for an aminotransferase side reaction21. However, incubation of l-VG with Mur24 and 9 under a variety of reaction conditions did not yield detectable 10. This result is in contrast to that observed with cystathionine γ-synthase (CSG synthase), which catalyzes γ-replacement of the α-amino acid O-succinyl-l-homoserine with the sulfhydryl group of l-Cys to generate l-cystathionine and succinate (Supplementary Fig. 16a) and is able to catalyze γ-addition starting with l-VG and l-Cys at pH 8.3 (ref. 25). Finally, the (S)- and (R)-sulfonium isomers of commercial AdoMet, the former being the biologically relevant diastereomer generated by AdoMet synthetase (MAT), were separated by HPLC and tested with Mur24 (Supplementary Fig. 17a). Unexpectedly, both isomers were functional as alkyl donors to convert 9 to 10 (Supplementary Fig. 17b).

Unexpectedly, both isomers were functional as alkyl donors to convert 9 to 10 (Supplementary Fig. 17b). The same panel of hypothetical alkyl donors was also tested for inhibition of the Mur24-catalyzed reaction using conditions promoting a near complete conversion of 9 to 10 with AdoMet as the alkyl group donor. SMM, which undergoes trace turnover when substituting for AdoMet under these conditions, inhibited the reaction at a 2:1 molar ratio relative to AdoMet (Supplementary Fig. 18a). Sinefungin, a well-known inhibitor of many AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, likewise inhibited the Mur24-catalyzed formation of 10 using either AdoMet or SMM as the alkyl donor (Supplementary Fig. 18a). The remaining L-Met analogues including l-VG, which is an established mechanism-based inhibitor of ACC synthase26,27, had no effect on 10 production (Supplementary Fig. 18b). Similarly, the addition of EDTA or Zn2+ or sulfhydryl-modifying reagents had no effect. Finally, by directly detecting the formation of 10 by HPLC, single-substrate kinetic analysis revealed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to varied 9 (Supplementary Fig. 19), yielding a Km = 92 ± 8 μM and kcat = 2.7 ± 0.2 min-1. The limiting amount of available 9 precluded an accurate assessment of the kinetic parameters for co-substrate AdoMet.

Mechanistic insight Mechanistic insight Mechanistic insight Enzymatic alkyl group transfer from AdoMet to a nitrogen nucleophile of an acceptor substrate is generally considered to occur by SN2 nucleophilic substitution. However, the PLP dependency of these newly discovered ABTases suggest γ-replacement with AdoMet occurs through a stepwise γ-elimination-γ-addition similar to CSG synthase25,28–30. Mechanistic insight for PLP-dependent enzymes such as CSG synthase can often be garnered by monitoring PLP-bound intermediates by UV-Vis spectroscopy28, however spectral snapshots of the Mur24 reaction under steady state conditions provided marginal information on the mechanism and role of PLP (Supplementary Fig. 20). We therefore opted to track the hydrogen atoms before and after C4N group transfer as a way to discriminate between mechanistic possibilities. Three AdoMet isotopologues were prepared in situ using differentially deuterated l-Met and human MAT isoform 2A (hMAT2A) (Fig. 4). Starting with l-[2,3,3,4,4-2H5; methyl-2H3]Met and monitoring the Mur24-catalyzed formation of 10 by HR-MS, an (M + H)+ ion at m/z = 633.1835 was detected [expected (M + H)+ at m/z = 633.1848 for C20H29D3N5O16P], consistent with the retention of 3 of 8 deuterium atoms when compared to unlabeled l-Met control (detected m/z = 630.1615). An (M + H)+ ion at m/z = 633.1859 was observed with l-[2,3,3,4,4-2H5]Met, again indicating the retention of 3 deuterium atoms. Finally, an (M + H)+ ion at m/z = 630.1653 was detected when starting with l-[2-2H]Met, revealing the loss of the single deuterium during the formation of 10.

Reactions starting with 9 and natural abundance AdoMet were performed in D2O, and isotopic distribution revealed that most of 10 was monodeuteruated (60%) with some dideuterated (19%) after 6 h (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The potential reversibility of the Mur24-catalyzed reaction was also examined. Although no products were observed when starting with 10 and MTA, time-course analysis of reactions in D2O revealed a relatively fast incorporation of one deuterium into 10 (specific activity of 1.2 μmol/min/mg ≈ 62 min−1) and a slow formation of dideuterated-10 (2.0 × 10−2 μmol/min/mg ≈ 1.0 min−1) (Supplementary Fig. 21b,c). After a 6-h reaction, isotopic distribution revealed that most of 10 was monodeuteruated (75%) with some dideuterated (9%). Overall, the data are consistent with two exchangeable hydrogen atoms from AdoMet—one bonded to C-2 and the other C-3 or C-4—during the C4N group transfer reaction.

Enzymatic decarboxylation of 10 Enzymatic decarboxylation of 10 Enzymatic decarboxylation of 10 The functional assignment of the PLP-dependent ABTases suggested that, unlike classical AdoMet-dependent polyamine biosynthesis, decarboxylation during 5 biosynthesis occurs after alkyl group transfer. To explore this possibility, recombinant Mur23 was produced and purified (Supplementary Fig. 11d). Unlike the ABTases, Mur23 copurified with PLP as evident by the yellow color and the characteristic UV/Vis spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 22). LC-MS analysis of reactions of Mur23 with 10 yielded a new peak (Fig. 5) with an (M + H)+ ion at m/z = 586.1748, consistent with the molecular formula for decarboxylated-10 (11) [expected (M + H)+ 586.1756 for C19H32N5O14P] (Supplementary Note). The structure of 11 was further supported by MS and NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Note). In contrast to reactions with 10, Mur23 was unable to catalyze decarboxylation of AdoMet or dephospho-10 (12) (Supplementary Fig. 23), the latter generated by reacting 10 with calf intestinal phosphatase and confirmed by MS (Supplementary Note). Single-substrate kinetic analysis revealed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to varied 10 (Supplementary Fig. 19b), yielding a Km = 701.8 ± 9.2 μM and kcat = 144.8 ± 1.1 min−1, equating to an apparent second order rate constant kcat/Km ~ 3.3 × 103 M−1s−1, a 6-fold greater catalytic efficiency compared to Mur24 (kcat/Km ~ 5 × 102 M−1s−1). The Km value for Mur23, although relatively high, is within the range observed for other PLP-dependent decarboxylases (Supplementary Fig. 8). Overall the data support the functional assignment of Mur23 as a 10 decarboxylase (Fig. 5b).

Discussion Discussion AdoMet is perhaps best known as a methyl donor, although this ubiquitous metabolite also serves as the source for C3N and C4N alkyl groups in the biosynthesis of many structurally distinct metabolites. For C3N group biosynthesis, a PLP-dependent decarboxylase first generates dcAdoMet, which serves as the substrate for a distinct alkyltransferase that catalyzes C3N group transfer independent of cofactors. These C3N alkyltransferases have structural similarity to AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases and consequently have been proposed to originate via divergent evolution. AdoMet as a C4N group donor has likewise been noted in several metabolic pathways14,20,31–34. Similarly to the C3N alkyltransferases, the available data suggest the C4N alkyltransferases are also structurally, mechanistically, and evolutionarily related to methyltransferases18,19. The data herein have provided evidence of a C4N alkyl group transfer from AdoMet by a new family of enzymes most closely related to plant PLP-dependent ACC synthases26,35. AdoMet is perhaps best known as a methyl donor, although this ubiquitous metabolite also serves as the source for C3N and C4N alkyl groups in the biosynthesis of many structurally distinct metabolites.

Similarly to the C3N alkyltransferases, the available data suggest the C4N alkyltransferases are also structurally, mechanistically, and evolutionarily related to methyltransferases18,19. The data herein have provided evidence of a C4N alkyl group transfer from AdoMet by a new family of enzymes most closely related to plant PLP-dependent ACC synthases26,35. Canonical AdoMet- or dcAdoMet-dependent alkyl group transfer is generally believed to occur by an SN2 substitution, wherein the nucleophile directly attacks the carbon adjacent to the sulfonium. Consequently, no exchange of carbon-bonded hydrogen atoms would be expected during the reaction. Similarly, the ACC synthase reaction proceeds without exchange21. The results with Mur24 revealed two exchangeable hydrogen atoms, which is consistent with alkyl group transfer from AdoMet via a stepwise reaction proceeding through sequential γ-elimination (lyase) and aza-Michael γ-addition (synthase) chemistries. Although less-favored mechanisms remain possible, we propose the following mechanism that is comparable to the γ-replacement mechanism put forth for CSG synthase (Fig. 6)28–30,36. PLP and AdoMet first generate an external aldimine I that is commonplace for PLP-dependent enzymes. Interestingly, unlike many PLP-dependent enzymes including CSG synthase28, the recombinant ABTases do not co-purify with PLP under a variety of conditions screened. Following the formation of a pseudo-Michaelis (ternary) complex, a general base—likely Lys234 for Mur24—abstracts the Cα proton. This step, again well established for many PLP-dependent enzymes, is supported by the deuterium labelling experiments. Due to the lack of a diagnostic absorption band for a quinonoid (Supplementary Fig. 20), Cα deprotonation is likely immediately followed by C4′ protonation, generating the ketimine II. Subsequently, the Cβ proton—rendered relatively more acidic due to the vicinal iminium—is abstracted to form the enamine III prior to formation of a transient β,γ-unsaturated ketimine IV with concomitant elimination of MTA. The intermediacy of enamine III is supported by the deuterium “wash-in” experiments with 10, which demonstrate Mur24-catalyzed exchange of the α and β hydrogens without γ-elimination. In the presence of 9, i.e. the true Michaelis complex, the amine nucleophile is deprotonated by an unidentified general base and attacks Cγ in an aza-Michael-type nucleophilic addition, and the reverse of the previous steps affords 10.

Potentially the most intriguing feature of the Mur24-catalyzed reaction is the chemical functionality involved in the bond-breaking and bond-making steps to transform one γ-substituted, α-amino acid to another. CSG synthase and O-acetyl-l-homoserine sulfhydrylase37, enzymes catalyzing a native PLP-dependent γ-replacement, initiate their reactions by breaking a Cγ-OC(O)R bond prior to the formation of a new Cγ-S bond (Supplementary Fig. 16a). These enzymes along with two other PLP-dependent enzymes, l-Met γ-lyase and cystathionine γ-lyase, have been shown to catalyze reactions in vitro using nucleophiles other than thiols including selenium/selenols (Cγ-Se), and cyanide (Cγ-C), although the biological relevance of these reactions is unknown (Supplementary Fig. 16b)38–41. Mur24 and homologous ABTases are clearly different than these γ-replacement enzymes by utilizing a sulfonium substrate, thereby breaking a Cγ-S+ bond, and using a primary amine of an amino acid acceptor, thereby generating a Cγ-N bond. This aza-Michael-type 1,4-addition, a comparable second half-reaction of which has been proposed during ergot alkaloid biosynthesis but for which the putative enzyme catalyst has not yet been characterized (Supplementary Fig. 16c)42, is a considerable chemical feat. The general interest in having mild and simple methodologies to introduce unfunctionalized C-N bonds via aza-Michael additions has resulted in multiple reports detailing new synthetic catalysts and strategies43,44. Consequently, a few enzymes have been discovered to catalyze an aza-Michael-type γ-addition that is similar to the addition half-reaction addressed here, although an entirely different, PLP-independent catalytic strategy is used to afford a new C-N bond45,46. Interestingly, an enzyme SbnA involved in the biosynthesis of l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid has recently been shown to catalyze a PLP-dependent β-replacement reaction utilizing the amine of l-Glu as a nucleophile for addition47. However, the reaction involves a β-replacement as opposed to the γ-replacement, a fundamental difference between the two enzymes. The catalytic strategy used by Mur24 and SbnA to activate amine nucleophiles for γ- and β-addition reactions, respectively, and how this compares with other β- and γ-replacement enzyme catalysts, can now be addressed.

The catalytic strategy used by Mur24 and SbnA to activate amine nucleophiles for γ- and β-addition reactions, respectively, and how this compares with other β- and γ-replacement enzyme catalysts, can now be addressed. CSG synthase catalyzes a well-characterized γ-replacement reaction with a specific activity of 100 μmol/min/mg (~240 min−1)30. CSG synthase is also able to convert l-VG and l-Cys to cystathionine, thereby bypassing the first-half (i.e., γ-elimination) reaction25. The newly discovered ABTases cannot bypass the elimination step by using l-VG as an alkyl donor. The ability of CSG synthase to use l-VG directly for γ-addition has been speculated to be a consequence of solvent accessibility to the active site25, which compensates for the incorrect protonation state of the general base/acid (EnzB1 in Fig. 6) responsible for Cβ deprotonation (during γ-elimination) and re-protonation (during γ-addition). Using cystathionine, CSG synthase catalyzes isotope exchange from 3H2O to both Cα and Cβ protons—with a 2-fold preference for Cβ exchange over Cα— at rates >7-fold faster than the overall γ-replacement reaction30. Mur24 can catalyze a similar isotope exchange from D2O to 9 that is comparably faster (~23-fold) than γ-replacement. However, the data establish a strong preference for the exchange of a single hydrogen per molecule instead of two (62-fold difference), suggesting that one site, which we propose is Cβ, is better shielded from bulk solvent and hence cannot support γ-addition starting with l-VG. The differences in reactivity of CSG synthase and the ABTases could also be the result of the nature of the acceptor nucleophile. Thiols/thiolates, for example, the l-Cys acceptor for CSG synthase, are excellent nucleophiles for conjugate additions, and the softness enables orbital effects to dominate the reaction with the relatively soft electrophilic center at Cγ48,49. The PLP-dependent ABTases utilize a relatively hard amine nucleophile, thereby relying more on charges and electrostatic effects to catalyze conjugate γ-addition. Consequently, the correct protonation state is likely critical for PLP-dependent ABTase activity, and this can only be achieved upon catalyzing γ-elimination of the substrate. Ongoing structural and biochemical studies will undoubtedly help clarify the observed differences in the chemistry.

Finally, the discovery of the PLP-dependent C4N alkyltransferases has revealed that the biosynthetic pathway for 3–5 proceeds through a cryptic phosphorylated intermediate. This discovery is consistent with the isolation of a phosphorylated caprazol from a mutant strain of the 2 producer50, as well as the previous functional assignment of the kinase Mur28 involved in 5 biosynthesis16. The results establish 10 as the most likely last shared intermediate, upon which the pathways diverge to afford the structurally unique scaffolds of 1–5. Pathway divergence for 5 is initiated by Mur23-catalyzed 10 decarboxylation that, when combined with the preceding Mur24-catalyzed alkyl transfer, has revealed a new, “inverse” polyamine biosynthetic strategy using two consecutive PLP-dependent enzymes to incorporate an aminopropyl linker derived from the exceptionally versatile metabolite AdoMet.

For Mur23 reactions consisted of 25 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.3), 100 μM PLP with variable 10 (5 μM–1000 μM). The Mur23-catalyzed reaction was performed at 30 °C with 50 nM Mur23 for 60 min and analyzed under initial velocity conditions (<10% conversion). Product formation was determined using HPLC with the gradient described above. Each data point represents a minimum of three replicate end point assays; kinetic constants were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

Fig. 6.Putative γ-elimination and γ-addition mechanism for the PLP-dependent AdoMet:9 ABTases.The asterisk (*) indicates a proton that is different than Hβ that is removed from the substrate, which is consistent with isotopic labelling. Following formation of ketimine II, deprotonation at Cβ could hypothetically generate an enamine (Cα-Cβ double bond), which is not shown, prior to γ-elimination to generate the β,γ-unsaturated ketimine III.
