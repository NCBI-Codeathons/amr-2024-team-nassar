 Fungi have historically been the source of numerous important
medicinal
compounds, but full exploitation of their genetic potential for drug
development has been hampered in traditional discovery paradigms.
Here we describe a radically different approach, top-down drug discovery
(TD3), starting with a massive digital search through a
database of over 100,000 fully genomicized fungi to identify loci
encoding molecules with a predetermined human target. We exemplify
TD3 by the selection of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
as targets and the discovery of two molecules, 1 and 2, which inhibit therapeutically important human CDKs. 1 and 2 exhibit a remarkable mechanism, forming
a site-selective covalent bond to the CDK active site Lys. We explored
the structure–activity relationship via semi- and total synthesis,
generating an analog, 43, with improved kinase selectivity,
bioavailability, and efficacy. This work highlights the power of TD3 to identify mechanistically and structurally novel molecules
for the development of new medicines. Special Issue Published

known to humankind are
the products of small molecule evolution in fungi. Lovastatin was
the first drug approved by the FDA to lower cholesterol by blocking
sterol biogenesis,1 and is the direct progenitor
to the entire family of statin drugs that are among the most widely
prescribed medicines in the US, with over 800 million prescriptions
filled annually to 40 million patients.2 Cyclosporin enabled routine and widespread organ transplantation
in humans by suppressing T cell mediated rejection of the donor-derived
organs.3 Cyclosporin also served as an
invaluable tool for elucidation of many fundamental aspects of T cell
biology, while revealing a powerful new modality for drug action,
launching the field of molecules known as molecular glues.4 Lovastatin and cyclosporin exemplify the potential
of genetically encoded small molecules (GEMs), otherwise known as
natural products, to provide mechanistically and structurally novel
medicines that have saved and extended millions of lives. Several of the most impactful medicines

the predominant paradigm for small molecule drug discovery,
a clinical molecule is elaborated through an iterative optimization
process that typically requires the synthesis and characterization
of thousands of fully synthetic compounds. In contrast to this bottom-up
approach, lovastatin and cyclosporin represent an appealing alternative
paradigm, which we term top-down drug discovery (TD3),
where a new lead molecule emerges fully fledged from a discovery program
as a clinical candidate. Both lovastatin and cyclosporin achieved
FDA approval with no further elaboration; importantly, they also served
as an advanced starting point for focused semisynthetic optimization
that subsequently yielded next-gen FDA-approved drugs with improved
clinical properties.5 Penicillin, a drug
that has saved millions of lives, is the most famous example of a
fungal GEM discovered in the TD3 paradigm that was life-cycle-managed,
in this case to overcome emergent bacterial drug resistance.6 Mycophenolic acid is yet another prominent example
of a clinically administered drug discovered from fungi by this approach,
and subsequently life-cycle-managed by semisynthesis (CellCept).7 In

broader deployment of this strategy has been hampered by the numerous
difficulties encountered during activity-guided isolation of fungal
GEMs.8 These molecules are often potent
and target-specific, but are typically present in vanishingly small
quantities and in complex mixtures comprising hundreds to thousands
of contaminating GEMs, many of which exhibit diverse biological activities
that confound cell-based screens.9 Having
successfully carried out a large-scale genome-mining operation in
bacteria that led to the discovery of new members of the FK506/rapamycin
class of GEMs,10 it occurred to us that
exploitation of advances in fungal genomics, bioengineering, and multiomics
might also accelerate, simplify and render more predictable the scalable
discovery of GEMs from fungi. In both bacteria and fungi, the genes
encoding GEM biosynthesis are often colocated within the genome in
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), each comprising a cassette of coordinately
regulated genes that evolve and act together to perform context-dependent
production of their self-encoded GEM.11 Many fungal GEMs have evolved to provide a competitive advantage
over other fungi, and this creates the need for self-protection of
fungi from their own GEMs.12 Such protective
genes typically reside within the BGC, as resistance mechanisms are
coevolved with, and mechanistically tailored to, individual GEMs.
Many BGCs, for example, contain one or more genes encoding GEM-specific
transmembrane pumps that export their cognate GEM from the producing
fungus.13 However, most relevant to the
field of drug discovery, a small but important subset of BGCs contain
a gene embedded within their evolutionarily conserved boundaries that
encodes a copy of the molecular target of the encoded GEM, which we
refer to as an embedded target gene (ETaG). For example, colocalized
within the lovastatin BGC can be found a copy of the HMG-CoA reductase
gene, the target of lovastatin that, when inhibited in humans, is
responsible for its cholesterol-lowering effect.14 Typically, fungi hosting BGCs using this method of self-resistance
encode two copies of the target gene: an ancestral copy that remains
susceptible to inhibition, and a second ETaG copy that has acquired
GEM-resistant mutations while maintaining the capacity for functional
complementation; for example, the protein encoded by the HMG-CoA reductase
ETaG is active enzymatically but resistant to inhibition by lovastatin. Notwithstanding the obvious appeal of TD3 from fungi,

ETaG is active enzymatically but resistant to inhibition by lovastatin. Fungi and humans share many genes that can be considered evolutionarily
conserved, and often perform the same or a related function in both
organisms.15 These orthologs typically
exhibit moderate overall sequence identity, but active site amino
acid residues can be conserved almost identically.16 However, it is exactly these functionally important and
highly conserved regions that comprise important drug binding sites.
While fungal GEMs can be assumed to have evolved to compete with organisms
encountered in their native environments, such as other fungi, bacteria,
or plants, there is considerable potential for cross-kingdom binding
to homologous human proteins at conserved active sites. In this context,
an ETaG can be viewed as an avatar for a relevant human therapeutic
target, enabling a digital search through genomic space to identify
BGCs that encode novel GEMs with important clinical properties.17 These concepts suggested to us the possibility
of broadly enabling an ETaG-based platform for more rapid, scalable,
and targeted implementation of TD3 in fungi than has previously
been available, by (1) assembling a massive database of phylogenetically
diverse, comprehensively annotated fungal genomes; (2) selecting a
disease-relevant human protein; (3) performing genomic search to query
the database for BGCs having an ETaG avatar of the preselected human
target; (4) using multiomic methods to monitor BGC-related RNA expression
and metabolite production under a variety of conditions; (5) identifying
the fully elaborated GEM product of the BGC; then (6) performing minor
structural optimization if necessary to develop the GEM as a drug. Fungi and humans share many genes that can be considered evolutionarily

use of ETaG-based search to identify a BGC that encodes two inhibitors
of human cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs): compounds 1 and 2, respectively roseopurpurins D and C. The roseopurpurins
were originally isolated from the fungi Aspergillus spp.(18,19) and Penicillium roseopurpureum(20) and shown to exhibit selective cytotoxicity
toward cancer cell lines,20 though the
target responsible for the activity of these GEMs was not identified
in that earlier work. We recently disclosed that 1 and 2 are novel CDK-inhibitors, with potential utility in the
treatment of CDK-dependent cancers.21 Subsequent
to our disclosure, the target identification of 1 and 2 was replicated independently in a publication that describes
the CDK-active properties of the roseopurpurins and delineates the
encoding BGC, designated as rosA–rosK.22 Here we provide a fully detailed account
of our genomic deorphanization of these kinase-inhibitor GEMs, comprehensive
elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway, characterization of their
extraordinary covalent kinase engagement mechanism, an initial structure–activity
exploration by semisynthetic and synthetic modification, and preliminary
in cellulo and in vivo characterization. By applying our integrated TD3 platform we report the

we observed 70 distinct BGC variants, each having a unique gene order

of this BGC family, despite the substantial degree of gene rearrangement,
strongly suggested functional association of the ETaG with the ros BGC. We identified a candidate BGC family

that they represent
an extra copy of a housekeeping gene.13 Indeed, phylogenetic analysis comparing a CDK ETaG from a LifeBase
strain of Preussia flanaganii with
CDK proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and Homo sapiens (human)
revealed that the ETaG is most closely related to fungal housekeeping
Pho85 protein, which in turn is most closely related to human CDK5
(Figure 2). An important
feature of CDKs is that they are central to cellular processes in
both fungi and humans, with conserved evolutionary, structural, and
functional relationships between subgroups. The CDK family is greatly
expanded (radiated) in humans, which presents an opportunity to optimize
a single fungal GEM scaffold to inhibit evolutionarily divergent human
kinases. We anticipated that identifying the GEM encoded by this BGC
might provide a starting point for the development of novel inhibitors
of human CDK2, an attractive target for drug development23 and a close sequence homologue of CDK5. A commonly observed characteristic of ETaGs is

of mutations
that reduce or abolish the binding of an inhibitor, but that maintain
normal enzymatic function.12 We thus performed
residue conservation analysis comparing 100 diverse housekeeping Pho85
proteins (selected as having a single pho85 gene
copy and lacking the ros BGC) and the sequences of
38 diverse Pho85 ETaGs, to identify statistically significant sequence
variations. Using this approach, we identified 8 residues that consistently
differed between the housekeeping protein set and the ETaG protein
set, and where the most abundant residue was present in more than
50% of each set of sequences (Table 1). Three of these potential resistance mutations were
colocalized within the ATP binding pocket, as judged from the structure
of the yeast Pho85-Pho80 CDK-Cyclin complex (PDB ID 2PMI, Figure 3). As resistance mutations
are most likely to interfere directly with drug binding, these observations
suggest that the GEM encoded by the ros BGC is an
active site (orthosteric) inhibitor that competes directly with ATP.
One of the putative resistance mutations occurs at the so-called gatekeeper
residue; gatekeeper mutations in human kinases are a known, frequent
escape mechanism that confers clinical resistance to FDA-approved
kinase inhibitors.24 Here, the gatekeeper
Phe in Pho85 is replaced by Ser in the ETaG. In the ATP binding pocket,
human CDK2 has identical residues with the fungal housekeeping Pho85
in two out of three mutation sites, including the gatekeeper Phe,
which led us to hypothesize that human CDK2, similarly to fungal housekeeping
Pho85, would be susceptible to the GEM produced by this BGC. ETaGs may provide self-resistance via the acquisition

encoded by the ros BGC, we replaced the promoter
of the rosH transcription factor with a strong constitutive

with the expectation that overproduction of this transcription factor
would coordinately up-regulate all the biosynthetic genes in the ros BGC. By screening extract fractions from these engineered

of Mycophilomyces sp. alongside a chimeric variant
incorporating the putative resistance-determining residues (Val66Leu,
Phe82Ser, and Gly150Ala) in Escherichia coli. In vitro functional assays of both proteins, wild-type and chimeric

conserved active site residues from the ETaG were sufficient to confer
resistance to Pho85 against 2 at greater than 50 mM concentration
(Supporting Figure 1). This result validated

the ros cluster, so as to reasonably represent the
full phylogenetic diversity of the 900 total strains in which this

of the 11 genes of the ros BGC in the wild-type production
strain (Penicillium sp.) discussed above. Biosynthetic
intermediates that uniquely accumulated in each knockout strain were
characterized by LC-MS/MS analysis (Scheme 1). Seven of the ros genes
(rosABCDFJK) were found to be essential for the biosynthesis
of 2, while deletions of the four remaining ros genes (rosEGHI) led to similar or reduced production
levels of 2, suggesting that they play a supporting role.
Disruption of rosE significantly reduced both molecule
production and BGC transcription, effects similar to those seen upon
targeted deletion of the transcription factor rosH, suggesting that rosE also serves a role in transcriptional
activation, despite its lack of sequence or structural similarity

by comparison to reference standards prepared by chemical synthesis
(Supporting Figure 4). The early steps
of the biosynthetic pathway of 2, up to formation of 5, are similar to other recently characterized fungal depsidone
biosynthetic systems as well as previous proposals for the biosynthesis
of 2.27 However, our observations
have more clearly delineated several late-stage steps in the pathway,
involving three genes responsible for oxidation, reduction and methylation
that are proposed to convert 5 to 1, via
roseopurpurin G 6. The hydroxylation of 5 by RosA was confirmed after heterologous expression of the encoding
gene in S. cerevisiae, however we did
not observe further oxidation to putative intermediate 7 in this system (Supporting Figure 5).
Disruption of rosF, encoding an O-methyltransferase, led to accumulation of 8, which
was isolated and its structure was confirmed by NMR. While previous
studies have proposed a different biosynthetic pathway, one in which 6 is formed by elimination of water from 8,22 we did not observe such an elimination reaction
during purification. In our extensively characterized pathway, 6 is not a shunt artifact but a bona fide biosynthetic intermediate. The structures of intermediates 3 and 5 (Scheme 1) were confirmed

protein in fungal biosynthesis having no significant sequence identity
to any functionally characterized enzyme (Supporting Table 1). RosD does however have a conserved domain belonging
to the vicinal oxygen chelating (VOC) superfamily, which has been
associated with highly diverse functions in other proteins.28 RosD has been suggested to catalyze the hydrolysis
of 2 to aculeatusquinone C as a detoxification mechanism,22 but the comprehensive analysis here demonstrates
unambiguously that rosD encodes a C7 hydroxyl epimerase
that interconverts 1 and 2 to the equilibrium
mixture of ∼30/70% 1/2. Consistent
with this role, disruption of rosD resulted in accumulation
of 1, without production of 2. The purified
RosD protein, generated by heterologous expression in E. coli, enabled reconstitution of the epimerization
reaction in vitro, affording rapid conversion of 1 to
the equilibrium 1/2 mixture (Supporting Figure 5). In these reconstitution
reactions, we also observed two new products by LC-MS/MS, these being
consistent with hydrolytic ring-opening of the vinylogous anhydride
in 2 to form the known compound roseopurpurin A 9, which undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to form aculeatusquinone
C 10 (Scheme 1). Interestingly, the corresponding products of hydrolytic
ring-opening and decarboxylation from 1 were not observed
in significant quantities under reaction conditions, consistent with
our general observation that the vinylogous anhydride in 2 is more reactive than that in 1. Degradants 9 and 10 were formed at the same rate under conditions
in which the RosD enzyme was omitted, with all other conditions being
held constant. To further establish the nonenzymatic nature of this
pathway, 2 was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile
and water with a mild base (NaHCO3), resulting in formation
of 9 and 10. Because intermediates such
as 6 in the biosynthetic pathway can also undergo nonenzymatic
hydrolysis and decarboxylation, or methanolysis to produce methyl
esters, we propose that a number of the aculeatusquinones and roseopurpurins
derived from intermediates in the ros biosynthetic
pathway similarly result from shunt pathways and are not evolved products
of the ros BGC (Supporting Figure 6). The final gene in the biosynthesis encodes RosD, which is a unique

interaction of 1 with the Aspergillus
nidulans CDK Pho85 (PhoA) revealed the site-selective
formation of a covalent 1:1 adduct, with the inhibitor being linked
to the active site Lys residue that engages the α- and β-phosphate
moieties of ATP. Peptide mapping by mass spectrometry identified a
single 348 Da mass shift of the Lys38-containing peptide, along with
a missed tryptic cleavage site following this residue, consistent
with site-specific modification by 1 (Supporting Figure 7). This residue is highly conserved in
the vast majority of enzymatically active protein kinases, including
all CDKs, and mutation to any other residue is known to abolish kinase
activity.29 The kinase activity of CDK

interaction of 1 with the Aspergillus
nidulans CDK Pho85 (PhoA) revealed the site-selective
formation of a covalent 1:1 adduct, with the inhibitor being linked
to the active site Lys residue that engages the α- and β-phosphate
moieties of ATP. Peptide mapping by mass spectrometry identified a
single 348 Da mass shift of the Lys38-containing peptide, along with
a missed tryptic cleavage site following this residue, consistent
with site-specific modification by 1 (Supporting Figure 7). This residue is highly conserved in
the vast majority of enzymatically active protein kinases, including
all CDKs, and mutation to any other residue is known to abolish kinase
activity.29 The kinase activity of CDK

With a Ki in the low micromolar range,
and as described below, low selectivity within the CDK family and
modest oral bioavailability (12% in rats), it became clear that optimization
by medicinal chemistry would be desirable. Our TD3 lead-optimization
strategy focused on making structure–activity explorations
using three synthetic approaches executed in parallel: (1) a total
synthesis campaign to execute the first total synthesis of 1 and 2, gaining broad control over chemical matter in
this series; (2) a campaign to a relevant series of analogs probing
various aspects of structure–activity relationships; and (3)
semisynthetic modification starting from 2 produced by
fungal fermentation. With respect to fully synthetic approaches, the
compactness of this scaffold (MW = 348
Da) is attractive, but the structure poses a formidable synthetic
challenge, due to the three contiguous chiral centers (C5a, C6 and

for our synthetic strategy, featuring a late-stage dehydration to
form the central 7-member ring. Disconnecting into a suitably protected
orsellinic acid derivative and a nonaromatic ring bearing the stereochemical
complexity, we reasoned that an epoxide coupling approach would set
the desired relative stereochemistry. Our initial experiments coupling
known compound 14 with the racemic epoxide of a protected
benzoquinone delivered a trans intermediate 15, which
was methylated to form 16 (Scheme 2). Relative stereochemistry was confirmed
by NOE NMR experiments. Epoxidation to 17, followed by
substrate-controlled stereoselective reduction afforded intermediate 18 with the desired relative stereochemistry at C7 (highlighted
blue). We had planned to induce the rearrangement of the epoxide to
the vinylogous carboxylic acid in preparation for dehydrative ring
closure to form 2 but were unable to effect the transformation.
Instead, we opted for a stepwise approach by first reducing the epoxide
to intermediate 19 then reoxidation; this was successful,
but overoxidized to intermediate 20 ablating the C7 stereocenter.
Regioselective reduction was achieved using zinc with ammonium chloride,
however this delivered exclusively the undesired stereochemistry at
C7 (21, highlighted red). Debenzylation to 22 occurred smoothly, and our key dehydrative ring closure was achieved
with TFAA to afford racemic mixture 23, which was resolved
by chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) to afford each
enantiomer (1 and 24) in 99% e.e. The desired
enantiomer was identified by comparison of chiral analytical SFC retention
times to fermented samples of 1. The hydrolysis of 2 (Scheme 1) served as an inspiration

we leveraged our unique
insight into the biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 1), specifically that the enzyme RosD would
catalyze the transformation of 1 to 2 by
epimerization of the C7 hydroxyl. Synthetic 1 was treated
with the RosD epimerase which resulted in a 70% conversion, but only
11% isolated yield of 2 due to the small scale and the
requirement for HPLC to separate the unreacted starting material.
Under the same conditions, the racemic mixture 23 shows
diminished conversion (30%), and the chirally purified diastereomer 24 showed no conversion to 25. These results
provide further evidence that epimerization of the C7 hydroxyl is
an enzymatically driven process catalyzed by RosD, and that the enzyme
is stereospecific for (S)-stereochemistry at C5a.
The analytical data for synthetic 1 and 2 matched the data for samples prepared by fermentation, which confirmed

The analytical data for synthetic 1 and 2 matched the data for samples prepared by fermentation, which confirmed

the synthetic sequence above we observed that ring opening
of the racemic epoxide afforded an unexpected 2:1 mixture of trans
(15a and 15b) and cis (15c and 15d) products (Scheme 3). We deduced that the cis product was formed by epimerization
of the stereocenter α to the carbonyl of the initially formed
trans product under the basic reaction conditions (i.e., 15a → 15c and 15b → 15d), and furthermore that 15d had the configuration corresponding
to the epimerized C6 quaternary center (5aS,6R; highlighted blue). The cis product was isolated as a
racemic mixture of 15c and 15d and using
the same synthetic sequence as above elaborated to racemic mixture 26 and then resolved by chiral SFC. Leveraging the equilibrating
nature of the epimerase the (5aS,6R,7S)-enantiomer 27 was treated with RosD, which resulted in 35% conversion by LC–MS
and 6% isolated yield of the C7 epimer 28, requiring
SFC purification to remove the starting material. The relative stereochemistry
at C5a, C6 and C7 of 27 and 28 were confirmed
by NOESY data (see Supporting Information). The (5aR,6S,7R)-enantiomer 29 was isolated but showed no conversion

we undertook a systematic
simplification of the molecule, especially with respect to stereochemistry.
We used the same disconnection strategy, but substituted into the
synthesis a simplified nonaromatic ring, which expedited the synthesis
and avoided the late-stage redox challenges discussed above. The β-diketone 30 was methylated to form 31 and protected with
a benzoyl group in 32, then brominated with NBS. The
resulting α-bromo ketone 33 was alkylated with
an orsellinic acid derivative 34 (Scheme 4). The resulting intermediate 35 was cyclized using TFAA to afford racemic 36. The unsubstituted
intermediate 36a (R6 = H) was resolved to 37 using chiral SFC then deprotected to afford 38. The simplified intermediate 36b (R6 = Me)
was oxidized using Davis reagent to install the C7 OH, then deprotected
and resolved using chiral SFC to afford 39 and subsequent
RosD-catalyzed epimerization afforded 40. In parallel to the total synthesis approach,

(Scheme 5). Direct
halogenation was effective, but silyl protection of the phenol was

observation that 2 shows 25-fold enhanced biochemical
inhibition of CDK2/cyclin E relative to the coisolated GEM 1, despite only a single difference between the two compounds, specifically
the configuration at the C7 stereocenter. To ascertain the impact
of the stereochemical configuration on the activity, we characterized
our panel of stereoisomer analogs (Table 2). To confirm biological activity we tested
compounds in parallel in live cells employing NanoBRET alongside in
vitro enzyme assays; these data corroborated each other well. Compound 2 showed 21-fold greater biochemical inhibition than its C6
epimer 28, and for the epimerized scaffold the C7 diastereomer 28 was superior to 27, showing the same trend
as 2 and 1. Compounds 24 and 29 (enantiomers of 1 and 27, respectively)
lost significant activity against CDK2/cyclin E, and displayed noncovalent
binding properties. The C6/C7-simplified analog set was also profiled,
however complete removal of substituents at C6 and C7 (compound 38) led to substantial loss of activity on CDK2/cyclin E,
which was partially restored upon reintroduction of both a methyl
group at C6 and hydroxyl at C7 (39). Epimerization at
C7 in 40 provided a further boost to activity, achieving
a similar level of cellular inhibition to 1, but still
6-fold lower than 2. We were intrigued by the

of substituents and the natural stereochemical configuration are crucial

XC219) was
selected for additional profiling as it retained potent biochemical
and cellular inhibition of CDK2 while demonstrating improved selectivity
against CDK7. We acquired an X-ray crystal structure of 43 in complex with CDK2/cyclin E, which showed that its binding mode
matches that of 2, with the C3 phenol binding the hinge
and formation of a covalent bond from C11 to Lys33 (Figure 8). The R2 vector
projects toward Val64 of CDK2, which rotates to accommodate the Cl
atom of 43. There is a point-change of the corresponding
residue to Ile75 in CDK7, and we propose that the larger residue cannot
accommodate the R2 = Cl, affording selectivity for CDK2

anhydride of 2 reacts with the active site lysine of
CDK2 (Lys33) to form a covalent bond. This residue is highly conserved
within the protein kinase family, which raises the question of the
selectivity of 2 not only for CDKs but for the entire
kinome.34 Furthermore, the vinylogous anhydride
of 2 clearly shows conditional reactivity with CDKs,
but its electrophilic nature could give rise to off-target reactivity.
To assess the selectivity of 2 across the human kinome,
we tested 2 in a competitive Kinobead pull-down assay.35 The assay revealed remarkably high overall selectivity,
with the primary human targets of 2 being the CMGC family
of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases (Figure 9A), which contains 21 CDK family members.
A small number of additional kinase targets were identified in the
CK1, CAMK, and TKL classes. A broader competitive chemoproteomic screen
using the biotinylated probe 50 in lysates treated with
25 μM of 2 detected no additional nonkinase targets
(Supporting Figure 9). The vinylogous

targets of 2, revealing potent (EC50 = 31

selection of synthetic analogs in the human
Kinobead assay (Figure 9B–D). The improved selectivity of 43 versus 2 was recapitulated in the Kinobead assay, and extended to
the larger CDK family CDK5, 7, 12, and 13, and importantly the kinome
in general. The transcriptional regulators CDK7, 12, and 13 are known
to have a narrow therapeutic window, while reduced inhibition of CDK5
offers more favorable neurological safety.36 Beyond the CDK family we also noted improved selectivity on kinases
such as MAP3K11 and CSKN1E. The C7 acetylated analog 47 led to a slight shift of activity favoring the CMGC kinase CLK2,
and the CAMK kinase AURKC. The simplified analog 38 showed
barely detectable CDK2 activity but was highly selective for a therapeutically

genomic search across
a comprehensively sequenced and functionally annotated collection
of over 100,000 diverse wild-type fungi (LifeBase) to identify an
inhibitor of a preselected human target family, cyclin-dependent kinases.
To our knowledge, this represents the first example in which a fungal
GEM inhibiting a human protein of therapeutic interest was discovered
first by a targeted search in genomic space.21 In other words, our TD3 discovery paradigm starts with
a human target, progresses to the discovery of genes encoding a fungal
GEM predicted to engage that human target, and then progresses further
to the isolation and characterization of the GEM. This is in reversed
order compared to the historical paradigm of “natural product”
drug discovery, in which a GEM was first isolated and in some cases
its target identified, but only in relatively rare instances was the
producing organism sequenced and the genetic origins of the GEM characterized.
The historical emphasis on searching through chemical space has led
to a situation in which many GEMs in the literature have been isolated,
structurally characterized and reported to possess biological activity
in human cells, but the target(s) responsible for that activity has
not been elucidated. Genomic search for BGCs using the presence of
a colocated ETaG offers a powerful means to deorphanize the targets
of such GEMs. The present work exemplifies the use of genomic search
for GEM deorphanization—1 and 2 had
been isolated decades ago and shown to possess antiproliferative activity
in cultured human cells, but their molecular target(s) had not been
identified. Here we found that, as predicted by the presence of the
CDK-homologous rosG ETaG in the ros BGC, 1 and 2 indeed encode inhibitors
of both fungal and human CDK enzymes. In work to be reported elsewhere,
we have undertaken a systematic deorphanization of known GEMs and
are developing AI-based methods to correlate BGC and GEM structure. In this work, we have employed ETaG-based

a predetermined human target offers substantial advantages over searching
for GEMs through chemical space using activity-based fractionation.
As demonstrated in this study, up-front knowledge of the genes encoding
a GEM enables the transcriptional activity of the cluster to be monitored
as a function of growth conditions, allowing for GEM production to
be maximized prior to initiation of isolation. The functions of the
genes within the BGC can provide important insights into the chemical
structure of the GEM that aid in isolation based on MS/MS fragmentation,
for example analysis of the ros BGC suggested a heavily
oxidized orsellinic acid derivative with a methylated heteroatom.
Furthermore, enzymes encoded within the BGC can be used as reagents
in a hybrid bio/chemo-catalytic synthesis to aid downstream preparation
of the GEM and analogs for SAR. Of the roughly 100,000 genomicized
strains in LifeBase, 900 bore a colocated assemblage of the ros genes, though the order of genes within the cluster
was not conserved. Targeted profiling of a subset of these strains
for the transcriptional activity of the ros genes
under various growth conditions enabled us efficiently to identify
a wild-type fungal strain that natively overproduces 1 and 2. The ability to search in genomic space for therapeutics that engage

of structural relatedness
to their functionally related human counterparts, with sequence and
structural conservation being especially high in enzyme active sites
and surfaces that engage in protein–protein interactions. This
relatedness leads to species crossover, whereby a GEM evolved in fungi
to target fungal proteins engages the corresponding human protein.
Given the high relatedness of the fungal CDK Pho85 to human CDKs,
it comes as no surprise that 1 and 2 engage
human CDKs. Species crossover is however complicated by homologue
radiation; whereas there are 6 CDKs in fungi, the need for more specialized
orchestration of cell cycle related mechanisms in humans versus fungi
has resulted in radiation to 21 CDK homologues in humans. For radiated
human targets, sequence comparisons alone are unlikely to be predictive
of human homologue selectivity for a fungal-derived GEM, because interactions
with a drug are determined by a handful of amino acid residues on
the target, whereas phylogenetic analysis encompasses the entire protein
sequence. In the case of 1 and 2, human
homologue selectivity is further complicated by the covalent inhibition
mechanism of these GEMs, with contributions from both noncovalent
binding (KI) and the kinetics of covalent
bond formation (kinact). Thus, while 1 and 2 show marked selectivity for human CDKs
over other protein kinases, selectivity among the human CDK homologues
is poorly predicted by phylogenetic distance (compare Figures 9A and 2). To emphasize this point for proteins of therapeutic importance, 1 and 2 show little activity on CDK4 and CDK6
but have robust activity on CDK1 and CDK2, though the former are only
marginally more distant from Pho85 than the latter. However, in the
context of fungal kinases 1 and 2 show exquisite
selectivity for Pho85 versus the other 5 endogenous CDK homologues. Fungal proteins exhibit a high degree

selectivity can be subtle and difficult to predict. That is indeed
so in the case of 1 and 2, for which the
kinetics of covalent bond formation make a major contribution to selectivity.
The aromatic ring of 1 and 2 slots into
the active site in a manner consistent with other orthosteric kinase
inhibitors, with the phenolic hydroxyl engaging the hinge region (Figure 6B). We were able
to gain insight into the binding interaction that precedes covalent
bond formation using the analog 51, in which the vinylogous
anhydride of 2 is replaced by an amide-NH, rendering
the analog inert. The structure of CDK2/cyclin E bound to 51 (Figure 6C) shows
the molecule optimally positioned in the active site for nucleophilic
attack by Lys33. GEMs 1 and 2 are selective
by many orders of magnitude for Lys33 over other lysines in CDK2 as
well as lysines in other proteins, which in combination with the optimal
binding pose demonstrates that covalent bond formation with Lys33
is enzyme-activated, most likely by a combination of orbital steering
and enzyme-assisted lysine desolvation. Nearly all protein kinases
possess a lysine residue in the same position as Lys33 in CDK2, and
yet 1 and 2 are far from promiscuous kinase
inhibitors. The structural features in kinase inhibitors that give rise to

stereochemistry of
the GEMs, especially at the junction with the 7-membered ring (C5a)
and the adjacent C6. Both of these critical positions are, interestingly,
remote from the hinge-interacting region. The stereocenter at C7 may
be less important for selectivity, as 1 and 2 are stereoisomeric at this position, yet exhibit nearly identical
kinase selectivity. Our SAR studies provided further insights into
the role of these positions in determining selectivity. For example,
at equal concentrations the enantiomer of 1 is devoid
of kinase inhibitory activity when 1 and 2 show nearly complete inhibition. Analog 38, stripped
of stereochemistry and substituents at C6 and C7, was drastically
reduced in CDK-inhibitory activity but had undergone reprogramming
to target a completely different kinase, CSNK1A1 (Figure 9D). This observation suggests
that a systematic SAR exploration of the tricyclic scaffold in 1 and 2 is warranted, as it is likely to yield
a family of novel Lys-targeting covalent kinase inhibitors, possibly
with high brain penetration. Finally, semisynthetic chloro-substitution
at C2 provided an analog with improved selectivity for CDK2 compared
to 1 and 2, retaining good CDK2 activity
but reducing activity against several other CDKs (e.g., CDK7) and
against other protein kinases (e.g., MAP3K11) (compare Figure 9A,B). The origins of kinase selectivity in 1 and 2 are likely to derive from the substituents and

confirming our discovery that 2 targets
CDKs failed to observe a covalent binding mode, despite presentation
of a ligand-protein cocrystal structure (PDB ID 8OY2).22 In our previous disclosure and as further elaborated here
we provide multiple lines of evidence, from intact mass spectrometry
to rigorous enzymological characterization and high-resolution structural
information, all confirming that 1 and 2 are irreversible covalent inhibitors that modify the active site
Lys residue (Lys33 in CDK2) of their kinase targets. The discrepancy
is most likely attributable to the fact that noncovalent binding was
reported from CDK2 in the absence of its obligate cyclin partner,
whereas this study utilized the relevant physiologic form of CDK2
in complex with its cognate cyclin E. Cyclins are essential binding
partners required to activate CDKs both in vitro and in vivo and,
since ATP interacts differently with these enzymes in the presence
and absence of the cyclin,38 it is straightforward
to imagine that the CDK would interact differently with inhibitors
that also bind the ATP site. A recent report

has many interesting and promising
properties that differentiate them radically from existing orthosteric
kinase inhibitors. First, they have a rigid tricyclic ring system
devoid of nitrogen atoms, as opposed to the nitrogen-rich beads-on-a-string
structure of most human-designed kinase inhibitors. This difference
may underlie the high brain exposure seen with 2, as
brain penetration in small molecule drugs is typically counter-associated
with rotatable bonds.39 Brain penetration
is a highly desirable feature of cancer drugs in general but even
more so in those being used to treat breast cancer, as metastasis
to the brain is commonly observed and is often aggressively lethal
in patients taking nonbrain-penetrant precision medicines.40 Second, this family of molecules possess highly
conditional enzyme-activated Lys-specific warheads, an attribute that
humans have found difficult to design but fungi have produced via
evolutionary selection. In cancer drugs that covalently attach to
Cys residues, mutational escape by genetic alteration of the Cys residue
is common, because there is strong selective pressure favoring such
mutation and little selective pressure against it.41 Similar mutational escape would be ineffective for molecules
of the 1/2 scaffold class, because the Lys
residue is essential for the catalytic activity of the kinase targets,
hence there is strong selective pressure against its loss. While the
most promising molecules presented here will require further optimization
to increase potency and to improve the modest ∼5-fold CDK2
versus CDK1 selectivity, the work detailed here provides substantial
enablement for that optimization campaign. Beyond CDKs, we expect
that this pharmacologically privileged scaffold will find broader
utility in the important and burgeoning field of kinase inhibition. The molecule series reported here
