 Synthetic
biology offers a new path for the exploitation and improvement
of natural products to address the growing crisis in antibiotic resistance.
All antibiotics in clinical use are facing eventual obsolesce as a
result of the evolution and dissemination of resistance mechanisms,
yet there are few new drug leads forthcoming from the pharmaceutical
sector. Natural products of microbial origin have proven over the
past 70 years to be the wellspring of antimicrobial drugs. Harnessing
synthetic biology thinking and strategies can provide new molecules
and expand chemical diversity of known antibiotic scaffolds to provide
much needed new drug leads. The glycopeptide antibiotics offer paradigmatic
scaffolds suitable for such an approach. We review these strategies
here using the glycopeptides as an example and demonstrate how synthetic
biology can expand antibiotic chemical diversity to help address the
growing resistance crisis. Antibiotics are among the most
successful drugs discovered and developed over the past century. The
first clinically useful antimicrobial compounds were synthetic molecules
including dyes, organometallic complexes, and structurally simple
aromatic compounds. The discovery and purification of antibiotics
(a term first used to describe antimicrobial compounds derived from
living organisms) such as penicillin, gramicidin, tyrocidine, and
streptomycin in the late 1930s and early 1940s ushered in what has
become known as the Golden Age of antibiotics: a decade and a half
where the products of microbial secondary metabolism were systematically
screened for antibiotic activity.1 The
vast majority of chemical scaffolds in current clinical use can be
traced back to this relatively short period of time. The remarkable
richness of microbial natural products as sources of antibiotics reflects
the fact that they are products of evolution, selected over millennia
for interaction with biological targets. When compared to synthetic
molecules that are generally the result of experimental campaigns
based on chemical diversity that is readily accessible in the lab,
the privileged nature of microbially derived natural products as antibiotics
becomes clear. A hallmark of antibiotic natural products is
their chemical diversity
and complexity (Figure 1). This chemical diversity
is based on the production of chemical scaffolds consisting of peptide,
polyketide, carbohydrate, alkaloid, or terpene backbones that serve
as the core structure. These scaffolds are then modified by a variety
of chemical reactions catalyzed by a broad spectrum of tailoring enzymes
that are co-produced with the scaffold assembly machinery. Scaffold-tailoring
reactions include isomerization and racemization, reduction and oxidation
(including hydroxylation), as well as group transfer such as acylation,
methylation, glycosylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, and halogenation.2 As a result the end products are often chemically
complex, stereochemically intricate, and rich in hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors. For example, the antibiotic erythromycin has 18 chiral
centers compared to none for the synthetic antibiotic ciprofloxacin.
Moreover the macrocyclic polyketide scaffold of erythromycin, 6-deoxyerythronolide,
is further modified by glycosylation by two unusual carbohydrates
that contribute to bioactivity and bioavailability to complete the
antibiotic. Nature’s ability to generate a large number of
natural product scaffolds, including the combination of scaffolds
to produce hybrids, and to tailor them in combinatorial fashion results
in near limitless bioactive chemical diversity. Nevertheless, despite
the proven track record of natural products in drug and antibiotic
discovery, they have largely been abandoned by the pharmaceutical
sector in favor of large libraries of synthetic molecules. Figure 1Chemical diversity
and complexity of antibiotics in nature. Antibiotics
derived from microbial sources are rich in chiral centers and hydrogen
bond donors and acceptors and span an order of magnitude in molecular
weight. Chemical diversity
and complexity of antibiotics in nature. Antibiotics
derived from microbial sources are rich in chiral centers and hydrogen
bond donors and acceptors and span an order of magnitude in molecular
weight. The rich bioactivity of natural
products is the result of chemical
diversity that is intrinsically compatible with interaction with proteins,
nucleic acids, and membranes under physiological conditions and fine-tuned
by natural selection. It is therefore not surprising then that natural
products and their derivatives dominate the molecules that find use
as drugs and drug leads including antibiotics.3,4 Yet
despite their success, the drug discovery sector has turned away from
these molecules over the past two decades in favor of small synthetic
molecules. As outlined by Li and Vederas,4 the reasons for the abandonment of natural products by the pharmaceutical
industry are multifactorial, yet there are two significant reasons
for the current emphasis on small synthetic molecules over natural
products. First is the limited number of natural scaffolds discovered
that have proven suitable for downstream antibiotic development. Second
are the significant technical challenges in the identification, purification,
synthesis, and scale up production of natural products for the preparation
of diverse libraries suitable for screening and lead optimization.
On the other hand, synthetic and combinatorial chemistry provide tractable
molecules that, while often lacking in innate bioactivity, can be
readily modified in the lab by medicinal chemists. Drug discovery
firms therefore have largely chosen to forego the rich bioactivity
of natural products, and their associated chemical challenges, in
favor of the predictable outcomes of synthetic chemistry. The fruits
of this emphasis on synthetic molecules are evident in the absence
of new antibiotics brought to market over the past 20 years. There is a growing clinical need for new antibiotics that is driven
by the emergence and prevalence of multidrug resistance.5 As noted by Fischbach and Walsh, our current
arsenal of broad spectrum antibiotics is dominated by only four major
scaffolds:6 cephalosporins, penicillins,
quinolones, and macrolides, all of which were discovered almost half
a century ago. Other distinct chemical scaffolds are also important,
among them glycopeptides, lipopeptides, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines,
but these generally have more narrow application than the “big
four”. The innovation gap in new antibiotic scaffold identification
over the past 50 years has been obscured by the great success in tailoring
of existing scaffolds either by the discovery of natural variants
or by medicinal chemical modification in the lab. The challenges faced
by antibiotic field are emblematic of a general crisis in the generation
of new bioactive chemical matter in drug discovery. Fortunately,
new genomic technologies including rapid and low-cost
DNA sequencing and a growing understanding of the mechanistic details
of natural product biosynthesis, along with innovation in chemical
synthesis and analytical methods, can be combined to expand bioactive
chemical diversity in a fashion that is compatible with high-throughput
technology and begin to overcome the innovation gap in antibiotic
discovery. In order to fully exploit the privileged nature of natural
products in antibiotic drug discovery, what is required is the ability
to rapidly identify scaffolds, tailor them using a collection of modifying
enzymes, and rapidly purify the resulting compounds in sufficient
quantity to generate libraries of molecules suitable for high-throughput
screening. The rise of synthetic biology offers a tremendous opportunity
to address these issues. At the same time, medicinal chemical modification
of natural product scaffolds and de novo compound
synthesis of new natural product-inspired scaffolds will increase
the value of synthetic libraries in drug discovery. Synthetic Biology
and Antibiotics Synthetic Biology
and Antibiotics Natural products are genetically encoded
small molecules. They
represent a rich source of privileged chemical structures that have
evolved over millennia specifically to interact with biological macromolecules.
Nevertheless, there remain some significant barriers for the widespread
integration of natural products in modern high-throughput antibiotic
discovery including issues of compound availability, purity, and chemical
complexity. Fortuitously, the renewed interest in natural products
as drug leads is concurrent with the development of new technologies
in genomics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and chemical synthesis
that are enabling a new assessment of the compatibility of natural
products with modern drug discovery. In particular, synthetic biology
has the potential to play a leading role in this area and holds real
promise to help overcome some of the challenges for increased integration

the number of well-characterized natural product biosynthetic pathways
in the past 15 years. This work is not limited to cases where a producing
organism is known and cultivated, and indeed whole biosynthetic pathways
have been successfully reconstructed from metagenomic libraries bypassing
the frequent bottleneck of successfully culturing natural product-producing
microbes.10 Furthermore, there have been
several examples of gene mutation, deletion, replacement, and introduction
into natural product producing bacteria that have generated new compounds,
an approach termed combinatorial biosynthesis.11 This approach was pioneered by Hopwood and colleagues,
who first genetically manipulated the antibiotic pigment actinorhodin
in the producing organism Streptomyces coelicolor.12 Researchers at Kosan later refined
the combinatorial biosynthesis approach and demonstrated that systematic

what we now
would term “synthetic biological strategies” generally

predictable and unifying rules of assembly and production such that
“unnatural” natural products can be designed and expressed
in large quantities with minimal purification steps. Nevertheless,

of compounds.25 Recent evidence suggests
that gene expression is precisely staged during natural product biosynthesis
with the small molecule products of early gene expression inducing
the expression of late gene expression such as transporters and resistance
elements.26 Also essential is an understanding
of how these pathways draw on host metabolism and what impact this

will greatly improve the recovery of the pure molecules that are important
for reproducible high-throughput testing. Organisms that are robust
producers of natural products (e.g., Streptomyces) offer advantages of intrinsic metabolism that supports secondary
metabolite production, while nonproducers such as E. coli have been successfully manipulated for natural product production.
A collection of optimized potential hosts will no doubt be required
to maximize the production potential of various scaffolds. 3. Robust chassis. Hosts that

are not mutually exclusive and can be complementary (Figure 2). In fact there is a long history of merging synthesis
and natural product biosynthesis in the form of mutasynthesis, precursor-directed
biosynthesis, and semisynthetic medicinal chemistry.30 All of these strategies can be brought together to help

where we
and others have initiated efforts to explore the applicability of
synthetic biology approaches in an effort to expand the chemical diversity
of a natural product class. GPAs (Figure 3)
are critically important antibiotics that target Gram-positive bacteria
by binding to the acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine terminus
of growing peptidoglycan. This interaction physically blocks cell
wall biosynthetic enzymes, inhibiting cell growth and division. They
remain essential drugs for the treatment of life-threatening infections
caused by important human pathogens such as Staphylococcus
aureus and Enterococcus sp. The antibiotics
consist of a heptapeptide scaffold that is matured to the active antibiotic
via a series of tailoring enzymes that oxidatively catalyze 3–4
intramolecular cyclizations and a variety of modifications including
glycosylation, halogenation, acylation, etc. (Figure 4). Two distinct peptide scaffolds that include two unusual
amino acids, 4-hydroxylphenylglycine (Hpg) and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine
(Dpg), are in current clinical use exemplified by vancomycin (Leu-Bht-Asn-Hpg-Hpg-Bht-Dpg)
and teicoplanin (Hpg-Tyr-Dpg-Hpg-Hpg-Bht-Dpg). Since the discovery
of vancomycin in 1953, a large number of GPAs have been isolated.
These molecules generally retain the canonical heptapeptide cores
and vary in their accessorization by various functional groups. Nicolaou
and colleagues have catalogued an exhaustive list of all of the functional
groups attached at various positions in different GPAs.31 The first reported GPA biosynthetic gene clusters
revealed a predicted set of nonribosomal peptide synthetase units
required for assembling the peptide scaffold along with genes encoding
amino acid and sugar biosynthesis, self-resistance, export, and tailoring
enzymes.32,33 This pattern is repeated in all other GPA
clusters (Figure 5). Here we will focus on
the molecules with known biosynthetic machinery, which can be utilized
to assemble novel GPAs using a synthetic biology approach. These include

of chlorination
is the most prevalent modification observed in GPA scaffolds. This
functionalization is also common among the glycopeptide variants such
as actinoidin, complestatin, and kistamycin. Chlorination has been
implicated in imparting rotamer stability to the molecule during the
assembly stage and also in the intermolecular dimerization of GPAs
in solution.31 The GPA biosynthetic clusters
sequenced so far show the presence of either one or two halogenases
in every cluster (Figure 5). They are implicated
in the addition of chlorine(s) ranging from one Cl atom per GPA molecule
in pekiskomycin to four in the case of UK68597. Chemical diversity
is also achieved by the ability of halogenases to add chlorine to
different amino acids of the heptapeptide. Tyr (or its β-hydroxy
version, Bht) at positions 2 and 6 are the most commonly chlorinated
amino acids as seen in chloroeremomycin, vancomycin, balhimycin, teicoplanin,
UK68597, and A47934. Both chlorine molecules are added by the same
halogenase as demonstrated by the deletion of bhaA, the sole halogenase in the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster,
resulting in complete absence of Cl from the resulting antibiotic.38 The halogenase in A40926 biosynthetic cluster
of Nonomuraea sp. shows some variation in function
where it chlorinates Dpg3 instead of Tyr2. Pekiskomycin
is a monohalogenated GPA where the putative halogenase Pek27 adds
a chlorine atom on Bht6. An additional chlorination on
Hpg5 of A47934 is proposed to occur by another halogenase
present in the cluster, StaK.33 Similarly,
a second halogenase is present in the UK68597 cluster, which we attribute
to chlorination of Hpg1 and Hpg5. Thus, the
use of these enzymes in selected combinations provides enough choices

specificity of these enzymes allows additional leverage in modifications.
In the balhimycin producer Amycolatopsis balhimycina, bromobalhimycin and bromochlorobalhimycin were obtained by simply
regulating the concentration of bromine and chlorine salts in the
growth media.39 Halogenation by means
of chlorination
is the most prevalent modification observed in GPA scaffolds. This
functionalization is also common among the glycopeptide variants such
as actinoidin, complestatin, and kistamycin. Chlorination has been
implicated in imparting rotamer stability to the molecule during the
assembly stage and also in the intermolecular dimerization of GPAs
in solution.31 The GPA biosynthetic clusters
sequenced so far show the presence of either one or two halogenases
in every cluster (Figure 5). They are implicated
in the addition of chlorine(s) ranging from one Cl atom per GPA molecule
in pekiskomycin to four in the case of UK68597. Chemical diversity
is also achieved by the ability of halogenases to add chlorine to
different amino acids of the heptapeptide. Tyr (or its β-hydroxy
version, Bht) at positions 2 and 6 are the most commonly chlorinated
amino acids as seen in chloroeremomycin, vancomycin, balhimycin, teicoplanin,
UK68597, and A47934. Both chlorine molecules are added by the same
halogenase as demonstrated by the deletion of bhaA, the sole halogenase in the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster,
resulting in complete absence of Cl from the resulting antibiotic.38 The halogenase in A40926 biosynthetic cluster
of Nonomuraea sp. shows some variation in function
where it chlorinates Dpg3 instead of Tyr2. Pekiskomycin
is a monohalogenated GPA where the putative halogenase Pek27 adds
a chlorine atom on Bht6. An additional chlorination on
Hpg5 of A47934 is proposed to occur by another halogenase
present in the cluster, StaK.33 Similarly,
a second halogenase is present in the UK68597 cluster, which we attribute
to chlorination of Hpg1 and Hpg5. Thus, the
use of these enzymes in selected combinations provides enough choices
to create many backbone variations. Furthermore, degeneracy in reagent
specificity of these enzymes allows additional leverage in modifications.

is a relatively uncommon yet very
interesting modification on GPAs. By loading a sulfate molecule on
the GPA backbone, the sulfotransferases impart a negative charge to
the molecule. Until recently the role of this modification in the
GPAs was not understood, but experiments in our lab show that GPA
sulfation plays an important role in evading the induction of resistance.40 Only two naturally occurring sulfated GPAs,
namely, A47934 and UK68597, have been so far reported. In UK68597
the sulfation occurs on the free hydroxyl moiety of Dpg3 that is not involved in the oxyE mediated aryl
cross-linking with Hpg1. The sulfotransferase StaL in Streptomyces toyocaensis has been shown to decorate Hpg1 of A47934. This substitution is noteworthy since the modification
on Hpg1 is very rare. Additional sulfotransferases have
been discovered recently from screening of soil metagenomic cosmid
libraries. Out of four novel sulfotransferase identified, three belong
to the TEG cluster.10 Enzymes Teg12, Teg13,
and Teg14 have been shown to modify Dpg3, Bht6, and Hpg4, respectively, on the A47934 backbone. The
fourth sulfotransferase, identified on a partial GPA cluster of cosmid
AZ205, is a Bht6 modifying analogue of Teg13.41 By using these enzymes in different combinations,

sulfotransferase to have its 3D structure determined by X-ray crystallography,
which showed that the protein exists as a dimer and has a dimerization
motif unique from the other known sulfotransferases.42 The subsequent determination of the structures of two additional
sulfotransferases, Teg1243 and Teg1444 with alternate regiospecificity, suggests that
these enzymes must have a unique substrate binding pattern in their
variable regions, to orient the active site toward different parts
of the heptapeptide scaffold. Recent updates from co-crystallization
of StaL bound to the substrate (desulfo-A47934) and product of sufate
donation (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate) have improved
our understanding of the reaction.45 It
clearly shows that even though the protein exists as a dimer, only
one of the active sites can accommodate the GPA backbone in proper
orientation. Interestingly, StaL also demands a conformational flexibility
from the canonical cup shape of the heptapeptide core as the enzyme
can only recognize the more planar conformation observed in desulfo-A47934.

can be modified by SAM-dependent N-methyltransferases
that cap the amino terminus of Leu1 of the vancomycin class
antibiotics. MtfA from the chloroeremomycin
cluster is a well-studied example representing the group. The crystal
structure of MtfA reveals that the protein exists as a dimer with
wing-like extensions and the GPA substrate is proposed to bind in
the cleft located at the dimer interface.46 Furthermore, MtfA has some substrate elasticity and can modify the N-terminal Hpg1 of teicoplanin-class antibiotics.
Other variants of this protein exist; for example, M43A is a vancomycin
analogue from Amycolatopsis orientalis, which differs
from the parent molecule in trimethylation of Leu1.47 We have recently identified a methyltransferase
in the pekiskomycin cluster that adds two methyl groups to the amino-terminus
of the heptapeptide. Ristocetin is decorated by two methyl groups
at different positions: one is an unusual C-methylation at the para position of the phenol ring of Dpg3, and
the other is on the carboxyl group of Dpg7 forming a methyl
ester. An orthologuous methyltransferase is also found in the VEG
cluster obtained from an environmental metagenome study.10 The cosmid when expressed in S. toyocaensis conferred methylation of the carboxy terminus of A47934.41 This chemical modification resulted in improvement
of the MIC of the GPA against S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. This demonstrates that even modest
alteration to the molecule indeed can increase antibiotic efficacy.

All of the sugar modifying enzymes identified so far act on one of
amino acids 4, 6, or 7 of the heptapeptide. The phenolic OH of Hpg4 serves as the “hot seat” for loading sugar
moieties on GPAs; this reflects its relative availability for modification
given its spatial separation from the acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine binding region of the antibiotic as well as the role that
sugars at this position play in back-to-back dimerization. The glucosyltransferases
in the chloroeremomycin (GtfB), vancomycin (GtfE), and balhimycin
(bGtfB) clusters transfer glucose from the nucleoside diphosphosugar

aglycons and utilizing over 30 natural as well as synthetic sugar

residues including the aminosugars on vancomycin.50−53 The aminosugars present an independent
platform for further secondary modifications either naturally (e.g.,
acylation in teicoplanin) or by semisynthetic derivatization (e.g.,
alkylation in oritavancin) for improved GPA activity. Thus, glycosylation
serves as an excellent example of the potential of synthetic biology
in harnessing these enzymes in creating diverse GPA libraries. The four-ringed heptapeptide scaffolds of UK68597 and ristocetin
are also glucosylated at Hpg4, whereas teicoplanin (GtfB)
and A40926 (Dbv9) have a GlcNAc moiety at Hpg4. The biosynthetic
clusters of the latter two, along with ristocetin, also include a
mannosyltransferase that modifies Dpg7 with a mannose.
The most unusual sugars associated with GPAs modify the β-hydroxyl
of Bht6. In teicoplanin biosynthesis modification of the
position is catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase (Orf1) that attaches
a GlcNAc moiety. A customized sugar, 4-epi-l-vancosamine, adorns the Bht6 in chloroeremomycin. A set
of five dedicated enzymes are required to mature a putative substrate
TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose in a series of steps involving C2 deoxygenation
(EvaA), C3 amination (EvaB), C3 methylation (EvaC), and C5 epimerization
(EvaD) followed by C4 ketoreduction (EvaE) to form 4-epi-vancosamine.54 An intermediate form of
this sugar, l-dehydrovancosamine, decorates the sixth amino
acid in balhimycin. This is due to a nonfunctional DvaE (EvaE) in
the balhimycin cluster required for the final maturation of the sugar.
Another variant of 4-epi-vancosamine, observed in
the form of ristosamine, is present on the ristocetin Bht6. The lack of a C3 methyl group on ristosamine suggests that the
producer might not have a functional EvaC homologue. A40926 and vancomycin
molecules are devoid of any sugar at Bht6, a key feature
differentiating them from similar GPAs chloroeremomycin and teicoplanin,
respectively. The four-ringed heptapeptide scaffolds of UK68597 and ristocetin

of the secondary tailoring
enzymes identified so far act on the sugar linked to Hpg4 of the backbone. The modifications such as the methyltransferases
(EvaC, DvaC) and the aminotransferases (EvaB, DvaB) involved in maturation
of vancosamine and its analogues in vancomycin, chloroeremomycin,
balhimycin, and ristocetin do not qualify as secondary modifications
since these modifications occur independently toward maturation of
the sugar, before it is attached to the GPA backbone. In teicoplanin
and A40926 the primary sugar GlcNAc undergoes deacetylation mediated
by Orf2* and Dbv21, respectively.55 This
modification paves the way for an acyltransferase to add an acyl chain
on the glucosamine.24 The acyltransferase
is promiscuous in recognizing and loading different acyl chains, thereby
generating many natural variants. Teicoplanin is clinically used as
a mixture of five molecules with acyl tails of varying lengths (C10–C11),
and four more forms have been identified as related substances produced
in relatively minor amounts.56 The lipophilic
nature of the aliphatic tail has been suggested to impart superior
pharmacokinetic profile to teicoplanin. All

solved for two deacetylases (Orf2* and Dbv21) show a unique capping
loop involved in substrate binding.57 Recently
the crystal structure of Orf2* bound to teicoplanin has also been
solved, revealing a cavity lined by hydrophobic residues that can
host the long aliphatic acyl chain.37 Furthermore,
the enzyme also shows a higher affinity and specificity for long chain
carbons compared to C2. This explains the role of Orf2*as a deacylase
shown previously in in vitro assays. In A40926 biosynthetic
pathway sugar oxidation by a hexose oxidase (Dbv29) is an additional
modification that oxidizes C6 of the N-acylglucosaminyl
substituent to N-acylglucuronic acid. The minor change
serves as a block and safeguards the molecule from any further deacylation
attack by Dbv21 in A40926, which was observed in teicoplanin. Interestingly,
during recent structure determination studies of the flavin-containing
hexose oxidase (Dbv29), Li et al. serendipitously discovered a solvent-exposed
reaction intermediate that they cleverly used in generating a series
of teicoplanin analogues with amidated and aminated lipid chains.58 Some of these derivatives showed excellent activity
against vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant E. faecalis strains. This provides yet another example of small chemical modifications

only to the primary sugar (invariably a glucose) on Hpg4. A vancosamine sugar is added on the hexose of the pseudoaglycone
vancomycin by GtfD, to form vancomycin. The same modification is also
observed in UK68597, whereas chloroeremomycin glycosyltransferase
(GtfC) transfers 4-epi-vancosamine on the glucose.
Ristocetin has a crown of three different sugars attached to the primary
glucose. Two putative glycosyltransferases attach a rhamnose and a
mannose to the glucose moiety. A third glycosyltransferase attaches
an arabinose to the mannose. It is not known if the two sugars are
assembled before loading on the GPA or act in a stepwise fashion as
in case of other secondary sugars. The crystal structure of the vancosamyl
transferase GtfD has been solved.59 Walsh
et al. have shown that the enzyme can recognize alternate primary
sugar substrates attached to Hpg4 creating several variants
of the disaccharides including a 4-epi-vancosaminyl-4-aminoglucosyl
moiety on the vancomycin backbone. The availability of two nucleophilic
amino handles (one on each sugar) creates new opportunity for testing
addition of functional groups (e.g., acylation) to create semisynthetic

evolved gradually over the decades. After the Golden Era of antibiotics,
when new antibiotics were hard to find and sufficient genetic understanding
and tools were available, the first foray in the development of “hybrid”
antibiotics was reported by Hopwood and colleagues.12 The use of combinatorial biosynthesis was rapidly adapted
to create libraries of unnatural natural products. Methods for heterologous
transfer of large clusters on multiple cosmids using recombination
techniques were also evolved. Most of the early work was done using
the well-characterized model system of Streptomyces coelicolor as the host. The constraint with this blue pigment (actinorhodin)
producer was a very high pigment background that often masked the
production of new compounds and siphoned off precursor elements necessary
for expression of heterologous pathways. Alternative strains including Streptomyces lividans and Streptomyces albus that showed fewer background host secondary metabolites and receptiveness
for foreign DNA were successfully employed. The CH999 strain of S. coelicolor, with most of the actinorhodin cluster removed,
was among the first designer strains developed as a “clean”
host dedicated for expression of foreign natural product clusters.
Several tools and techniques have been evolved or adapted (such as E. coli-Streptomyces artificial chromosomes, Transformation
Associated Recombination, ReDirect technology among others)60−62 over the years that benefit the process. During this time, a phenomenal
accomplishment was achieved when the Khosla group and colleagues at
Kosan successfully expressed the genes necessary for the biosynthesis
of the erythromycin polyketide scaffold (6-deoxyerythronolide) from Saccharopolyspora erythrea in E. coli.
To achieve this, they reengineered the E. coli strain
and added appropriate promoters to the biosynthetic genes, which could
be readily identified by the host system. Genes for alternate substrates
required for building the polyketide, absent in E. coli, were also added.63 Various bacterial
host systems besides Streptomyces and E.
coli such as Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Myxococcus xanthus, and others have been developed
over the years.64 In the post genomics
era the enormous natural product wealth of the Actinomycetes has been
unleashed. It has opened the genome-wide view of strains and developed
patterns that reveal a relatively conserved essential genomic core
and dispensable arms with natural product pathways. On the basis of
such information and advances in molecular engineering, improved host
systems have been developed in recent years, including a genome minimized
strain of S. avermitilis where 1.4 Mb of the dispensable
genomic region has been removed to develop an efficient and versatile
host.15 The genome reduction channels metabolic
resources toward the production of heterologous molecules as was shown
with streptomycin and cephamycin C overproduction. Similarly the M1154
strain of S. coelicolor has been developed by Bibb’s
group at John Innes Centre, where the four major secondary metabolite
pathways (act, red, cdA, cpk) have been systematically deleted generating
a host with greater heterologous biosynthetic potential.18 Further, mutations in rpoB and rpsL genes that stimulate secondary metabolite production
discovered by the Ochi group65 have also
been incorporated in this strain, further improving heterologous expression.

of a cosmid vector lies in its capacity to carry large “payload”
(up to 300 kb) enough to accommodate virtually any bacterial natural
product biosynthetic apparatus in a single clone. Heterologous expression
of the entire cluster in one of the available Streptomyces hosts should
offer the opportunity to produce many different scaffolds and variants.
The resulting system serves as an optimal chassis on which a variety

(up to 300 kb) enough to accommodate virtually any bacterial natural
product biosynthetic apparatus in a single clone. Heterologous expression
of the entire cluster in one of the available Streptomyces hosts should
offer the opportunity to produce many different scaffolds and variants.
The resulting system serves as an optimal chassis on which a variety
of modifications can be designed using the toolbox of the ancillary
genes. These tailoring enzymes can be sourced by isolating new GPA
producers or from the environmental metagenomes. Conclusions and
Caveats Conclusions and
Caveats A synthetic biology approach is an ideal strategy
for expansion
of the chemical diversity of many natural products. GPA antibiotics
in particular offer an optimal scaffold for this approach since the
necessary assembly lines are known and various tailoring enzymes have
been tested successfully in the manufacture of new derivatives. The
pioneering work done by the Baltz group at Eli Lilly some 15 years
ago anticipated this strategy and offers the first proof of principle.21 By expressing the glycosyltransferases from
the chloroeremomycin producer Amycolatopsis orientalis in S. toyocaensis they for the first time showed
production of two hybrid GPAs in the form of glycosylated derivatives
of A47934. Our subsequent work has helped to decipher the biosynthetic
pathway of A47934 and has led to better understanding of the structure
and functioning of the ancillary proteins, especially sulfotransferases.
Furthermore, the creative exploration of environmental metagenomic
cosmid megalibraries as a source of novel tailoring enzymes has yielded
several novel GPA variants. Given the number of scaffolds, tailoring
enzymes, and the impact that various chemical modifications have on
antibiotic activity, a synthetic biology strategy can yield libraries
of GPAs suitable for screens for bioactivity. A synthetic biology approach is an ideal strategy

there are some significant challenges to the routine
application of synthetic biology strategies in expanding natural product
diversity. Among them are difficulties in heterologous expression
of biosynthetic gene clusters, competing metabolic pathways that siphon
off precious precursors, unpredictable substrate specificity and/or
efficiency of tailoring enzymes, unknown specificity of efflux systems
to deliver new derivatives out of the cell, and the potential generation
of toxic compounds unable to be averted by associated resistance mechanisms.
Some of these difficulties may be insurmountable for some scaffolds;
however, there is reason to be hopeful that for many complex compounds
that are practically inaccessible by total synthesis methods synthetic
biology approaches offer a fresh strategy to explore new chemistry. Nevertheless,

and antibiotic discovery, the need for new medicines, the rich bioactivity
of these molecules, the dramatic advancements in our understanding
of natural product biosynthesis, and the resulting amenability of
the field to synthetic biology solutions are poised to relaunch a
new era in natural product-focused pharmaceuticals. While natural products may have fallen out of favor in modern drug
