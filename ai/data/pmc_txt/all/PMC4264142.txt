Genome shuffling technology was used as a novel whole-genome engineering approach to rapidly improve the antimicrobial lipopeptide yield of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Comparative proteomic analysis of the parental ES-2-4 and genome-shuffled FMB38 strains was conducted to examine the differentially expressed proteins. The proteome was separated by 2-DE (two dimensional electrophoresis) and analyzed by MS (mass spectrum). In the shuffled strain FMB38, 51 differentially expressed protein spots with higher than two-fold spot density were detected by gel image comparison. Forty-six protein spots were detectable by silver staining and further MS analysis. The results demonstrated that among the 46 protein spots expressed particularly induced in the genome-shuffled mutant, 15 were related to metabolism, five to DNA replication, recombination and repair, six to translation and post-translational modifications, one to cell secretion and signal transduction mechanisms, three to surfactin synthesis, two to energy production and conversion, and 14 to others. All these indicated that the metabolic capability of the mutant was improved by the genome shuffling. The study will enable future detailed investigation of gene expression and function linked with surfactin synthesis. The results of proteome analysis may provide information for metabolic engineering of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens for overproduction of surfactin. 1. Introduction 1. Introduction Bacillus strains produce many types of bioactive lipopeptides that are synthesized non-ribosomally by a large multifunctional enzyme complex. Of these, the lipopeptide surfactin is well characterized at the genetic level. Surfactin is biosynthesized by three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, SrfA–C, and by the thioesterase/acyltransferase enzyme SrfD, which initiates this process. Surfactin is a powerful biosurfactant that is known to decrease the surface tension of water [1]. It exerts a detergent-like action on biological membranes, and is distinguished by its emulsifying, foaming, antiviral and anti-mycoplasma activities. Surfactin has many potential applications in plant disease biocontrol [2] and biomedicine [3]. Moreover, lipopeptides are widely used in the food [4] and cosmetics industries [5], and for enhanced oil recovery [6] and bioremediation of oil-contaminated sites [7]. However, the production of antimicrobial peptides in Bacillus is generally less than 1.0 g/L, and even as low as 0.1 g/L for some peptides. Therefore, it is particularly important to improve antimicrobial peptide production in industrially important Bacillus strains. There have been many attempts to increase lipopeptide production, but almost all have focused on the optimization of fermentation [8], isolation and purification [9], or on the regulation of lipopeptide synthesis using genetic engineering methods [10,11]. Although global techniques have been successfully applied to strain improvement, engineering more complex phenotypes requires a more combinatorial approach.

Although global techniques have been successfully applied to strain improvement, engineering more complex phenotypes requires a more combinatorial approach. The synthesis of antimicrobial substances in Bacillus species is closely related to the formation of competent cells and sporulation, with these three pathways sharing the same metabolic network [12]. Surfactin biosynthesis and regulation of competent cell formation are also closely linked. Interestingly, the comS gene, which is involved in competent cell formation, is located in the surfactin synthase gene srfA operon. The expression of comS, srfA and several quorum sensing genes is regulated by a complex network, which includes the extracellular ComX protein and the two-component adjustment system ComPA [12]. Phosphorylated ComA (ComA–P) was shown to promote srfA operon expression by binding to the promoter region. CodY and AbrB suppressed srfA operon expression by binding to the srfA promoter [13]. The signaling protein RapC could inhibit srfA expression by dephosphorylating ComA–P. Additionally, YerP could increase the tolerance for surfactin in Bacillus subtilis [14].

Genome shuffling involves generation of mutant strains that have an improved phenotype, followed by multiple rounds of protoplast fusion to allow recombination between genomes. A strain with a high yield of a desired product can rapidly be obtained by genome shuffling without knowledge of the metabolic regulatory mechanism. We previously described the generation of a high-yield recombinant Bacillus amyloliquefaciens F2-38 (FMB38) strain that exhibited 3.5- and 10.3-fold increases in surfactin production in a shake flask and fermenter, respectively, following two rounds of genome shuffling. Comparative analysis of synthetase gene expression was conducted between the parental and shuffled strains using FQ (fluorescent quantitation) RT-PCR. ΔCt (threshold cycle) relative quantitation analysis revealed that surfactin synthetase gene (srfA) expression at the transcriptional level in the F2-38 strain was 15.7-fold greater than in the parental strain ES-2-4 [15]. However, these results only indirectly identified differences at the transcriptional level in the lipid peptide synthetase gene. Because proteins carry out molecular functions and are responsible for almost all the biochemical activitiesof the cell, a real understanding of biological systems requires the direct study of proteins. The rapid development of proteomics technology based on 2-DE, identification by MS, and bioinformatics provides a good platform for large-scale proteomic studies.

Isoelectric Point and Molecular Weight Analysis of Theoretically and Experimentally Identified Proteins 2.2. Isoelectric Point and Molecular Weight Analysis of Theoretically and Experimentally Identified Proteins Isoelectric points and molecular weights of the identified proteins were determined using analysis software (ImageMaster 2D). Samples were compared with the migration distances of the molecular weight marker, and the pH of the IPG (immobilized pH gradient) strips was used to determine the isoelectric point of the protein spots in the silver stained gel. These values were compared with proteins in the database to assist with identification. Overall, the gel estimated molecular weight and isoelectric point of each protein closely matched the theoretical values, but there were some proteins for which the estimated molecular weight (spots 1031, 1074, 1313, and 1366) or isoelectric point (spots 1023, 1031, 1073, 1074, 1075, and 1262) differed greatly from the theoretical value (Table 1).

The mRNA expression profiles of these genes are shown in Figure 3. The mRNA levels of comA, codY and degU were upregulated in FMB38. The upregulated expression of comA and codY mRNA in FMB38 agreed with their protein levels, although degU showed upregulation at the transcriptional level, but was downregulated at the protein level. This disparity was probably due to a methodological error, different regulation of the rates of mRNA and protein turnover, or coverage of several protein isoforms or several members of a gene family [16].

Proteins Related to Surfactin Synthesis 3.1. Proteins Related to Surfactin Synthesis 3.1. Proteins Related to Surfactin Synthesis Of the 46 identified differentially expressed proteins, ComA, DegU, and CodY were directly related to surfactin synthesis. ComA and CodY were upregulated in FMB38, while DegU was downregulated. The three spots corresponding to these proteins on the 2-DE gels are shown in Figure 4. Marahiel et al. [17] reported that ComA acts as a transcriptional regulatory protein, and can directly bind to the srfA-D promoter, thus promoting the synthesis and secretion of surfactin (Figure 5A). DegU/DegS is an important regulatory protein, and plays a role in many physiological activities of the cell, including the secretion of extracellular proteases, cell migration, and competence. As a protein kinase regulatory protein, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated DegU are also involved in the physiological activity of the cell. Phosphorylated DegU stimulates the synthesis of extracellular protease and inhibits the expression of sigD. However, in its unphosphorylated state, DegU can stimulate comK expression, thereby triggering cell competence. In B. subtilis, DegU/DegS and ComA/ComP act as a molecular switch that controls the occurrence of cellular changes in different physiological states. The physiological state in the later phases of cell growth is closely linked to the synthesis and secretion of antimicrobial substances. Hahn et al. [18] reported that DegU inhibited srfA operon expression (Figure 5B); However, the specific negative regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Hamoen et al. [13], Stein [12], and Serror et al. [19] showed that CodY acted as a transcriptional inhibitor of srfA expression (Figure 5C). Duitman et al. [20] constructed a codY-knockout vector to transform B. subtilis ATCC 6633. The resulting strain, BV12I38, showed no effect of CodY on surfactin synthesis. In the present study, upregulated ComA and downregulated DegU were consistent with a surfactin production increase, which was stimulated by ComA (Figure 5A), but inhibited by DegU (Figure 5B). The upregulated CodY in FMB38 contradicted the surfactin production increase (Figure 5C), contrary to previous reports. This was possibly because the entire network of metabolic regulation relies on signal factors, which both promote each other and are mutually antagonistic. Therefore, the CodY regulatory mechanism in surfactin synthesis in B. amyloliquefaciens requires further study.

As a protein kinase regulatory protein, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated DegU are also involved in the physiological activity of the cell. Phosphorylated DegU stimulates the synthesis of extracellular protease and inhibits the expression of sigD. However, in its unphosphorylated state, DegU can stimulate comK expression, thereby triggering cell competence. In B. subtilis, DegU/DegS and ComA/ComP act as a molecular switch that controls the occurrence of cellular changes in different physiological states. The physiological state in the later phases of cell growth is closely linked to the synthesis and secretion of antimicrobial substances. Hahn et al. [18] reported that DegU inhibited srfA operon expression (Figure 5B); However, the specific negative regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Hamoen et al. [13], Stein [12], and Serror et al. [19] showed that CodY acted as a transcriptional inhibitor of srfA expression (Figure 5C). Duitman et al. [20] constructed a codY-knockout vector to transform B. subtilis ATCC 6633. The resulting strain, BV12I38, showed no effect of CodY on surfactin synthesis. In the present study, upregulated ComA and downregulated DegU were consistent with a surfactin production increase, which was stimulated by ComA (Figure 5A), but inhibited by DegU (Figure 5B). The upregulated CodY in FMB38 contradicted the surfactin production increase (Figure 5C), contrary to previous reports. This was possibly because the entire network of metabolic regulation relies on signal factors, which both promote each other and are mutually antagonistic. Therefore, the CodY regulatory mechanism in surfactin synthesis in B. amyloliquefaciens requires further study. Figure 4Enlargement of ComA, DegU, and CodY protein spots on 2-DE gels.

A further two proteins were involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism, and one protein was associated with co-metabolism, biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism. The synthesis levels of key enzymes involved in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway of glucose metabolism were higher in the genome-shuffled strain. The putative implications of these increases are described below. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase is an important enzyme in the glycolysis pathway of all organisms. It catalyzes the cleavage of 1,6-diphosphate-d-fructose to 3-phospho-d-glyceraldehyde and α-dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and can also catalyze the reverse reaction in gluconeogenesis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenation and phosphorylation to generate 1, 3-diphosphoglycerate with a high-energy phosphate bond. The released hydrogen and electron are then transferred to NAD+ by the dehydrogenase coenzyme, to form NADH. The phosphate radical comes from inorganic phosphate. Phosphopyruvate hydratase catalyzes the reaction with 2-phosphoglycerate to generate phosphoenolpyruvate. Glucose can be degraded in the glycolytic pathway to generate ATP and provide raw materials for the synthesis reaction. Transaldolase in the non-oxidative stage of the pentose phosphate pathway can catalyze the reaction between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 7-sedoheptulose monophosphate to generate 4-phosphate erythrose and fructose 6-phosphate. NADP produced in the pentose phosphate pathway could provide reducing power for the biosynthesis reaction, while pentose phosphate generated in this pathway could then participate in nucleic acid metabolism.

Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is an important enzyme involved in the reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to proline. Because of this function, it was widely believed that pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase played an important regulatory function in a series of pathological and physiological processes such as cell apoptosis. 2-Aminoethylphosphonate-pyruvate transaminase belongs to the Valley-Grass transaminase family, and catalyzes the synthesis of aspartate, which is one of the amino acids that constitute surfactin. We speculate that the increased surfactin production by strain FMB38 is a result of increases in this enzyme. The acetoin reductase 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (YdjL) encoded by YdjL plays an important role in amino acid transport and metabolism [21]. Biosynthesis of many amino acids is closely linked to certain metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Therefore, substances closely related to amino acid biosynthesis could be regarded as starting materials. Under conditions where the expression of enzymes related to amino acid transport and metabolism are increased, surfactin synthesis will also be enhanced in the recombinant strain. Upregulation of NAD synthetase (NadE) improves NAD generation, and thus would greatly improve the metabolic activities in of enzymes using NAD as a coenzyme in the recombination strain. Thus, we speculate that the increase in antibacterial lipopeptide yield accompanies the increased synthesis of key enzymes of the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways. Additionally, the abundance of aspartic acid transaminase and other key enzymes in amino acid metabolism likely enhances surfactin production. Furthermore, expression levels of key enzymes in lipid metabolism, coenzyme metabolism, and inorganic ion metabolism processes were also raised.

SOS response is the emergency effects in case of cell DNA injury or copy system inhibited. The SOS response is caused by the interaction of RecA protein and LexA repressor. RecA protein not only play an important role in homologous recombination, but it is also the SOS response factor initially launched. It can be showed that, in the high-yielding strain, DNA serious injury caused by UV, NTG, and ion beam mutagenesis will lead to a series of complex inductive effects, called emergency response. Emergency response induces the excision and reorganization repair enzymes, elevate the levels of these enzymes within the cell and further strengthen excision repair and recombination repair capacity. In addition, SOS reaction can induce the development of DNA polymerase’s lack of proofreading function, speed up repair, and avoid death, while at the same time increase the mutation rate.

Ribosome size is represented by the sedimentation coefficient S: The larger S value, the larger the particle and the greater the molecular weight. There are approximately 20,000 ribosomes in a vigorous growth bacterial, wherein the protein accounts for 10% of the total cellular proteins and rRNA account for 80% of the total cellular RNA. In 1968, the self-assembly of E. coli small subunit in vitro was researched, and it was found that 30S small subunit with natural activity be formed by adding in 16s rRNA and 21 proteins. In prokaryote 70S ribosome, the 30S subunit (small subunit) contains 22 kinds of the ribosomal protein, and the 50S subunit (large subunit) contains 34 kinds of the ribosomal protein, accounting for 35% of the ribosome.

GroEL belongs to a highly conserved protein whose function is to assist the biological macromolecules correct folding, assembly, degradation and transport as well as improving cell stressor tolerance. When bacteria encounter environmental stress (such as heat shock), they will be high expressed within the cytoplasm to enhance bacterial tolerance, and therefore these proteins are also known as heat shock proteins [22]. GroEL belongs to the chaperonin 60 (Hsp60) protein family which includes cpn60, E. coli GroES/GroEL and Helicobacter pylori GroES/GroEL, etc. These proteins are highly conserved, but also produce cross-reactivity.

The repressor protein can hinder gene transcription by binding manipulate sequence. As previously mentioned DegU (downregulated) and ComA (upregulated) as a transcription factor, the expression change and surfactin production increase in the high-yield strain is closely related. S-ribosylhomocysteinase upregulated in the recombination strain has lyase activity, which is both combined with the iron ions and related to quorum sensing [24].

For the protein function indirectly noted in B. amyloliquefaciens, we can refer to its function in B. subtillis or other microorganisms to speculate. All these indicated that the metabolic capability of the mutant was improved by the genome shuffling. The study will enable future detailed investigation of gene expression and function linked with surfactin synthesis. The results of proteome analysis may provide information for metabolic engineering of B. amyloliquefaciens for overproduction of surfactin.

Image Acquisition and Data Analysis The silver-stained 2-DE gels were scanned at 400 dots per inch using an ImageScanner (GE Healthcare), and resulting images were analyzed using ImageMaster 2D Elite software (version 2.00; GE Healthcare) for spot detection, quantification, and comparative and statistical analyses. Images were cropped and optimized, and then gel-to-gel matching of the standard protein maps was performed. The spot detection parameters were optimized by checking different protein spots in certain regions of the gel, then automatically detected as described above, followed by visual inspection for removal or addition of undetected spots. Spot detection was refined by manual spot curation when needed. Spots that were present on at least two gels of one treatment or control were identified as expressed protein spots. The abundance of each protein spot was estimated by normalizing the spot volumes as a percentage of the total volume of all the spots in the gel to correct for any variability due to loading, gel staining, and destaining. Triplicate gels were used for each sample. The volume of each spot on the three replicate gels was normalized to the total spot volume from the reference gel, quantified, and then subjected to one-way ANOVA. Only those spots showing reproducible and significant changes were considered to be differentially expressed proteins.

First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using an RT-PCR kit (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). Real-time PCR was performed using a real-time PCR SYBR Green Master Mix kit (Toyobo Biologics, Osaka, Japan) on a Rotor-Gene 3000 RT-PCR System (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). Each 25 µL PCR reaction contained 10 µL of real-time PCR mix, 1 µL of template DNA (100 ng), and 2 µL of 10 µM primers (Table 3). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each reaction was performed in triplicate. Following threshold-dependent cycling, melting was performed from 45–95 °C at a 0.1 °C/s melt rate with a smooth curve setting averaging one point. Primer specificity was verified by melt curve analysis. Band intensities were normalized to the 16S rDNA transcript band for 2−ΔΔCt relative quantification. The B. amyloliquefaciens nucleotide sequences for these genes were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database.

Conclusions 5. Conclusions In conclusion, the functions of the identified differential proteins appeared to be interconnected. The results revealed that the improvement in lipopeptide yield in the genome-shuffled strain was not the result of a single metabolic pathway or a small number of proteins, but a combination of gene transcription and translation processes, sugar, protein, and energy metabolism, and many other related factors. Of the 46 identified proteins, ComA, DegU, and CodY were directly related to surfactin synthesis, and we determined that ComA and CodY stimulate surfactin synthesis, while DegU acts as an inhibitor. The integration of proteomic information could offer more rational strategies for the genetic modification of B. amyloliquefaciens cells with an enhanced surfactin synthesis capacity.
