 Pedobacter cryoconitis strain UP508 was isolated
from a soil sample using a mixture of ampicillin, kanamycin, and nalidixic
acid for selection. UP508 was found to produce >30 unknown antibacterial
peptides, of which eight, isopedopeptins A–H (1–8), were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation
and characterized with respect to structures and biological properties.
Compounds 1–8 were all composed of
nine amino acid residues and one 3-hydroxy fatty acid residue, and
the structures were ring-closed via an ester bond from the C-terminal
aspartic acid to the 3-hydroxy fatty acid. The differences between
the peptides were the size and branching of the 3-hydroxy fatty acid
and the presence of a valine or a 3-hydroxyvaline residue. The isopedopeptins
mainly had activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and isopedopeptin
B (2), which had the best combination of antibacterial
activity, in vitro cytotoxicity, and hemolytic properties,
was selected for further studies against a larger panel of Gram-negative
bacteria. Isopedopeptin B was found to have good activity against
strains of WHO top-priority Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory
concentrations (MIC) down to 1, 2, and 4 μg/mL, respectively.
Furthermore, compound 2 had activity against colistin-resistant
strains of A. baumannii, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a MIC down to
8, 2, and 4 μg/mL, respectively. Compound 6 was
tested in an E. coli liposome system where it induced
significant leakage, indicating membrane disruption as one mechanism
involved in isopedopeptin antibacterial activity. Isopedopeptin B
stands out as a promising candidate for further studies with the goal
to develop a new antibiotic drug. The global
spread of antibiotic
resistance threatens many aspects of modern healthcare, and in the
future even the simplest infection or any routine surgery may be dangerous
without access to efficient and safe antibiotics. In Europe, infections
caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are responsible for the deaths
of more than 30 000 individuals per year,1 and estimations in the U.S. show similar figures.2 The situation is expected to escalate in the
years to come. To manage this serious problem, humanity needs access
to new antibiotic drugs but also regulations to limit the spread of
resistance against present and future antibiotic drugs. A large
proportion of the antibacterial drugs used today, and in
the past, originate from nature—either as molecules isolated
from microorganisms or developed from such molecules. Fungi and bacteria
produce compounds with antimicrobial properties, with the assumed
function to mediate interactions with competing microorganisms, to
bring benefits to the producers. One important group of natural compounds
used as antibiotic drugs are peptides produced by fungi or bacteria,
and vancomycin, penicillins, and cephalosporins are all classical
examples of such peptides which influence cell-wall synthesis in the
target bacteria. Over the years, these peptides have served as models
for the development of related improved antibiotic drugs, such as
extended-spectrum penicillins, fourth-generation cephalosporins, and
the recent semisynthetic vancomycin derivative telavancin. Another
important group of peptide antibiotics are the cyclic lipopeptides,
which have a cyclic peptide core carrying a fatty acid tail, exemplified
by the cationic peptide colistin and the anionic peptide daptomycin.
Colistin was introduced more than 60 years ago for the treatment of
Gram-negative infections, but due to toxicity issues, its use decreased
in the 1980s, and now it is used mainly as a last-resort antibiotic
against multidrug-resistant infections. Daptomycin was approved by
the FDA in 2003, for treatment of, e.g., complicated skin and skin
structure infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Cationic peptides
typically exert their antibacterial activity by interaction with negatively
charged components of the bacterial membrane and disrupting its cohesion,
and in the case of colistin, this includes specific interaction with
bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS).3,4 The mechanism
of action of the anionic daptomycin involves calcium dependent oligomerization
and membrane insertion, causing membrane leakage.5 Antibacterial peptides, produced by microorganisms, are
commonly produced by nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS). Nonribosomal
peptides often contain nonproteinogenic amino acid residues, such
as d-amino acids and a great variety of modified amino acid
residues. Examples of such modified residues are the oxidized and
chlorinated tyrosine residues and cross-linked phenylglycin residues
in vancomycin and the β-lactam-thiazolidine structure of penicillins,
that is formed by modification of an NRPS produced tripeptide precursor. Despite the impressive track record of antibiotics discovery in
nature, it was out of fashion for a couple of decades to screen microorganisms
for the production of new antibiotics candidates, but in recent years,
fungi and bacteria are again considered as promising sources for new
chemical entities for development into antibiotic drugs.6,7 One major challenge when searching for new antibiotic compounds
in microorganisms is to find novel drug-producing microbial strains
to investigate. The recently described drug candidate teixobactin8 was discovered in a bacterial strain isolated
using methods targeting previously uncultured bacteria,9 which are estimated to be well over 90% of all
bacterial species in environmental samples. This methodology is expected
to open up an exciting untapped source of bacterial strains for the
production of novel and interesting bacterial compounds. Another recent
approach to obtain previously unexploited drug-producing microbial
strains is to use antibiotic resistance-based isolation of microorganisms.10 This technique is based on the inherent need
for antibiotic producing microorganisms to carry genes for “self-resistance,”
which makes resistant microorganisms likely candidates to produce
antibiotic compounds. The present paper describes the isolation
and characterization
of a family of antibacterial cyclic lipodepsipeptides, isopedopeptin
A–H (1–8) from the bacterium Pedobacter cryoconitis strain UP508, which was isolated
from a soil sample using a resistance-based approach. Several of these
peptides display activity against many important clinical strains
of Gram-negative bacteria, including strains of all the WHO top-priority
human pathogens: carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae, as well as colistin-resistant strains of A. baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Results and Discussion Results and Discussion Isolation of Compounds Isolation of Compounds Isolation of Compounds Culture extracts
of P. cryoconitis UP508 were analyzed by UHPLC-MS,
followed
by database and literature comparison. The observation of the following

and 571.3352 (8), suggested the presence of several unknown
compounds in the extracts. Most of the compounds also had [M + 3H]3+ and [M + H]+ ions, and the presence of several
different charge states suggested the compounds to be peptides. Subsequent
bioassay-guided fractionation of these P. cryoconitis UP508 culture extracts resulted in many fractions with activity
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including the
bacterial pathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii. Antibacterial fractions were
analyzed by UHPLC-MS, followed by database mining, which suggested
the presence of a large number (>30) of unknown antibacterial compounds
with molecular weights in the range 1100–1160 Da, and all the
above suggested peptides (1–8) were
present in antibacterial fractions. Subsequently, small amounts of
compounds 1 and 2, along with several of
the other compounds above, were obtained in semipure form after another
round of preparative HPLC. MIC determination gave preliminary values
<10 μg/mL against strains of E. coli, A. baumannii, E. cloacae, and K.
pneumoniae for several of the compounds, indicating them
to be interesting for further studies. Subsequently, the cultivation
of the UP508 isolate was optimized along with the method for isolation
of the compounds, which allowed the isolation of compounds 1–8 (between 0.66 mg and 7.95 mg each), for further
characterization with respect to structure and biological properties. Culture extracts

Two spin systems, NH–CH–CH2, with chemical
shifts for the CH2 groups in agreement with linkages to
amino groups (δH 3.12/2.91, δC 43.9,
and δH 3.04/2.87, δH 40.6, respectively),
suggested the presence of two 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid residues (DAPA)
in compound 1. A similar spin-system, but extended by
a CH2 group, i.e., NH–CH–CH2–CH2, suggested a 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid residue (DABA) to be
present in 1. Three basic amino acids in 1, i.e., two DAPA residues and one DABA residue, were in agreement
with the presence of an intense [M + 3H]3+ ion for the
peptide in MS analysis. One further spin system was NH–CH,
and by HMBC correlations (Figure 1A) the methine group was determined to be linked to
a quarternary carbon (δC 70.6) which was linked to
two methyl groups and, as judged by the chemical shift, to a hydroxy
group. This suggested the presence of a 3-hydroxyvaline residue (3OHVal)
in compound 1. The final proposed nonproteinogenic amino
acid residue in 1 had a methyl group (δH 1.77, δC 12.5) which was linked to an sp2 CH (δH 5.57, δC 114.1). By HMBC
(Figure 1A), this sp2 carbon was determined to be linked to another sp2 carbon (δC 132.6) and subsequently to a carbonyl
(δC 165.4). If the carbon at δC 132.6
was linked to an amino function, this would make up a 2-amino-2-butenoic
acid residue (ABA), described to be present in many microbial nonribosomal
peptides, with Z-geometry11 or with E-geometry.12 In the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of 1, there were
nine signals from putative amide protons, and eight of these signals
were already assigned to the amino acid residues Phe, Thr, Leu, Asp,
2 × DAPA, DABA, and OHVal, using data from COSY, TOCSY, and HSQC-TOCSY.
The remaining putative amide signal (broad signal at δH 10.22) was thus assigned as the tentative ABA amide proton. Subsequently,
ROESY experiments gave a cross-peak between this signal and the ABA
olefinic signal (Figure 1A), which supported the assignment of the signal at δH 10.22 as the ABA amide proton, but also suggested the ABA residue
to be in the E-configuration in 1. The
proposed 3OHFA, with the spin-system CH2–CH–CH2–CH2–(CH2)n–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3, was identified by combination of COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, and
HMBC NMR data. The terminal CH2 had chemical shifts and
a coupling pattern in agreement with the linkage to a carbonyl (δH 2.69/2.17, 2J 13.8 Hz, δC 39.4) and chemical shifts for the adjacent CH in accord with
linkage to an esterified hydroxy function (δH 4.97,
δC 70.7). HMBC data verified the linkage of the terminal
CH2 to a carbonyl group (δC 167.6). Two spin systems, NH–CH–CH2, with chemical
shifts for the CH2 groups in agreement with linkages to
amino groups (δH 3.12/2.91, δC 43.9,
and δH 3.04/2.87, δH 40.6, respectively),
suggested the presence of two 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid residues (DAPA)
in compound 1. A similar spin-system, but extended by
a CH2 group, i.e., NH–CH–CH2–CH2, suggested a 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid residue (DABA) to be
present in 1. Three basic amino acids in 1, i.e., two DAPA residues and one DABA residue, were in agreement
with the presence of an intense [M + 3H]3+ ion for the
peptide in MS analysis. One further spin system was NH–CH,
and by HMBC correlations (Figure 1A) the methine group was determined to be linked to
a quarternary carbon (δC 70.6) which was linked to
two methyl groups and, as judged by the chemical shift, to a hydroxy
group. This suggested the presence of a 3-hydroxyvaline residue (3OHVal)
in compound 1. The final proposed nonproteinogenic amino
acid residue in 1 had a methyl group (δH 1.77, δC 12.5) which was linked to an sp2 CH (δH 5.57, δC 114.1). By HMBC
(Figure 1A), this sp2 carbon was determined to be linked to another sp2 carbon (δC 132.6) and subsequently to a carbonyl
(δC 165.4). If the carbon at δC 132.6
was linked to an amino function, this would make up a 2-amino-2-butenoic
acid residue (ABA), described to be present in many microbial nonribosomal
peptides, with Z-geometry11 or with E-geometry.12 In the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of 1, there were
nine signals from putative amide protons, and eight of these signals
were already assigned to the amino acid residues Phe, Thr, Leu, Asp,
2 × DAPA, DABA, and OHVal, using data from COSY, TOCSY, and HSQC-TOCSY.
The remaining putative amide signal (broad signal at δH 10.22) was thus assigned as the tentative ABA amide proton. Subsequently,
ROESY experiments gave a cross-peak between this signal and the ABA
olefinic signal (Figure 1A), which supported the assignment of the signal at δH 10.22 as the ABA amide proton, but also suggested the ABA residue
to be in the E-configuration in 1. The
proposed 3OHFA, with the spin-system CH2–CH–CH2–CH2–(CH2)n–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3, was identified by combination of COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, and
HMBC NMR data. The terminal CH2 had chemical shifts and
a coupling pattern in agreement with the linkage to a carbonyl (δH 2.69/2.17, 2J 13.8 Hz, δC 39.4) and chemical shifts for the adjacent CH in accord with
linkage to an esterified hydroxy function (δH 4.97,
δC 70.7). HMBC data verified the linkage of the terminal
CH2 to a carbonyl group (δC 167.6). Two spin systems, NH–CH–CH2, with chemical
shifts for the CH2 groups in agreement with linkages to
amino groups (δH 3.12/2.91, δC 43.9,
and δH 3.04/2.87, δH 40.6, respectively),
suggested the presence of two 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid residues (DAPA)
in compound 1. A similar spin-system, but extended by
a CH2 group, i.e., NH–CH–CH2–CH2, suggested a 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid residue (DABA) to be
present in 1. Three basic amino acids in 1, i.e., two DAPA residues and one DABA residue, were in agreement
with the presence of an intense [M + 3H]3+ ion for the
peptide in MS analysis. One further spin system was NH–CH,
and by HMBC correlations (Figure 1A) the methine group was determined to be linked to
a quarternary carbon (δC 70.6) which was linked to
two methyl groups and, as judged by the chemical shift, to a hydroxy
group. This suggested the presence of a 3-hydroxyvaline residue (3OHVal)
in compound 1. The final proposed nonproteinogenic amino
acid residue in 1 had a methyl group (δH 1.77, δC 12.5) which was linked to an sp2 CH (δH 5.57, δC 114.1). By HMBC
(Figure 1A), this sp2 carbon was determined to be linked to another sp2 carbon (δC 132.6) and subsequently to a carbonyl
(δC 165.4). If the carbon at δC 132.6
was linked to an amino function, this would make up a 2-amino-2-butenoic

olefinic signal (Figure 1A), which supported the assignment of the signal at δH 10.22 as the ABA amide proton, but also suggested the ABA residue
to be in the E-configuration in 1. The

the [M + H]+ ion of 1 (1131.6413), with the
sum of the individual masses of the different amino acid residues
(Phe, Thr, Leu, Asp, 2 × DAPA, DABA, 3OHVal and ABA), a nice
fit was obtained when adding the mass for a 3-hydroxy-9-methylhydroxydecanoic
acid residue (theoretical m/z 1131.6408
for the [M + H]+ ion, difference 0.4 ppm). Thus, compound 1 was suggested to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide containing
a 3-hydroxy-9-methyldecanoic acid together with nine amino acid residues. By comparison of the m/z for
the [M + H]+ ion of 1 (1131.6413), with the

a 3-hydroxy-9-methyldecanoic acid together with nine amino acid residues. As mentioned above, MSMS on the native peptide gave poor yields
of sequence fragment ions, in accord with 1 being a cyclic
lipodepsipeptide. Thus, the peptide was treated with dilute NaOMe
in MeOH to open the presumed lactone. Analysis by MS showed that MeOH
indeed had been added to the structure ([M + 2H]2+m/z 582.334), and subsequent MSMS analysis
gave informative fragment ions which were used for the determination
of the amino acid sequence of 1 (Figure 2). The B-fragment ion series B1–B8 was in good agreement with the sequence (3-hydroxy-9-methyldecanoyl-DAPA)-Leu-DABA-ABA-Thr-DAPA-Phe-3OHVal-Asp-OMe,
and this sequence was corroborated by the Y-fragment ion series Y2–Y8. The 3-hydroxy-9-methyldecanoyl CH group
had chemical shifts (δH 4.97, δC 70.7) in accord with linkage to an esterified hydroxy function,
and furthermore, if the lactone would have been closed to the hydroxy
function of either the Thr or 3OHVal residue, informative N-terminal
sequence fragment ions would have been expected in MSMS analysis of
the native peptide. Thus, compound 1 was proposed to
have the structure cyclo(3-hydroxy-9-methyldecanoyl-DAPA1-Leu-DABA-ABA-Thr-DAPA2-Phe-OHVal-Asp)
(Figure 3). As mentioned above, MSMS on the native peptide gave poor yields

acids was determined using the advanced
Marfey’s method,14,15 by acidic hydrolysis
and derivatization with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-leucinamide
(FDLA), followed by UHPLC-MS analysis. Comparison with commercial
reference amino acids enabled identification of the amino acids as
2 × L-DAPA, l-Leu, L-DABA, l-Thr, d-Phe, l-OHVal, and l-Asp. d-DAPA was also
detected in peptide hydrolysates, but hydrolysis of peptides in H2O/D2O mixtures demonstrated that D-DAPA was formed
by epimerization, as previously observed,16 and was thus not present in the peptide. Similarly, Phe was also
shown to epimerize during the acidic hydrolysis, but to a lesser extent
than DAPA. The configuration of the amino

residue in 1 was determined by Mosher’s method.13 After release of the fatty acid by acidic hydrolysis
of
the peptide, the fatty acid was derivatized with (R)- and (S)-2-methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-2-phenylacetyl
(MTPA) chloride. The crude products were analyzed by NMR in pyridine-d5 and chloroform-d. Comparison
of the proton chemical shifts of H-2, H-4, and H-5, between the products
obtained with R- and S-reagents
(i.e., (R)-MTPA–Cl product – (S)-MTPA–Cl product) gave differences in line with
R-configuration of the 3-hydroxydecanoyl residue (Figure 1B). This was valid for both
NMR solvents. Thus, analysis by NMR and MS, along with chemical degradations
and derivatizations, resulted in the full structure of compound 1 (Figure 3). The configuration of the 3-hydroxy-9-methyldecanoyl
residue in 1 was determined by Mosher’s method.13 After release of the fatty acid by acidic hydrolysis

and derivatizations, resulted in the full structure of compound 1 (Figure 3). Compound 2 was found to have an [M + 2H]2+ ion of m/z 559.3169, corresponding
to m/z 1117.6265 for the [M + H]+ ion, which suggested a difference compared to 1 by a −CH2– group. NMR in DMSO-d6 (Supplementary Table 2) indicated
the presence of the same amino acids as in 1, along with
an unbranched 3-hydroxy fatty acid residue. By comparison of the m/z for the [M + H]+ ion of 2 (1117.6265), with the added individual masses of the different
amino acid residues, a nice fit was obtained when adding the mass
for a 3-hydroxydecanoic acid residue (theoretical m/z 1117.6252 for the [M + H]+ ion, difference
1.2 ppm). Thus, compound 2 was suggested to be a cyclic
lipodepsipeptide containing a 3-hydroxydecanoic acid together with
nine amino acid residues. Subsequent NaOMe/MeOH lactone opening and
MSMS analysis gave the sequence (3-hydroxydecanoyl-DAPA)-Leu-DABA-ABA-Thr-DAPA-Phe-OHVal-Asp-OMe,
and this sequence was corroborated by ROESY and HMBC correlations.
The configuration of the amino acids was determined by acidic hydrolysis
and derivatization with FDLA, followed by UHPLC-MS analysis, to be
the same as for 1. Assuming the same configuration of
the 3-hydroxydecanoyl residue in 2 as for the (R)-3-hydroxy-9-methyldecanoyl residue of 1 resulted
in the full structure of 2 (Figure 3). Compound 2 was found to have an [M + 2H]2+ ion of m/z 559.3169, corresponding

in the full structure of 2 (Figure 3). Subsequently, compounds 3–8 were
analyzed in analogy with compounds 1 and 2, and their structures were found to be very similar to 1 and 2, including the configuration of all amino acid
residues (d-Phe and l-configuration for all other
residues). The R-configuration of the 3OHFA residues was only determined
on 1 and was assumed to be the same on compounds 2–8. The main differences between compounds 3–8 and compounds 1 and 2 are described below. Subsequently, compounds 3–8 were

for the [M+2H]2+ ion (m/z 1143.6419 for the [M + H]+ ion). Compared to compounds 1 and 2, MSMS
showed the structure difference to be in the 3OHFA part of the structure.
The 3OHFA of 3 was found to have 12 carbon atoms, and
additionally, one unsaturation or ring in the 3OHFA. NMR analysis
(Supplementary Table 3) showed the 3OHFA
to be unbranched and to contain one double bond (two olefinic protons
at δH 5.27 and δH 5.40, respectively).
By COSY experiments, it was concluded that the double bond was located
at C-5/C-6 of the 3OHFA. The H-5/H-6 3J was 11 Hz, which strongly suggested the 3OHFA in 3 to
be a cis-3-hydroxy-5-dodecenoyl residue (Figure 3). MS analysis of compound 3 resulted in m/z 572.3246
for the [M+2H]2+ ion (m/z 1143.6419 for the [M + H]+ ion). Compared to compounds 1 and 2, MSMS
showed the structure difference to be in the 3OHFA part of the structure.
The 3OHFA of 3 was found to have 12 carbon atoms, and
additionally, one unsaturation or ring in the 3OHFA. NMR analysis
(Supplementary Table 3) showed the 3OHFA
to be unbranched and to contain one double bond (two olefinic protons
at δH 5.27 and δH 5.40, respectively).
By COSY experiments, it was concluded that the double bond was located
at C-5/C-6 of the 3OHFA. The H-5/H-6 3J was 11 Hz, which strongly suggested the 3OHFA in 3 to

described pedopeptins17 were shown to have
antibacterial activity against E. coli, S.
aureus, and S. epidermis,
with MICs down to 2 μg/mL against the two tested E.
coli strains and down to 4 μg/mL against the two tested
Staphylococcii.19 The MICs for pedopeptins
against two different E. coli strains are similar
to MICs determined for compound 2 against several E. coli strains, but the activity against S. aureus is strikingly different for 2 compared to the pedopeptins.
Possibly, this may be due to differences between the bacterial strains
used in the two studies, but it may also depend on the structural
differences between 2 and the pedopeptins. The previously

Possibly, this may be due to differences between the bacterial strains
used in the two studies, but it may also depend on the structural
differences between 2 and the pedopeptins. To investigate
the mechanism of action of 2 and to
measure the frequency of resistance (FoR), two E. coli strains were incubated with compound 2 at 4 ×
MIC and 8 × MIC. In these experiments, however, no resistant
mutants were observed (FoR < 2 × 10–9 and
<3 × 10–9, respectively), and thus, no information
on the mechanism of action could be obtained by sequencing of resistant
mutants. The pedopeptins, similar peptides from Pedobacter sp. SANK 72003,17 have been shown to
inhibit the binding of bacterial LPS to cellular receptors at very
low concentrations (IC50 11–47 nM).19 Given the similarities between the pedopeptins and the
isopedopeptins (1–8), it is possible
that also 1–8 may interact with cellular
LPS receptors. In the same study, Kozuma et al. found that also polymyxin
B inhibits the binding of LPS to cellular receptors at even lower
concentrations (3.6 nM) than the pedopeptins.19 The antibiotic compound colistin, which is a polymyxin B analogue,
has been described to have specific interactions with bacterial LPS
but also general detergent type membrane effects.3 Colistin and polymyxin B are both polycationic due to the
presence of the amino functions of the five DABA side-chains in their
structures. Compounds 1–8 and the
pedopeptins, with one DABA and two DAPA residues, are also cationic
at physiological pH. Cationic peptides are well-documented to interact
with negative structure elements of membrane components,5 and likely, 1–8 exert their activity by interaction with bacterial membranes. Potentially, 1–8 and the pedopeptins have a similar
mechanism of action to that of colistin, i.e., binding to LPS and
a general detergent effect on bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. However,
in the present study, compound 2 was found to have potent
activity also against colistin-resistant strains of A. baumannii, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae (Table 3). The E.
coli strains carrying the mobilized colistin resistance gene
(mcr-1, Table 3) have an LPS with phosphoetanolamine residues bound to the
lipid A part, which decreases the affinity for colistin.20 Thus, if there is an interaction of 2 with LPS, this must be different compared to the interaction of
colistin and polymyxin B with LPS. To investigate

peptides, also other antibacterial
lipopeptides have been reported to interact with bacterial membranes,
e.g., the antibiotic drug daptomycin, which has been shown to have
a calcium-dependent aggregation in bacterial cell membranes, which
creates leakage.5 To investigate if permeabilization
of bacterial membranes could be responsible for the activity of the
cationic cyclic isopedopeptins, compound 6 was tested
in an in vitro bacterial membrane system using large
unilamellar liposomes made from an E. coli phospholipid
extract. Indeed, compound 6 was found to cause membrane
leakage, and the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) was 2.0 μM (Figure 4). In comparison, the cyclic lipopeptide polymyxin B and the
human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, two highly potent membrane disrupting
antibacterial agents, gave EC50’s of 1 μM
and 0.6 μM, respectively (Figure 4). Bacterial liposome permeabilization has a strong
correlation with antibacterial activity and indicates that compound 6 exerts antibacterial activity by membrane disruption. Due
to the structural similarities between all the isopedopeptins (1–8), it is reasonable to suggest that
this could be a shared mechanism of action that at least in part explains
their antibacterial activity. In addition to colistin type

isopedopeptin A–H (1–8) described
in the present paper have interesting
activity against WHO top-prioritized Gram-negative bacteria. In particular,
isopedopeptin B (2), with potent antibacterial activity
combined with acceptable cytotoxicity and hemolysis rates, along with
a low FoR, is a promising candidate for further studies and optimization
with the goal to develop a new antibiotic drug. The isopedopeptins
form the basis of a recently published Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)
application.21 The cyclic lipodepsipeptides
