 The bleomycin (BLM) family of glycopeptide-derived
antitumor antibiotics
consists of BLMs, tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycins (PLMs), and zorbamycin
(ZBM). The self-resistant elements BlmB and TlmB, discovered from
the BLM- and TLM-producing organisms Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94
ATCC31158, respectively, are N-acetyltransferases
that provide resistance to the producers by disrupting the metal-binding
domain of the antibiotics required for activity. Although each member
of the BLM family of antibiotics possesses a conserved metal-binding
domain, the structural differences between each member, namely, the
bithiazole moiety and C-terminal amine of BLMs, have been suggested
to instill substrate specificity within BlmB. Here we report that
BlmB and TlmB readily accept and acetylate BLMs, TLMs, PLMs, and ZBM in vitro but only in the metal-free forms. Kinetic analysis
of BlmB and TlmB reveals there is no strong preference or rate enhancement
for specific substrates, indicating that the structural differences
between each member of the BLM family play a negligible role in substrate
recognition, binding, or catalysis. Intriguingly, the zbm gene cluster from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892
does not contain an N-acetyltransferase, yet ZBM
is readily acetylated by BlmB and TlmB. We subsequently established
that S. flavoviridis lacks the homologue of BlmB
and TlmB, and ZbmA, the ZBM-binding protein, alone is sufficient to
provide ZBM resistance. We further confirmed that BlmB can indeed
confer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases the level of resistance. Bleomycins
(BLMs), glycopeptide-derived
antibiotics produced by Streptomyces verticillus,
are clinically relevant natural products used in chemotherapy treatments
against lymphomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and testicular cancer.1−4 BLMs cause sequence-specific oxidative cleavage of double-stranded
DNA through a metal-dependent mechanism.5,6 BLMs contain
four functional domains (Figure 1): (i) the
metal-binding domain comprised of pyrimidoblamic acid and the β-hydroxyl
histidine, (ii) the DNA-binding domain consisting of the bithiazole
moiety and C-terminal amine tail in cooperation with the aminopyrimidine
ring, (iii) a linker region connecting the metal-binding and DNA-binding
domains, and (iv) the disaccharide moiety responsible for cell selectivity3,7−10 and DNA cleavage activity.11 Five nitrogen
atoms within the metal-binding domain (Figure 1) coordinate iron and oxygen in the active form of the antibiotic.
A crystal structure of BLM bound to BlmA, the BLM-binding protein
found in the native producer, revealed that the primary amine of the
β-aminoalanine moiety of BLM is the axial ligand to the metal
ion in the active BLM–metal complex form.12 Figure 1Structures of selected members of the bleomycin (BLM) family of
antitumor antibiotics. Structural differences between the antibiotics
are highlighted with dotted blue boxes; the five nitrogen atoms that

antitumor antibiotics. Structural differences between the antibiotics
are highlighted with dotted blue boxes; the five nitrogen atoms that
coordinate the metal ion are shown in bold and colored red, and the
nitrogens acetylated by BlmB and TlmB are highlighted with a solid
blue box. The four members of the BLM family selected for this study
are BLM B2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM. The tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycins (PLMs), and zorbamycin
(ZBM),
members of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics, are structurally
related glycopeptides.13−16 There are three major structural differences among these compounds.
(i) The bithiazole moieties in the BLMs and TLMs are replaced with
thiazolinyl-thiazole moieties in the PLMs and ZBM. (ii) ZBM contains
a unique terminal amine compared with the BLMs, TLMs, and PLMs, which
share many of the same C-terminal amines. (iii) The BLMs, TLMs, and
PLMs share the same disaccharide moiety; ZBM features a unique disaccharide,
and TLM possesses an additional sugar in the linker region. The metal-binding
domain, however, is strictly conserved among all members of the family. Antibiotic producers must contain elements within their genomes
capable of providing self-resistance to the compounds they produce.
Generally, there are four major mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics:
antibiotic modification or destruction, target modification, antibiotic
efflux, or metabolic pathway circumvention.17 Antibiotic sequestration, usually stoichiometric, is a fifth possible
mechanism.18−20Streptomyces verticillus contains
at least two of these mechanisms. BlmA, the BLM-binding protein, noncovalently
binds metal-free and metal-bound BLMs, sequestering them and thereby
preventing them from becoming active and cleaving DNA.6,12,20 BlmB, an N-acetyltransferase
that has been previously termed BAT,21,22 transfers
an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the primary amine of the β-aminoalanine
moiety, the axial ligand of BLMs’ metal-binding domain.21,23 Although acetylation does not preclude metal from binding to BLMs,
acetylation inhibits the metal-chelated complex from coordinating
to and/or reducing molecular oxygen, thereby preventing the formation
of activated BLMs.23,24 The resistance provided by BlmB
has been used as a selectable marker in bacteria, fungi, and mammalian
cells.25−28 Comparison of the biosynthetic gene clusters of BLM from S. verticillus ATCC15003,29 TLM
from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158,30 and ZBM from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC2189231 reveals all three clusters
possess homologues of the BLM-binding protein (blmA, tlmA, and zbmA, respectively)
(Figure S1 of the Supporting Information).13 However, only the blm and tlm gene clusters contain genes encoding an N-acetyltransferase (blmB and tlmB, respectively), with S. flavoviridis lacking a blmB or tlmB homologue within the cloned zbm cluster. A protein sequence alignment showed BlmB is
57% identical (64% similar) to TlmB. As described above, ZBM is structurally
distinct from BLMs and TLMs by the presence of a thiazolinyl-thiazole
moiety and a unique disaccharide moiety (Figure 1). The lack of a blmB/tlmB homologue
within the zbm gene cluster led to the speculation
that (i) ZBM might be sufficiently different and is not accepted by
an N-acetyltransferase as a substrate, (ii) a blmB/tlmB homologue may reside outside
the cloned zbm gene cluster, or (iii) ZbmA alone
is sufficient to confer resistance to ZBM in S. flavoviridis. Given the structural similarity among the BLMs, TLMs, PLMs,
and
ZBM, specifically the conserved metal-binding domain, it is easy to
imagine BlmB or TlmB would accept any member of the BLM family of
antibiotics and catalyze acetylation. Surprisingly, BlmB was reported
to be incapable of acetylating PLM or bleomycinic acid, BLM lacking
the C-terminal amine.21,32 Recently, the crystal structure
of BlmB was determined, suggesting that a three-aromatic amino acid
canyonlike groove is responsible for bithiazole specificity, while
an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged Glu188
and the positively charged terminal amine is responsible for the lack
of activity with bleomycinic acid.22 Here, we report the in vitro characterization
of the two known members of the BLM family of N-acetyltransferases,
BlmB and TlmB, and an in vivo investigation of the
resistance mechanisms of ZBM in S. flavoviridis SB9001,
a ZBM overproducer derived from wild-type S. flavoviridis ATCC21892.16 Our findings unveiled that
(i) BlmB and TlmB acetylate all four members of the BLM family of
antitumor antibiotics at the same primary amine of the β-aminoalanine
moiety, (ii) BlmB and TlmB react only on the metal-free forms of the
antibiotics, consistent with the crystal structure of BlmB,22 (iii) there is no significant preference or
rate enhancement by BlmB or TlmB for any of the four members of the
BLM family, (iv) S. flavoviridis does not possess
a blmB/tlmB homologue outside the
cloned zbm gene cluster, indicating ZbmA is sufficient
to confer resistance to ZBM in S. flavoviridis, and
(v) BlmB can confer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases ZBM resistance. Materials

up to 10 μg of ZBM per disk, an increase of >10-fold versus
that of the parent mutant SB9031. S. flavoviridis SB9035 showed a complete recovery of ZBM resistance as compared
to the parent wild-type strain SB9001, presumably because of the enhanced
expression of blmB under ErmE* (Figure 3B). Similarly, expression of blmB in S. flavoviridis SB9001 also increased the level

BLM N-acetyltransferase (BlmB) is a resistance
element found within the blm gene cluster of S. verticillus ATCC15003 that bestows self-resistance to
BLM by acetylating the primary amine of its β-aminoalanine moiety,
the axial ligand of the BLM-metal ion-binding domain. As there are
many examples of bacterial self-resistance elements conferring resistance
to a family of antimicrobial agents,19,38,39 it was surprising to discover BlmB was capable of
acetylating only BLM and not other members of the BLM family of antitumor
antibiotics, particularly PLM, a compound identical to BLM except
for the presence of a thiazolinyl-thiazole moiety instead of the bithiazole
moiety found in BLM.21 A crystal structure
of BlmB implied that a canyonlike groove of three aromatic side chains
is too narrow to accommodate the nonplanar thiazoline ring of PLM.22 Interestingly, the zbm gene
cluster from S. flavoviridis ATCC21892 does not contain
a blmB/tlmB homologue,31 suggesting ZBM, a thiazolinyl-thiazole-containing
analogue of BLM, would not be acetylated by a BlmB-like enzyme. In
this study, we determined whether BlmB and TlmB can acetylate BLM
B2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM, four members of the BLM family, in vitro and investigated the resistance mechanisms of the
ZBM producer S. flavoviridisin vivo. The

a blmB/tlmB homologue,31 suggesting ZBM, a thiazolinyl-thiazole-containing
analogue of BLM, would not be acetylated by a BlmB-like enzyme. In
this study, we determined whether BlmB and TlmB can acetylate BLM
B2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM, four members of the BLM family, in vitro and investigated the resistance mechanisms of the
ZBM producer S. flavoviridisin vivo. Both BlmB and TlmB acetylate BLM B2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM,
but
only the metal-free forms, in vitro. Although metal-free
BLM as a requirement for BlmB activity was previously stated,22 it appeared to be anecdotal as we found no experimental
evidence in the literature. Comparisons of the BLM structures (Figure 4A),12,22,40 free and enzyme-bound, reveal a probable cause for the lack of acetylation
of the metal-bound forms of BLMs by BlmB and TlmB. When metal is coordinated
to the five nitrogens of BLM, as in the case of the Cu(II)-BLM complex
bound to BlmA or the Co(II)-BLM complex alone, the metal-binding domain
forms a compact conformation. Conversely, BLM in BlmB must adopt an
open conformation allowing the primary amine of BLM access to acetyl-CoA.
The tight conformation of BLM when bound to metal likely precludes
the correct binding orientation in BlmB necessary for catalysis and
prevents BlmB from pulling apart the tightly chelated nitrogen atoms
(Figure 4A). Both BlmB and TlmB acetylate BLM B2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM,

BLM reveal its structural
flexibility: (I) free Co(II)-BLM A2 (Protein Data Bank entry 1DEY), (II) Cu(II)-BLM
A2 bound to BlmA (Protein Data Bank entry 1JIF), and (III) BLM A2 bound to BlmB (Protein
Data Bank entry 2ZW7). Enzymes are not shown. Co(II) or Cu(II) atoms are shown as gold
spheres. The five metal-coordinating nitrogens are shown as blue spheres.
For II and III, the bithiazole moieties and C-terminal amines are
cropped at the double wavy lines. The tight conformation of the metal-binding
domain in metal-bound BLM likely prevents BLM from correctly binding
to BlmB for acetylation. (B) Unified model for self-resistance within
the producers of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics as exemplified
by the BLM producer. Activated BLM (or TLM or ZBM) is generated by
binding to a metal ion [M(II)] and molecular oxygen (O2), which is then reduced to form BLM-M(III)-OOH (black box). Resistance
in the native producer is primarily achieved through sesquestration
by BlmA (thick blue box), while antibiotic modification by BlmB (thin
green box) provides an additional mechanism of resistance. BlmB acetylates
the axial ligand of the BLM metal-binding domain, but only in the
presence of metal-free BLM. Acetylated BLM (Ac-BLM) can bind metal,
but O2 binding or activation is inhibited. BlmA tightly
binds metal-bound BLM, preventing O2 binding and activation.
For the sake of simplicity, the coordinated metal ion is represented
as an M. Members of the BLM family are isolated as Cu(II) complexes;
structures have been determined as Cu or Co complexes, and Fe(II)
must bind before activated BLM is generated. Figure 4(A) Conformations of free and enzyme-bound

with four
members of the BLM family, each in metal-free forms, and surprisingly,
both the rates (kcat) and Michaelis constants
(KM) for each member were essentially
equivalent. Comparable Michaelis constants indicate each member, regardless
of its differences in structure, binds favorably for the reaction
to occur. Thus, the narrow bithiazole binding groove in BlmB does
not prevent the correct binding orientation necessary for acetylation
to occur in thiazolinyl-thiazole analogues. A sequence alignment of
BlmB and TlmB reveals only two of the three aromatic side chains in
the canyonlike groove are conserved (Figure S9 of the Supporting Information). One could imagine a
Phe/Val substitution, as in the case of BlmB and TlmB, may provide
the necessary space to better accommodate a nonplanar thiazoline ring.
However, neither BlmB nor TlmB shows a preference for bithiazole as
in BLM B2 and TLM A or thiazolinyl-thiazole as in PLM D1 and ZBM,
suggesting the canyonlike groove plays little role in substrate recognition
and specificity. The BlmB and TlmB enzymes were kinetically characterized

for their sequestration,
and therefore inactivation, of members of the BLM family of antitumor
antibiotics.12,20,41,42 The structure of BlmA, the BLM-binding protein
from S. verticillus ATCC15003, was determined with
bound BLM B2 in both the metal-free and Cu(II)-complexed forms,12 suggesting BlmA can bind either form of BLM
and thus confer resistance in either situation. Given the significant
structural similarity of both BlmA and BLM B2 in both the metal-free
and Cu(II)-complexed forms and the fact that BLMs are isolated as
Cu(II) complexes,15,16,30 BlmA likely preferentially binds metal-bound BLMs in vivo (Figure 4B). As experimentally determined
in this study, BlmB acetylates only the metal-free form of BLMs. As
members of the metal-free forms of the BLM family are incapable of
causing DNA damage,3,43 BlmB and TlmB appear to inactivate
an unharmful form of an antibiotic. Although counterintuitive, covalent
modification of an inactive antibiotic by BlmB or TlmB immediately
after its biosynthesis may provide a preemptive and complementary
mechanism of resistance from self-imposed oxidative damage (Figure 4B) and/or a more stable, yet potentially reversible,
inactivation. It is not clear, however, when and at what level the blmB/tlmB gene is expressed during biosynthesis. We suspect
BlmB or TlmB acts on only the final biosynthetic product, a model
that is consistent with our in vitro data, previously
reported studies,21 and the numerous contacts
BlmB makes with the four functional domains of BLM.22 This hypothesis would rule out BlmB acetylating a biosynthetic
intermediate or precursor. The BLM-binding proteins have long been known

from S. flavoviridis ATCC21892 lacks the blmB/tlmB homologue, implying BlmA or TlmA performs the
essential role in BLM resistance.31 We
now establish that S. flavoviridis does not possess
a blmB/tlmB homologue in its genome. S. flavoviridis therefore appears to forego the BlmB resistance
mechanism of antibiotic modification, and ZbmA alone must be sufficient
to provide ZBM resistance. With these findings and the fact that Cu(II)-BLM
complexes are isolated, we now propose that the mechanism of sequestration
by BlmA, TlmA, and ZbmA is the primary mechanism of resistance. BlmB
and TlmB may then be considered as a secondary mechanism of resistance.
Indeed, we show that BlmB can confer resistance to ZBM in
vivo in the ZBM-sensitive S. flavoviridis SB9031 strain and that introduction of BlmB into wild-type S. flavoviridis SB9001 further increases ZBM resistance
as exemplified by the SB9033 strain. The reacquisition of ZBM resistance
in sensitive strain S. flavoviridis SB9031 by expression
of blmB confirms that ZBM can be inactivated by a
BlmB homologue in vivo and proves BlmB can confer
resistance as the sole resistance element. We previously reported that the cloned zbm cluster

the biochemical functionality and antibiotic
resistance mechanism of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics by
the BLM N-acetyltransferases. Comparison among the blm, tlm, and zbm gene
clusters exposes the evolutionary relationship between the BlmB and
TlmB N-acetyltransferases and the BlmA-, TlmA-, and
ZbmA-binding proteins as mechanisms of resistance to the BLM family
of drugs. On the basis of this study, we now propose a unified model
for self-resistance within the producers of BLM, TLM, and ZBM, with
