Summary The toxoflavin (Txn), broad host range phytotoxin produced by a variety of bacteria, including Burkholderia glumae, is a key pathogenicity factor of B. glumae in rice and field crops. Two bacteria exhibiting Txn‐degrading activity were isolated from healthy rice seeds and identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva and Agrobacterium sp. respectively. The genes stdR and stdA, encoding proteins responsible for Txn degradation of both bacterial isolates, were identical, indicating that horizontal gene transfer occurred between microbial communities in the same ecosystem. We identified a novel Txn‐quenching regulation of bacteria, demonstrating that the LysR‐type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) StdR induces the expression of the stdA, which encodes a Txn‐degrading enzyme, in the presence of Txn as a coinducer. Here we show that the bacterial StdRTxn‐quenching regulatory system mimics the ToxRTxn‐mediated biosynthetic regulation of B. glumae. Substrate specificity investigations revealed that Txn is the only coinducer of StdR and that StdA has a high degree of specificity for Txn. Rice plants expressing StdA showed Txn resistance. Collectively, bacteria mimic the mechanism of Txn biosynthesis regulation, employ it in the development of a Txn‐quenching regulatory system and share it with neighbouring bacteria for survival in rice environments full of Txn. Here we show that the bacterial StdR/Txn‐quenching regulatory system mimics the ToxR/Txn‐mediated biosynthetic regulation of Burkholderia glumae. Schematic of the novel Txn‐quenching gene regulation identified in two Txn‐resistant bacteria, Sphingomonas adhesiva and Agrobacterium sp., isolated from rice seeds. Exogenous Txn (double hexagon shape) binds to StdR, resulting in StdRTxn complex‐dependent activation of the expression of stdA, resulting in Txn quenching. Microb. Biotechnol. (2021) 14(4), 1657–1670 Introduction Introduction Toxoflavin (Txn) is a bright yellow pigment {1,6‐dimethylpyrimido[5,4‐e]‐1, 2,4‐triazine‐5,7(1H,6H) dione; molecular weight= 193}, which exhibits antibacterial, antifungal and herbicidal activities and is toxic to animals (Latuasan and Berends, 1961; Sato et al., 1989; Iiyama et al.,1995; Cox et al., 2000; Nagamatsu, 2001; Kim et al., 2004). Several bacterial strains are known as Txn producers, including Burkholderia
cocovenenans, B. gladioli, B. glumae, B. plantarii, Pseudomonas protegens and Streptomyces spp. (Levenberg and Linton, 1966; Lynch and Dennis, 2010; Machlowitz et al., 1954; Philmus et al., 2015). It has been reported that B. cocovenenans intoxication caused by two toxins, bongkrekic acid and Txn, produced an average of 288 poisonings and 34 deaths in Indonesia between 1951 and 1975 (Latuasan and Berends, 1961; Cox et al., 2000). The mode of action of Txn toxicity has been proposed: briefly, under aerobic and visible light conditions, Txn functions as an active electron carrier that is reduced and transfers its electrons to oxygen, resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide (Latuasan and Berends, 1961).

Burkholderia
glumae was isolated from an infant with chronic granulomatous disease (Devescovi et al., 2007). B. glumae produces the essential key pathogenic toxin, Txn, which is responsible for the development of the major symptoms of panicle blight (grain rot in Japan and Korea) of rice and wilt of many field crops (Jeong et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004). The Txn biosynthesis pathway of B. glumae has been revealed: the TofRI quorum sensing system and ToxR LysR‐type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) in the presence of its coinducer Txn (ToxRTxn) positively regulate the expression of both toxABCDE (biosynthesis) and toxFGHI (exporter) operons (Kim et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2009).

To attenuate the virulence of phytopathogenic bacteria, quorum‐quenching has been suggested as an antivirulence strategy. Lactonase produced by Bacillus spp. hydrolysed the lactone bond in the homoserine ring of N‐acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), thereby inactivating the signal molecules, and transgenic plants expressing AHL lactonase have been shown to exhibit resistance to quorum‐dependent bacteria (Dong et al., 2001). The acylase is another enzyme involved in the quorum‐quenching (Bokhove et al., 2010). Toxin‐quenching is another antivirulence strategy in toxin‐mediated diseases. To attenuate the virulence of B. glumae, the tflA gene encoding the enzyme Txn lyase was isolated from Paenibacillus polymyxa and transferred into Arabidopsis and rice plants, resulting in Txn resistance (Koh et al., 2011).

Although there have been several studies on the significance of Txn with respect of its pathogenicity and biochemical characteristics, reports on the biodegradation of Txn or the usage of chemical agents including Txn itself for herbicides, pH indicators and anticancer agents are rare. Genes responsible for Txn degradation previously reported include tflA of P. polymyxa JH2 (encoding 221 aa; amino acid residues; Koh et al., 2011), toxM of P. protegens Pf‐5 (137 aa; GenBank accession no. AAY90317; Philmus et al., 2015) and metagenome‐derived txeA (140 aa; GenBank accession no. KT210132; Choi et al., 2018).

Results Results Isolation and identification of the Txn‐degrading enzyme Isolation and identification of the Txn‐degrading enzyme Isolation and identification of the Txn‐degrading enzyme To isolate Txn‐degrading bacteria, healthy rice seeds were germinated in AB minimal medium with 40 μg m–1 Txn. Two bacterial isolates that survived in the presence of Txn were isolated. The isolated bacteria were identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva SG14 and Agrobacterium sp. AL14 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing (> 99% identities) and whole‐cell matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF MS; score 2.2, species identification; and 1.6, genus identification respectively). To identify the genes responsible for Txn degradation, random mariner‐based transposon mutagenesis was performed in S. adhaesiva SG14. Seven mutants of S. adhaesiva SG14, which exhibited growth deficiency in Txn, were isolated, and their transposon‐flanking regions were analysed using touchdown PCR and sequencing. Sequencing revealed that the mutation sites were physically close. Two possible open reading frames, called stdA (Sphingomonas toxoflavin‐degrading gene) and stdR, were identified (GenBank accession no. MH253465) in 2.1 kb‐DNA regions, which were confirmed by PCR analysis using primers StdB and StdH, and sequencing (Fig. 1). One mutant of Agrobacterium sp. AL14, which exhibited growth deficiency in Txn, was isolated, and its transposon‐flanking region was analysed. Surprisingly, a gene 100% identical to that of S. adhaesiva SG14, annotated as glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance/dioxygenase, was identified (Fig. 1).

Using primers StdH and StdB, the region of 2.1 kb‐DNA containing stdR and stdA genes was confirmed by PCR. The gene stdA encodes a protein that expected to be 16.37 kDa with 153 amino acid residues, which was much smaller than the previously reported tflA gene encoding 221 amino acid residues (Koh et al., 2011). BLASTP analysis showed 97% identity with the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily of Klebsiella pneumoniae (GenBank accession no. WP_023288345). VOC is found in a variety of structurally related metalloproteins, including extradiol dioxygenases, glyoxalase and antibiotic resistance proteins.

Txn (100%) and reumycin (> 80%) were degraded by 3 μM StdA–His in 10 min at 28°C; however, other derivatives showed no detectable degradation (Fig. 3E).

StdR regulates the expression of stdA in the presence of Txn StdR regulates the expression of stdA in the presence of Txn StdR regulates the expression of stdA in the presence of Txn To determine if StdR regulates stdA expression, we analysed the expression of stdA::lacZY in wild‐type SG14, ΔstdR and stdR‐complemented strain backgrounds (Fig. 4A). When β‐galactosidase activity was measured in each strain, stdA expression was abolished in the absence of StdR or Txn. StdR induced stdA expression in the presence of 1–10 μM Txn (Fig. 4B). Mutant strains were sensitive to Txn at concentrations higher than 10 μM, so concentrations below 10 μM were used. These results indicated that the StdR positively regulates the expression of stdA, and StdR requires Txn as a coinducer to activate the expression of stdA (Fig. 4B). By combining genetics with gene expression analysis, we propose a novel working model of how bacteria quench Txn (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that bacteria mimic the mechanism of Txn biosynthesis regulation (Fig. 4D) and employ it in the development of the Txn‐quenching regulation system.

Characterization of the StdR, Txn‐quenching regulator Characterization of the StdR, Txn‐quenching regulator Characterization of the StdR, Txn‐quenching regulator The specific DNA sequence of stdR revealed that StdR exhibits functional domains including DNA binding, Txn recognition/response and oligomerization (Schell, 1993; Kim et al., 2009). The sequence of StdR is similar to that of ToxR of B. glumae and contains a helix‐turn‐helix (HTH) motif in its N‐terminal domain (Fig. 5). To determine the regions of StdR important for stdA expression, StdR mutants were constructed in a similar manner as the StdA mutants. The StdR mutants were introduced into the ΔstdR stdA::lacZY mutant strain by conjugation, and their activation activities were analysed via stdA expression using β‐galactosidase assay. We examined six StdR mutants (P9L, V27A, N35S, P39S, L64P and R69Q) associated with DNA binding, three mutants (L106P, L115R and L191H,) associated with the coinducer recognition/response, and three mutants (W234R, G243E and D288G) associated with the oligomerization‐impaired expression of stdA (Fig. 5A and B).

The column denotes the data mean, and error bars indicate the range. Next, we investigated the coinducer specificity of StdR with Txn and its derivatives (Fig. S3). The expression of stdA was induced only in the presence of Txn, indicating that Txn is a specific coinducer of StdR (Fig. 5C).

The stdAR genes are present in a mobile plasmid The stdAR genes are present in a mobile plasmid The stdAR genes are present in a mobile plasmid To determine whether toxoflavin‐degrading genes, stdAR, are present in the mobile plasmid, we performed conjugation assays using the stdA::lacZY mutant strain (kanamycin‐resistant) as a donor. Agrobacterium tumefaciencs C58 harbouring pSRKGm (gentamycin‐resistant) was used as a recipient. The conjugation rates of SG14 stdA::lacZY strain and AL14 stdA::lacZY strain were 2.2 × 10‐7 transconjugants per donor and 2.2 × 10‐9 transconjugants per donor respectively. Transconjugants showing kanamycin and gentamycin resistance were confirmed using multiplex PCR amplification for simultaneous detection of stdA and virD genes (Fig. S4). These results suggest that the toxoflavin‐degrading genes are present in the plasmid and horizontal transfer occurs.

The coding region of stdA was amplified and cloned into pCAMBIA 1300PT, which contains the hygromycin resistance gene under the control of the 35S promoter, resulting in pBS43 (Fig. 6A). Agrobacterium‐mediated rice transformation was performed using rice‐calli inoculation with A. tumefaciens LBA4404 carrying pBS43. Leaf discs of the T1 rice transgenic line, Nd43‐1, showed resistance against Txn up to 20 µg ml–1 (Fig. 6B). Wild‐type Nakdongbyeo was sensitive to 5 µg ml–1 Txn and showed complete chlorosis in 20 µg ml–1 Txn under light conditions. However, the Nd43‐1 line showed chlorosis only at the merged regions of leaf discs in 20 µg ml–1 Txn (Fig. 6B). These results were confirmed by the quantification of chlorophyll. As the Txn concentration increased, the chlorophyll levels in wild‐type rice leaf discs gradually decreased (Fig. 6B). The Nd43‐1 line exhibited approximate 60% Txn degradation compared to the wild type (Fig. 6C). Putative T1 rice transformants were verified using reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR with a stdA gene primer (Fig. 6D). These results indicated that rice expressing stdA may be useful in the development of cultivars resistant to rice grain rot.

Discussion Discussion Microbial pigments are receiving more attention in current research as they are widely applied as natural food colourants, fires, antimicrobial agents and cytotoxic activity (Ramesh et al., 2019). Yellow Txn exhibits antibiotic activity against a variety of bacteria, fungi and plants and has mammalian toxicity (Latuasan and Berends, 1961; Cox et al., 2000). This toxin is well known as a key virulence factor for bacterial grain rot of rice and wilt of many crop plants (Jeong et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004). The phytotoxicity of Txn was effective against a broad range of monocot and dicot plants (Koh et al., 2011). Furthermore, Txn has also been shown to demonstrate anticancer activity (Choi et al., 2013a,2013b). These findings led us to investigate the biodegradation and utilization of Txn. In this study, we isolated two bacteria, S. adhaesiva SG14 and Agrobacterium sp. AL14, with Txn‐degrading activity from healthy rice seeds. Surprisingly, even though the two bacteria belong to distinctly different genera, they shared identical nucleotide regions (stdR and stdA) that function in toxoflavin degradation. In this study, we confirmed that the stdAR genes can be transferred by conjugation. These results support the possibility that these bacteria have acquired and shared genes important in antibiotic‐Txn degradation through horizontal gene transfer to allow for survival in the same ecological niche. The Txn produced by B. glumae, causing rice grain rot, has antibacterial‐antifungal activity, so it is difficult for other microorganisms to survive when B. glumae is present. We isolated two Txn‐degrading bacteria in this study, as well as P. polymyxa JH02 with Txn‐degrading TflA in a previous study from healthy rice seeds (Koh et al., 2011), and these results suggest that Txn‐resistant bacteria are probably well established in the rice grain environment. In order to complete gene horizontal movement, it is necessary to have components including transposable elements, but there is currently no information on whether the stdRA genes are present in these components. It could be interpreted as the result of a war between a rice parasite that use Txn as a weapon and saprophytes trying to overcome it. In addition, it is analysing the extent of matching around two matching genes. Achieved through horizontal gene transfer, the acquisition of antibiotic resistance is necessary for survival in the ecological niche of agricultural animals and humans frequently treated with antibiotics against many bacterial pathogens (O’Brien, 2002). Many variations among closely related bacterial genomes are due to gains and losses of genes that are acquired horizontally as well as to gene duplications and larger amplifications (Francino, 2012). Recently, many findings suggest that specific plasmid might be able to overcome horizontal transfer barriers including host range, phylogenetic and ecological habitat (Zrimec, 2020; Zurfluh et al., 2020).

The majority of dioxygenases fully incorporated dioxygen into their substrates, and a variety of cofactor schemes are used to achieve this activity. The most widely observed cofactor involved in dioxygenase reactions is iron. The Txn‐degrading enzyme TflA and TxeA require the Mn(II) ion for Txn degradation (Koh et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2018). Metal ions were not required for the Txn‐degrading activity of StdA‐His, indicating that StdA has novelty that can be distinguished from many known members of the dioxygenase superfamily. Characterization of StdA mutations trough single amino acid substitutions and high‐resolution crystallographic analysis may be required to define the role of specific amino acid residues involved in metal ion independence and Txn binding.

In this study, we found that the expression of stdA is regulated by StdR (LTTR family), in the presence of the coinducer, Txn (Fig. 4). These results revealed that the StdR and StdA system operates only in the presence of Txn, so the energy costs for bacteria are efficiently decreased for adaptation to competitive environments to allow for survival in this ecological niche. Because Txn degradation is an energetically expensive process in the absence of Txn, bacteria use complicated regulatory networks to conserve energy and to compete for appropriate niches for survival. There are many other examples of similar regulatory systems, allowing genes to be expressed only when they are needed to utilize or degrade exogenous compounds, such as the use of lactose. In addition, in S. coelicolor, the two components VanRS regulate the expression of vancomycin resistance genes only when vancomycin is present (Hutchings et al., 2006). In the case of flagella biosynthesis, flagellum genes of bacteria are most likely regulated on multiple levels to conserve energy and to promote the transition between different bacterial developmental phases (Macnab, 1996; Kim et al., 2007; Zan et al., 2015). Our StdRA regulation was unique compared with a previous report that tflA, which encodes a Txn‐degrading enzyme, existed independently without a regulator (Koh et al., 2011).

Our StdRA regulation was unique compared with a previous report that tflA, which encodes a Txn‐degrading enzyme, existed independently without a regulator (Koh et al., 2011). It is interesting that StdA is specific for Txn and does not degrade the other derivatives except reumycin without a single methyl group. However, reumycin does not act as a StdR coinducer and consequently does not induce stdA expression in vivo. The interaction of StdR with the DNA region of the stdA promoter is central to the control of stdA transcription. Currently, we do not have direct evidence of the interaction between StdR and the stdA promoter DNA region. To perform electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the StdR was overexpressed in E. coli. Overexpressed StdR was collected in the pellet fraction. We used previously reported methods, such as temperature variation, IPTG concentration, incubation time, Txn induction, sorbitol supplement using betaine and the use of sarkosyl, to improve protein solubility, but StdR remained in the pellet fraction.

The generation of transgenic plants with agriculturally improved features will improve agricultural production and economy. The selection of transgenic plants from wild types is crucial in the development of plant transformation methods. The current antibiotic and herbicide resistance selection systems have many issues, and their uses can be limited. Therefore, a more efficient and safe selection marker system is in high demand. Txn is a known photosensitizer and may be useful as a new selection agent for the generation of transgenic plants, as reported previously (Koh et al., 2011). To determine whether transgenic plants expressing stdA are resistant to Txn, we transformed stdA into rice. Through rice transformation, it was possible to ensure that StdA‐expressing rice plants degrade Txn to make it resistant to Txn.

Engineering microbial agents for the biocontrol of plant diseases can provide new ways to use natural microorganisms as microbial inoculums, thereby can be used as an eco‐friendly alternative to pesticides (Jing et al., 2020). Inactivation of the negatively‐acting transcriptional regulator or sensor kinase enhanced the production of antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which contributed to improving the antimicrobial activity to act as a biocontrol agent (Kim et al., 2003; Jing et al., 2020). In this study, the biological control effect on rice grain rot using Txn‐degrading bacteria was not evaluated, so future studies on plant disease control incorporating microbial biotechnology are needed.

In this study, we identified a novel phytotoxin‐quenching regulation of bacteria from rice grain, on which phytotoxin‐producers co‐exist. Our results demonstrate the possibility that if the population of phytotoxin‐quenchers were to overwhelm that of producers, the toxicity would be reduced. Manipulating the microbial ecosystem will be an alternative strategy for controlling plant disease. This is the first study to demonstrate that the LysR‐type regulator StdR and its coinducer Txn activate expression of the Txn‐degrading enzyme StdA. The characterization of StdA may enable the development of disease‐resistant crop plants.

To generate the non‐polar deletion mutant, the outside DNA fragments (approximately 500 bp) of the target gene were amplified. These DNA fragments were upstream (amplified by primers 1 and 2) and downstream (amplified by primers 3 and 4) of the gene to be deleted. Primers 2 and 3 were designed with complementary sequences at the 5′ ends to allow splicing by overlapping extension, as described previously (Merritt et al., 2007). The DNA fragments were purified and used as a template for five cycles of PCR. A final PCR was performed with primers 1 and 4 using the short PCR product as a template. The resulting product was cloned into pGEM‐T Easy and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragment was excised using appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the suicide vector pNPTS138‐R6KT. Derivatives of pNPTS138‐R6KT were introduced into SG14 by conjugation. Single cross‐over integrants were selected by growth on LB plates supplemented with rifampicin and kanamycin. Single colonies were grown overnight in LB with rifampicin and spread on LB containing 5% sucrose. Excision of the integrated plasmid was confirmed by patching onto LB supplemented with kanamycin or sucrose. Kanamycin‐sensitive colonies were selected and deletion of the targeted DNA was confirmed by diagnostic PCR and DNA sequencing of the product.

StdA‐His was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as described by the manufacturer (Novagen) and purified using a Ni‐NTA spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The eluted protein was dialysed with 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) buffer, and the concentration of the purified protein was measured using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Bradford, 1976). The enzyme assay of purified StdA‐His was performed as described previously, with some modifications (Koh et al., 2011). Purified StdA‐His was assayed in vitro to determine the optimum pH, temperature and dithiothreitol (DTT) requirements to degrade Txn by thin‐layer chromatography (TLC). StdA‐His activity was assayed at pH 4.5–10 and a temperature range of 15–50°C. The enzyme assays were performed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). StdA‐His (3 μM) in assay buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, and 5 mM DTT) and 100 μM Txn were incubated for 10 min at 28°C. The enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of chloroform. The chloroform layer was dried and dissolved in 10 μl of methanol. The methanol extract was developed on a silica gel 60 TLC plate (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) with chloroform:methanol (95:5, v:v). The degradation of Txn and its derivatives were detected under ultraviolet light (254 or 365 nm). We previously demonstrated that TLC analysis is a simple and easy method for the detection of Txn and its derivatives (Kim et al., 2004; Koh et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2013a,2013b).

Conclusion Conclusion Toxoflavin (Txn), broad host range phytotoxin produced by a variety of bacteria, is a key pathogenicity factor of Burkholderia glumae in rice and field crops. Two bacteria exhibiting Txn‐degrading activity were identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva and Agrobacterium sp. respectively. The genes stdR and stdA, which are responsible for Txn degradation of both bacterial isolates, were identical, indicating that horizontal gene transfer occurred between microbial communities in the same ecosystem. We identified a novel phytotoxin‐quenching regulation of bacteria, demonstrating that the transcriptional regulator StdR positively regulates expression of the stdA gene, which encodes a Txn‐degrading enzyme, in the presence of Txn as a coinducer. Amino acid sequence of StdA exhibited similarity with a metalloenzyme, but metal ions were not required for Txn degradation. Rice plants expressing StdA showed Txn resistance.
