The anti-coccidiosis agent salinomycin is a polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces albus BK3-25 with a remarkable titer of 18 g/L at flask scale, suggesting a highly efficient export system. It is worth identifying the involved exporter genes for further titer improvement. In this study, a titer gradient was achieved by varying soybean oil concentrations in a fermentation medium, and the corresponding transcriptomes were studied. Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified eight putative transporter genes, whose transcription increased when the oil content was increased and ranked top among up-regulated genes at higher oil concentrations. All eight genes were proved to be positively involved in salinomycin export through gene deletion and trans-complementation in the mutants, and they showed constitutive expression in the early growth stage, whose overexpression in BK3-25 led to a 7.20–69.75% titer increase in salinomycin. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of SLNHY_0929 or SLNHY_1893 rendered the host Streptomyces lividans with improved resistance to salinomycin. Interestingly, SLNHY_0929 was found to be a polyether-specific transporter because the titers of monensin, lasalocid, and nigericin were also increased by 124.6%, 60.4%, and 77.5%, respectively, through its overexpression in the corresponding producing strains. In conclusion, a transcriptome-based strategy was developed to mine genes involved in salinomycin export, which may pave the way for further salinomycin titer improvement and the identification of transporter genes involved in the biosynthesis of other antibiotics. 1. Introduction 1. Introduction Polyether antibiotics, also called polyether ionophores, are a broad class of natural compounds produced by actinomycetes, with the vast majority being derived from the genera Streptomyces and Actinomadura [1]. In recent years, with the discovery of over 120 novel molecules, these chemicals have received more and more attention. Typical polyether antibiotics, including salinomycin, nigericin, lasalocid, and monesin (Figure 1), feature 2–5 ether oxygen atoms and a carboxyl group [2]. This structure enables them to chelate with metal cations, such as Na+ and K+, and protons to form neutral coordination compounds, which cross the cell membrane and subsequently change ion gradients and osmotic pressures, thus resulting in cell death [1]. Salinomycin, a polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces albus DSM41398 and its derived strains [3], is widely applied in husbandry because it has properties that kill Gram-positive bacteria and coccidia [4]. Recent studies have found that salinomycin also inhibits the growth of leukemia stem cells [5] and epithelial cancer stem cells [6], indicating that it is a potential anti-tumor drug [6].

Recent studies have found that salinomycin also inhibits the growth of leukemia stem cells [5] and epithelial cancer stem cells [6], indicating that it is a potential anti-tumor drug [6]. The high-titer Streptomyces albus strain BK3-25 produces 18 g/L salinomycin under lab conditions [7], but the intracellular accumulation of salinomycin poses a threat to cell growth, which can be released by the strain’s resistance ability [8,9,10]. However, the mechanism underlying this antibiotic resistance remains elusive. According to our previous work, SLNHY_261 (slnTII) and SLNHY_262 (slnTI) in a salinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), encoding the ATP-binding subunit and transmembrane subunit, respectively [11], were thought to form an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) complex participating in salinomycin export. When slnTI and slnTII were deleted in Streptomyces albus XM 211, the salinomycin titers of the corresponding mutants declined by only 27.2% and 45.4%, respectively [12], indicating that there are additional genes involved in salinomycin export, which may be located beyond the salinomycin BGC regions.

Actinomycetes have large-capacity transporter protein systems, which participate in cell metabolism, intercellular communication, biosynthesis, and proliferation [13]. The ABC superfamily [14] and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) [15] are two well-studied classes of transporters. Whole-genome sequencing has illustrated that there are numerous ABC and MFS transporter genes in an actinomycetal genome both inside and outside of secondary metabolite BGCs [13,16]. Wang et al. analyzed transcriptome expression differences with expression profile chips and discovered 13 candidate transporter genes outside the natamycin BGC from Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10 [17]. Chu et al. built a step-by-step workflow based on the TCDB database BLAST, and they included substrate analysis, transporter classification analysis, and phylogenetic analysis to mine BGC-independent exporters. Together with a tunable plug-and-play exporter module with replaceable promoters and ribosome-binding sites, they realized the titer improvement of macrolide biopesticides in different Streptomyces producers [18]. Nevertheless, the current commonly used approaches are mainly sequence-dependent or based on known exporters, and the methods of BGC-independent exporter mining still need development.

Soybean oil serves as the main carbon source in salinomycin fermentation, supplying energy through primary metabolism and precursors, such as malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, and ethylmalonyl-CoA, for salinomycin biosynthesis. Usually, 15% (w/v) of soybean oil is added to the fermentation medium, which is extremely high compared with other antibiotic fermentations. Our previous work revealed that increased soybean oil addition resulted in higher salinomycin production [19], and, thus, we hypothesized that higher concentrations of soybean oil cause a higher transcription of exporter genes.

Transcriptome-Based Identification of Candidate Exporter Genes 3.1. Transcriptome-Based Identification of Candidate Exporter Genes 3.1. Transcriptome-Based Identification of Candidate Exporter Genes We initially assumed that the higher the salinomycin titer, the higher the transcription of the involved exporter genes. In order to establish a titer gradient, different concentrations of soybean oil (5%, 10%, and 15%) were supplemented to the fermentation broth, and the corresponding salinomycin titers were 5.30 g/L, 12.50 g/L, and 17.40 g/L, respectively. Using these three samples, transcriptomic data were collected using RNA-seq technology. According to the hypothetic concurrent relationship between salinomycin titers and the transcription of exporter genes, eight exporter genes with increasing expression patterns and that topped the fold-change of transcription at a higher salinomycin titer were selected from 248 ABC transporter genes and 23 MFS genes in the BK3-25 genome. These eight genes include seven ABC transporter genes, SLNHY_3363, SLNHY_4037, SLNHY_6316, SLNHY_6652, SLNHY_0818, SLNHY_0199, and SLNHY_1893, and one MFS gene, SLNHY_0929 (Figure 2 and Table S3). Although the transcriptions of SLNHY_3363 and SLNHY_0199 at 15% oil supplementation were lower than those at 10%, both of their transcriptions dramatically rose when the oil contents were shifted from 5% to 10%.

Compared with the house-keeping gene hrdB, these exporter genes were actively transcribed at the very beginning and then gradually decreased along with the fermentation process. Since salinomycin obviously accumulated after the first day, as shown in Figure S7, we can safely draw the conclusion that these genes were constitutively expressed rather than being induced by salinomycin. 3.4. SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893 Improved Resistance to Salinomycin in Streptomyces lividans 3.4. SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893 Improved Resistance to Salinomycin in Streptomyces lividans 3.4. SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893 Improved Resistance to Salinomycin in Streptomyces lividans Even though these eight exporter genes were proved to be involved in salinomycin export, we still needed to determine why they functioned in this way. Streptomyces lividans TK24 was found to be susceptible to high concentrations of salinomycin, and the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) was 0.5 mmol/L for the control strain TK24::pIB139. These eight genes were individually introduced into S. lividans TK24. Although most mutants carrying the introduced exporter genes maintained similar susceptibility to salinomycin, TK24::SLNHY_0929 and TK24::SLNHY_1893 rendered the host with an improved resistance as high as 1.0 mmol/L (Figure 5A,B). These data strongly suggest the salinomycin export ability of SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893, which exported the assimilated exogenous salinomycin out of S. lividans TK24.

SLNHY_0929 Was a Universal Exporter for Polyether Antibiotics with Similar Structure with Salinomycin 3.5. SLNHY_0929 Was a Universal Exporter for Polyether Antibiotics with Similar Structure with Salinomycin 3.5. SLNHY_0929 Was a Universal Exporter for Polyether Antibiotics with Similar Structure with Salinomycin Since most polyether antibiotics shared similar hydrophobic structures, we wondered whether the exporter genes were universal in pumping them out and whether the genes played roles in improving their titers. Therefore, the three exporter genes with the most substantial effects on salinomycin titers when over-expressed in BK3-25, i.e., SLNHY_0929, SLNHY_3363 and, SLNHY_4037, were heterologously expressed in Streptomyces lasaliensis ATCC 31180 (a lasalocid producer), Streptomyces cinnamonensis ATCC 15413 (a monensin producer), and Streptomyces hygroscopicus XM201-ga32 (a nigericin producer). Herein, the previously used PermE* promoter was replaced by a stronger promoter kasOp*, since the latter was reported to work better in XM201 [22,27].

Herein, the previously used PermE* promoter was replaced by a stronger promoter kasOp*, since the latter was reported to work better in XM201 [22,27]. Interestingly, the heterologous expression of SLNHY_0929 resulted in a significant improvement in all three antibiotics, with lasalocid titers from 163.60 mg/L to 262.50 mg/L in S. lasaliensis (Figure 6A), monensin titers from 572.40 mg/L to 1,286.00 mg/L in S. cinnamonensis (Figure 6B), and nigericin titers from 116.77 mg/L to 207.27 mg/L in S. hygroscopicus (Figure 6C). Surprisingly, the heterologous expressions of SLNHY_3363 and SLNHY_4037 had no positive effects on the production of these three polyether antibiotics, even with unexpected, dropped titers, and the reason needed further exploration. Overall, these results clearly show that SLNHY_0929 is a universal exporter for salinomycin, lasalocid, monensin, and nigericin, which shared similar molecular structures.

Transporter engineering has been considered as a promising strategy to maximize secondary metabolite production in bacterial hosts, such as Streptomyces spp. and Aspergillus spp. [28,29]. Except for the exporters located in BGCs, BGC-independent exporters caused by horizontal gene transfer may also contribute to metabolite export [30,31]. To discover transporter genes located far from BGCs, expression profiling, genome-wide knockout studies, stress-based selection, and the inhibitor strategy have often been used [32].

Herein, due to Streptomyces albus’ highly efficient utilization of soybean oil, we found that salinomycin production rose as oil addition rose, and the transcription levels of the genes involved in salinomycin PKS, β-oxidation, and precursor biosynthesis also increased [7]. Since transporters are the essential channels of both precursor import and salinomycin export, they are more necessary with the rise in ionophore product synthesis, so we decided to focus on the study of transporters. Next, we managed to mine eight transporter genes outside salinomycin BGC based on comparative transcriptome data under different salinomycin titers. Furthermore, all eight selected genes proved to be correlated with salinomycin synthesis by gene deletion and over-expression. Among the eight genes, only SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893 encoded proteins that could pump salinomycin out of the cell and, thus, provide self-resistance to the host, according to the heterologous expression in the model strain S. lividans and the salinomycin supplement experiments. Our work constructed a novel method for antibiotic transporter gene mining. The fermentation characteristics of Streptomyces albus with a soybean oil preference were focused and combined with transcriptome sequencing technology, which showed a very successful titer improvement of salinomycin through exporter engineering and might apply to other antibiotics with oil-derived precursors. Therefore, this study also provides an application with great potential in promoting the more cost-effective production of salinomycin and other chemicals.

MFS-type transporters are channels of multiple substrates, such as monose, polysaccharides, amino acids, polypeptides, vitamins, cofactors, secondary metabolites, chromophores, and bases. They can either function independently or cooperate with ABC transporters in metabolite efflux [17]. In our work, the MFS family gene, SLNHY_0929, was heterologously expressed in the producers of other polyether antibiotics, and it showed a broad spectrum of substrate identification, whose protein pumped out intracellular salinomycin, lasalocid, monensin, and nigericin, as well as increasing the titers of each. As a matter of fact, S. cinnamonensis ATCC 15413 possesses a homolog of the exporter gene SLNHY_0929, namely, orf6552, with 93% coverage and 75.81% identity, while none of the homolog is present in S. lasaliensis ATCC 31180 or S. hygroscopicus XM201-ga32. Thus, ORF6552 is considered to be an endogenous MFS transporter, which exports monensin from the host. Whether or not it served as another universal ionophore pump remains to be explored. Compared to specific exporters slnTI and slnTII in the gene cluster, SLNHY_0929 contributed more to salinomycin biosynthesis [12]. Meanwhile, endogenous exporters in lasalocid, monensin, and nigericin BGCs, which provide self-resistance to producing strains, have been reported. Lsd5 in S. lasaliensis showed 53% identity with MonT in S. cinnamonensis, and in S. hygroscopicus, R14/R15 formed an ABC transporter with 71% and 49% identities with the TMD and NBD of the transporter in S. avermitilis’s BGC, respectively [33,34,35,36]. Until now, there have been no data about these self-exporters’ functions on antibiotic production, so we could not compare them with the non-specific exporter SLNHY_0929. However, introducing this MFS transporter improved the polyether antibiotics’ titers by over 60% and almost doubled monensin’s titer, which demonstrates the efficacy of our method for transporter mining. Due to the constitutive expression of these exporter genes, we can safely draw the conclusion that SLNHY_0929 served as a universal and stable pump by flexibly identifying polyether compounds. Whether or not it could recognize other types of chemicals remains unknown. SLNHY_1893, SLNHY_3363, SLNHY_4037, SLNHY_0199, SLNHY_0818, SLNHY_6316, and SLNHY_6652 all belong to ABC transporters; however, they cannot export salinomycin according to the MIC results implemented in Streptomyces lividans. Their functions were speculated to be importers of soybean oil or other small nutrient molecules, or exporters of other secondary metabolites, such as actinopyranone and elaiophylin, whose BGCs were detected in the S. albus genome. Hence, on the one hand, in a future study, intracellular acyl-CoA concentrations will be detected to study whether these proteins pump fatty acids and glycerol derived from soybean oil [37]. On the other hand, we would like to strengthen or weaken the expression of these pumps and observe the production of possible metabolites to identify the pumps’ function.

Additionally, since each transporter exported salinomycin and improved its biosynthesis, it would be interesting to examine whether these pumps are competitive or cooperative. Thus, tandem over-expression of two or more genes will be employed to study their relationship, which may push the salinomycin titer to a higher level. By means of electronic microscope observation and molecular dynamics simulation, the conformation change of transporters during the pumping of salinomycin will be analyzed. Besides export, other resistance strategies, including the inactivation of antibiotics and the modification of function targets, are worthy of study with regard to salinomycin. Further bioinformatic and functional analyses are likely to provide answers to these questions.

Conclusions In summary, we constructed a novel method for salinomycin exporter mining by combining soybean oil preference and transcriptome analysis. We identified eight BGC-independent transporters and verified their functions. Finally, one of them was proved to be efficient in multiple polyether antibiotic-producing hosts. Our work contributes new strategies to further the improvement of salinomycin titers, and it paves the way for increasing the titers of other antibiotics through transporter engineering.
