With the overuse and misuse of antibiotics amid COVID-19 pandemic, the antimicrobial resistance, which is already a global challenge, has accelerated its pace significantly. Finding novel and potential antibiotics seems one of the probable solutions. In this work, a novel Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 was isolated and found to be an excellent source of antimicrobials as confirmed by agar-plug assay. It showed antibacterial activity against infection-causing bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 inhibited the growth methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and ampicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, to get deep insights about the genome and biosynthetic gene clusters producing antibiotics, whole genome sequencing was done. The strain EMB24 is closely related to the Streptomyces longispororuber as revealed by phylogenetic analysis which is a potential source of antibiotics and pigments as undecylprodigiosin and metacycloprodigiosin belonging to the class prodigiosin. Naphthyridinomycin, alkylresorcinols, desferrioxamine B and E, venezuelin, aborycin, MS-271, and siamycin are potent therapeutics that shared 100% similarity with the reference strain as revealed by the online antiSMASH tool.

Keywords Introduction Introduction Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections are expected to kill more people in the coming years than the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has already resulted in multibillion-dollar investments in the discovery of new antiviral drugs, repurposing existing drugs, and developing vaccines (Miethke et al. 2021). The overuse of antibiotics as a COVID-19 (co)treatment has significantly contributed to the ongoing emergence of AMR (Goel et al. 2021a). Unfortunately, the current clinical pipeline has only 41 (60%) traditional (antibiotics) and 27 (40%) non-traditional antibacterial agents, which are insufficient to tackle the ever-growing AMR challenge (WHO 2021). This is accompanied by a significant drop in the success of traditional drug development by high-throughput screening (van Bergeijk et al. 2020).

This is accompanied by a significant drop in the success of traditional drug development by high-throughput screening (van Bergeijk et al. 2020). The Streptomyces genus belongs to the phylum actinobacteria, which is well-recognized for its ability to create a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites, including antibiotics (Costa et al. 2020; Goel et al. 2021b). In addition, the Streptomyces genus alone represents 80% of the richest therapeutic drug-producing family in all kingdoms (Gosse et al. 2019). The rate of success of finding a new drug has significantly decreased primarily due to dereplication. However, advancement in genome sequencing has revealed > 50 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) even in the well-studied Streptomyces species, inferring the breakthrough potentiality in producing novel antibiotics (Ward and Allenby 2018; Belknap et al. 2020).

However, advancement in genome sequencing has revealed > 50 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) even in the well-studied Streptomyces species, inferring the breakthrough potentiality in producing novel antibiotics (Ward and Allenby 2018; Belknap et al. 2020). BGCs are specific bacterial genome loci with clusters of two or more genes required to biosynthesize the natural products (Zheng et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020). BGCs are majorly classified into three types: nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS), polyketide synthase (PKS), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) based on structural differences (Chen et al. 2020). In general, NRPs and PKS are essential targets for discovering natural products because they can synthesize an enormous number of antibiotics and essential therapeutic drugs (Zheng et al. 2019). PKSs are classified into three types based on their organization of catalytic domains: type I, type II, and type III (Wang et al. 2014). Type-I PKSs and NRPS are large multidomain consisting enzymes, each organized into modules. Each module performs a cycle of chain elongation and typically contains at least three domains. In a PKS module, the three domains are ketosynthase (KS) domain, an acyltransferase (AT) domain, and an acyl carrier protein (ACP). Whereas in NRPS module: a condensation (C) domain, an adenylation (A) domain, and a thiolation (T) domain are present (Bloudoff and Schmeing 2017; Komaki and Tamura 2020). The condensation domain in NRPS clusters is responsible for the amide bond formation during the chain elongation step, whereas in PKS, a similar reaction is carried out by KS domain. These two domains are highly conserved and are vital targets for distinguishing between various NRPS/PKS secondary metabolites pathways (Bloudoff and Schmeing 2017).

The current unprecedented rate of Streptomyces genome mining has led to the creation and usage of bioinformatics tools aimed explicitly at discovering BGCs. Bacterial antiSMASH is a robust genome-mining tool that enables users to identify easily, annotate, and evaluate secondary metabolite BGCs (Cibichakravarthy and Jose 2021).

After 24 h incubation at respective temperatures, plates were checked for the zone of inhibition (Balouiri et al. 2016). Results and Discussion Results and Discussion Sequencing, Assembly, Phylogenetic Analysis, and the Genomic Characteristics Sequencing, Assembly, Phylogenetic Analysis, and the Genomic Characteristics Sequencing, Assembly, Phylogenetic Analysis, and the Genomic Characteristics The Illumina-compatible sequencing library for the sample showed an average fragment size of 343 bp, and 7,524,682 reads were generated. Nanopore read statistics were as follows: 136,162 reads were generated with an average read length of 5097 bp. The maximum read length was 58,086 bp, and the minimum was 94 bp. The genome size was linear of 7,252,958 bp size with a GC content of 72.40% and N50 length 7,252,958, contigs 1. The genome consists of 6433 protein-coding sequences with 3150 pseudogenes; in total, 77 tRNA and 18 rRNA were found. The statistical results are summarized in Table S1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 is closely related to the Streptomyces longispororuber (MT760611.1) (Fig. S1), which is a potential source of antibiotics and pigments as undecylprodigiosin and metacycloprodigiosin belonging to the class Prodigiosin (Harir et al. 2018). In addition, genomic comparison analysis unraveled the maximum similarity with Streptomyces sp. ETH9427 (CP029624.1), which is 7,745,357 bp genome (Fig. S2) and has 6864 protein-coding sequences.

Genomic Prediction and Genome Annotation Genomic Prediction and Genome Annotation Genomic Prediction and Genome Annotation The gene prediction from the assembled genome was carried out using the PROKKA tool (Seemann 2014). Out of the 6433 total number of predicted proteins, 6365 (98.94%) were annotated. The gene ontology (GO) of 6365 proteins is divided into three classes: biological process (10 branches), molecular function (10 branches), and cellular component (8 branches). Gene ontology annotation resulted in the top 5 abundant protein functions: DNA-binding protein, transcriptional regulator, transposase, TetR family transcriptional regulator, and oxidoreductase. The complete gene annotation summary and protein predictions are shown in Fig. S3. The predicted genes were subjected to pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Fig. S4). All the genes are mainly concerned around 23 pathway functions of which the maximum number of genes is involved in protein families: genetic information processing (419) and signaling and cellular processes (383). This is followed majorly by carbohydrate metabolism (306), amino acid metabolism (264), and protein families: metabolism (214). There are 28 genes associated with the pathways of metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides responsible for antibiotic synthesis, vancomycin (KO01055), enediyne (KO01059), tetracycline (KO00253), type I PKS (KO01052), along with other potential antibiotics. In addition, 38 genes belong to the pathways of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites: prodigiosin biosynthesis (KO00333) consistent with the 16S rRNA phylogenetic relation with the Streptomyces longispororuber responsible for prodigiosin pigment production; streptomycin biosynthesis (KO00521); penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis (KO00311); neomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin biosynthesis (KO00524); and novobiocin biosynthesis (KO00401) (Table S2).

RAST Annotation and Secondary Metabolites Prediction RAST Annotation and Secondary Metabolites Prediction RAST Annotation and Secondary Metabolites Prediction Fig. S5 shows that 72 genes are involved in stress response, and 46 genes are involved in virulence, diseases, and defense, which may be associated with the upregulation of secondary metabolites to protect nutrients available while switching life from substrate-to-substrate aerial mycelium. In total, 16 secondary BGCs were identified using the online antiSMASH tool predicted for NRPS, Lanthipeptide-class-i, ii, iv, PKS-like, T1PKS, T2PKS, T3PKS, terpene, ectoine, siderophore, RiPP-like, and lasso peptide (Table 1). Region 1 has 100% similarity with naphthyridinomycin and antimycin and 93% with splenocin. Naphthyridinomycin, isolated from Streptomyces lusitanus, belongs to the tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) alkaloids that exhibit strong antitumor and antibacterial activity against MRSA (Zhang et al. 2018; Pu et al. 2013). Splenocins are first reported from Streptomyces sp. CNQ43 shares structural dilactone scaffold identity with antimycins and has potent anti-inflammatory activity (Strangman et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2015). Many of the therapeutic drugs are believed to be produced by Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 as predicted by the online antiSMASH tool such as alkylresorcinols (T3PKS), curamycin (T2PKS), ectoine, desferrioxamine B and desferrioxamine E (siderophore), albaflavenone and geosmin (terpene), venezuelin (lanthipeptide class iv), and aborycin, MS-271, and siamycin (lasso peptide), each of them shares 100% similarity with the reference (Table 1). In addition, ectoines are one kind of compatible solutes produced by microorganisms to cope with the varied habitats due to the continuous fluctuations in the surrounding environmental osmolarity. Ectoines protect DNA from damage by ionizing radiation (Schröter et al. 2017), help stabilize the lipid bilayers (Harishchandra et al. 2010), protect the functionality of proteins caused by various challenges (Kolp et al. 2006), and also confer protection to the bacterial cell at extreme temperature conditions (Salvador et al. 2018; Richter et al. 2019). While iron is an essential trace element used by virtually all microorganisms to carry out critical redox reactions, the bioavailability of this element is low (Emerson et al. 2012). To cope up with the shortage, microorganisms have evolved in many ways to take this essential trace element; one of the ways is the secretion of siderophores. Siderophores are secondary metabolites released into the environment that scavenge iron and make soluble Fe3+ complex, further taken up by the microorganisms via specific receptors (Kramer et al. 2020). Streptomyces sp. EMB24 strain predicted to produce the two potent siderophores: desferrioxamine B and desferrioxamine E, with 100% similarity with the references Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus and Streptomyces sp. ID38640 respectively. Desferrioxamin B has been used to treat iron load in humans and sold under the brand name Desferal (Jia et al. 2017).Table 1Overview of 17 secondary metabolic biosynthesis gene clusters of Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 detected by antiSMASH 2.0 serverRegionTypeFromToMost similar known clusterReference strainSimilarity (%)Accession number1NRPS, lanthipeptide class I, lanthipeptide class II, PKS-like, T1PKS374151,659NaphthyridinomycinStreptomyces lusitanus100JQ996389.1AntimycinStreptomyces argillaceus100LT989885.1SplenocinStreptomyces sp.

Conclusion Conclusion In this study, a novel Streptomyces sp. EMB24 strain was isolated from salt pan, Maharashtra, India. The strain exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against various drug-resistant bacteria growth, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, genome analysis revealed various therapeutics BGCs producing drugs such as naphthyridinomycin, antimycin, splenocin, alkylresorcinols, curamycin, ectoine, desferrioxamin B, desferrioxamine E, albaflavenone, geosmin, venezuelin, aborycin, MS-271, and siamycin, each of them sharing 100% similarity with the reference strain. Isolation, characterization, and purification of the compounds continue to evaluate the potentiality of this EMB24 strain. In this study, a novel Streptomyces sp.
