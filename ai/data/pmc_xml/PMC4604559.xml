However, the role of LDs in resistance to toxins in fungi remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the trapping of endogenous toxins by LDs is a self-resistance mechanism in the toxin producer, while absorbing external lipophilic toxins is a resistance mechanism in the toxin recipient that acts to quench the production of reactive oxygen species. We found that an endolichenic fungus that generates phototoxic perylenequinones (PQs) trapped the PQs inside LDs. Using a model that incorporates the fungicidal action of hypocrellin A (HA), a PQ derivative, we showed that yeast cells escaped killing by trapping toxins inside LDs. Furthermore, LD-deficient mutants were hypersusceptible to HA-mediated phototoxins and other fungicides. Our study identified a previously unrecognised function of LDs in fungi that has implications for our understanding of environmental adaptation strategies for fungi and antifungal drug discovery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Microorganisms have evolved diverse strategies to adapt to various environmental stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Self-resistance in a toxin-producing organism and toxin-resistance in the recipients are some of the most important adaptive abilities. The emergence of resistance to endogenous or extracellular toxins results via one or a combination of the following mechanisms: (i) intracellular modification or degradation of toxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, (ii) target mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and (iii) removal of the toxins by efficient efflux pumps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Numerous studies have shown that subcellular organelles are also involved in resistance to oxidative stress and intracellular toxins. For example, chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes, the major generators of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), harbour antioxidant defence systems that confer resistance to endogenous oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Lysosomes in mammalian cells and vacuoles in yeast are known to degrade molecules, such as nutrients or metabolites, that have essential functions at physiological concentrations but that become toxic in excess<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic intracellular organelles that contain neutral lipids, including triacylglycerols (TAGs) and sterol esters (SEs), as their main constituents. These are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and specific proteins, and they are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. LDs have been assumed to be inert fat particles used to store carbon and energy since they were first recognised in the 19<sup>th</sup> century<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recent evidence has shown that LDs participate in multiple cellular functions, such as membrane trafficking, phospholipid recycling, intracellular protein metabolism and cell signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Macrophages utilise LDs to store esterified cholesterol when excess endogenous cholesterol causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In response to starvation, autophagosomes can mediate the delivery of LD content into lysosomes for degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Notwithstanding the important cellular functions of LDs, little is known about the involvement of LD-mediated resistance in environmental adaptation.</p><p>Here, we show that phototoxic perylenequinones (PQs), which are biosynthesised by the endolichenic fungus <italic>Phaeosphaeria</italic> sp., are taken up into LDs following exposure to light irradiation. This confers resistance in the producer to these phototoxins. Using a PQ derivative, hypocrellin A (HA), as a molecular probe, we found that trapping HA inside LDs resulted in reduced phototoxicity against both the pathogenic fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and the yeast model <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which suggests a function for this exquisite organelle in drug resistance. In addition, mutants deficient in LDs were found to be more hypersusceptible to HA-mediated phototoxins and other fungicidal agents. We believe that this LD-mediated resistance mechanism may provide valuable insights into how self-resistance to endogenous toxins is conferred to toxin producers and how resistance to external toxins occurs in other recipients.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Trapping phototoxins in LDs serves as a resistance mechanism in an endolichenic fungus</title><p>Our previous investigation of an endolichenic fungus, <italic>Phaeosphaeria</italic> sp., from the lichen <italic>Heterodermia obscurata</italic> (Nyl.) Trevis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A&#x02013;E</xref>), led to the discovery of a series of PQs that harbour cytotoxic activity due to the high yields of reactive oxygen species (ROS) they produce upon light irradiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We sought to understand the self-resistance mechanisms that this producer evolved to these phototoxins.</p><p>The perylenequinonoid skeleton of PQs makes fluorescent microscopic analysis a convenient method by which to study these compounds. Examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that the thallus of the lichen was composed of filaments and algae cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). Stereoscopic analysis using z-stacks demonstrated that the filaments were embedded within the lichen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). The filaments produced substances that displayed orange and red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>), in agreement with the characteristics of isolated PQs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The endolichenic fungus <italic>Phaeosphaeria</italic> sp., which produces the phototoxins, was isolated and purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). When the fungus was exposed to light, it grew at a much slower rate compared with that cultured in darkness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). We observed that pigments accumulated in the LDs of the fungi filaments, as indicated by BODIPY staining of the LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F,G</xref>). By contrast, red fluorescent granules were secreted by the dark-cultured organisms (white arrow, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). Because PQs can be activated by light to generate high quantum yields of ROS, especially singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), which results in phototoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, the ability of the microorganism to trap PQs in LDs led us to hypothesise that LDs may play a key role in self-resistance.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used the PQ derivative HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1H</xref>), which is the main constituent in <italic>Phaeosphaeria</italic> sp. and displays potent antifungal, antibacterial and antivirus activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, as a molecular tool for an <italic>in vitro</italic> study. Because it is a hydrophobic agent, HA has a very high octanol-water partition coefficient (<italic>K</italic><sub>OW</sub>) with a Log P greater than 4, and it is easily dissolved in lipophilic solvents. When HA was dissolved in different solvents of variable polarity or in solvents containing triglycerides to mimic LD components, light-driven <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production by HA was proportional to the polarity of the solvents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1I</xref>). The lower ROS production observed when HA was in nonpolar solvents suggested that their localisation in LDs may be a resistance mechanism in this endolichenic fungus.</p><p>To explore whether this specific mechanism is also used by other fungi, further experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of LD size or LD formation on resistance to the phototoxicity of HA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Large LDs confer resistance to lipophilic toxins in yeast</title><p>To determine the relationship between LD size and resistance to external toxins, HA was again used to assess light-induced toxicity in the pathogenic fungus <italic>C. albicans.</italic> The majority of <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain SC5314 cells were rapidly killed by HA when exposed to light irradiation, with few viable sub-populations remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

Further tests showed that the trapped HA reached its peak concentration within 10&#x02009;minutes of incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Using two other PQ derivatives, phaeosphaerin A (PA) and phaeosphaerin C (PC), as probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) or by changing the host from <italic>C. albicans</italic> to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), we observed that the phototoxic PQs were trapped in the LDs of the fungal cells.

We found that larger LDs trapped larger amounts of HA when cells were cultured in YPD medium containing oleate (YPDO), which confirmed the storage function of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We then studied the relationship between the size of LDs and cell fate in response to HA-mediated phototoxins in real time. Time-lapse experiments showed that the onset of cell death was greatly delayed in cells with larger LDs (LLDs) that were cultured in YPDO medium compared to cells with small LDs (SLDs) that were cultured in YPD medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">3</xref>). Furthermore, statistical analysis of survival times revealed that cells with LLDs were much more resistant to HA-mediated phototoxins than did cells with SLDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>LD-deficient yeast mutants are much more sensitive to lipophilic toxins</title><p>To validate the important role of LDs in drug resistance, we tested the susceptibility of LD mutant strains to the toxicity of HA.

Large amounts of ROS were produced in the HA-treated cells cultured in YPD medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,C</xref>). However, <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells harboured larger LDs and produced less ROS when cultured in YPDO medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B,D</xref>). The <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutant strain <italic>dga2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>/dga2</italic>&#x00394;, which has a reduced ability to form LDs, generated much more ROS in the presence of HA-mediated photodynamic inactivation compared with its parent strain BWP17, as indicated by DCF fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A,B</xref>).

Based on these results, we concluded that LD-induced resistance is a result of the cells escaping oxidative damage by compartmentalising toxins into LDs and the consequent sequestration of ROS formation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>LD-deficient mutants are more sensitive to some fungicides</title><p>Taking into consideration the central roles of LDs in self-resistance to endotoxins and drug resistance to extracellular toxins, we were interested in assessing the impact of yeast LDs on other antibiotics. The susceptibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells cultured in YPD or YPDO medium to clinically-used antifungal agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and the quorum sensing molecule farnesol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> was tested. We found that the growth inhibition caused by fluconazole (FLC), terbinafine (Ter), caspofungin (CAS), amphotericin B (AmB) and miconazole (Mic) was not significantly different in the cells cultured in the above two culture media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10A, B</xref>). By contrast, <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells with large LDs were resistant to farnesol compared with cells with small LDs, possibly due to differences in intracellular distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10C</xref>). By examining the intracellular fluorescence distribution of dansyl-labelled amphotericin B (AmB-Ds)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, we found that AmB-Ds was bound to the cytoplasmic membrane and spread throughout the cytoplasm of dead cells rather than localising to specific LDs in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), in accordance with a previous report showing that AmB aggregates in the cell membrane and extracts ergosterol from the lipid bilayers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. This suggested that LDs had a smaller effect on the trapping of most of these clinically used antifungal agents. However, AmB or Mic treatment stimulated an increase in the number and size of LDs in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12A</xref>). A similar result was obtained when farnesol was studied, whereas no significant effects were observed following Ter, CAS or FLC treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12B</xref>). These results suggest that the increased size or number of LDs was a stress response to treatment with antifungal agents, although the cells with large LDs did not escape death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12C</xref>). This is consistent with a previous finding that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducers, such as tunicamycin and brefeldin A, stimulate LD formation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> but do not guarantee cell survival during ER stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>Further testing of <italic>dga2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>/dga2</italic>&#x00394; in growth inhibition assays with CAS, FLC, Ter, farnesol, AmB and Mic showed that <italic>dga2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>/dga2</italic>&#x00394; was more susceptible to farnesol, AmB, and Mic than its parent strain BWP17. However, no significant differences were observed between <italic>dga2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>/dga2</italic>&#x00394; and BWP17 in their responses to other drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Moreover, susceptibility testing of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed that the LD mutants were also highly susceptible to farnesol, AmB, and Mic, especially the strains that could not synthesise TAGs (RSY3290) or neutral lipids (RSY3077) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15</xref>). These data collectively demonstrate that disruption of LD formation renders yeast cells more susceptible to some antifungal agents, although LD-induced resistance was not a universal response to all types of drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings reveal that LDs can trap endogenous or external lipophilic phototoxins and this is a resistance mechanism that protects against toxins in both the producer and the recipient. Starting with an investigation of self-resistance mechanisms in an endolichenic fungus, <italic>Phaeosphaeria</italic> sp., that biosynthesizes phototoxic PQs, we found that the toxins were trapped inside LDs in the producer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1G</xref>). The toxicity of PQs results from ROS formation, particularly singlet oxygen production, following exposure to light. When HA, a PQ derivative, was dissolved in lipophilic solvents that contained triglycerides, fewer singlet oxygen molecules were generated by light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1I</xref>), suggesting that trapping PQs into LDs conferred resistance to endogenous phototoxins. This LD-induced resistance mechanism is also critical for maintaining a lichen community that contains a toxin producer.</p><p>Moreover, yeast cells with larger LDs trap HA and display higher resistance to phototoxicity, suggesting that trapping toxins in LDs is also a mechanism for the recipient to resist extracellular toxins. The reduced phototoxic effect of HA in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can be attributed to the ability of LDs to trap toxins, and yeast with larger LDs may trap more toxins, thus conferring increased resistance to HA-mediated phototoxicity or to the lipophilic agent farnesol. The trapped toxins in LDs lose the ability to induce the production of ROS, resulting in the increased survival of the fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). This is different from what occurs in organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes that employ antioxidant defence systems to protect against ROS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Our findings demonstrate that LDs could be a novel strategy for relieving oxidative stress via trapping of toxins. This observation is supported by the fact that yeast mutants with depleted LD formation are more susceptible to oxidative stress resulting from photodynamic inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>In nature, organisms have evolved multiple strategies for adapting to environmental challenges and, in particular, for counteracting oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.

Physical quenching is the main mode for deactivating lipid-soluble antioxidants and is related to energy transfer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, while chemical quenching prevails in water-soluble antioxidants, and the quencher molecule is generally oxidised or consumed in the process of ROS scavenging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The present findings contribute to our understanding of how LD-mediated trapping leads to the inactivation of the ROS production that generally occurs in response to lipophilic toxins. The main constituents of LDs include TAGs and SEs, which have lipophilic characteristics that give them high affinity to PQs and lay the basis for trapping mechanisms. For large amounts of toxins, trapping in LDs is probably the best resistance mechanism for preventing self-damage.</p><p>Unexpectedly, <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells with large LDs displayed no obvious alterations in susceptibility in response to most of the tested antibiotics compared with those with small LDs following culture in YPD medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). This was probably owing to the polarity of tested antibiotics, which prevents them from dissolving mutually with LDs or to the specificity of their targets outside LDs, as exemplified by the fact that AmB-Ds primarily bind to the cytoplasmic membrane rather than being taken up into LDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). However, the increases in LD size and number observed in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells that were stimulated by AmB or Mic treatment suggested that the generation of neutral lipids is a stress response. Disruption of <italic>DAG2</italic> caused the loss of the ability to form LDs and rendered <italic>C. albicans</italic> more susceptible to AmB, Mic and farnesol treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Moreover, the LD-defective strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was highly susceptible to farnesol, AmB and Mic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. 15</xref>). This implies that the disruption of LD formation results in a suppressed stress response and renders yeast cells more susceptible to fungicides.</p><p>In summary, our investigation of the self-protecting strategies of an endolichenic fungus that involve the trapping of phototoxins led to the determination that fungal LDs play crucial roles in drug resistance and adaptations to stress. Although it remains to be determined whether this represents a more generalised strategy for resistance or self-protection in other organisms, our findings offer new insights into the roles of LDs in resistance mechanisms used by fungi and the development of antifungal strategies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Lichen studies</title><p>Lichen (<italic>Heterodermia obscurata</italic> (Nyl.) trevis) was collected from Yunnan province, People&#x02019;s Republic of China.
