The wide host range and success of these pathogens has been attributed to the production of a photoactivated toxin, cercosporin. We engineered tobacco for resistance to <italic>Cercospora nicotianae</italic> utilizing two strategies: 1) transformation with cercosporin autoresistance genes isolated from the fungus, and 2) transformation with constructs to silence the production of cercosporin during disease development. Three <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> cercosporin autoresistance genes were tested: <italic>ATR1</italic> and <italic>CFP</italic>, encoding an ABC and an MFS transporter, respectively, and <italic>71cR</italic>, which encodes a hypothetical protein. Resistance to the pathogen was identified in transgenic lines expressing <italic>ATR1</italic> and <italic>71cR</italic>, but not in lines transformed with <italic>CFP</italic>. Silencing of the <italic>CTB1</italic> polyketide synthase and to a lesser extent the <italic>CTB8</italic> pathway regulator in the cercosporin biosynthetic pathway also led to the recovery of resistant lines. All lines tested expressed the transgenes, and a direct correlation between the level of transgene expression and disease resistance was not identified in any line. Resistance was also not correlated with the degree of silencing in the <italic>CTB1</italic> and <italic>CTB8</italic> silenced lines. We conclude that expression of fungal cercosporin autoresistance genes as well as silencing of the cercosporin pathway are both effective strategies for engineering resistance to <italic>Cercospora</italic> diseases where cercosporin plays a critical role.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007198</institution-id><institution>US-Egypt Joint Board on Scientific and Technological Cooperation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>58-3148-1-161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4292-3949</contrib-id><name><surname>Daub</surname><given-names>Margaret E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by the US-Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund through the USDA cooperative agreement #58-3148-1-161 to MD and NG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/egypt/index.htm">http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/egypt/index.htm</ext-link>.

The wide host range and lack of disease resistance in many host species has been attributed to the fungus&#x02019; production of a photoactivated perylenequinone toxin, cercosporin (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Cercosporin is a photosensitizing compound that absorbs light energy to generate singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) as well as other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In host plants the cercosporin-generated ROS cause peroxidation of the host cell membrane lipids, leading to membrane breakdown, death of host cells and leakage of nutrients needed by the fungus for tissue colonization [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies in several <italic>Cercospora</italic>-host systems have documented the importance of cercosporin in disease by documenting reductions in disease development by mutants deficient for cercosporin production [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The importance of light, required for cercosporin photoactivation, in disease symptom development has also been documented in both coffee and sugar beet [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230362.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Singlet oxygen is a non-radical, but highly reactive species of ROS [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Unlike free-radical forms of ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen is not a common part of cellular reactions, and most cells lack effective resistance mechanisms. Compounds have been identified that quench singlet oxygen [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Carotenoids are among the most effective quenchers of singlet oxygen, and play a role in defense against singlet oxygen generated as part of photosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. But there is little evidence for a role for quenchers in resistance to photosensitizer toxicity in cells [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Consistent with its production of singlet oxygen, cercosporin has been shown to be almost universally toxic, with toxicity documented not only to plants, but also to mice, bacteria, oomycetes, and many fungi [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Although cercosporin has been shown to be almost universally toxic, <italic>Cercospora</italic> species are resistant to its toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, extensive studies have been conducted to characterize autoresistance mechanisms in <italic>Cercospora</italic> fungi as a strategy to identify genes that may have utility in engineering cercosporin-resistant plants. Characterization of endogenous quenchers including carotenoids, as well as antioxidant enzymes and general antioxidant activity were not correlated with cercosporin resistance in fungi (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230362.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Vitamin B6 production was correlated with autoresistance, however expression of <italic>Cercospora</italic> B6 biosynthetic genes (<italic>PDX1</italic>, <italic>PDX2</italic>) in tobacco did not elevate B6 levels or cercosporin resistance due to down-regulation of the endogenous tobacco <italic>PDX</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Identification of the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 that regulates cercosporin resistance and production [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] led to the recovery of putative resistance genes through the use of a subtractive hybridization strategy of genes differentially expressed between the wild type strain and a <italic>crg1</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Differentially regulated genes identified through this strategy have subsequently been characterized for a possible role in resistance through characterization of mutants [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] as well as by the ability to impart cercosporin resistance to the cercosporin-sensitive fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230362.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Another strategy for engineering resistance is to use host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) with RNA interference (RNAi) to silence expression of critical pathogenicity genes. The utility of HIGS to protect plants against fungal pathogens was first demonstrated by Nowara et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with the obligate powdery mildew fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic>. It has since been shown to function against fungi with diverse modes of pathogenicity, including other obligate pathogens such as rusts [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as well as species of <italic>Fusarium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], <italic>Verticillium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and <italic>Sclerotinia</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). The biosynthetic pathway for cercosporin production has been characterized. The polyketide synthase (PKS) in the pathway was first identified through recovery from cercosporin-deficient mutants of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> created by restriction enzyme-mediated insertion (REMI) [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other genes in the pathway were then identified through sequencing of flanking regions. This work identified a cluster of eight genes (<italic>CTB1</italic>-<italic>CTB8</italic>) encoding methyltransferases, oxidoreductases, a transporter, and a transcription factor in addition to the PKS [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

In addition, recent successes with the use of host-induced gene silencing to silence critical fungal pathogenicity factors [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], coupled with the characterization of the cercosporin biosynthetic pathway gene cluster [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], suggest that silencing of cercosporin production may also be a useful strategy. We tested both of these strategies.</p><p>In our work to test resistance genes, we selected three genes that were shown in previous studies to be involved in cercosporin autoresistance in <italic>Cercospora</italic>. These genes were identified through a subtractive hybridization strategy between the wild type and a mutant for the CRG1 transcription factor shown to regulate both cercosporin resistance and production [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230362.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One of the genes recovered through this strategy, <italic>CFP</italic>, was the first cercosporin-resistance gene ever identified. It was initially identified as a light-induced gene involved both in cercosporin production and in resistance [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>CFP</italic> has also recently been shown to flank the cercosporin biosynthetic cluster in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>beticola</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <italic>CFP</italic> encodes an MFS transporter, and in previous work we also documented a role for this gene in cercosporin resistance, as over-expression of <italic>CFP</italic> in a cercosporin-sensitive <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae crg1</italic> mutant increases cercosporin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous work had documented reductions in lesion size caused by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> in tobacco cv &#x02018;Xanthi&#x02019; transformed with <italic>CFP</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our <italic>CFP</italic>-transformed lines were not more resistant to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> infection, however, in spite of strong expression of the gene. It is not clear why our results differ from the Upchurch et al. study, but it may be due to genotypic differences in the host species. We used a flue-cured tobacco cv &#x02018;Hicks&#x02019;, rather than the sun-cured oriental tobacco cultivar &#x02018;Xanthi&#x02019;. Genome sequence data for these two tobacco types has been published [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>CFP</italic> lines, resistance to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> was identified in lines transformed with both <italic>ATR1</italic> and <italic>71cR</italic>. Interestingly, the phenotype of the resistance response differed between the two, with <italic>ATR1</italic>-transformed lines showing a reduction mostly in the size of lesions and the <italic>71cR</italic>-transformed lines showing fewer lesions that did expand, suggesting a difference in the mode of action of these two genes in protecting against infection. The symptoms on the <italic>ATR1-</italic> transformed plants are similar to what is seen when plants are inoculated with cercosporin-deficient mutants. <italic>ATR1</italic> encodes an ABC transporter that plays a role in both cercosporin production and resistance [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Cercosporin production in <italic>ATR1</italic> disrupted mutants is approximately 25% of wild-type levels [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Mutants are also sensitive to cercosporin, and overexpression of <italic>ATR1</italic> in the aforementioned cercosporin-sensitive <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae crg1</italic> mutant increases cercosporin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The precise function of ATR1 in cercosporin resistance, however, is not clear. <italic>71cR</italic> encodes a hypothetical protein that is localized in the cytoplasm, has an NTF2-like superfamily DUF1348 domain of unknown function, and has some similarities to the steroid delta-isomerase family of proteins [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Expression of <italic>71cR</italic> was induced in a cercosporin-sensitive mutant exposed to cercosporin, suggesting a role in resistance, and subsequent expression of the gene in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> confirmed its ability to impart resistance to cercosporin [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the precise function of 71cR, either in the fungal life cycle or in providing resistance, is not known. Further work is needed to define the precise role of these genes in imparting resistance.</p><p>In addition to expression of cercosporin-resistance genes, we also tested the efficacy of host-induced gene silencing of cercosporin production to provide disease resistance. The CTB gene cluster for cercosporin biosynthesis has been identified and characterized (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). The core cluster contains eight genes, encoding the polyketide synthase, a transcription factor, an MFS transporter, as well as for methyltransferases and oxidoreductases. Recent work in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>beticola</italic> identified an additional five genes that flank the CTB cluster [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We tested silencing of the CTB1 polyketide synthase [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the first enzyme in the pathway, and of the CTB8 transcription factor, shown to regulate expression of the cluster genes [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Silencing of either gene provided resistance to infection, although greater numbers of resistant lines were obtained with <italic>CTB1</italic> silencing. Symptoms on inoculated <italic>CTB1</italic>-silenced plants, i.e. small lesions that did not expand, resembled symptoms obtained when plants are inoculated with cercosporin-deficient mutants [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230362.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], consistent with inhibition of cercosporin production.</p><p>Overall, differences in effectiveness between the genes utilized was reflected as the proportion of lines tested that were significantly resistant, rather than the degree of symptom reduction. Lines that showed resistance (those expressing <italic>ATR1</italic> and <italic>71cR</italic> and silenced for <italic>CTB1</italic> and <italic>CTB8</italic>) had 40&#x02013;60% of the disease severity seen on &#x02018;Hicks&#x02019;. We did see a difference in the proportion of lines that were resistant, with <italic>71cR-</italic>expressors and <italic>CTB1</italic>-silenced lines having the highest proportion of resistant lines. With the exception of <italic>71cR</italic> line 9&#x02013;1, which was specifically selected as a control due to its low transgene expression, we did not see a correlation between expression of the transgenes and resistance. This may be due to the fact that we initially selected transformants based on highest expression of the transgene. Lack of correlation between transgene expression and phenotype has previously been reported. For example, Fagoaga and co-workers did not see a correlation between transgene protein expression of the pathogenesis-related protein PR-5 and resistance to <italic>Phytophthora citrophthora</italic> in transgenic orange [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Grand et al. found a correlation between the predicted phenotype and expression of preformed defense regulator genes in some but not all transgenic rice lines expressing overexpression constructs, an observation they hypothesized may have been due to expression being above a maximum level needed for the response [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have tested the efficacy of <italic>Cercospora</italic> cercosporin-resistance genes and of silencing of cercosporin biosynthesis on providing resistance to <italic>Cercospora</italic> disease development. Both strategies were successful in providing resistance. The degree of symptom reduction was similar across strategies, but silencing of <italic>CTB1</italic> and expression of <italic>71cR</italic> provided the highest proportion of lines with statistically significant resistance, and may have utility in engineering crop plants for resistance to this damaging group of pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Vector construction</title><p>An <italic>in vitro</italic> spliced coding sequence of the <italic>ATR1</italic> gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> (GenBank accession number EU530631) using the methodology described previously [<xref rid="pone.0230362.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Reverse transcription was carried out using 900 ng of total RNA using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. qPCR was carried out using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with a thermal cycling protocol that included an initial denaturation step of 95&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, target-dependent annealing temperature for 30 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds with a plate read. At the end of each reaction, melt curves were used to verify the amplification of a single, correct product. Each sample reaction was run as triplicates.

Total RNA was isolated, treated with DNase I, and reverse transcribed as described above. qPCR was conducted as described above. Normalization was carried out against two tobacco reference genes that amplified with the same efficiency as that of the target gene. The heterologous fold-change gene expression was determined by using the 2&#x02212;<sup>&#x00394;&#x00394;CT</sup> method. The normalized transcript levels of all the samples were expressed relative to the sample with the lowest normalized transcript level.

The cDNA was preamplified using SsoAdvanced PreAmp Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) so as to obtain an unbiased amplification of all target amplicons from the limited amounts of fungal nucleic acid transcripts. The primers for this assay comprised of 50nM of primers that included <italic>CTB1</italic> and fungal reference genes. The preamplification involved a thermal cycling protocol that included an initial denaturation step of 95&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes, followed by 11 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds and an annealing step of 55&#x000b0;C for 4 minutes. Each preamplified cDNA was diluted with low EDTA TE buffer (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH) and used as the template for qPCR. qPCR was carried out using iQ SYBR Green Supermix with a thermal cycling protocol that included an initial denaturation step of 95&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds with a plate read.
