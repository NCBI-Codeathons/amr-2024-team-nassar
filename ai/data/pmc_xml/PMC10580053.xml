The information on the use of viruses providing efficacy to plants facing growth challenges owing to stress is lacking. The role of induction of pathogen-related genes by microbes is also colossal in drought-endurance acquisition. Studies put forward the importance of viruses as sustainable means for defending plants against dual stress. A fundamental part of research focuses on a positive interplay between viruses and plants. Notably, the tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) possess the capacity to safeguard tomato host plants against severe drought conditions. This study aims to explore the combined effects of TYLCV, ToCV, and drought stress on two tomato cultivars, Money Maker (MK, UK) and Shalala (SH, Azerbaijan). The expression of pathogen-related four <italic>cellulose synthase gene</italic> families (<italic>CesA</italic>/<italic>Csl</italic>) which have been implicated in drought and virus resistance based on gene expression analysis, was assessed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The molecular tests revealed significant upregulation of <italic>Ces-A2</italic>, <italic>Csl-D3</italic>,<italic>2</italic>, and <italic>Csl-D3,1</italic> genes in TYLCV and ToCV-infected tomato plants<italic>. CesA/Csl</italic> genes, responsible for biosynthesis within the MK and SH tomato cultivars, play a role in defending against TYLCV and ToCV. Additionally, physiological parameters such as &#x0201c;relative water content,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;specific leaf weight,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;leaf area,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dry biomass&#x0201d; were measured in dual-stressed tomatoes. Using these features, it might be possible to cultivate TYLCV-resistant plants during seasons characterized by water scarcity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like genes</kwd><kwd>drought</kwd><kwd>tomato chlorosis virus</kwd><kwd>tomato yellow leaf curl virus</kwd><kwd><italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) is a highly economically valuable crop worldwide, with a production of 180.8 million tons in 2019 (<xref rid="b19-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2020</xref>). Viral diseases are significant inhibitors of tomato production, causing yield losses (<xref rid="b26-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Han&#x0010d;insk&#x000fd; et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="b55-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2020</xref>). A comprehensive analysis of databases and literature revealed at least 312 viruses, satellite viruses, or viroid species associated with tomatoes, representing 22 families and 39 genera, which is a record number for any plant species. The financial losses caused by viral infections in tomato crops are challenging to estimate, but yield losses range from approximately 30 to 50 billion US dollars per year (<xref rid="b62-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Rivarez et al., 2021</xref>). Biotic and abiotic stress factors have a detrimental impact on global agricultural production. DNA and RNA viruses that infect tomato plants are particularly significant biotic stress factors affecting productivity. Whitefly-transmitted virus diseases, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), are the main pathogens causing infections in tomato plants (<xref rid="b18-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Fiallo-Oliv&#x000e9; and Navas-Castillo, 2019</xref>). TYLCV is a single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the <italic>Geminiviridae</italic> family in the <italic>Begomovirus</italic> genus, known for its negative impact on tomato plant production in tropical and subtropical regions (<xref rid="b12-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Czosnek, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="b15-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Desbiez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="b75-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Verdin et al., 2018</xref>). TYLCV has a circular 2800 nucleotide single-stranded DNA genome encapsulated in a structure measuring 25 &#x000d7; 30 nm. Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) is another pathogen affecting tomato plants, belonging to the Closteriviridae genus of the Crinivirus species. It is a single-stranded RNA genome virus causing characteristic symptoms of interveinal chlorosis in the lower leaves and chlorotic spots in the apical part of the plant (<xref rid="b56-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Orfanidou et al., 2016</xref>). ToCV is a phloem-limited virus with a positive-sense single-stranded bipartite RNA genome. Insect vectors, particularly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, play a crucial role in transmitting both ToCV and TYLCV viruses (<xref rid="b43-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Macedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="b79-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Drought, exacerbated by global warming, poses a significant threat to many countries (<xref rid="b21-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Fullana-Peric&#x000e0;s et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="b37-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Lesk et al., 2016</xref>). Rational utilization of natural water resources is becoming a global challenge (<xref rid="b81-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Yan and Wang, 2013</xref>). Tomato production is severely affected by abiotic stresses, leading to yield losses of approximately 70% depending on the severity and duration of the stress. Drought is recognized as the most detrimental abiotic stress, rendering cultivated tomato plants lacking novel genes for drought stress tolerance highly susceptible (<xref rid="b33-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Krishna et al., 2022</xref>). Prolonged drought also impacts plant-pathogen interactions, resulting in further reductions in productivity due to the combined effect of biotic (TYLCV, ToCV) and drought stresses (<xref rid="b13-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2017</xref>). Developing resistant plant varieties against pathogenic and abiotic stress factors is economically significant.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that virus-infected tomato plants exhibit increased tolerance to drought by reducing metabolic activity in leaves and activating defense mechanisms in roots to cope with water scarcity (<xref rid="b52-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2022</xref>). TYLCV and ToCV have the capacity to prevent wilting and crop loss in tomato plants under extreme drought conditions. The virus-resistant tomato plants can be preserved during water scarcity, preventing crop loss during seasons characterized by water deficit, which is of great economic importance.</p><p>Drought stress has a more pronounced impact on qualitative and quantitative indicators in plants compared to other abiotic factors (<xref rid="b63-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Rukundo et al., 2014</xref>). Severe modifications occur in the morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes of plants when water metabolism is impaired due to drought stress (<xref rid="b74-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Torres-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses can help develop strategies to optimize crop productivity in severe environments by studying the expression profiling of genes, proteins, and metabolites (<xref rid="b74-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Torres-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>). Drought restricts plant growth by reducing the intensity of photosynthesis in affected plants (<xref rid="b39-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). Stomatal closure due to decreased CO<sub>2</sub> levels, decreased photosynthetic activity in mesophyll tissue (nonstomatal), or both can contribute to the reduction in photosynthesis intensity (<xref rid="b39-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). Osmotic substance accumulation, changes in membrane lipid balance, induction of reactive oxygen species synthesis, increased protein synthesis, and alterations in hormonal regulatory pathways play important roles in the development of drought-resistant plants (<xref rid="b40-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Metabolite profiling studies have shown that virus infection enhances plant tolerance to abiotic stresses by inducing the synthesis of osmoprotectants and antioxidants. Virus infection can also increase the level of salicylic acid in an abscisic acid-independent manner, further contributing to drought tolerance (<xref rid="b2-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Aguilar et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The cellulose synthase gene family, which includes the cellulose synthase (<italic>CesA</italic>) and cellulose synthase-like (<italic>Csl</italic>) gene families, plays a vital role in cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthesis in plants. These genes are also involved in cell wall biosynthesis, cell elongation, and plant growth (<xref rid="b9-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Choe et al., 2021</xref>). Some genes associated with the <italic>cellulose</italic> biosynthesis pathway have been found to show increased resistance to TYLCV infection (<xref rid="b66-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2018</xref>). It has been hypothesized that the symptoms caused by TYLCV, which disrupt plant growth, may be directly related to the suppression of cellulose synthesis genes. <italic>CesA/Csl</italic> genes have also been associated with drought stress, with <italic>CesA</italic> genes showing increased gene expression under drought-stress conditions (<xref rid="b77-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). The expression of <italic>CesA/Csl</italic> genes may vary during different developmental stages of plants under drought stress (<xref rid="b82-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, <italic>CesA/Csl</italic> genes have not been extensively studied in <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants, particularly tomatoes (<xref rid="b71-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, investigating the roles of these genes in response to virus and drought stress in Solanaceae plants, especially in susceptible and/or resistant cultivars, is of great importance for understanding their functions.</p><p>The study of host plant-virus relations has been extensively explored, with significant research addressing this topic. However, there exists a notable gap in our understanding of the combined effect of abiotic and biotic stress factors on plants and the resulting outcomes, as well as the economic implications. <xref rid="b14-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Dastogeer et al. (2020)</xref> and <xref rid="b60-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Poudel et al. (2021)</xref> have highlighted this limitation in their research. To address this gap, our research focused on investigating the complex interaction between viruses and drought stress on tomato plants. As a result, we uncovered new priorities for enhancing plant tolerance to both viral infections and severe water reduction. This knowledge can contribute to the development of innovative concepts and strategies vital for combatting the global problem of food insecurity, which is exacerbated by climate change. By utilizing the findings from our research, we can propose the use of virus-resistant cultivars that are infected with the virus during the early stages of development. This approach minimizes yield loss when drought stress is subsequently applied. This novel strategy can have a significant impact on mitigating the negative consequences of both viral infections and water scarcity on crop productivity. The objective of this research was to conduct a physiological (&#x0201c;relative water content,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;specific leaf weight,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;leaf area,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dry biomass&#x0201d;) and comparative analysis of the expression profiles of the <italic>cellulose synthase gene</italic> superfamily in highly productive but susceptible cultivars under biotic and abiotic stress factors. In this study, we utilized the Money Maker (MK) cultivar as a susceptible genotype (<xref rid="b51-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Milc et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="b68-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Siniga Geroge et al., 2013</xref>) to drought and virus, and the Shalala (SH) cultivar, recently grown in Azerbaijan fields, with unknown sensitivity/resistance to virus and drought. We analyzed four <italic>CesA</italic> and <italic>Csl</italic> genes using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. qRT-PCR analyses were performed at 1 and 25 time points in both virus-infected and combined virus/drought-stressed MK and SH cultivars. In addition to qRT-PCR studies, we measured four important physiological parameters, including relative water content, specific leaf weight, leaf area, and dry biomass, to assess the impact of virus and drought stress on tomato cultivars. The results obtained from this study are expected to contribute to the development of drought- and virus-resistant crop systems and provide insights into the response and adaptation mechanisms of tomato plants to drought stress.</p><p>In conclusion, while host plant-virus relationships have been extensively studied, the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stress factors, along with their economic implications, have received limited attention. Our research tackles this knowledge gap by examining the intricate interplay between viral infections and drought stress on tomato plants. The resulting insights offer new avenues to improve plant tolerance and contribute to addressing global food insecurity amidst the challenges posed by climate change.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant growth and single-leaflet grafting of TYLCV and ToCV</title><p>To investigate the response of tomato plants to the combined effects of virus and drought stresses, we used susceptible <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L. cv.

The leaf axil of the identified diseased plant samples was used as inoculum for grafting. The inoculum was applied to the recipient plant by making a cut on the recipient plant with a lancet. Grafting clips were used to ensure successful grafting. The newly grafted tomato seedlings were kept in a shaded, air-conditioned, insect-free greenhouse with temperatures of 26&#x000b0;C during the day and 20&#x000b0;C at night.

It is important to note that the growth of drought-exposed tomatoes in the healthy (HD) group was also restricted. Drought symptoms became apparent in tomatoes of the virus-infected (VD) and healthy (HD) groups after 10 days of drought treatment. However, by day 25, the tomatoes in the HD group had completely wilted and collapsed, unlike the VD group where only clear wilting was observed.

In RNA-Seq analyses of healthy and TYLCV-infected tomato cultivars, it was observed that the cellulose synthase family gene <italic>Csl-H1g043390.2.1</italic>, a homolog of the <italic>AtCESA8</italic> gene, was highly down-regulated in response to TYLCV infection (<xref rid="b66-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2018</xref>). This downregulation of cellulose synthase genes may be an important factor triggering stunted growth and leaf curl in TYLCV-infected plants (<xref rid="b38-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). However, in our experiments using TYLCV-infected cultivars MK and SH, no downregulation was observed in the 4 <italic>CesA/Csl</italic> genes used, in contrast to the findings of the previous studies.</p><p>In the comparison between the 1st and 25th day, it was observed that the <italic>Ces-A2</italic> (93 fold change and 117 fold change) and <italic>Csl-D3,1</italic> (73 fold change and 3 fold change) genes in the MK genotype, known to be sensitive, and the <italic>Ces-A2</italic> gene (115-fold change and 223-fold change) in the SH cultivar showed marked upregulation within 25 days. Transcriptome profiling analyses of TYLCV-infected tomato lines have reported approximately 4-fold upregulation of the <italic>Csl</italic> gene in TYLCV-resistant breeding lines, and in TYLCV-infected tomato samples, one <italic>CesA</italic> gene and two <italic>Csl</italic> genes were significantly upregulated (<xref rid="b7-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b9-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Choe et al., 2021</xref>). Based on this information, the upregulation of the 4 <italic>CesA/Csl</italic> genes used in our study, albeit at different levels, in the susceptible MK cultivar with TYLCV infection suggests that these genes play different roles in the complex biotic stress response mechanisms, which could potentially differentiate between sensitive and resistant cultivars. Regardless of the time point difference, the upregulation of these genes indicates their involvement in the plant&#x02019;s response to TYLCV.</p><p>TYLCV and ToCV, which exhibit similar symptoms in plant leaves, are believed to be regulated by leaf senescence processes, although the genes involved in the molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown (<xref rid="b17-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Espinoza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b66-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2018</xref>). In the same study, it was found that the cell wall invertase 2 gene was significantly upregulated after TYLCV infection, suggesting a general defense response in tomato, and this gene was also upregulated in ToCV-infected plants (<xref rid="b66-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, except for the <italic>Csl-H1</italic> gene, the other three <italic>CesA/Csl</italic> genes were significantly upregulated on the 25th day, particularly in the SH cultivar. For instance, in the SH (SWO) cultivar, <italic>Ces-A2</italic> showed a 9-fold increase on the 1st day, while it was upregulated by 69-fold on the 25th day. However, in the MK (MWO) cultivar, no significant difference in upregulation was observed between the 1st and 25th day of ToCV infection.</p><p>Studies have shown that drought stress can affect the content of sugars in plants by inhibiting enzymes involved in <italic>cellulose</italic> synthesis (<xref rid="b20-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Foyer et al., 1998</xref>).

On the other hand, in the drought-stressed MK cultivar infected with ToCV and TYLCV, no significant upregulation of the 4 genes was observed on the 25th day. This suggests that the MK cultivar, despite being infected with the viruses, did not show a significant correlation with increased drought stress.</p><p>In a study on susceptible/resistant maize cultivars subjected to drought stress, significant upregulation of 3 <italic>CesA genes</italic> was observed in the resistant line (<xref rid="b76-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Waititu et al., 2021</xref>). The comparison of the 1st and 25th days in our study, particularly in terms of the <italic>Csl-D3,1</italic> and <italic>Ces-A2</italic> genes, suggests the possibility of the SH cultivar exhibiting higher resistance compared to the MK cultivar. These genes may play a role in distinguishing between resistant and sensitive cultivars under drought stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological analysis of TYLCV and ToCV-infected tomatoes</title><p>Drought is a significant inhibitor of crop production, including tomatoes, as it affects numerous plant processes and results in a reduction in plant growth. In our current experimental system, tomato plants exposed to water withholding exhibited a dramatic reduction in growth after 10 days. However, grafting of tomato cultivars (MK and SH) with TYLCV and ToCV viruses provided critical protection to the plants from these effects. After 25 days, while the virus-free tomatoes completely wilted and collapsed, the VD plants continued to grow.</p><p>Harsh environmental stresses, particularly water deficit, influence plant biomass and its distribution on leaflets. When measuring the dry weights of MK and SH cultivars, we observed significant losses in the leaves of healthy-drought plants compared to HW plants. However, the VD tissues lost much less biomass compared to VW plants, both in the case of TYLCV and ToCV inoculated tomato plants. This suggests that virus infection enhances plant endurance under drought stress, and the allocation of leaflet biomass in TYLCV and ToCV-inoculated tomato plants plays an important role in drought adaptation. Physiological water balance parameters measured in healthy and virus-grafted tomato plants also revealed significant differences in response to drought stress (<xref rid="b52-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Similar results were obtained for RWC, where VD-inoculated variants developed drought tolerance over time, enabling the plants to cope with the stress, while mock-inoculated variants gradually withered. Thus, the combined effect of virus and drought in plants activates the phyto-immune system and promotes plant adaptation to adverse climatic conditions. Similar trends were observed for leaf area in plants exposed to dual stress and mock-inoculated samples, whereas these parameters decreased in VW variants. This confirms that the combined effect of biotic and abiotic stresses triggers plant adaptation mechanisms. Specific leaf weight, which is considered an essential physiological indicator of plants, was found to decrease in VW-affected plants compared to HW plants. On the other hand, the increase in specific leaf weight in VD samples indicates the activation of self-resistance mechanisms in plants, approaching the levels observed in HW plants.</p><p>The RWC is an indicator of water status in plant cells and is related to drought stress tolerance.

In our study, we also observed a sharp decrease in leaf area in both MK and SH cultivars under HD conditions. Similarly, leaf area decreased by about 28% in the experimental plants compared to the control.

These plant-virus interactions may be part of the complex mechanisms that plants employ to cope with environmental changes. Virus infection can reduce the size of plant hosts, which can reduce their water requirements and improve survival under extreme drought stress. Virus infection can also lead to physiological modifications in plant tissues, including water content alteration and metabolite synthesis and translocation. For example, CMV infection increased water quantity in above-ground tissues, and infected plants retained water better than mock-inoculated plants (<xref rid="b30-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Hull, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The study aimed to investigate the self-regulation ability of tomato plants in tolerating various stresses such as TYLCV and ToCV infections, as well as water deficit and drought. Physiological indicators were examined, and pathogen-related transcriptional changes were analyzed alongside the recovery process. Ultimately, the research aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying drought stress tolerance in tomato plants to prevent yield loss and address the potential impact of environmental changes.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that the combined effects of biotic and abiotic stresses play a crucial role in mitigating the negative consequences of drought and viral infections caused by TYLCV and ToCV. Furthermore, these combined stressors were observed to expedite the recovery time of tomato plants after rehydration. This finding is significant because it implies that by understanding the underlying mechanisms supporting drought stress tolerance, it may be possible to prevent yield losses in tomato crops, which hold immense economic and commercial value. In practical terms, several tomato cultivars or hybrids carrying resistance genes to TYLCV-causing viruses are currently being cultivated in extensive areas to minimize the impact of yield losses. This cultivar selection approach aligns with the findings of this study, reinforcing the validity of studying the self-regulation ability of tomato plants in response to multiple stressors. Given the economic importance of tomato crops and the imminent environmental changes, understanding the mechanisms behind stress tolerance in tomato plants is essential. This knowledge will enable researchers and farmers to implement effective strategies for preserving crop yield under challenging environmental conditions. By embracing this research, the agricultural industry can strive for sustainable practices and secure the future of tomato production.</p><p>The commercialization of tomato fruits heavily relies on cultivars resistant to viral infection. However, it is important to note that these cultivars do not develop immunity against viral infection; rather, they only exhibit systemic infection with mild symptomatology. This crucial information was highlighted by <xref rid="b46-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Marchant et al. (2020)</xref>, emphasizing that although resistant cultivars may still succumb to viral infections, the symptoms are much milder than in susceptible cultivars. To supplement this knowledge, <xref rid="b12-ppj-oa-07-2023-0103" ref-type="bibr">Czosnek (2021)</xref> provided insights into the pathophysiological behavior of TYLCV-resistant tomato lines under water shortage conditions. Their research shed light on how these resistant plants respond to abiotic stress, particularly water scarcity, while still maintaining their resistance against the viral infection.</p><p>Expanding on this research, it would be beneficial to explore the resistance mechanisms of other host plants against different epidemic DNA and RNA genome viruses under various abiotic stresses. This deeper understanding of the perception and interaction between biotic and abiotic stress factors can significantly contribute to global knowledge on plant defense mechanisms. By elucidating how plants respond to both types of stress simultaneously, future genetic agronomic applications can be developed to enhance crop resilience in challenging environments.</p><p>In summary, the cultivation of resistant tomato cultivars against viral infection has allowed for the commercialization of tomato fruits. However, these cultivars do not develop immunity, but rather exhibit mild symptomatology. Further research on the resistance mechanisms of host plants to various viral infections under different abiotic stresses will advance our understanding of the combined effects of biotic and abiotic stressors and provide valuable insights for future genetic agronomic applications.</p><p>TYLCV and ToCV are two common pathogens that significantly impact tomato production. In this study, we utilized the susceptible MK and the Shalala cultivar (susceptibility or resistance status unknown) to conduct single-leaflet grafting with TYLCV and ToCV. By subjecting the plants to virus infection and drought stress, we aimed to investigate the potential effects on water parameters in the leaves and assess their recovery compared to healthy plants. To gain insight into the plant&#x02019;s response to the combined stress, we employed qRT-PCR to detect antivirus-related genes or pathways. Specifically, we focused on measuring the expression levels of cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like genes, as their biosynthesis is known to play a crucial role in the defense mechanisms of tomatoes against TYLCV and ToCV.</p><p>According to our experiments, we have observed certain physiological parameters and gene expressions that lead us to hypothesize that the plant recovery process in both cultivars, MK and SH, cannot be disregarded when considering the effect of combined stress. These findings contribute to a wider understanding of the interplay between host plants and viruses during periods of drought stress, shedding light on the molecular-genetic mechanisms that govern plant adaptation to the simultaneous impacts of biotic and abiotic environmental stresses.</p><p>The implications of our research extend beyond the realm of academia, particularly within the current context of climate change. As water scarcity becomes a pressing concern in many regions, it is imperative to develop agricultural practices that can sustain crop growth despite limited water availability. By delving into the intricate relationship between plants, viruses, and drought stress, our work provides valuable insights that can aid in the formulation of new agronomic strategies customized for water-scarce areas. Moreover, our study paves the way for future investigations that aim to explore the dual effects of viruses and additional abiotic stressors on plants. By unraveling the complex interactions between multiple stress factors, we can gain a deeper understanding of plant resilience and uncover novel approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of environmental challenges on crop productivity.</p><p>In conclusion, our research contributes to the expanding knowledge base surrounding plant-virus interactions during drought stress. By elucidating the molecular-genetic mechanisms of plant adaptation to combined stressors, our findings offer valuable insights for combating water scarcity in agriculture. Ultimately, this work serves as a catalyst for further advancements in the field, inviting future research that explores the multifaceted challenges posed by viruses and abiotic stressors on plant health and productivity.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was financially supported by a grant from the Islamic Development Bank (ISDB) &#x0201c;Postdoc&#x0201d; Scholarship programme, Scholarship No.: 600047690 (2022).
