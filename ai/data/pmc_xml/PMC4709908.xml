In actinomycetes, antibiotic production is often associated with a physiological differentiation program controlled by a complex regulatory and metabolic network that may be elucidated by the integration of genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic tools. Accordingly, an extensive evaluation of the proteomic changes associated with NAI-107 production was performed on <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 by combining two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and gene ontology approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 cultivations in a complex medium were characterized by stages of biomass accumulation (A) followed by biomass yield decline (D). NAI-107 production started at 90&#x000a0;h (A stage), reached a maximum at 140&#x000a0;h (D stage) and decreased thereafter. To reveal patterns of differentially represented proteins associated with NAI-107 production onset and maintenance, differential proteomic analyses were carried-out on biomass samples collected: i) before (66&#x000a0;h) and during (90&#x000a0;h) NAI-107 production at A stage; ii) during three time-points (117, 140, and 162&#x000a0;h) at D stage characterized by different profiles of NAI-107 yield accumulation (117 and 140&#x000a0;h) and decrement (162&#x000a0;h). Regulatory, metabolic and unknown-function proteins, were identified and functionally clustered, revealing that nutritional signals, regulatory cascades and primary metabolism shift-down trigger the accumulation of protein components involved in nitrogen and phosphate metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis/maturation, lipid metabolism, osmotic stress response, multi-drug resistance, and NAI-107 transport. The stimulating role on physiological differentiation of a TetR-like regulator, originally identified in this study, was confirmed by the construction of an over-expressing strain. Finally, the possible role of cellular response to membrane stability alterations and of multi-drug resistance ABC transporters as additional self-resistance mechanisms toward the lantibiotic was confirmed by proteomic and confocal microscopy experiments on a <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 lantibiotic-null producer strain which was exposed to an externally-added amount of NAI-107 during growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides a net contribution to the elucidation of the regulatory, metabolic and molecular patterns controlling physiological differentiation in <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024, supporting the relevance of proteomics in revealing protein players of antibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-2369-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Actinomycetes</kwd><kwd>Antibiotic production</kwd><kwd>Differential proteomics</kwd><kwd>2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>Metabolic pathways</kwd><kwd>Regulatory network</kwd><kwd>Molecular and cellular functions</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004431</institution-id><institution>European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>245066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Puglia</surname><given-names>Anna Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The filamentous actinobacterium <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 is a potentially relevant industrial bacterial strain since it produces the lantibiotic NAI-107 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], an antibiotic peptide active against Gram-positive bacteria - including methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate <italic>S. aureus</italic> (GISA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) - and some Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024, the <italic>mlb</italic> cluster has been demonstrated to contain genes encoding enzymes required for NAI-107 biosynthesis, pathway specific regulators, and proteins involved in secretion and self-resistance mechanism (also referred as cell immunity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The NAI-107 cluster is highly similar to the <italic>mib</italic> cluster present in <italic>M. corallina</italic> NRRL 30420, where the function of the corresponding gene products and the mechanisms regulating gene expression have been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly to other lantibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], NAI-107 is ribosomally synthesized as a precursor peptide that is encoded by the <italic>mlbA</italic> structural gene. The NAI-107 precursor undergoes extensive modifications, including the formation of <italic>meso</italic>-lanthionine (Lan) or 3-methyllanthionine (Me-Lan) residues, before the removal of the N-terminal leader peptide and the secretion of the final 24 amino acid-long product.</p><p>In <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, the most studied actinomycete used as model strain, the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites is elicited as a developmental program and a physiological response to a variety of environmental stimuli and conditions, which depend on cell density, nature and/or quantity of carbon, nitrogen and phosphate sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. From a molecular cell biology perspective, production of these secondary metabolites is generally associated with a cascade of regulatory proteins, which span from those playing pleiotropic roles to pathway-specific regulators controlling anabolic or catabolic genes and, eventually, gene products responsible for antibiotic biosynthesis. A comprehensive understanding of such a complex network of signalling, regulatory circuits and biochemical reactions may be in principle difficult, labour intensive and time consuming. Nowadays, the continuous integration of bioinformatic tools and holistic technologies has allowed the development of consolidated strategies to manage the huge amounts of molecular information on gene expression and biochemical capabilities deriving from &#x0201c;omic&#x0201d; investigations, ultimately leading to novel perspectives and approaches to explore microbial strain physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this context, proteomics has recently been used for shedding light on the relationships among overall metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of interesting bioactive molecules in several actinomycete strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In the perspective of using <italic>Microbispora</italic> strains for the industrial synthesis of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, insights on the molecular cell physiology of this rare genus of filamentous actinobacteria would be beneficial to develop robust and economically-feasible production processes. Thus, due to the promising applicative scenario of NAI-107 and the limited knowledge on <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024, an extensive investigation on the proteomic changes associated with lantibiotic production was carried out on the wild-type (WT) strain at different fermentation stages by using combined two-dimensional difference <italic>in gel</italic> electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry (MS) approaches. In addition, with the aim to confirm results concerning the impact of NAI-107 on <italic>Microbispora</italic> physiology, comparative proteomic experiments were performed on a <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 lantibiotic-null producer strain after the exposure to NAI-107. All proteomic data were integrated with bioinformatic, confocal microscopy and genetic engineering results in order to elucidate regulatory networks, biochemical pathways and molecular processes linking bacterial growth and NAI-107 production, thus providing the first global functional picture of a member of the <italic>Microbispora</italic> genus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Growth parameters and NAI-107 production kinetics</title><p>When incubated in the KV6 complex medium, <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 WT showed a growth kinetics characterized by a stage of active mycelial cell growth and biomass accumulation (A), ranging from A-66&#x000a0;h to A-96&#x000a0;h, which was followed by a stage of general cell growth arrest and cellular lysis occurrences, as inferred by biomass content decline (D) from D-117&#x000a0;h to D-191&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The A and D stages of biomass accumulation profiles paralleled the kinetics of medium concentration changes of glucose, phosphate and ammonium as well as of pH variation during cultivation time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In particular, glucose resulted progressively consumed and then completely exhausted at D-117&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The medium inorganic phosphate (Pi) content gradually decreased until A-90&#x000a0;h, reaching the lowest value, and then progressively increased during D substages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The content of hydrolysable phosphate from medium organic sources (Po) showed a decreasing trend during the A substages that became more rapid during the transition from A to D substages where Po resulted almost exhausted at D-117&#x000a0;h and completely exhausted thereafter. The medium ammonia content resulted slightly fluctuating until D-117&#x000a0;h and then gradually increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In agreement with glucose consumption and the ammonia concentration profile, the medium pH was characterized by a bi-phasic profile (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) comprising: i) a first stage of acidification ending at A-96&#x000a0;h, which is probably a consequence of the production of organic acids from glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; ii) a second stage of pH increase, which is probably due to ammonia produced by medium peptide hydrolysis and amino acid utilization as carbon and nitrogen source during growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. NAI-107 production was observed starting from A-90&#x000a0;h, when the glucose concentration in the medium was about 3&#x000a0;g/l (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). NAI-107 accumulation still occurred at D-117 and D-140&#x000a0;h, when NAI-107 production reached the maximum yield. At D-162&#x000a0;h and thereafter, NAI-107 amount dropped down (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Growth parameters of <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 WT strain.

In this context, the down-representation of two glycogen phosphorylase (GlgP) protein species, coupled with the over-representation of a corresponding proteolytic fragment, and the concomitant slight increment of the alpha amylase GlgE abundance at A-90&#x000a0;h suggested an increased glycogen conversion to trehalose, whose intracellular synthesis is associated with morpho-physiological development and stress resistance capability in streptomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Among the A-90&#x000a0;h over-represented proteins belonging to the carbon metabolism group, worth mentioning are some TCA cycle enzymes, such as citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase iron-sulfur subunit (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Their up-regulation may be put in relation with an increased production of the alpha-keto acids deriving from the utilization of peptides and amino acids present in the medium. This possibility is supported by the over-representation at A-90&#x000a0;h of different protein species, which were further identified as two putative peptidases (NCBI accession numbers: ETK34477.1 and ETK32069.1) and four proteins with unknown function. An intensive-mode Phyre2 analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] also designed the latter proteins as possible alkaline serine proteases (NCBI accession numbers: ETK32012.1 and ETK32013.1), peptidase (NCBI accession number: ETK32069.1) and trypsin-like protein (NCBI accession number: ETK31048.1), with a confidence greater than 90&#x000a0;% for a percentage identity spanning from 56&#x000a0;% to 69&#x000a0;%.

The detailed description of the abundance profile of these proteins is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Supplementary Results section; it is consistent with a global metabolic context of decreased nucleotide synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Proteins involved in nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur metabolism</title><p>The accumulation profile of key factors involved in phosphate, nitrogen and sulphur metabolism were positively associated with NAI-107 production and, in the first two cases, with the measured concentration profiles of Pi, Po (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and ammonia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) in the spent medium.

In particular, the <italic>Microbispora</italic> lipoprotein BldK, which is an ABC-type permease involved in mycelium differentiation by permitting the transport of the morphogenic oligopeptide Bld261 in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], was found as under-represented in its two intact isoforms and over-represented in its putative proteolytic fragment to highlight a decreased need of its function during NAI-107 production. Instead, the anti-anti sigma factor BldG showed augmented levels in concomitance of NAI-107 biosynthesis, which well paralleled the moderate increment of the transcriptional regulator BldD. This result may be consistent with a synchronized progression of physiological regulatory events in <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024, suggesting an early accumulation of BldK at A-66&#x000a0;h, whose abundance dropped down with the concomitant accumulation of BldG and BldD at A-90&#x000a0;h, according to the regulatory cascade proposed in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, the <italic>bld</italic> cascade has already been associated with a growth rate decrement due to nutrient limitation that activates the biosynthesis of the intracellular signalling molecule ppGpp(p) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In agreement with this observation, <italic>Microbispora</italic> ObgE GTPase showed a modest, but appreciable, abundance increment, while PNPase presented decreased abundance levels of intact species and augmented representation of the corresponding degradation products during NAI-107 production. The first protein is an important modulator of bacterial physiological differentiation by controlling the decrease of GTP pool, while the second one is an enzyme involved in mRNA degradation. In <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, the ObgE homologue has been shown to control biomass production positively and bacterial differentiation negatively throughout ppGpp level regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. On the other hand, PNPase is negatively controlled by ppGpp in actinomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

A similar quantitative trend, although with subtle abundance changes, was observed for lantibiotic cyclase MlbC, which is involved in lanthionine ring formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, MlbF and MlbZ were also found in the global proteome analysis dataset at A-90&#x000a0;h (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), where MlbF and MlbZ occur as over- and under-represented species, respectively, thus suggesting a control mechanism for the cellular compartmentalization of the latter protein. In addition, an over-representation of proteins generally related to cell detoxification and protective mechanisms against antibiotic toxicity was revealed. In particular, various ATPase components (NCBI accession number: ETK31443.1, ETK37841.1 and ETK33189.1), which are part of ABC-type multidrug transporter systems, as inferred by bioinformatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], were differentially represented in global and/or membrane proteome analysis at A substages (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3).

In particular, an over-representation at A-90&#x000a0;h was observed for TrxB, siroheme synthase, globin, and UspA. PspA and HPI showed discordant and inverse accumulation levels in the whole/membrane bacterial extracts during NAI-107 production, being PspA modestly-increased/decreased and HPI modestly-decreased/increased, respectively. These results suggest a differential compartmentalization of these proteins. In the case of PspA, the compartment-dependent accumulation profile may be related with its dual role as regulatory element and membrane component, similarly to what already observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Comparative proteomic analysis between D substages characterized by different profile of NAI-107 yield</title><p>The D stage is characterized by a decrease in the amount of bacterial biomass compatible with cell growth arrest and cellular lysis occurrences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). However, surviving cells are still metabolically active and use medium peptides as carbon and nitrogen source. This can be inferred from the progressive increment of the pH value of the medium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), as consequence of amino acid utilization and ammonia production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and by the NAI-107 concentration that increases until D-140&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In order to shed light on the molecular events associated with NAI-107 production maintenance and arrest, differential proteomic analysis was carried out on biomass samples collected at D-117, D-140 and D-162&#x000a0;h substages, using D-117&#x000a0;h as pivotal time-point. This analysis revealed 171 differentially represented spots in the D-117 <italic>vs</italic> D-140&#x000a0;h comparison, with 111 and 60 ones over- and under-represented at D-117&#x000a0;h, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2); on the other hand, 265 differentially represented spots were observed in the D-117 <italic>vs</italic> D-162&#x000a0;h comparison, with 130 and 135 ones over- and under-represented at D-117&#x000a0;h, respectively. Hundred and fifty-one spots were in common between the two datasets showing concordant abundance profiles in terms of up- and down-regulation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Thus, 285 spots were then subjected to MS analysis for protein identification. Identified proteins were clustered according their function as reported above (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). Proteins occurring in spots (19 in total) presenting the concomitant presence of multiple components (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S5) were excluded from clustering. Functional analysis revealed that proteins with unknown function were the most represented group (i) of differentially regulated species, followed by that of species involved in carbon and protein metabolism (b and g, respectively). The two datasets showed a concordant profile and distribution into functional groups of over- and under-represented protein species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). These results univocally revealed that proteins belonging to all functional groups were mostly over-represented at D-117&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">d</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>); conversely, an opposite trend was observed for proteins with unknown function (under-represented at D-117&#x000a0;h). In particular, proteins involved in protein biosynthesis, folding and turn-over, stress response factors, transport through membranes (either involved in amino acid, peptide and sugars up-take), and enzymes active in nucleotide, energy and carbon metabolism (mostly in TCA cycle) were accumulated at D-117&#x000a0;h (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Global accumulation pattern of these functional groups well paralleled the fact that mycelial cells stopped growth at D substages, with the occurrence of concomitant events of cell lysis which became more severe after D-140&#x000a0;h, thus determining the dramatic decrease of biomass content and NAI-107 production yield as observed thereafter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Interestingly, a number of proteins or specific metabolic/molecular processes already observed as over-represented at A-90&#x000a0;h confirmed their positive association with the progression of NAI-107 production in the D stages, resulting over-represented at D-117&#x000a0;h with respect to D-162&#x000a0;h or to both D-140 and D-162&#x000a0;h substages.

Interesting exceptions of the general trend of down-regulation of anabolic pathways at A-90&#x000a0;h were some over-represented enzymes involved in cell wall precursor biosynthesis.

In addition, the nutrient stress may be a triggering factor that, through the ppGpp activity (as suggested by ObgE GTPase and PNPase abundance profiles), can sequentially activate the <italic>bld</italic> cascade, as deduced by the accumulation profiles of the <italic>Microbispora</italic> BldK, BldG and BldD proteins. In agreement with this view, a stimulation of NAI-107 biosynthesis has been recently demonstrated in <italic>Microbispora corallina</italic> by the over-expression of <italic>relA</italic>, whose product is responsible of ppGpp biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Worth mentioning is the fact that the presence of BldK suggests the involvement of cell density signals too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which may integrate nutrient availability signals. Thus, in parallel with what already observed for the biosynthesis of the morphogenetic lanthionine containing peptide SapB in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], the <italic>bld</italic> regulatory cascade can promote the activation of pathway-specific <italic>mlb</italic> genes that control the production of NAI-107 in <italic>Microbispora</italic>. In line with these observations, products of the <italic>mlb</italic> cluster - i.e. ABC transporters MlbF and MlbZ, together with lantibiotic cyclase MlbC - accumulated in <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 during NAI-107 production at A-90&#x000a0;h. Interestingly, MlbF, MlbZ and MlbC were identified as associated with bacterial membranes, thus confirming the possibility that lantibiotic biosynthesis and self-immunity mechanisms occur in proximity of this bacterial district, as already reported in the case of nisin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Indeed, proteomic analysis of the membrane extracts identified specific proteins, such as PspA, which shifted their quantitative representation moving from the cytosolic to the membrane district. These results confirmed also previous observations on cytosolic translational effectors in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, for which a &#x0201c;moon-ligthining&#x0201d; activity was claimed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the metabolism of nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur resulted important for NAI-107 production onset. Evidences of the importance of Pi for NAI-107 production have recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In this study, the Pi content in the medium was observed as decreasing and reaching its minimum in coincidence of NAI-107 onset at A-90&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>); then, it progressively increased during the D stage. This last evidence may be a consequence of two different and partly simultaneous events consistent with: i) mycelial cell lysis during the D stage - as inferred by several experimental evidences such as biomass content kinetics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), fluorescent confocal microscopy observations (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S6), the accumulation of osmotic and membrane-associated stress response factors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3) and overall diminished representation of primary metabolism enzymes during the transition from A to D stages (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S1 and S2) - leading to the progressive release of cellular phosphate; ii) the scavenging action for phosphate from organic sources by Pho regulon gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], whose members were observed as accumulating during NAI-107 production at A-90&#x000a0;h (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). This last occurrence well paralleled the Po consumption profile (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). On the other hand, the ammonia content profile suggests an equilibrium between production/assimilation of ammonia from medium peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], according with the activity of the GlnA enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] that was up-regulated at A-90&#x000a0;h (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). This equilibrium appeared as interrupted in coincidence with glucose exhaustion during D substages. Ammonia metabolism seems to play a crucial role also during NAI-107 production maintenance at D substages, due to the accumulation profile of two GlnA paralogues and of GlnK (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Altogether, these evidences suggest that NAI-107 biosynthesis is mainly supported by the supply of general and essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur. This is in good agreement with the fact that NAI-107 is a ribosomally synthesised lanthipeptide containing all the proteinogenic amino acids except phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamine and histidine as can be inferred from the amino acid sequence of the precursor peptide encoded by the structural gene <italic>mlbA</italic>.</p><p>An interesting finding from comparing A and D substage proteomes was the increasing abundance of a TetR-like regulatory protein. The over-expression of this TetR-family regulator exerted a stimulatory effect on morphological and physiological differentiation in <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024, as reported for the first time in this study. Although further studies are necessary to elucidate which regulatory circuits control the expression of this regulator and which genes are regulated by its activity, this result confirm the powerfulness of differential proteomic-based approaches to reveal regulatory factors playing crucial role in actinomycete biology.</p><p>Another common aspect that characterized A and D substage proteomes is the evidence of a positive correlation between NAI-107 production and the stimulation of cellular processes involved in NAI-107 transport, cell wall biosynthesis/maturation, lipid modification, stress response and multidrug resistance mechanisms. Their up-regulation during NAI-107 production suggests that, beside having <italic>mlb</italic> specific genes associated with self-immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 genome contains a number of additional genes whose increased expression possibly diminish/prevent the potential detrimental effects due to this lantibiotic. A similar phenomenon was described in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> during the metabolic switching that leads to secondary metabolism activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and also emerges from studies on other actinomycetes producing antibiotic metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This can be related to the general responses exerted by bacterial strains in circumstances where they are exposed to antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Worth mentioning is the fact that <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> in exponential growth phase, when exposed to NAI-107, showed the over-representation of proteins that coincide with or are strictly related to the molecular processes here described for <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p>Accumulation of factors that may help maintaining the integrity and stability of the cell membrane, i.e. CFA that catalyzes the cyclopropane ring formation in phospholipid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], further confirms that NAI-107 can alter membrane district integrity by binding to bacterial lipid II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Although no a real pore-forming mechanism can be claimed to justify the NAI-107 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], the NAI-107 capacity of modifying bacterial membrane permeability was highlighted here by confocal microscopy observations coupled with differential fluorescent staining. Confirmatory results for the involvement of cellular factors involved in the response to membrane permeability alterations and of ABC-type multi drug transporter systems as additional self-resistance mechanisms were finally obtained from the RP0 strain proteomic analysis performed by comparing NAI-107-exposed cultivations with unexposed ones. This analysis allowed identifying proteins directly induced to face the presence of NAI-107 in the medium. Thus, analogously to other holistic studies realized on antibiotic producing or non-producing bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] the data obtained from differential proteomic analyses in this study for <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 strains suggests that antibiotics generally do not affect only proteins directly involved in drug binding, trafficking or metabolism, but also components that have no apparent relation with the bioactive molecules itself. Altogether, these findings reveal the existence of a well-conserved antibiotic bacterial resistome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] that can in turn support the function of signalling molecules besides inhibitors in a dose dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work reports the first proteomic study of the poorly investigated actinomycete <italic>Microbispora</italic> ATCC-PTA-5024 that produces the promising lantibiotic NAI-107.
