Here, we report an unexpected 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation of nucleoside biosynthetic intermediates in the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways. This phosphorylation is a unique cryptic modification as it is introduced in the third of seven steps during aminohexuronic acid (AHA) nucleoside biosynthesis, retained throughout the pathway&#x02019;s duration, and is removed in the last step of the pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of reported nucleoside BGCs suggests the presence of cryptic phosphorylation in other pathways and the importance of functional characterization of kinases in nucleoside biosynthetic pathways in general. This study also functionally characterized all of the enzymes responsible for AHA biosynthesis and revealed that AHA is constructed via a unique oxidative C-C bond cleavage reaction. The results suggest a divergent biosynthetic mechanism for three classes of antifungal nucleoside natural products.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P4">Nucleoside natural products constitute an important class of molecules with diverse structures and biological activities useful in medicine, agriculture, and research<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. While approximately 29 BGCs have been reported<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, characterization of these pathways is frequently challenging because hydrophilic biosynthetic intermediates do not accumulate or are difficult to detect in gene disruption experiments. Notably, these challenges limited our understanding of how the conserved nucleoside moiety in antifungal peptidyl nucleosides (PNs) is biosynthesized, even though the BGCs have been known for more than a decade<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">PNs have wide-ranging applications in medicine (nikkomycin Z, <bold>1</bold>)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and agriculture (polyoxin D, <bold>2</bold>)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), and these compounds exhibit antifungal activities through selective inhibition of chitin synthase<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In contrast to many antifungal compounds, PNs exhibited no side effects in humans during dose-finding clinical trials<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and the United States Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate polyoxin residue on agricultural products (EPA Reg. No. 68173-1). Thus, PNs represent an attractive platform for the development of novel antifungals.</p><p id="P6">PNs are characterized by a non-proteinogenic amino acid ligated to a conserved six-carbon nucleoside, aminohexuronic acid (AHA, <bold>3</bold>). The biosynthesis of PNs has been studied for more than three decades, and the BGCs for nikkomycins<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and polyoxins<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> were reported in the 1990&#x02019;s and 2000&#x02019;s, respectively. Still, our understanding in the biosynthesis of AHA is limited to the first two steps: (i) coupling of uracil 5&#x02019;-monophosphate (UMP, <bold>4</bold>) and phosphoenol pyruvate to form enolpyruvyl UMP (EP-UMP, <bold>5</bold>) by NikO/PolA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and (ii) a radical-mediated cyclization of EP-UMP into octosyl acid 5&#x02019;-phosphate (5&#x02019;-OAP, <bold>6</bold>)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Subsequent steps in AHA biosynthesis remain uncharacterized.</p><p id="P7">Four enzymes (PolJ/NikL, PolK/NikM, PolD/NikI, and PolI/NikK) were previously proposed to convert 5&#x02019;-OAP into AHA based on their conservation between the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. While a previous study reported<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> that PolJ dephosphorylates 5&#x02019;-OAP to yield octosyl acid (OA, <bold>7</bold>), PolJ also catalyzed dephosphorylation of EP-UMP at apparently comparable efficiency, which left ambiguity about the relevance of these observations to AHA biosynthesis. Furthermore, while gene knockout strains for all four enzymes have been reported<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, no biosynthetic intermediates were described. Therefore, the mechanism for 5&#x02019;-OAP&#x02019;s transformation into AHA remained unknown.</p><p id="P8">Here, we report that AHA biosynthesis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>) proceeds through an unexpected and cryptic 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation catalyzed by a kinase (PolQ2). Previous proposals suggested that PolQ2 and its homologs only participated in the export of the final metabolite. However, our characterizations revealed that PolQ2 catalyzes an ATP-dependent 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation of 5&#x02019;-OAP to yield octosyl acid 2&#x02019;,5&#x02019;-bisphosphate (OABP, <bold>8</bold>). This finding permitted the in vitro reconstitution of AHA biosynthesis, where OABP is dephosphorylated at the 5&#x02019;-position, followed by conversion of the octosyl acid backbone into AHA backbone via hydroxylation, epimerization, transamination, and oxidative C-C bond cleavage (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Finally, the amide ligase, NikS, couples AHA 2&#x02019;-phosphate (AHAP, <bold>9</bold>) to 4&#x02019;-hydroxy-2&#x02019;-pyridinyl homothreonine (HPHT, <bold>10</bold>), the N-terminal amino acid of nikkomycin Z, to yield nikkomycin Z 2&#x02019;-phosphate (<bold>11</bold>). Gene knockout studies verified the physiological relevance of these in vitro characterizations. This unexpected 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation explains why biosynthetic intermediates may have been overlooked in previous gene disruption studies. A comparison of nucleoside BGCs suggests the conservation of kinases in ~60% of reported nucleoside natural product biosynthetic pathways. While most of these kinases are uncharacterized, cryptic phosphorylation may be relevant to the biosynthesis of many other nucleoside natural products.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Search for the enzyme that acts on 5&#x02019;-OAP</title><p id="P9">We initially hypothesized that the four enzymes (PolJ/NikL phosphatase, PolI/NikK aminotransferase, PolD/NikI &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (&#x003b1;-KG) dependent oxygenase, and PolK/NikM &#x003b1;-KG dependent oxygenase; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) conserved between the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways may be responsible for the transformation of 5&#x02019;-OAP into AHA. To test this hypothesis, we initially focused on in vitro characterization of primarily the polyoxin homologs (PolJ phosphatase, PolK oxygenase, and PolD oxygenase, see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for SDS-PAGE) since they generally were more soluble than the nikkomycin homologs. The only exception was NikK, whose aminotransferase activity had been reported for proteinogenic amino acids, although the nucleoside substrate was not identified<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. NikK was expressed and purified as an N-terminal fusion with maltose binding protein (MBP) to improve its solubility and stability. PolD and PolK were expressed with an N-terminal His-tag. Both an N-terminal His-tagged protein and an MBP fusion protein were investigated for PolJ. Of these, PolJ, PolK, and PolD did not exhibit activities towards 5&#x02019;-OAP (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>, see below for PolJ). NikK was not tested, since 5&#x02019;-OAP lacks an amine or ketone and cannot be a substrate of an aminotransferase.</p><p id="P10">We subsequently extended our study to another conserved enzyme, PolQ2/NikN (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). NikN contains two domains: an N-terminal major facilitator superfamily<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (MFS) transporter domain and a C-terminal P-loop NTPase superfamily domain. In the polyoxin pathway, these domains are encoded by two independent but co-transcribed genes, <italic>polQ1</italic> and <italic>polQ2</italic>, respectively. Because of this genetic organization, the P-loop NTPase was proposed as a regulatory subunit/domain of the MFS transporter and only responsible for PN export to the extracellular space<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. For our studies, we focused on PolQ2 to avoid purification of NikN with a transmembrane MFS domain. PolQ2 was expressed and purified as an N-terminal fusion with MBP, and incubated with 5&#x02019;-OAP in the presence of ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Analysis of the reaction by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) revealed the formation of a uracil-derived molecule (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Notably, the compound&#x02019;s retention time (RT, 5.9 min) was consistent with the addition of a phosphate to 5&#x02019;-OAP, and product formation was concomitant with ATP consumption. We observed formation of both ADP and AMP, where ADP is likely the by-product of 5&#x02019;-OAP&#x02019;s phosphorylation, and AMP is likely an artifact of promiscuous phosphatase activity. PolQ2&#x02019;s product was structurally characterized by HRMS and NMR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>), which were consistent with OABP. PolQ2 demonstrated a turnover rate of ~0.1-0.21 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with 5&#x02019;-OAP as the substrate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), which may be compared to 6.8 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> reported for NikO<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and ~0.3 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for NikJ/PolH<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. No activity was observed with EP-UMP despite prolong incubation (12 h, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2</xref>). Thus, PolQ2 specifically acts on 5&#x02019;-OAP, and the observed turnover rate suggested its relevance to AHA biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Selective 5&#x02019;-dephosphrylation of OABP by PolJ</title><p id="P11">Of the remaining conserved enzymes, only the phosphatase PolJ produced a new compound from OABP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>), which migrated closely to 5&#x02019;-OAP on HPAEC.

PolD&#x02019;s product was isolated and characterized by LC-HRMS/MS, which was consistent with heptosyl acid 2&#x02019;-phosphate (2&#x02019;-HAP, <bold>13</bold>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). However, this compound was not converted to any advanced intermediates by either phosphatase PolJ, aminotransferase NikK, or oxygenase PolK (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>). When 2&#x02019;-OAP was assayed in the presence of both oxygenases PolK and PolD, 2&#x02019;-HAP was not formed, and only PolK&#x02019;s products were observed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). These observations suggest that 2&#x02019;-HAP is likely an off-pathway product that is irrelevant to AHA biosynthesis.</p><p id="P13">PolK&#x02019;s two products were isolated for further characterization. The product with later RT on HPAEC (2.2 min in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) was stable and characterized by LC-HRMS and NMR analyses, which were consistent with 5&#x02019;-keto-octosyl acid 2&#x02019;-phosphate (KOAP, <bold>14</bold>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). In contrast, the product with an earlier RT (2.0 min in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) exhibited limited chemical stability. Interpretation of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of a mixture of this product and its degraded compounds were challenging, but the absence of <sup>1</sup>H signals at 2.0 &#x02013; 2.5 ppm suggested an oxidation of C6&#x02019; (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). Based on the exact mass of this compound determined by LC-HRMS (+ 31.989 Da from 2&#x02019;-OAP, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>) and its acceptance by the PLP-dependent aminotransferase NikK (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>; see below for details), which requires the presence of a ketone, the structure of this compound was inferred as a hydrate form of 6&#x02019;-hydroxy-5&#x02019;-keto-octosyl acid 2&#x02019;-phosphate (HKOAP, <bold>15</bold>). The stereochemistry of C4&#x02019;, C6&#x02019; and C7&#x02019; of HKOAP cannot be assigned. As described below, it is possible that the C4&#x02019; and C7&#x02019; of HKOAP have opposite stereochemistry from 2&#x02019;-OAP. Recombinant NikM, the homolog of PolK in the nikkomycin pathway, also catalyzed the formation of HKOAP and KOAP (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of AHA biosynthesis is likely conserved between the two pathways.</p><p id="P14">No substantial amount of HKOAP was formed when isolated KOAP was incubated with oxygenase PolK for 20 hrs (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that KOAP is not an intermediate of HKOAP formation.

LC-HRMS and FTIR analyses of this compound (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>) were consistent with the conversion of a ketone of HKOAP into an amine. However, characterization by NMR was challenging due to broadened <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals and a slow T1 relaxation (0.5-1.0 s; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>), likely from a slow conformational equilibrium or extended H-bond interactions in solution. We consequently characterized a dephosphorylated analog.

In particular, we demonstrate that the 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation is introduced by a P-loop NTPase kinase PolQ2 (NikN) and is retained for the pathway&#x02019;s duration. Previously, PolQ2/NikN kinases were thought to be involved exclusively in the export of the final metabolites since no additional phosphorylation beyond 5&#x02019;-OAP was immediately apparent, and these kinases are associated with the putative MFS transporter. In contrast, our in vitro and in vivo characterizations of PolQ2 and the downstream enzymes reveal that the kinase is essential for AHA biosynthesis and is responsible for cryptic phosphorylation at the 2&#x02019;-OH.</p><p id="P25">The discovery of 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation in AHA biosynthesis has important implications on our general understanding of nucleoside natural product biosynthesis. Phosphorylated intermediates behave differently from nucleosides and can be easily missed when characterizing biosynthetic pathways. AHAP and its precursors were not reported in previous gene knockout studies<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> likely because phosphorylation was not expected. Based upon our bioinformatics analysis suggesting the potential abundance of such cryptic phosphorylation, this may be the case for other nucleoside natural product pathways as well. Seventeen of the 29 reported nucleoside BGCs contained kinases, of which nine belonged to the P-loop kinase superfamily. In particular, cryptic phosphorylation is likely involved in the biosynthetic pathways of malayamycin, pseudouridimycin, and GlyU-ADR-containing nucleosides (e.g. caprazamycins). Therefore, these findings suggest the importance of the functional characterization of kinases in nucleoside BGCs in general.</p><p id="P26">Previously reported cryptic modifications of biosynthetic intermediates usually serve chemical roles, e.g. cryptic chlorination installs a leaving group for subsequent cyclopropanation<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Cryptic acylation is found in the biosyntheses of arginine<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, butirosin<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, and the polyoxin N-terminal amino acid, carbamoylpolyoxamic acid<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> (CPOAA, <bold>18</bold>), and is thought to function as a protecting group. Transient phosphorylation has been reported to act as a leaving group for dehydration in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Compared to these precedents, cryptic phosphorylation in AHA biosynthesis is unique since phosphorylation is introduced early in the pathway, retained for the pathway&#x02019;s duration, and has no apparent chemical role.</p><p id="P27">Consequently, cryptic phosphorylation in AHA biosynthesis is more similar to the recent reports of loading biosynthetic intermediates to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) during mitomycin biosynthesis<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, where the function of ACP was not immediately apparent. We propose two possible biological functions for phosphorylation in AHA biosynthesis. The first is a specific recognition by downstream enzymes. With the exception of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2&#x02019;-phosphate (NADP), nucleoside 2&#x02019;-phosphate is rare in nature, suggesting that 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation may serve as a specific recognition tag. Since PNs have substantialvariations in their nucleobase structures that the AHA biosynthetic machinery must accommodate, 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation may be a mechanism to produce structurally diverse natural products while maintaining the crucial specificity for efficient metabolic flux. A second possible function is to prevent the diffusion of intermediates to the extracellular space. In fact, no phosphorylated intermediates were observed in our MS analysis of WT <italic>S. tendae</italic>. Even in gene knockout strains, the amount of OABP in the culture media was ~ 25-fold less than 5&#x02019;-OAP, suggesting that the additional phosphate group minimizes its diffusion/export to the extracellular media. Thus, 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation may allow efficient metabolic flux during PN biosynthesis.</p><p id="P28">While the current study revealed a majority of the steps in nikkomycin biosynthesis, the mechanism of dephosphorylation of nikkomycin Z 2&#x02019;-phosphate remains unknown. Nikkomycin Z 2&#x02019;-phosphate is not detectable in WT <italic>S. tendae</italic>, suggesting the presence of a mechanism of dephosphorylation. Two possibilities are conceivable: (i) promiscuous activity of phosphatase NikL or (ii) a reverse reaction of the NikN kinase domain. In the latter case, it is possible that dephosphorylation is coupled to the export of nikkomycin Z through the MFS transporter. Such a mechanism may explain the absence of detectable accumulation of nikkomycin Z 2&#x02019;-phosphate and the genetic association of the kinase and MFS transporter.</p><p id="P29">This study also revealed the functions of the two &#x003b1;-KG-dependent dioxygenases, PolK and PolD. PolK catalyzes the dual hydroxylation, while PolD catalyzes an oxidative C-C bond cleavage. Based on these observations, we propose a divergent mechanism for the biosynthesis of the structurally related antifungal nucleosides malayamycins and ezomycins. Ezomycin A1 (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 10</xref>) contains a C8 bicyclic sugar, while malayamycins contain a C7 bicyclic sugar (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>); AHA in the PNs contains a C6 sugar. We propose that the size of the sugars of AHA and malayamycins is controlled by the PolD homologs. The malayamycin BGC carries both PolK and PolD homologs (MalM and MalI, respectively)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. It is likely that MalI catalyzes the C-C bond cleavage, but instead of cleaving between C6&#x02019;-C7&#x02019; as observed for PolD, MalI cleaves the C7&#x02019;-C8&#x02019; bond. As for the ezomycins, their nucleoside structure suggests that the pathway likely diverges earlier from either 2&#x02019;-OAP or HKOAP.</p><p id="P30">Three mechanisms are conceivable for the PolD-catalyzed C-C bond cleavage reaction. The first mechanism involves H-5&#x02019; atom abstraction by Fe(IV)=O followed by C6&#x02019;-C7&#x02019; bond cleavage and C7&#x02019; hydroxylation by Fe(III)-OH (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9a</xref>). Subsequent release of glyoxalate and further oxidation of C6&#x02019; into a carboxylate will yield AHAP. Alternatively, a processive oxidative decarboxylation could transform AHOAP into AHAP (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9b</xref>). Finally, although unprecedented, it is possible that PolD generates ketoacid intermediates, followed by their oxidative decarboxylation by a mechanism analogous to the oxidative cleavage of &#x003b1;-KG into succinate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9c</xref>). Mechanistic studies are currently underway to distinguish these possibilities.</p><p id="P31">Our study also revises the previously proposed function of NikS<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Initial proposals suggested that NikS loads HPHT or its precursor onto NikT&#x02019;s acyl carrier domain<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. More recently, NikS was proposed to catalyze an ATP-dependent amide ligation between AHA and HPHT<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. However, no in vitro functional characterization was reported. Our results demonstrate that NikS does not catalyze ligation between HPHT and AHA, and instead ligates HPHT and AHAP to form nikkomycin Z 2&#x02019;-phosphate. Therefore, AHAP is likely the physiological substrate of NikS, and AHA is an off-pathway shunt metabolite. Intriguingly, in a recent report for PolG<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, the NikS homolog in the polyoxin pathway, recombinant PolG ligates AHA and CPOAA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Together with our studies, this earlier report suggests that PolG may promiscuously accept both AHA and AHAP, while only AHAP is physiologically relevant. Alternatively, AHAP may be dephosphorylated to AHA prior to its ligation with CPOAA in the polyoxin pathway. Nevertheless, our study resolves a long-standing mystery regarding NikS&#x02019;s catalytic function, and identifies a potential difference in substrate specificity between the amide ligases of the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, the identification of unexpected cryptic 2&#x02019;-phosphorylation catalyzed by a P-loop NTPase kinase, PolQ2/NikN, resolved long-standing mysteries regarding AHA biosynthesis.
