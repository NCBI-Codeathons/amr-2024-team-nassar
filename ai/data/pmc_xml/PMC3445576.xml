We observed that the enteric insect pathogen, <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> Db10, produced a diffusible compound that inhibited the growth of <italic>Bacillis subtilis</italic> and <italic>Staphyloccocus aureus</italic>. Mapping the genetic locus required for this activity revealed a putative natural product biosynthetic gene cluster, further defined to a six-gene operon named <italic>alb1&#x02013;alb6</italic>. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins encoded by <italic>alb1&#x02013;6</italic> predicted a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) assembly line (Alb4/5/6), tailoring enzymes (Alb2/3) and an export/resistance protein (Alb1), and suggested that the machinery assembled althiomycin or a related molecule. Althiomycin is a ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic whose biosynthetic machinery had been elusive for decades. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses confirmed that wild type <italic>S. marcescens</italic> produced althiomycin and that production was eliminated on disruption of the <italic>alb</italic> gene cluster. Construction of mutants with in-frame deletions of specific <italic>alb</italic> genes demonstrated that Alb2&#x02013;Alb5 were essential for althiomycin production, whereas Alb6 was required for maximal production of the antibiotic. A phosphopantetheinyl transferase enzyme required for althiomycin biosynthesis was also identified. Expression of Alb1, a predicted major facilitator superfamily efflux pump, conferred althiomycin resistance on another, sensitive, strain of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. This is the first report of althiomycin production outside of the <italic>Myxobacteria</italic> or <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and paves the way for future exploitation of the biosynthetic machinery, since <italic>S. marcescens</italic> represents a convenient and tractable producing organism.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>SJC is supported by a Royal Society of Edinburgh/Scottish Government Personal Research Fellowship (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/">www.royalsoced.org.uk/</ext-link>).

The majority of antibiotics that are in use within the clinic and in agriculture are derivatives of natural products and micro-organisms remain an essential source of potential drugs <xref rid="pone.0044673-Gwynn1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This has led to a surge in the mining of genomes and analysis of unique environmental niches in the search for novel antimicrobial compounds <xref rid="pone.0044673-Challis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Zerikly1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In bacteria and fungi, many clinically relevant secondary metabolites (including antibiotics) are biosynthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes, polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes, or hybrids thereof. Examples include the clinically-relevant anticancer agents bleomycin A<sub>2</sub> and ixempra (epothilone derivative), the anti-MRSA antibiotic dalfopristin (pristinamycin IIA/virginiamycin M1 derivative), and the pathogenicity-conferring siderophore yersiniabactin. The soil-dwelling bacteria <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and <italic>Myxococcus</italic> are particularly well known and prolific producers of such compounds <xref rid="pone.0044673-Challis2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>NRPS and PKS systems are large enzymes comprised of multiple modules. Both NRPS and PKS systems function in a very similar manner with each module within a system being responsible for the incorporation of a specific building block into the final product in an &#x02018;assembly-line&#x02019; fashion <xref rid="pone.0044673-Keating1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. NRPS systems incorporate proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids, as well as other types of carboxylic acid, whereas PKS systems generally utilise acyl-coenzyme A thioesters <xref rid="pone.0044673-Finking1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Chan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Each NRPS and PKS module contains a carrier protein domain that serves as the point of attachment for the growing peptide or polyketide chain via a phosphopantetheinyl &#x0201c;arm&#x0201d;. Phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) enzymes catalyse the addition of this 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine (PPT) group to convert the carrier protein from an inactive to active state <xref rid="pone.0044673-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Lambalot1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Within each module responsible for the utilisation of a particular amino acid or acyl-CoA thioester, optional domains that modify the incorporated unit may also be found. Examples of these include epimerization, oxidase and N-methyltransferase domains in NRPSs, and ketoreductase, dehydratase, enoylreductase and C-methyltransferase domains in PKSs <xref rid="pone.0044673-Fischbach1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Trans-acting tailoring enzymes may also function to modify the product during or after peptide/polyketide chain assembly on NRPS/PKS multienzymes <xref rid="pone.0044673-Finking1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Althiomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic first isolated from <italic>Streptomyces althioticus</italic> in 1957 <xref rid="pone.0044673-Yamaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is a heavily modified pentapeptide that inhibits protein biosynthesis by blocking the action of the peptidyl transferase <xref rid="pone.0044673-Fujimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Burns1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The X-ray crystal structure of the molecule was solved in 1974 <xref rid="pone.0044673-Sakakibara1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and the total chemical synthesis of althiomycin and analogues has been achieved (albeit with low efficiency) <xref rid="pone.0044673-Inami1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Zarantonello1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the biosynthesis of althiomycin remained unexplored. The potential of althiomycin as a therapeutic agent is unclear. Results indicate the drug shows low cytotoxicity; however, there are conflicting reports over the extent to which it acts as a broad spectrum agent <xref rid="pone.0044673-Fujimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044673-Zarantonello1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To date, the difficulties associated with chemical synthesis of althiomycin have impeded further investigations into the effectiveness of althiomycin as a drug. Certain strains of the Gram-negative, soil-dwelling bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> are known to produce althiomycin <xref rid="pone.0044673-Kunze1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and, while this manuscript was in preparation, a gene cluster that directs althiomycin biosynthesis in this organism was described <xref rid="pone.0044673-Cortina1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. <italic>Serratia</italic> strains produce various secondary metabolites, including several anti-microbial compounds <xref rid="pone.0044673-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0044673-Flyg1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Here we report the unexpected discovery that althiomycin is produced by this organism, as a metabolic product of a previously unidentified biosynthetic gene cluster. We observed that <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 produced a diffusible metabolite able to inhibit the growth of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. A cluster of six genes encoding a hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly line, two tailoring enzymes and a putative self-resistance protein were identified as responsible for production of the antimicrobial. Additionally, a PPTase enzyme required for althiomycin biosynthesis was identified. Sequence analysis of the hybrid NRPS-PKS predicted that it assembled althiomycin (or a closely related molecule). Metabolite analysis of defined mutants confirmed this hypothesis, allowing a plausible pathway for althiomycin biosynthesis to be proposed. Moreover the genetic organisation of the gene cluster and resistance-conferring nature of the first gene in the operon were confirmed. Thus <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, a genetically-amenable enteric bacterium, is an unusual producer of this potentially valuable antibiotic.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>

To ensure that disruption of the killing activity was associated with the transposon insertion, bacteriophage-mediated transduction was used to introduce one of the Tn5 insertions back into wild type <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10. The resulting strain (SJC13) displayed an identical phenotype to the original Tn5 isolate (not shown). Therefore we concluded that the lack of bioactivity was directly associated with the transposon insertion. The location of the transposon insertion in all six of the isolated transposon mutant strains was mapped, by interrogation of the publicly-available complete genome sequence of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db11 (Sanger Institute, UK).

To define the 5&#x02032; boundary of the operon responsible for the biosynthesis of the potential antimicrobial compound, RT-PCR analysis was used. This was performed using cDNA synthesized from mRNA isolated from <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 <italic>SMA2292</italic>::Tn<italic>5</italic> (NRS2922). Primers designed to span the intergenic regions between 1) <italic>SMA2294</italic> and <italic>SMA2293</italic>; and 2) <italic>SMA2293</italic> and <italic>SMA2292</italic> were used to assess co-transcription.

It is not possible to distinguish between the &#x02212;41 bp or &#x02212;42 bp sites because the anchor primer that is needed for the 5&#x02032; RACE contains a series of thymine residues, which cannot be distinguished from the thymine residue at position &#x02212;42 bp in the promoter region by sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044673-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

Interestingly, no potential intermediates in althiomycin biosynthesis could be detected in the culture supernatant of either mutant, suggesting that the modification reactions may occur on intermediates that are covalently attached to the assembly line. It is also possible that non-oxidised or non-methylated intermediates are not detected in the culture supernatant because they are unstable.

Consistent with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> ATCC274 not producing althiomycin, we also showed that it was sensitive to althiomycin produced by <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044673-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), providing an ideal heterologous background to test the role of Alb1. The coding region for Alb1 was expressed in <italic>S. marcescens</italic> ATCC274 and resistance of the transformed strain to althiomycin was observed. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of Alb1 into <italic>S. marcescens</italic> ATCC274 was indeed able to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of althiomycin, demonstrating that <italic>alb1</italic> does confer resistance to althiomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044673-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Since the zone of growth inhibition surrounding the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 spot on the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> ATCC274 lawn was relatively small, we generated a strain of Db10 producing higher levels of althiomycin to further confirm this result. The native althiomycin promoter was replaced with the constitutive T5 promoter on the chromosome of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10. This strain was found to produce increased levels of althiomycin (not shown). Using this strain as the althiomycin producer, we were able to clearly demonstrate that resistance to althiomycin was observed in the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> ATCC274 strain expressing Alb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044673-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Comparison with althiomycin biosynthesis in Myxococcus</title><p>Concurrent with our independent, <italic>de novo</italic> identification, analysis and characterisation of the althiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10, a similar cluster directing althiomycin production was identified in the Gram-negative, soil dwelling bacterium, <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> strain DK897 <xref rid="pone.0044673-Cortina1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, following earlier reports of althiomycin production by this organism <xref rid="pone.0044673-Kunze1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 and <italic>M. xanthus</italic> are only distantly related, being members of the Gamma and Delta Proteobacteria, respectively. Therefore to determine the level of similarity between the two althiomycin biosynthetic gene clusters, a comparative bioinformatic analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044673-t001">Table 1</xref>). The althiomycin biosynthetic gene clusters of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 both contain six genes: <italic>almA-F</italic> and <italic>alb1&#x02013;6</italic>, respectively. Five of the six gene products are clearly equivalent and the gene order is conserved, suggesting that the clusters are related. The Alb1&#x02013;5 proteins share reasonable identity with the corresponding proteins in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> at the primary amino acid sequence level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044673-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our predictions for the role played by each of these proteins in althiomycin biosynthesis by <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 are similar to those made for the corresponding proteins in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0044673-Cortina1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Surprisingly however, Alb6 and AlmF show no detectable identity with each other at the primary amino acid sequence level. Alb6 is predicted to be a type II thioesterase, with an &#x02018;editing&#x02019; or &#x02018;proofreading&#x02019; function, required for the removal of misloaded building blocks or incorrect intermediates from the NRPS/PKS machinery <xref rid="pone.0044673-Fischbach1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This finding is corroborated by the finding that althiomycin production is reduced to &#x0223c;10% of wild type levels in the <italic>alb6</italic> mutant. By contrast, AlmF of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> is predicted to be a proline iminopeptidase (TIGR01250) and Cortina <italic>et al.</italic> (2011) prefer a model where AlmF catalyses the formation of the methyoxypyrrolinone ring of althiomycin following release from the NRPS-PKS enzyme. These authors do note, however, that this step could also be performed by the integrated (Type I) thioesterase domain at the end of AlmB (equivalent to that of Alb5). Alb6 and AlmF are both members of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase superfamily of proteins (Pfam 12697) and consistent with this, similarities in the predicted protein secondary structures of these proteins can be seen (not shown). Additionally, minor differences exist in the organisation of the biosynthetic operons between the two organisms. In <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, <italic>almB</italic> and <italic>almF</italic> (equivalent to <italic>alb5</italic> and <italic>alb6</italic>) are predicted to be translationally coupled. In the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 <italic>alb</italic> gene cluster, <italic>alb5</italic> and <italic>alb6</italic> are separated by a 146 bp gap suggesting that translational coupling is unlikely.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0044673-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0044673.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Comparative Analysis of the Althiomycin Biosynthetic Proteins.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0044673-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0044673.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Biosynthesis of althiomycin by <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 is directed by a six-gene operon encoding a hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly line, essential tailoring enzymes and a cognate self-resistance protein. The operon does not encode a dedicated phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) enzyme, required for post-translational phosphopantetheinylation of the PCP/ACP domains within the NRPS-PKS <xref rid="pone.0044673-Fischbach1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However we have identified a PPTase required for althiomycin biosynthesis, the product of <italic>SMA2452</italic>. The PPTase required for althiomycin production in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> has not been reported.</p><p>This is the first report of althiomycin biosynthesis by an organism outside of the <italic>Myxobacteria</italic> or <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, both representing soil-dwellers well known for producing antibiotics. In contrast, <italic>S. marcescens</italic> is a close relative of enteric bacteria such as <italic>Yersinia</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> and an opportunistic pathogen. The production of althiomycin may confer a significant competitive advantage for the survival of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10, since the antibiotic is readily produced under normal culture conditions despite the high energetic burden of biosynthesizing the extremely large NRPS-PKS proteins. Whether this advantage is particularly relevant to an insect-pathogenic lifestyle remains to be seen, but this is possible, since Db10 is an insect pathogen, unlike <italic>S. marcescens</italic> ATCC274 and other <italic>Serratia</italic> strains which do not elaborate althiomycin.</p><p>Althiomycin has attracted pharmaceutical interest as a potentially useful antibiotic, but progress has been curtailed by the lack of efficient chemical syntheses and availability of the biosynthetic genes/enzymes. Furthermore, of broader interest is the 4-methoxy-3-pyrrolin-2-one moiety of althiomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044673-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This is a key structural feature of numerous other bioactive natural products that are mostly of marine origin, including sintokamide A, malyngamide A, mirabimide E and the extremely potent anticancer agent dolastatin 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044673-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

We hypothesise that they, like althiomycin, are the products of hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly lines and that the 4-methoxy-3-pyrrolin-2-one unit in these molecules is assembled by analogous enzymatic logic to that employed in the assembly of althiomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044673-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, NRPS-mediated chain extension with glycine (in the case of malyngamide) or L-phenyalanine (in the case of dolastatin-15) followed by PKS-mediated chain extension with malonyl-CoA, O-methylation of the resulting beta-ketothioester and thioesterase-mediated cyclisation, equivalent to the action of Alb3 and the final two modules of Alb5, would yield the corresponding 4-methoxy-3-pyrrolin-2-ones.</p><fig id="pone-0044673-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0044673.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>The 4-methoxy-3-pyrrolin-2-one moiety of althiomycin is shared by other bioactive natural products.</title><p>The position of the 4-methoxy-3-pyrrolin-2-one moiety in althiomycin is highlighted by a broken box and this moiety is depicted in grey within the other molecules.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0044673.g008"/></fig><p>Modules and domains of NRPS and PKS enzymes have proven amenable to &#x02018;mix and match&#x02019; combinatorial approaches to generating novel bioactive molecules.
