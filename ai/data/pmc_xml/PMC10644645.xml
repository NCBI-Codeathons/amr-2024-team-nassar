The structural and chemical diversity of natural products is enormous. These compounds have been evolutionarily optimized for &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; properties, which can hardly be matched by any synthetic small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Natural products have been playing a key role in the infectious disease&#x02019;s chemotherapy since the penicillin and tetracycline discovery which promoted the systematic screening for effective drug candidates from microbial resources. In around 8&#x000a0;years of modern chemotherapy, from the early 1940s to the beginning of the present decade, the share of natural products in small molecules for anticancer therapy is around 50%, and almost 70% of antibiotics are either natural products or directly derived therefrom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, the bacterial pathogens are also evolving under the antibiotics pressure by acquiring resistance mechanisms. The death toll of bacterial AMR (antimicrobial resistance) by some estimates was at the level of 4.95 million people in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is rising exponentially. It is predicted to exceed 10 million deaths per year by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A similar situation is observed in cancer treatment, where tumor resistance to chemotherapy is a major threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Clearly, the development of novel anti-infective and anticancer drugs is critical to stand a chance in the global fight against AMR infections and multidrug resistant cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">An almost untapped resource of novel bioactive metabolites is hidden in the genomic repertoire of Actinomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, most natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are either silent under standard laboratory conditions or expressed at the level that produced compounds are accumulated at nanogram quantities, far below the amounts required for their exploration and exploitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Sustainable production of complex natural products in advanced chassis strains after heterologous expression of the corresponding BGCs is a promising solution to the existing situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Moreover, the heterologous expression of known BGCs, responsible for the synthesis of high-value compounds, enables the generation of chemical diversity by design-based engineering of the encoded pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. On the other hand, the efficiency of BGCs expression in heterologous strains is rather low. A key reason for this is very likely the complex and often BGC-specific regulatory networks controlling the expression of BGCs in the native producer. Therefore, in order to achieve the sufficient production of the compound of interest, promoter refactoring of corresponding BGC by replacing native regulatory elements with synthetic ones could be considered as one of the most efficient solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Pamamycins are a group of unusual polyketides with molecular masses ranging from 579 to 705&#x000a0;Da, pronounced bioactivity and a challenging for chemical synthesis scaffold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Pamamycins are produced by several <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species as a complex mixture of derivatives. However, all of them contain a 16-membered macrodiolide ring, formed by two hydroxy acids, commonly called as L (large, C1-C18) and S (small, C&#x02032;1&#x02032;- C-11&#x02032;), with three cis-2,5-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans and adjacent alkyl-substituted chains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The variations of these alkyl-substituents create a chemical diversity of pamamycins. At the same time, to date, only two pamamycins are known in which the hydroxy acid L (18C) is extended by one or two additional methylene groups: homopamamycin 621A (hydroxy acid L&#x02014;19C) and bishomopamamycin 635 (hydroxy acid L&#x02014;20C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. &#x0201c;Light&#x0201d; pamamycins (such as pam-607, pam-621A, etc.) are major components of the produced mixture and thus could be relatively easily isolated from the fermentation broth. They show excellent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including <italic>Mycobacterium&#x000a0;tuberculosis</italic> clinical isolates within a narrow MIC range of 1.5&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;mg/L irrespective of their resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Larger pamamycins with molecular mass of 649&#x000a0;Da and higher, were detected but never chemically or pharmaceutically characterized because of miserable yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Due to their extraordinary bioactivities and challenging molecular structure, pamamycins have stimulated intense synthetic as well as biotechnological efforts to provide sufficient amounts and enable pharmacological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, chemical synthesis of pamamycins is very complex and protracted due to the stereospecificity of the tetrahydrofuran rings and the adjacent stereocenters of alkyl chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, the biological production of these compounds, especially high-molecular-weight ones, is limited due to extremely low yields in native strains or heterologous hosts. A metabolic engineering approach was applied to improve access to high-molecular-weight derivatives, resulting in a better accumulation of some particular derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, the problem of sustainable access to these compounds remains unsolved.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of pamamycin derivatives with side chain substitution patterns</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2023_2231_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">Herein, we report the modulation of the heterologous production of pamamycins through transcriptional refactoring of the corresponding BGC. The described approach is based on the construction and screening of a <italic>pam</italic> BGC library with sequence-randomized promoters controlling the transcription of key biosynthetic operons. Combining the engineered <italic>pam</italic> BGCs with the <italic>S. albus</italic> expression host with improved pamamycin resistance led to increased production and, as a result, the discovery and characterization of three novel highly active pamamycins: pam-635G, pam-663A and homopam-677A.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Refactoring the transcriptional control of the pamamycin gene cluster by engineering promoters of key operons</title><p id="Par16">Specialized metabolites biosynthesis in actinomycetes is mostly controlled at the transcriptional level. Therefore, the rational engineering of promoters within BGC of interest is an attractive approach to trigger or increase the production of the desired compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The exchange of native promoters with well-studied natural or synthetic ones makes it possible to overcome regulatory barriers existing in the cell. However, this approach is mainly applied to individual biosynthetic or regulatory genes or operons rather than to the entire BGC due to the transcriptional complexity of the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The efficient production of compounds seems to require the well-balanced production of respective enzymes, which is achieved by a well-orchestrated transcription of corresponding genes expression. Breaking this balance leads to the accumulation of side or shunt products, rather than the compound of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The <italic>pam</italic> BGC is organized into several transcriptional units, including three operons (RNA-seq unpublished data, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A); two of them, <italic>pamA,B,D,E,O,K,J,M,N,L,H</italic> (<italic>pamA</italic> operon) and <italic>pamF,G,C</italic> (<italic>pamF</italic> operon), encode key biosynthetic enzymes involved in assembly of hydroxy acids S and L of which the final pamamycin is assembled (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); bicistronic <italic>pamX,Y</italic> codes for aminotransferase and methyltransferase enzymes decorating the large chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The promoters were engineered by preserving consensus &#x02212;&#x000a0;10 and &#x02212;&#x000a0;35 sequences and randomizing the spacer sequences of the erythromycin resistance gene promoter (<italic>ermE</italic>p1) from <italic>Saccharopolyspora&#x000a0;erythraea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Randomized promoters were inserted into the R2 cosmid carrying <italic>pam</italic> BGC between the <italic>pamA</italic> and <italic>pamF</italic> genes via Red/ET recombination. The insertion was facilitated by amplifying the hygromycin resistance gene with the primers carrying an aforementioned randomized sequence of <italic>ermE</italic>p1 promoter and RBS (Ribosome binding site). The primers also contain homology regions for recombination with the <italic>pamA</italic> and <italic>pamF</italic> coding sequences (see Materials and Methods section for details). The insertion of such cassette into R2 cosmid resulted in precise replacement of native <italic>pamA</italic> and <italic>pamF</italic> promoters with the random synthetic ones. The library consisting of approximately 5000 clones was constructed and stored as <italic>E. coli</italic> culture for further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Construction of the expression host for the pamamycin BGC library</title><p id="Par19">In our previous studies we came to the conclusion that the resistance of <italic>S. albus</italic> might be one of the bottlenecks affecting the level of pamamycin production in this heterologous host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The <italic>pam</italic> BGC carries two genes, <italic>pamS</italic> and <italic>pamW,</italic> putatively involved in the self-resistance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A).

To test whether these genes contribute to pamamycin resistance, <italic>S. albus</italic> strains carrying <italic>pamS</italic> or <italic>pamW</italic> genes cloned into a high copy number replicative vector under control of <italic>ermE</italic>*p promoter were constructed.

Three compounds with molecular weight of 635, 663 and 677&#x000a0;Da were purified in quantities sufficient for NMR analysis. Since all pamamycins have the same core structure of the macrodiolide ring and differ mainly by the length and structure of the side chains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), proton NMR was sufficient for analyzing the number of methyl groups and their coupling pattern.</p><p id="Par26">The core structure of pamamycins and their biosynthesis have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. During biosynthesis, two asymmetric hydroxy acids are produced, which together form the final pamamycin molecule (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Different pamamycins are synthesized by the enzymatic machinery, due to the ability of certain enzymes to accept a broader range of starter and extender units (succinyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA or ethylmalonyl-CoA). The different incorporation pattern might also depend on the availability of the respective units within the cell during different growth phases. Pamamycin 635G, with an exact mass of 635.4761&#x000a0;Da (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A), was obtained as a white powder (4.4&#x000a0;mg).

This leaves three methyl groups, each of which is presumably attached as part of an ethyl group to the previously known stereogenic centres C-2, C-7, C-9, C-2&#x02032; or C-7&#x02032; (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S&#x02019;5).

Pamamycin 663A comprises a largest possible derivative with fully saturated side chains&#x02019; structure.

Nevertheless, after extensive NMR analysis and comparison of the data obtained with those of pamamycin 635G and pamamycin 663A, a structure can be proposed at least for the main component. The main compound in the mixture has the same number of methyl groups, including the chemical shifts and the coupling patterns, identical to those observed in the case of pamamycin 663A except that chain extension of one of the two hydroxy acid fragments seems to have a place in case of homopamamycin 677A (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S&#x02019;5, S&#x02019;6, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figs. S&#x02019;16-S&#x02019;18). A first indication of this position is provided by the <sup>13</sup>C NMR data of homopamamycin 677A (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S&#x02019;19) and the comparison with those of pamamycin 635G (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S&#x02019;1). Only the methyl group C-11&#x02032; shows a small high-field shift of 0.2&#x000a0;ppm. All other methyl shifts remain almost the same. If to examine the connectivity to its two nearest methylene groups, a significant difference in their <sup>13</sup>C shifts to the comparative groups at pamamycin 635G could be detected. All this leads to the conclusion that homopamamycin 677A is a homologue of pamamycin 635G, with hydroxy acid small extended by one carbon to C-12&#x02032;. In analogy to the only chain-extended pamamycin variants known thus far, homopamamycin 621A and bishomopamamycin 635, we named this structure homopamycin 677A. It should be noted that the assignments for homopamamycin 677A were only possible after extensive selective 1D TOCSY measurements (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S&#x02019;20&#x02013;S&#x02019;30).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Synthetic promoters delay the pamamycins production onset</title><p id="Par29">The timing of bacterial natural products production is often an important factor influencing the yield.

However, there is a limited understanding of structure&#x02013;activity relationships within this family of natural products. In a course of compound purification pure samples of pamamycin 607, 649A, and 663A were obtained and tested in a number of activity assays. The antibiotic activity was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The cytotoxicity test was performed on KB-3.1 (cervix carcinoma) and HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cell lines. The general toxicity of compounds was assessed on zebrafish, and the herbicidal activity was tested on <italic>Agrostis&#x000a0;stolonifera</italic>. All tested compounds demonstrated weak or no activity against Gram-negative test cultures with MIC values ranging from 32&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M and higher (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, all three compounds were found to be highly potent with smaller pamamycins being less active than the large one. Pamamycin 607 demonstrated MIC ranging from 8 to 16&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M depending on the test culture used when pamamycin 663A has much better activity with MIC values of 1 to 8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M. The latter derivative has an MIC of 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M against both <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> laboratory strain Newman and MRSA strain N315, as well as against <italic>Streptococcus&#x000a0;pneumoniae.</italic> All three tested pamamycins were able to prevent the growth of <italic>Mycobacterium&#x000a0;smegmatis</italic> at concentrations 8&#x02013;16&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M<italic>.</italic> At the same time, they also showed high cytotoxicity on carcinoma (KB-3.1) and hepatocyte (HepG2) cancer cell lines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S6). In these experiments a similar to antibacterial activity trends were observed: the high-molecular-weight compounds were more active. The IC50 of pamamycin 663A on the HepG2 cell line was extraordinarily low reaching 2&#x000a0;nM which is 310 times lower than IC50 of pamamycin 607. The doxorubicin, which was used as a control, demonstrated IC50 of 0.29&#x000a0;nM. All tested pamamycins were toxic against zebrafish at different stages of development and demonstrated only some minor activity in the herbicidal test against <italic>Agrostis&#x000a0;stolonifera</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S7, S8).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">The progress in genome sequencing made clear that the specialized metabolism potential of <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> has not yet been exploited in full [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, the cryptic gene clusters are potential targets for new natural drug lead discovery. The development of methods and approaches leading to the activation of cryptic gene clusters is a key priority in the synthetic biology of Actinobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that decoupling of the transcription of pamamycin biosynthetic genes from the cellular regulatory network as well as changing the natural balance of gene expression could be used as a tool for modulating the production of specialized metabolites. Such decoupling could be achieved by rational engineering of promoters of corresponding biosynthetic genes and operons. However, the danger of such an approach lies in the imbalance of expression which could lead to production of shunt products but not the target compound as in the case of landomycin gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. On the other hand, the precise tuning of expression of biosynthetic genes and operons could be achieved by an approach based on randomization of corresponding promoters coupled with the intensive screening. This rather laborious way still results in a target compound overproduction as it was in the case of engineered bottromycin gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The latter approach could be successfully applied to diverse high value natural products which are typically produced at very low quantities. In this work we have demonstrated the efficiency of the latter approach on pamamycins, an unusual family of polyketide antibiotics.</p><p id="Par40">Pamamycins are produced in a mixture of derivatives ranging from 579 to 705&#x000a0;Da. The native cluster when expressed in heterologous host results in primary accumulation of smaller derivatives with molecular weights of 579, 593, 607, 621 and 635 Da, whereas pamamycins 649 and 663 are barely detectible, preventing their isolation and characterization (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1 </xref>and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). By introducing synthetic derivatives of the <italic>ermEp1</italic> promoter, the transcription of two main operons of the pamamycin BGC was rebalanced, which led to a shift in a spectrum of accumulated derivatives (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The high molecular weight pamamycins production was significantly increased, which enabled purification and structural characterization of new derivatives with molecular weight 663 and 677 Da. These two compounds named as pamamycin 663A and homopamycin 677A are the largest pamamycins with known structure to the date. Together with the pamamycin 635G they expand this family of natural products with new derivatives, bringing deeper understanding of the flexibility of corresponding biosynthetic enzymes in their selection of starter and extender units. Furthermore, also discovered in a course of this project pamamycin 623G represent the derivatives with the largest possible side chain substituents at positions C-2 and C-2&#x02032;. At the same time, when pamamycin 663A and homopamycin 677A have fully saturated side chains and thus represent the largest possible structure of pamamycins&#x02019; macrodiolide ring. The further increase in size of pamamycin 663A is possible solely by implementing larger starter units by the corresponding enzymatic assembly like. In fact, homopamycin 677A could be seen as an outcome of such starter unit selection: in the case of hydroxy acid small instead of usual propionate the butyrate is used. This compound is the first reported pamamycin with the extension of hydroxy acid small, since all other derivatives with the other than propionate starter had longer hydroxy acid large (homopamamycin 621A and bishomopamamycin 635A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The observed shift in the production of pamamycin derivatives is obviously caused by the changes in the efficiency of expression of the two engineered operons. These operons are coding for key biosynthetic enzymes involved in the assembly of hydroxy acid small (<italic>pamA-pamS</italic>) and its extension to hydroxy acid large (<italic>pamF-pamC</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The lack of <italic>pamC</italic> function was described to cause the accumulation of small molecular weight derivatives clearly pointing on its importance in assembly of large pamamycin derivatives. The transcriptional studies of engineered <italic>pam</italic> BGCs revealed that besides the increase in overall level of transcription the <italic>pamF-pamC</italic> operon was significantly overexpressed when compared to other <italic>pam</italic> genes. Such increase in transcription of <italic>pamF-pamC</italic> operon was observed in the case of R2-73 and R2-100 constructs, but not in R2-67, which has a similar to native profile of produced pamamycins. Overexpression of ACP (acyl carrier protein) is known to increase the production of other actinobacterial polyketide natural products, for instance tetracenomycin and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the case of pamamycins, it can be proposed that ACP is mediating the preferential recruitment of ethylmalonyl-CoA into the assembly line, somehow influencing the specificity of biosynthetic enzymes.</p><p id="Par42">At the same time, the balance in expression of <italic>pamF-pamC</italic> operon and other biosynthetic genes seems to be important for proper functioning of pamamycins assembly line. The <italic>pam</italic> BGC, in which the promoter of <italic>pamF</italic> was replaced with the strong synthetic promoter from R2-73 construct, demonstrated no changes in the spectra of derivatives. Furthermore, the overall pamamycins production was decreased. This observation reflects the complexity of transcriptional organization of biosynthetic gene clusters. In case of <italic>pam</italic> BGC the expression of two operons <italic>pamF-pamC</italic> and <italic>pamA-pamS</italic> have to be well balanced. Even more, the entire BGC expression has to be properly orchestrated in order to achieve the optimal production of target metabolite. The imbalance in transcription of biosynthetic genes seems to affect the assembly line resulting in sub-par efficiency of biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par43">On the other hand, the replacement of native promoters with the engineered ones led to the delay in onset of pamamycins production. It is not clear if such delay is caused by the properties of <italic>ermE</italic> core promoter sequences. In fact, <italic>ermE*p</italic> was reported to be constitutively expressed in <italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic> and is equally active at 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h of growth in <italic>S. albus J1074</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The changes in the randomized spacer regions of the engineered promoters seem to affect the timing of their onset. However, the influence of other factors, such as availability of specific sigma factor RNA polymerase, could not be excluded. Regardless of the actual reasons for observed production delay, it could be a useful feature of the producing strain construction. In many biotechnological applications the two-steps process is beneficial for the final product yield, especially when it comes to the toxic compounds. At the first phase the culture is actively growing and after a certain biomass is reached it switches to the production phase. The observed delay in onset of pamamycins production could be another factor which allowed the production of high molecular weight derivatives. The activity tests clearly demonstrated that larger pamamycins are more toxic against bacterial cultures as well as other tested organisms. This could explain the fact that the <italic>S. albus</italic> strains with recombinant cosmids with much higher level of expression of biosynthetic genes still have not outreach the overall production level of pamamycins observed in the case of strain carrying native R2 cosmid. The shift in accumulation toward larger and thus more toxic derivatives could limit the yield. In fact, strain with R2-67 construct, which has similar spectra of derivatives as the native R2, demonstrated twice higher production level then the latter. Additionally, all recombinant strains with the engineered BGC have higher biomass accumulation when compared to <italic>S. albus</italic> J1074 with native <italic>pam</italic> gene cluster. Finally, the delay of the production onset could also contribute to the observed changes in the spectra of produced pamamycins. It was noted that the intracellular concentration of ethylmalonyl-CoA is increasing over time in case of <italic>S. albus</italic> carrying R2 cosmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, the late expression of biosynthetic genes might coincide with the ethylmalonyl-CoA precursor accumulation leading to production of saturated side chain pamamycins like 635G, 663A and 677A.</p><p id="Par44">The increase in production of heavy pamamycins enabled their isolation and characterization. Pamamycin 663A&#x000a0;was found to have strong cytotoxicity being 310 times more active against HepG2 cancer cell line than pamamycin 607. This compound also showed eightfold higher activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5, S6, S7 and S8). On the other hand, all tested pamamycins were found to be highly toxic on zebrafish tests making them barely suitable for further development. However, the mode of action of this group of natural products still needs to be elucidated in details as well as structure&#x02013;activity relationship. To date, the structure of 18 pamamycin derivatives have been described, but taking into account the chemical core of these compounds and proposed biosynthesis, at least 288 variants are possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The understanding of structure&#x02013;activity dependencies could change the situation with the general cytotoxicity and promote the synthetic or bioengineering studies of this group of compounds.</p><p id="Par45">Summarizing the above data, the proposed transcriptional refactoring approach could be applied to modulate the transcription of specialized metabolites biosynthetic genes with preserving the balance in their expression, thus keeping unchanged the ratio of corresponding enzymes in the assembly line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It could be successfully used to boost the production level of desired compound or awaken the cryptic pathway. It is quite possible that imbalance of expression caused by introduction of artificial promoters into the silent BGC could be one of the reasons for unsuccessful attempt of their activation. However, the slight changes in transcription balance which seems to be tolerated by the assembly line could have a positive effect, as observed in the case of pamamycin BGC, resulting in production of new derivatives which could not be obtained in other ways.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par46">Transcriptional refactoring of biosynthetic gene clusters may lead to the discovery and sustainable supply of the corresponding natural products, opening the way for their pharmaceutical development. Using this approach, we have discovered and isolated three new pamamycins to conduct initial activity studies. Some of these new derivatives possess much stronger anticancer activity compared to the previously described pamamycin molecules. Therefore, pamamycins could be interesting targets for further studies to unveil their mode of action and potential development. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to other biosynthetic gene clusters, potentially resulting in a significant yield of previously neglected compounds that could be developed for pharmaceutical purposes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p id="Par47">The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> strains were grown in liquid lysogeny broth (LB) or solid LB containing 2% (w/v) agar at 37&#x000a0;&#x02103;.
