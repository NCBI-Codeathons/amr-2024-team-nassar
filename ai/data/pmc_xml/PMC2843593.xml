Since previously reported lantibiotic synthetases show no apparent homology with any other known protein families, the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary origin of these enzymes are unknown. In this study, we present a novel class of lanthionine synthetases, termed LanL, that consist of three distinct catalytic domains and demonstrate in vitro enzyme activity of a family member from <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic>. Analysis of individually expressed and purified domains shows that LanL enzymes install dehydroamino acids via phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues by a protein kinase domain and subsequent elimination of the phosphate by a phosphoSer/Thr lyase domain. The latter has sequence homology with the phosphothreonine lyases found in various pathogenic bacteria that inactivate host mitogen activated protein kinases. A LanC-like cyclase domain then catalyzes the addition of Cys residues to the dehydro amino acids to form the characteristic thioether rings. We propose that LanL enzymes have evolved from stand-alone protein Ser/Thr kinases, phosphoSer/Thr lyases, and enzymes catalyzing thiol alkylation. We also demonstrate that the genes for all three pathways to lanthionine-containing peptides are widespread in Nature. Given the remarkable efficiency of formation of lanthionine-containing polycyclic peptides and the latter's high degree of specificity for their cognate cellular targets, it is perhaps not surprising that (at least) three distinct families of polypeptide sequences have evolved to access this structurally and functionally diverse class of compounds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many bacteria generate cyclic peptides, which have improved biological activities compared to linear peptides, including higher stability. Lanthionine-containing peptides are one such group, and different members of this group have antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. For example, one lanthionine-containing peptide called nisin has been used to protect food items from harmful bacteria. Two different pathways for the biosynthesis of lanthionine-containing peptides have been described previously. By comparing the DNA sequences of bacterial genomes we reveal a third biosynthetic route that provides further insight into how the biosynthetic pathways for these cyclic peptides have evolved. We characterized the novel lanthionine synthetase utilized in this third pathway in the soil bacterium <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> and show that the purified enzyme catalyzes the chemical reactions necessary to turn a linear peptide into a peptide with multiple rings. The discovery of this third biosynthetic pathway widens the scope for the engineering of new lanthionine-containing peptides for potential use in human therapeutics.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrocyclization is a common strategy to constrain the conformational flexibility of natural peptides of both ribosomal and nonribosomal origin <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, thereby conferring increased proteolytic stability and improved affinity for their targets. Lantibiotic synthetases are remarkable catalysts that achieve macrocyclization by utilizing two simple posttranslational modification reactions, dehydration of Ser/Thr residues and subsequent intramolecular addition of Cys thiols to the dehydro amino acids to generate thioether crosslinks called (methyl)lanthionines <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Willey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The resulting polycyclic products have high affinity for their various targets, which to date all consist of small molecules <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Chatterjee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For instance, nisin binds with high affinity to the bacterial cell wall precursor lipid II <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Breukink1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and cinnamycin specifically recognizes phosphatidyl ethanolamine <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Mrki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Nisin is the most studied lantibiotic <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Lubelski1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and has been used commercially to combat food-borne pathogens for 40 years in more than 80 countries without widespread development of resistance. A remarkable feature of lantibiotic biosynthesis is the extraordinary efficiency by which one or two enzymes typically generate 3&#x02013;5 rings from a linear precursor peptide. How these exceptional catalysts carry out their reactions with apparently high promiscuity and yet a high degree of control and what their evolutionary origin is has not been clear since they have no obvious homology with other protein families in the databases. In this study, we report the discovery of a new class of lanthionine synthetases that provides important new insights into both their mechanisms of catalysis as well as their likely evolutionary origin.</p><p>Lantibiotics have been categorized into two classes based on their biosynthetic pathways <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Pag1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For class I lantibiotics, LanB dehydratases convert Ser and Thr present in precursor peptides to dehydroalanine (Dha) and <italic>Z</italic>-dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), respectively. Subsequent intramolecular Michael addition of Cys thiols to Dha/Dhb catalyzed by LanC cyclases form the characteristic lanthionine (Lan, from Ser) and methyllanthionine (MeLan, from Thr) thioether crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Class II lantibiotics are produced by bi-functional LanM modifying enzymes, which are responsible for both dehydration and cyclization <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The C-terminal cyclase domain of LanM proteins has sequence homology with the LanC enzymes, but the N-terminal dehydratase domain of LanM proteins has no homology with LanB enzymes <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Siezen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Recent X-ray structure analysis and mutagenesis studies of LanC enzymes and LanC-like domains in LanM proteins have provided structural and mechanistic insights into the cyclization steps in lantibiotic biosynthesis <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Okeley1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1000339-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In contrast, the molecular mechanism of the dehydration reaction by lantibiotic synthetases remains an open question. In this paper, we conducted a search of genome databases for putative alternative lantibiotic synthetases and report the discovery of a new biosynthetic route to lantibiotic-like peptides. We demonstrate in vitro activity for one member from a cryptic gene cluster in the differentiating mycelial soil bacterium <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic>. This new class of enzymes provides a rare glimpse into an evolutionary path leading to lanthionine-containing peptides. Moreover, we show that the genes for all three pathways to lanthionine-containing peptides are widespread in nature and that they are not restricted to Gram-positive bacteria as long believed.</p><fig id="pbio-1000339-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000339.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Putative lantibiotic biosynthesis in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>.</title><p>(A) Posttranslational modification of precursor peptides by lantibiotic synthetases.

A nearby small open reading frame has all the hallmarks of a putative lantibiotic precursor gene including a series of Cys, Ser, and Thr residues that are localized in the C-terminal part of the gene product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>A search of the publicly available databases uncovered at least nine other gene clusters that encode proteins with an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase-like domain and a C-terminal LanC-like domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s010">Table S1</xref>). We hypothesized that these proteins would be novel bifunctional lanthionine synthetases in which the N-terminal region containing the kinase-like domain and the C-terminal LanC-like domain would be responsible for dehydration and cyclization, respectively. Continuing the common nomenclature for lantibiotic biosynthetic genes, we refer to them as LanL proteins with the enzyme from <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> given the annotation VenL and its putative substrate VenA. Located immediately downstream of <italic>venL</italic> and <italic>venA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) are two genes, <italic>venT</italic> and <italic>venH</italic>, that appear to encode the ATP-binding and membrane permease subunits, respectively, of an ABC transporter that may be involved in export of the modified peptide out of the cell as occurs for many lantibiotics.</p><p>Interestingly, the <italic>ven</italic> cluster does not contain apparent immunity genes unless that role is fulfilled entirely by the putative transport genes <italic>venTH</italic>, which is not common for lantibiotics.

Nor does the cluster contain any regulatory genes, although the latter is not unprecedented in actinomycete antibiotic gene clusters (e.g., the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of <italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic>) <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Hutchinson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>VenL Dehydrates and Cyclizes VenA</title><p>To verify the hypothesized function, <italic>venL</italic> and <italic>venA</italic> were cloned and heterologously expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. VenA was produced as a fusion protein with an N-terminally located maltose-binding protein (MBP) and hexahistidine tag (His<sub>6</sub>) to improve its solubility and provide ease of purification, respectively. The fusion protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and subsequently treated with tobacco etch virus protease to obtain His<sub>6</sub>-VenA with a predicted mass of 7,552.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). VenL was also produced with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag (His<sub>6</sub>-VenL) and purified by IMAC and gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s001">Figure S1</xref>). His<sub>6</sub>-VenA was incubated with His<sub>6</sub>-VenL in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and after 3 h subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). After incubation with His<sub>6</sub>-VenL, His<sub>6</sub>-VenA was converted into a product with a mass corresponding to the loss of four molecules of water (&#x02212;72 Da) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This result clearly demonstrated that His<sub>6</sub>-VenL carried out the dehydration of all four Ser/Thr residues present in the putative core peptide of VenA, the region of the precursor peptide that undergoes the posttranslational modifications (underlined sequence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Oman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The molecular weight of a cyclized or uncyclized product is identical, and therefore we determined the presence of any free Cys thiols in VenA after VenL treatment by reaction with iodoacetamide (IAA), a well-known thiol-selective alkylation agent. As expected, when intact His<sub>6</sub>-VenA was treated with IAA, its mass increased by 228 Da, corresponding to alkylation of the four Cys in the core peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In contrast, IAA treatment of His<sub>6</sub>-VenA after incubation with His<sub>6</sub>-VenL did not result in detectable alkylation products, indicating that the great majority of free thiols were converted to thioether rings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that VenL functions as a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both dehydration and cyclization reactions.</p><fig id="pbio-1000339-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000339.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>MALDI-ToF MS analysis of in vitro enzyme assays of His<sub>6</sub>-VenA with VenL and VenL deletion proteins.</title><p>Mass spectra are depicted of (A) His<sub>6</sub>-VenA, (B) His<sub>6</sub>-VenA after incubation with His<sub>6</sub>-VenL, (C) His<sub>6</sub>-VenA after incubation with His<sub>6</sub>-VenL-&#x00394;C, (D) His<sub>6</sub>-VenA after incubation with His<sub>6</sub>-VenL-&#x00394;LC, and (E) His<sub>6</sub>-VenA after incubation with both His<sub>6</sub>-VenL-&#x00394;LC and His<sub>6</sub>-VenL-&#x00394;KC.

Collectively, these results are consistent with dehydratase activity of VenL being divided into two distinct catalytic modules, a central kinase domain and an N-terminal lyase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Investigation of the <italic>ven</italic> Gene Cluster</title><p>To determine the possible physiological function of VenA, both <italic>venA</italic> and <italic>venL</italic> were deleted individually from the <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> genome.

On the other hand, these investigations into VenA originated from a bioinformatic approach, and to date we have not succeeded in detecting production of the peptide by <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> or after cloning the gene cluster in <italic>S. lividans</italic>, which is often used to express heterologous gene clusters of actinomycete origin. Therefore, the structure of the mature peptide, which we have termed venezuelin, is unknown. To gain insight into the topology of the lanthionine rings in VenA after processing by VenL, a series of VenA analogs were made in which each cysteine residue was replaced with an alanine residue (VenA-C32A, VenA-C34A, VenA-C45A, and VenA-C50A). Ala29 in the leader peptide region was also replaced with a Lys in these VenA analogs to improve their solubility. Each VenA analog was incubated with His<sub>6</sub>-VenL followed by endoproteinase Glu-C treatment to yield the C-terminal cyclized peptide spanning Thr18-Ala51, and subsequently subjected to electron spray ionization-quadrupole/ToF (ESI-Q/ToF) MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>In the tandem mass spectra of the VenA, VenA-C34A, and VenA-C45A peptides, no fragmentation was observed in the C-terminal region (Dhb31&#x02013;Ala51) except for a fragment ion resulting from cleavage between Cys50 and Ala51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;C</xref>). This observation suggests that the processed VenA peptide contains overlapping cyclic structures between Dhb31 and Cys50; such cyclic structures are less susceptible to fragmentation than linear regions <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Additional ions were observed in the C-terminal region in the spectrum of VenL-processed VenA-C32A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), providing more insights into the ring pattern. Two segments were still protected from fragmentation (Cys34&#x02013;Dhb39 and Cys45&#x02013;Dha49), implying the formation of a MeLan between Cys34 and Dhb39 and a Lan between Cys45 and Dha49. The fragmentations that are observed around Dhb32 and Dhb43 in this mutant suggest that these two Dhb residues, whose cyclization partners would be Cys32 and Cys50, are not cyclized. Hence, disruption of a MeLan involving Cys32, which is mutated in VenA-C32A, appears to interfere with formation of another ring. Nonetheless, the fragmentation pattern limits the ring topology to two possibilities: Cys32&#x02013;Dhb43 and Cys50&#x02013;Dhb31, or Cys32&#x02013;Dhb31 and Cys50&#x02013;Dhb43, in addition to the two assigned rings (Cys34&#x02013;Dhb39 and Cys45&#x02013;Dha49). VenA-C50A was also treated with VenL and the product analyzed by ESI-Q/ToF MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The large number of fragmentations in the C-terminal region suggests that Cys45 is not cyclized by VenL when Cys50 is mutated. On the other hand, protection from fragmentation in the N-terminal region strongly supports ring formation between Cys32 and Dhb43. With three rings assigned, the final ring would have to form between Cys50 and Dhb31. Collectively, the only structure that can account for the regions that are protected from fragmentation in all VenA peptides tested is the ring topology shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g004">Figure 4F</xref>.

All lantibiotics characterized thus far require the removal of the N-terminal leader sequence of the modified precursor peptide to attain their active forms. Since the cluster does not contain an identifiable protease or protease domain that might provide insights, the site of protease cleavage is unknown. However, a peptide with sequence homology to VenA encoded in the genome of <italic>Streptomyces clavuligerus</italic> has an AlaPheAla sequence that is identical to the cleavage site found in the CinA precursor to the lantibiotic cinnamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). For cinnamycin, this cleavage site is thought to be recognized by a protease of the secretory machinery <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Widdick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In VenA, this AlaPheAla-like sequence is a ProPheAla sequence spanning positions 27&#x02013;29. Thus, several mutant VenA peptides were generated in which cleavage sites for commercial proteases were engineered such that after proteolysis the C-terminal product would be that predicted by a ProPheAla cleavage site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Alternatively, GlyAla and AlaAla sequences are found in VenA that could be potential cleavage sites for a protease of the double-Gly type that are found in class II lantibiotics <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Hvarstein1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These sequences are located at positions 25&#x02013;26 and 29&#x02013;30 of VenA, respectively.

Most importantly, Lys51, His53, Arg83, and Tyr108 in VenL align well with the residues that play essential roles in catalysis by OspF enzymes (Lys104, His106, Lys136, and Tyr158 in SpvC, an OspF family member from <italic>Salmonella</italic>). In the proposed catalytic mechanism of SpvC based on an X-ray structure <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, Lys104 and Tyr158 donate hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of the target phosphothreonine to decrease the pK<sub>a</sub> of its &#x003b1; proton. Lys136 is the catalytic base that abstracts the &#x003b1; proton triggering the &#x003b2;-elimination of phosphate, with His106 protonating the oxygen of the phosphate leaving group. An important difference between the OspF and LanL proteins is that the latter process several phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues present in one peptide, unlike the OspF family, which recognizes one specific phosphoThr in host MAPKs. The essential residues of the lyase domain are not found in LanB proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s009">Figure S9</xref>), but sequence alignments with a series of LanM enzymes suggested that possibly some of the conserved residues in OspF might also be present at the N-termini of LanM enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). To test the functional importance of these residues, mutants were generated in a representative LanM enzyme (lacticin 481 synthetase; LctM) in which the conserved residues that may be part of a putative lyase active site were mutated (Lys227Met, Tyr225Ala, and the double mutation Arg226Met/Lys227Met). When incubated with the LctA substrate, all three mutants had full dehydration activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s007">Figure S7B</xref>), strongly suggesting that these residues are not part of a lyase domain in LctM.</p><p>The discovery of a third route for the synthesis of lanthionine-containing peptides illustrates the biological importance of these conformationally constrained peptides. Given the remarkable efficiency of forming polycyclic peptides from linear ribosomally produced peptides and their proven capability to recognize molecular targets with high affinities, it is perhaps not surprising that nature has evolved three distinct families of polypeptide sequences in order to access the reactive dehydro amino acids Dha and Dhb. A search of the available protein databases shows that the genes responsible for the three strategies for lanthionine biosynthesis are widespread, with some species containing two or all three pathways; e.g., LanL and LanB in <italic>Streptomyces clavuligerus</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic>, LanM and LanB in <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, and all three pathways in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000339-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

<bold>Sequence alignments of VenA and its homologue, SclA.</bold> All lantibiotics known to date require the removal of the N-terminal leader sequence of the modified precursor peptide to attain their active forms. Since venezuelin production by <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> has not yet been detected and since the cluster does not contain a protease that might provide insights, the site of protease cleavage is unknown. However, a peptide with sequence homology to VenA encoded in the genome of <italic>Streptomyces clavuligerus</italic> has an AFA sequence (panel A). Identical and similar residues are highlighted in yellow and cyan, respectively. The same AFA sequence motif has been predicted to be the recognition site for removal of the leader peptide of cinnamycin by Type I signal peptidases of the general secretory pathway <xref rid="pbio.1000339-Widdick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In VenA, the homologous sequence is PFA<sup>29</sup>&#x02013;A<sup>30</sup>, and we infer that the VenL-modified VenA is likely cleaved between Ala29 and Ala30 upon secretion (thick arrow). Taken together with the results of tandem mass spectrometry of the VenA derivatives, we propose the structure of venezuelin shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000339.s004">Figure S4B</xref>.

<bold>LanM enzymes do not contain the lyase domain found in the LanL family.</bold> (A) Sequence alignment between 10 LanL proteins and four selected LanM proteins. The alignments suggest that the lyase domain found in LanL proteins is not present in LanM proteins since the catalytic residues involved in the lyase activity of the OspF family and conserved in the LanL family (red stars) are not conserved in LanM. However, some weak sequence similarity between the lyase domains of the LanL family and LanM enzymes is shown around residue 149 of VenL (red bar); no significant homology was observed in other regions. (B) Substrate modification assays with VenL-&#x00394;C, LctM, and LctM mutants, in which the residues in the putative lyase domains of LanLs and LanMs were mutated in lacticin 481 synthetase (LctM). All mutants at these residues (Y225A, K227M, R226M/K227M) showed dehydration activity with the LctA substrate peptide similar to that of the wild-type LctM, which is shown for comparison.
