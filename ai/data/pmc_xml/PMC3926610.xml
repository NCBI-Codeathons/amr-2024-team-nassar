The enzyme is often upregulated in cancer cells, and it is a target for chemotherapeutic drugs of the camptothecin (CPT) family. Response to CPT-based treatment is dependent on hTopI activity, and reduction in activity, and mutations in hTopI have been reported to result in CPT resistance. Therefore, <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number, mRNA level, protein amount, and enzyme activity have been studied to explain differences in cellular response to CPT. We show that Rolling Circle Enhanced Enzyme Activity Detection (REEAD), allowing measurement of hTopI cleavage-religation activity at the single molecule level, may be used to detect posttranslational enzymatic differences influencing CPT response. These differences cannot be detected by analysis of hTopI gene copy number, mRNA amount, or protein amount, and only become apparent upon measuring the activity of hTopI in the presence of CPT. Furthermore, we detected differences in the activity of the repair enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, which is involved in repair of hTopI-induced DNA damage. Since increased TDP1 activity can reduce cellular CPT sensitivity we suggest that a combined measurement of TDP1 activity and hTopI activity in presence of CPT will be the best determinant for CPT response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Topoisomerase-I</kwd><kwd>camptothecin</kwd><kwd>enzyme activity</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>drug response</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA-modifying enzymes have been used for many years as drug targets in chemotherapeutic anticancer therapy, which exploits the high transcription and replication rates of cancer cells. As a consequence there has been a growing interest in using genetic and bio-enzymatic information related to these enzymes to predict drug response. An example of DNA-modifying enzymes that are targeted by chemoterapeutic agents is the human enzyme, topoisomerase I (hTopI). hTopI is an essential nuclear enzyme which releases the topological stress resulting during processes such as transcription and replication, where the two DNA strands in the DNA double helix are locally unwound. Enzymatically, hTopI acts through the transient cleavage and subsequent religation of one strand of the DNA helix [<xref rid="b1-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The enzyme is overexpressed in a wide range of cancers [<xref rid="b2-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and it is the sole cellular target of anticancer drugs from the camptothecin (CPT) family mainly used in systemic treatment of colon-, ovarian- and small cell lung cancer [<xref rid="b3-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently drugs of the CPT family have also been used for treatment of upper gastrointestinal-, cervical-, and pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="b6-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CPT exhibits its toxicity by intercalating between the bases of the DNA in the hTopI-induced nicks and is stabilized through interactions to both the DNA and hTopI [<xref rid="b10-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. CPT poisons the cells mainly through the generation of double-stranded DNA breaks caused by S-phase specific collision of replication forks with the hTopI-DNA complexes [<xref rid="b11-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, CPT also damages non-dividing cells through collision of the complexes with DNA repair processes and transcription forks [<xref rid="b12-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Stabilization of hTopI-DNA complexes may also occur as the result of cleavage near endogenous DNA lesions (such as nicks, abasic sites, or mismatches) [<xref rid="b13-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but are normally promptly repaired, e.g., through the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) dependent pathway [<xref rid="b15-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, enzymatic factors other than hTopI influence the patient response rate for CPT-based treatment, which for CPT monotherapy is around 20%&#x02013;30%, but may be increased to a response rate of around 50% in combination with other agents [<xref rid="b16-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>hTopI has been widely evaluated as a predictive biomarker for CPT-based therapy both at gene-, mRNA-, protein-, and activity level with somewhat diverging results. In some studies the gene-copy number of <italic>hTOPI</italic> has been found to correlate with protein expression and with CPT sensitivity [<xref rid="b19-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, others have found that neither the mRNA expression nor protein amount of hTopI was predictive for CPT sensitivity whereas hTopI activity correlated with the CPT sensitivity [<xref rid="b12-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b21-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, certain mutations in hTopI have been demonstrated to cause CPT resistance [<xref rid="b22-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We show here that direct determination of the drug response of hTopI is a better predictive marker for cellular CPT sensitivity than looking solely at gene copy number, mRNA amount, protein amount, or hTopI activity without drug. Furthermore, since other factors than hTopI have been shown to influence CPT response we suggest that additional assays, e.g., measurement of TDP1 activity may be included.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec><label>2.1.</label><title>Reagents and Enzymes</title><p>T4 polynucleotide kinase, Phi29 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, exonuclease I (ExoI), and exonuclease III (ExoIII) were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Slangerup, Danmark).

Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 &#x003bc;L cell extract in the presence or absence of CPT as indicated in the figure legends. DMSO was added as solvent control of CPT. Incubation was continued at 37 &#x000b0;C for 60 min for the dilution experiments and 15 min for CPT sensitivity experiments, before the heat inactivation of the enzymes by incubation for 5 min at 95 &#x000b0;C. To allow quantification, 5 nM of ligated S(PosC)Id33 was added to the heat inactivated reaction mixture and to increase the efficiency of hybridization NaCl was added to a final concentration of 250 mM. Preparation of the ligated S(PosC)Id33 was done using the T4 DNA ligase, and the resulting ligated circles were exonuclease digested with ExoI and ExoIII to remove non-ligated S(PosC)Id33 before gel-purification using 8% polyacrylamide gel. The concentration of the obtained circles was determined by spectrophotometric measurement. The 5&#x02032;-amine-coupled RCA primer was linked to CodeLink Activated Slides according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number is frequently increased in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="b25-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the two colon cancer cell lines used here, Caco2 and HT29 are known to have an approximate twofold difference in <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number. Caco2 has eight copies of the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene, whereas HT29 has five [<xref rid="b27-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These cell lines were examined with regards to hTopI protein amount, hTopI activity, cellular CPT sensitivity, TDP1 activity, and CPT response of hTopI in whole cell extracts.</p><p>Similar to McLeod <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="b19-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we found a correlation between the known <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number and the hTopI protein amount based on western blot analysis of extract from the two cell lines. Thus, the Caco2 cell line, which has eight copies of the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene, had around a twofold higher amount of hTopI protein compared to the HT29 cell line, which has five copies of the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene (<xref rid="f1-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This could indicate that there is a similar expression from the <italic>hTOPI</italic> genes in the two cell lines. However, <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number, RNA level, and protein amount is not capable of predicting changes in activity due to posttranslational factors. This may be problematic since the activity of TopI is known to be influenced by posttranslational modifications [<xref rid="b28-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] as well as protein-protein interactions [<xref rid="b30-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>We have previously published a method for highly sensitive detection of hTopI using Rolling Circle Enhanced Enzyme Activity Detection (REEAD), capable of measuring hTopI cleavage-religation activity at the single molecule level (<xref rid="f1-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="b24-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This method, which is based on a DNA-sensor with a preferred DNA binding site of hTopI, can detect any changes in activity whether it is DNA-binding, -cleavage, or -ligation. Using this method we found an approximate twofold higher hTopI activity in the extract from the Caco2 cell line compared to the extract from the HT29 cell line (<xref rid="f1-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>,D). In contrast to previous findings where hTopI protein amount and enzyme activity did not correlate [<xref rid="b12-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b21-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we found that the twofold higher hTopI activity in Caco2 correlated well with the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number and protein amount. This discrepancy between the two studies may likely be due to the use of different cell lines, which regulate hTopI activity differently at the posttranslational level, thus without affecting the hTopI protein amount.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2.</label><title>Presence of Gene Mutations in hTOPI or Different TDP1 Activity in Caco2 and HT29</title><p>To examine if the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number, protein amount, or enzyme activity could be correlated to cellular CPT sensitivity, the Caco2 and HT29 cultures were exposed to increasing concentration of CPT and the surviving cells were counted and scored as the percentage of the total number of cells. Despite the fact that the Caco2 cells have eight copies of the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene, and the HT29 have five, twofold more hTopI protein, and twofold higher activity of hTopI, the Caco2 and HT29 cells had similar sensitivity to CPT (<xref rid="f2-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This was unexpected since hTopI activity had been found to be the best determinant for CPT sensitivity, where high hTopI activity resulted in high cellular CPT sensitivity [<xref rid="b21-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>An explanation to this could be mutations in the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene, which have been shown to be able to modify the cellular CPT sensitivity [<xref rid="b22-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b31-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, sequencing of the <italic>hTOPI</italic> genes from either culture did not reveal any mutations in the genes (data not shown). Decreased cellular CPT-sensitivity can be obtained also through upregulation of enzyme activities involved in repair of TopI-DNA complexes such as TDP1 [<xref rid="b33-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We have previously published an optical DNA-based sensor (<xref rid="f2-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) capable of detecting the activity of TDP1 specifically even in crude cellular extract [<xref rid="b35-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The TDP1-sensor was shown to be capable of precisely detecting changes in TDP1 activity, and since it has been shown that increased TDP1 activity can influence cellular toxicity of CPT, we measured the activity of TDP1 in extract from both Caco2 and HT29. In <xref rid="f2-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> it can be seen that Caco2 cells did indeed have an approximate twofold higher TDP1 activity compared to HT29. The higher activity of TDP1 in Caco2 might contribute to the lower CPT sensitivity. Although Barthelmes <italic>et al.</italic> did not measure the TDP1 activity when they showed that overexpression of TDP1 could reduce CPT sensitivity, they reported a more than 100-fold increase in TDP1 protein [<xref rid="b33-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Despite that it has been shown that the amount of TDP1 protein does not always correspond to TDP1 activity [<xref rid="b36-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a 100-fold increase in TDP1 protein is likely to cause much more than a twofold increase in activity. Thus, the twofold increased TDP1 activity in Caco2 compared to HT29 is likely to contribute to the overall CPT sensitivity of the cell line but might not be the only factor.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3.</label><title>Posttranslational Modification Changing CPT Sensitivity</title><p>Since hTopI activity has been reported to be regulated both by posttranslational changes [<xref rid="b37-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and protein-protein interactions [<xref rid="b30-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it is possible that these factors may affect the drug response of hTopI directly. Such factors will not be revealed by measuring hTopI activity, -expression, -gene copy number, or by analyzing the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene for mutations. Therefore, we speculated that since the activity of the endogenously expressed hTopI did not correlate with the CPT sensitivity of the cell lines, different posttranslational modifications or protein-protein interactions could affect hTopI differently in the two cell lines resulting in similar cellular sensitivity to CPT. We have previously stressed the importance of using sensor systems resembling the natural substrates for the targeted enzymes as much as possible, <italic>i.e.</italic>, DNA-based sensor systems for DNA-modifying enzymes, since this will enable detection of differences in the DNA interaction of both enzymes and drugs [<xref rid="b39-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the REEAD assay such a DNA-based sensor system is exploited and is capable of detecting the cleavage-religation activity of hTopI at the single molecule level. Thus, CPT will prevent religation of the DNA-sensor leading to the generation of fewer closed DNA circles and thereby also fewer signals. Performing REEAD in the presence of CPT should therefore allow detection of any changes in the sensitivity of hTopI towards CPT. As seen in <xref rid="f3-sensors-14-01195" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> hTopI from the Caco2 cell line was less sensitive towards CPT than was hTopI from HT29 cells. The specificity of REEAD and the use of a divalent cation depleted buffer, leave most enzymes inactive due to lack of co-factors. Thus, it seems plausible that the different drug response observed in the two cell cultures could be a combination of increased TDP1 activity and different drug sensibility of the endogenously expressed hTopI.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4.</label><title>Conclusions and Outlook</title><p>Accurate prediction of a response to chemotherapeutic drugs such as CPT, which exert their cytotoxic effect via inhibition of specific enzymatic activities such as hTopI is complicated. There are several factors influencing the cellular response to CPT treatment, including the level of hTopI activity, genetic mutations in the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene, repair mechanisms such as TDP1, and posttranslational factors which may affect the activity or drug sensibility of hTopI. When comparing Caco2 and HT29, we observed that the Caco2 cell line containing close to twofold the amount of <italic>hTOPI</italic> genes compared to HT29 also had an approximate twofold increase in protein amount and hTopI activity. Since the level of hTopI activity previously has been found to be the best predictor of CPT sensitivity, the Caco2 cells were expected to be more sensitive to CPT than HT29. However, the two cell lines showed identical sensitivity to CPT, something that could not be explained from mutations in the <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene.</p><p>Since an increased level of TDP1 has been shown to result in decreased CPT sensitivity, we measured the activity of TDP1 in both the Caco2 and the HT29 cell lines and found an approximate twofold higher TDP1 activity in extract from the Caco2 cells compared to HT29 cells. Although other enzymes are required for repair of hTopI-induced damages in the TDP1-PARP dependent pathway, this difference may contribute to the higher CPT resistance in the Caco2 cell line. However, the twofold increase in TDP1 activity in Caco2 cells compared to HT29 cells is unlikely to counteract the effect of the increased activity of hTopI in the Caco2 cells completely. Hence, other factors may act in combination with the observed differences in TDP1 activity to explain the similar CPT response of Caco2 and HT29 cells. Indeed, when hTopI activity measurement was performed in the presence of CPT a marked difference in the CPT sensitivity of hTopI from the two cell lines was detected. Since the hTopI activity measurement was performed in a divalent cation depleted buffer with an assay strictly specific to hTopI, it indicates that the hTopI enzyme from the two cell lines, Caco2 and HT29 respond differently to CPT. We did not identify any mutations that could explain this difference, suggesting that the difference could be due to posttranslational modification of the hTopI protein. Note, that we cannot rule out that different intracellular CPT accumulation may also influence the survival of the Caco2 and HT29 cell lines.</p><p>Thus, <italic>hTOPI</italic> gene copy number, protein amount, and even hTopI activity cannot always accurately predict CPT sensitivity. Measuring hTopI activity in the presence of CPT increases the chance of precise estimation of cellular CPT sensitivity; however additional assays, such as measurement of TDP1 activity, could be included to maximize the chance of accurately predicting the CPT response.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Aase og Ejnar Danielsens Foundation, the K&#x000f8;bmand Svend Hansen og hustru Ina Hansens Foundation, the Familien Hede Nielsens Foundation, the Marie &#x00026; MB.

TATA binding protein (TBP) was used as loading control. (<bold>B</bold>) Graphic depiction of the REEAD assay. S(hTopI) is designed to adopt a dumbbell structure consisting of a stretch of double-stranded DNA connected by two loops holding a sequence identifying the substrate (marked Id and depicted in red) and a primer binding sequence (marked p and depicted in blue). The double-stranded DNA has a preferred recognition sequence for hTopI that enables hTopI to cleave S(hTopI) releasing three bases of DNA (shown in green) from the 3&#x02032;end of S(hTopI). This enables the 5&#x02032;end of S(hTopI) to hybridize, and hTopI can subsequently ligate the substrate into a closed circle. The generated circle is hybridized to a surface-attached primer matching the primer binding sequence (indicated by p). Subsequently, Phi29 DNA polymerase mix is added to support RCA and the resulting RCA products are visualized by hybridization of fluorescently labeled probes (matching the Id sequence) and the products analyzed using a fluorescence microscope.

All data are presented as the percentage of live cells with mean &#x000b1;SD from triplicate experiments. (<bold>B</bold>) Graphic depiction of the TDP1 assay. The TDP1-biosensor is designed to adopt a beacon structure, bringing the quencher (Q) and fluorophore (F) in proximity thus quenching the emission from the fluorophore. In presence of active TDP1, the quencher is removed from the TDP1-biosensor, and the emission of the fluorophore becomes quantifiable.
