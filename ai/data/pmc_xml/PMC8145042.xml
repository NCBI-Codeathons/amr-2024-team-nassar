PRPs, recognized as having at least eight contiguous pentapeptide repeats (PRs) of a consensus pentapeptide sequence, adopt a remarkable structure, namely, a right-handed quadrilateral &#x003b2;-helix with four consecutive PRs forming a single &#x003b2;-helix coil. Adjacent coils join together to form a &#x003b2;-helix &#x0201c;tower&#x0201d; stabilized by &#x003b2;-ladders on the tower faces and type I, type II, or type IV &#x003b2;-turns facilitating an approximately &#x02212;90&#x000b0; redirection of the polypeptide chain joining one coil face to the next. PRPs have been found in all branches of life, but they are predominantly found in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria have existed on earth for more than two billion years and are thought to be responsible for oxygenation of the earth&#x02019;s atmosphere. Filamentous cyanobacteria such as <italic>Nostoc</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 may also represent the oldest and simplest multicellular organisms known to undergo cell differentiation on earth. Knowledge of the biochemical function of these PRPs is essential to understanding how ancient cyanobacteria achieved functions critical to early development of life on earth. PRPs are predicted to exist in all cyanobacteria compartments including thylakoid and cell-wall membranes, cytoplasm, and thylakoid periplasmic space. Despite their intriguing structure and importance to understanding ancient cyanobacteria, the biochemical functions of PRPs in cyanobacteria remain almost completely unknown. The precise biochemical function of only a handful of PRPs is currently known from any organisms, and three-dimensional structures of only sixteen PRPs or PRP-containing multidomain proteins from any organism have been reported. In this review, the current knowledge of the structures and functions of PRPs is presented and discussed. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>filamentous cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>heterocyst</kwd><kwd><italic>Nostoc</italic> sp. strain Pcc7120</kwd><kwd>pentapeptide repeat protein</kwd><kwd>protein crystallography</kwd><kwd>repeat five residue fold</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-biomolecules-11-00638"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The first description of a pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) was reported in 1995, when Haselkorn and coworkers identified a gene from the filamentous cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc</italic> (formerly <italic>Anabaena)</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120, which, when mutated, altered the composition of glycolipids encasing the heterocysts, among other alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They named the gene <italic><underline>h</underline>eterocyst-specific <underline>g</underline>lyco<underline>l</underline>ipids-directing protein <underline>K</underline></italic> (<italic>hglK)</italic> for the role that the gene played in localization of glycolipids to heterocysts. The protein encoded by the <italic>hglK</italic> gene, HglK, was predicted to contain four trans-membrane spanning regions and an unusual alanine- and leucine-rich pentapeptide repeat (PR) region made up of 36 PRs with the consensus sequence AXLXX [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, HglK was the first PRP to be associated with a putative biochemical function. To date, however, the precise mechanism for the role that HglK plays in regulating glycolipid localization to heterocysts remains unknown. </p><p>In 1998, Bateman et al. [<xref rid="B2-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported the discovery of a novel family of proteins, to which HglK belonged, that contained tandem PRs with the sequence motif A(D/N)LXX, based on the analysis of recently determined complete genomes of several bacteria at the time. They observed that PRPs were most commonly found in cyanobacteria [<xref rid="B2-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The authors also proposed a model of PRP structures, rightly predicting that PRPs would adopt a right-handed &#x003b2; helical architecture; however, they predicted a triangular-shaped helix, which would prove to be in error once the first three-dimensional structures of PRPs were determined several years later. </p><p>Furthermore, in 1998, Mart&#x000ed;nez-Mart&#x000ed;nez confirmed that quinoline resistance in bacteria could be carried on a multi-resistance plasmid (pMG252), which they discovered in a clinical isolate of <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> [<xref rid="B3-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bacterial acquisition of antimicrobial resistance undergoes constant evolution with horizontal gene transfer through plasmids playing a major role [<xref rid="B4-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2001, Montero et al. discovered that intrinsic resistance to fluoroquinolines was influenced by MfpA, a putative PRP-containing protein encoded by a chromosomal gene in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 2005, Hegde et al. [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] solved the three-dimensional structure of MfpA from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, a homologue of MfpA from <italic>M. smegmatis,</italic> representing the first three-dimensional structure of a PRP, revealing that it adopted a right-handed quadrilateral &#x003b2; helical structure. Hegde et al. also reported that the structure and electrostatic charge distribution of MfpA mimicked that of DNA, and therefore MfpA was able to confer fluoroquinoline resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> due to its ability to mimic DNA, bind to DNA gyrase and inhibit its function [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Soon after, many more chromosomal genes encoding homologs of MfpA were discovered in the genomes of a variety of organisms and in 2013, Jacoby and Hooper reported a phylogenetic tree analysis that showed that quinoline resistance genes (<italic>qnr)</italic> and <italic>mfpA</italic> homologs could be identified in the chromosomes of 58 Gram-negative bacteria and 34 Gram-positive organisms and in 14 plasmid-mediated genes [<xref rid="B7-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </p><p>In 2003, Chandler et al. [<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] ascribed a cellular function to RfrA, a PRP from the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803, showing that it played a role in regulating a novel manganese uptake system; however, the nature of the system and the precise role that RfrA plays in regulating the manganese uptake system remains unknown.</p><p>By 2006, Vetting et al. [<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that the PRP family had grown to more than 500 members in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms and they updated the PR consensus sequence as [S,T,A,V][D,N][L,F][S,T,R][G]. In 2009, Buchko reviewed the knowledge of the structure and function of PRPs from cyanobacteria [<xref rid="B10-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 2014, Shah and Heddle reported that a query of the Pfam database (<uri xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org">http://pfam.xfam.org</uri> (accessed on 15 June 2014)) for members of the PR family (PF00805) had expanded to 11,082 sequences from 1513 species [<xref rid="B11-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and that protein structures had been solved for a number of PRPs from <italic>Nostoc.</italic> sp.

In 2019, Zhang et al. updated the PR consensus sequence to (A/C/S/V/T/L/I)/(D/N/S/K/E/I/R)/(L/F)/(S/T/R/E/Q/K/V/D)/(G/D/E/N/R/Q/K) based on the consideration of several newly available PRP crystal structures [<xref rid="B21-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. By 2020, the number of PRPs in the PF00805 Pfam had increased to 38,000 sequences in over 3300 species reported in a study by Xu and Kennedy that characterized the protein dynamics in PRPs [<xref rid="B22-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The current distribution of PRPs in PF00805 Pfam is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f002">Figure 2</xref>, indicating 38,981 PRP sequences distributed over 3338 species (<uri xlink:href="https://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00805#tabview=tab7">https://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00805#tabview=tab7</uri> (accessed on 25 April 2021)). In this sunburst plot, 82.2% of the species and 84.7% of the sequences belong to bacteria, 14.1% of species and 13.7% of sequences belong to eukaryota, 0.5% of species and 1.4% of sequences belong to viruses, and 1.1% of species and 2.2% of sequences belong to archaea. The plot shows that PRPs are found most abundantly in cyanobacteria, with 26.9% of all PRP sequences occurring in cyanobacteria; however, cyanobacteria represent only 3.7% of the species in which PRPs have been discovered, indicating that PRPs likely played an important physiological or structural role in the evolution and lifecycle of ancient cyanobacteria. Despite the large and growing nature of the PRP superfamily, three-dimensional structures of only sixteen PRP or PRP-containing proteins have been determined, thirteen of which contain a single PRP domain with &#x003b1; helices capping the N and/or C termini and three of which contain two or more domains including the PRP domain. </p><p>In this review, several PRP categories are discussed, ranging from those that have putative associated biochemical or cellular functions to those that have had structures determined but with unknown putative functions, including those involved in (1) heterocyst glycolipid synthesis, (2) manganese uptake, (3) gyrase inhibition, (4) ubiquitin E3 ligases, (5) synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 isoform C (SV2C) receptors, and (6) plant and cyanobacteria proteins with three-dimensional structures but no functional characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the biological functions of most PRPs remain unknown, three-dimensional structures of PRPs and PRP-containing multidomain proteins continue to be solved and reported with the hope of helping to eventually understand their biological, biochemical or cellular functions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-biomolecules-11-00638"><title>2.

Heterocyst Glycolipid Biosynthesis-HglK</title><p>In 1995, Haselkorn and coworkers identified the <italic>hglK</italic> gene in mutant strain 543 of the filamentous <italic>Nostoc</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mutant strain was isolated as a <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (lack of ability to fix dinitrogen except in an oxygen-depleted environment) mutant [<xref rid="B23-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] following chemical mutagenesis [<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The ultrastructural phenotype of the mutant strain showed that, in nitrogen replete media, i.e., media containing an abundant usable soluble nitrogen source, the vegetative cells in the filaments, i.e., those cells capable of dividing and extending the filament length, were more cylindrical and had thicker septa compared to the wild-type strain, whereas in nitrogen depleted media, the mutant heterocysts lacked the glycolipid layer that is normally exterior to the cell wall and isolates the nitrogenase enzyme that is required for fixation of atmospheric nitrogen inside the heterocysts from oxygen that inactivates the nitrogenase enzyme. Hydropathy analysis indicated that the 727 amino acid HglK protein contained four potential trans-membrane regions in its N-terminal region and 36 PRs in its C-terminal region starting at amino acid position 501. Analysis of the mutant strain indicated that it contained a stop codon just upstream of the DNA encoding the PRP domain. Because heterocysts in the mutant strain lacked the glycolipid layer exterior to the cell wall, the authors used thin-layer chromatography to analyze the lipid content of the mutant and wild-type strains and found no difference. The authors therefore concluded that the <italic>hglK</italic> gene encoded a protein that was necessary for localization of glycolipids to the heterocyst walls and that this function required the PRP domains.</p><p>Ar <italic>&#x000e9;</italic> valo and Flores further characterized the function of the <italic>hglK</italic> gene and discovered that <italic>hglK</italic> mutants were also defective in heterocyst differentiation, being impaired in the expression of the heterocyst-related genes <italic>coxB2A2C2</italic> (a cytochrome c oxidase) and <italic>nifHDK</italic> (a nitrogenase) [<xref rid="B25-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The authors also observed that HglK was predominantly localized at the intercellular septa and was required for biogenesis of long filaments, to produce normal numbers of nanopores, and for normal intercellular molecular transfer activity. The authors concluded that HglK contributed to the architecture of the intercellular septa and impacted the function of septal junctions [<xref rid="B25-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The precise biochemical role of HglK remains unknown and no three-dimensional structure of HglK is currently available.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-biomolecules-11-00638"><title>2.2. Regulator of Manganese Uptake-RfrA</title><p>In 2003, Pakrasi and coworkers discovered that RfrA (gene name <italic>sll1350</italic>), a PRP from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803, was a regulator of a novel high-affinity manganese uptake system [<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. RfrA and its function were identified in a suppressor screen in which the mutant strain was deficient in both <italic>mntC</italic>, a gene encoding a component of an ABC transport system for manganese, and <italic>psbO</italic>, which encoded an extrinsic manganese stabilizing protein of photosystem II. In a suppressor screen, one looks for additional mutations that reverse the mutant phenotype, in this case, deficiency in manganese transport. The authors discovered that a point mutation in rfrA restored photosynthetic activity of the <italic>&#x00394;</italic><italic>mntC</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;</italic><italic>psbO</italic> double deletion mutant. Radioactive manganese uptake experiments indicated that RfrA was a regulator of a high affinity manganese transport system that was different from the known manganese ABC transport system. The authors named the 398 amino acid RfrA protein for the <underline>r</underline>epeat <underline>f</underline>ive-<underline>r</underline>esidues (Rfr) domain, which is another name for PRPs, which occurred in the N-terminus of the protein. Genetic analysis indicated that <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 contained sixteen PRPs. RfrA was the first member of the PRP family to be linked to a specific physiological process. RfrA has no sequence or structural similarities to previously described bacterial manganese transcription factors and it does not have any known DNA-binding domains [<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been postulated that RfrA may regulate the second manganese transporter through a mechanism other than transcriptional control, such as by reversible protein modifications at the post-translational level [<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite the link to regulation of manganese uptake, the nature of the hypothetical second high-affinity manganese importer, its regulatory mechanism, and the precise biochemical role that RfrA plays regulating the putative manganese transporter remains unknown [<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The three-dimensional structure of RfrA also remains unknown.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-biomolecules-11-00638"><title>2.3.

MfpA (2BM4, 2BM5, 2BM6 and 2BM7) </title><p>In the early 2000s, with the growing antibiotic resistance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to two bactericidal compounds, isoniazid and rifampicin [<xref rid="B27-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], fluoroquinolines had become the most common new antibiotic therapy to treat <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In 2001, Montero et al. identified a gene <italic>mfpA</italic> that encoded a PRP that conferred a new mechanism of fluoroquinoline resistance to <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The protein encoded by the <italic>mfpA</italic> gene resulted in a low level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacine [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hegde et al. [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] identified a 183-amino acid MfpA homolog from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (MtMfpA) encoded by the Rv3361c gene that was 67% identical to the 192-residue <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> MfpA protein. In 2005, Hegde et al. [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported the three-dimensional structure of MfpA from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> revealing it to be a PRP made up of eight complete PR coils composed of a mixture of type II and type IV &#x003b2; turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f004">Figure 4</xref>). MfpA was the first PRP to have its three-dimensional structure solved. Hegde et al. reported that MfpA expression in vivo conferred resistance to the antibiotic fluoroquinolone. Fluoroquinolines are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs that interfere with DNA replication in bacteria, leading to bacterial cell death. Fluoroquinolines exert their antibacterial activity by interfering with the normal function of the type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV. These enzymes normally cut the genomic DNA to allow supercoiling and then ligate the DNA to stabilize the supercoiled DNA. Fluoroquinoline acts by inhibiting the ligase activity of these enzymes and leaving the nuclease activity intact, resulting in accumulation of single- and double-strand breaks that leads to disrupted DNA replication and cell death. Fluoroquinoline acts by binding reversibly to the gyrase-DNA complexes and stabilizing the covalent enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphate ester that is normally a transient intermediate in the topoisomerase reaction. Hegde et al. reported that the three-dimensional structure of MfpA exhibited a size, shape and electrostatic surface similar to that of B-form DNA, and concluded that its mechanism of action was due to DNA mimicry [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since fluoroquinoline only binds to DNA gyrase-DNA complexes, binding of MfpA to DNA gyrase blocks fluoroquinoline binding to DNA gyrase-DNA complexes, thus interfering with the bactericidal activity of fluoroquinoline [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. </p><p>Because its function relies on a mechanism of DNA mimicry, MfpA exists as functional dimer. Two molecules of MfpA undergo a head-to-head interaction mediated by two &#x003b1; helices at the C terminus of each molecule to form an asymmetric rod-like shape with a hydrophobic dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f004">Figure 4</xref>, top panel). Based on the electrostatic surface potential of the MfpA dimer, Hegde et al. generated a model in which the &#x003b2; helices of the MfpA dimer interacted with N terminal region of gyrase dimer through electrostatic interactions. The secondary structure of MfpA contains a &#x003b2; bulge in its &#x003b2; helix and two &#x003b1; helices at the C terminus and 28 to 29 &#x003b2; turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f004">Figure 4</xref>, top panel). </p><p>The head-to-head interaction two molecules of MfpA involves 81 contacts mediated by 18 residues on one chain and 17 residues on the second chain that interact through hydrogen bonds and non-bonded contacts involving a surface area of about 1700 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panel). An interweaved interaction between two MfpA molecules is mediated by a short parallel &#x003b2; sheet involving residues 162&#x02013;164 on one strand (chain A) and residues 178&#x02013;181 on the second strand (chain B), an orthogonal interaction between &#x003b1;-helices (165&#x02013;176 on each MfpA molecule), and another short parallel &#x003b2; sheet involving residues 178&#x02013;181 (chain A) and 162&#x02013;164 (chain B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panel). The dimer interaction was stabilized by a hydrophobic core formed by the interacting hydrophobic side chains from each &#x003b1;-helix primarily involving F172 (12 interactions), H176 (2 interactions), L178 (9 interactions), plus the H-bonds stabilizing the parallel &#x003b2;-sheets, and multiple interactions involving R145 (six interactions), R164 (7 interactions), and C179 (7 interactions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00638-f004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panel).

In the interaction between chain A (NleL) and chain C (E2 UbcH7), one salt bridge, two hydrogen bond and 47 non-bonded contacts form the contact interface involving 15 residues from chain A and 13 residues from chain C. Asn578 from NleL and Phe63 from E2 UbcH7 are responsible for most of the contacts for this interaction.

Different from interaction between chain A and C, in the interaction between chain B and chain D, a disulfide bond between Cys753 (chain B) and Cys86 (chain D) stabilized the interaction.

Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2 Receptors</title><sec><title>SV2C-LD (4JRA, 5JMC, 5JLV, 5MOY, and 6ES1)</title><p>Synaptic vesicles, also referred to as neurotransmitter vesicles, store various neurotransmitters that are released at the synapse, i.e., the junction, or between nerve cells. The synaptic vesicles are essential for propagation of nerve impulses and constantly regenerated in nerve cells. The synaptic lumen refers to the volume contained inside the synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) receptors represent a protein family with two essential complementary major isoforms, SV2A and SV2B, and one minor isoform, SV2C, that are putative transport proteins [<xref rid="B56-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. All three isoforms are composed of a 12-transmembrane domain and a luminal domain (SVC-LD), i.e., the domain sticks into the vesicle lumen, composed of a four and half-coil PRP &#x003b2; helix that acts as a receptor for binding to Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) from the bacterium <italic>C. botulinum</italic> and related bacteria [<xref rid="B57-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most toxic class of bioweapons and also have a popular and widely used cosmetic application as an anti-wrinkle agent, e.g., Botox [<xref rid="B58-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. BoNTs exist as seven main serotypes from BoNT/A to BoNT/G [<xref rid="B58-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In 2006, Dong et al. showed that the luminal domain of SV2 (SVC-LD) acts as a receptor for BoNT [<xref rid="B57-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The SV2C-LD is necessary in the process of translocation of BoNT/A and glycosylation of SV2C-LD and SV2 glycan are also crucial for BoNT/A binding to neurons [<xref rid="B58-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>From 2014 to 2018, five structures were reported for complexes between BoNTs and the SV2C-LD (also referred to as SV2C-L4) [<xref rid="B58-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

All five structures were similar with slight variations in the relative orientations between the SV2C-LD and the different subtypes of BoNT/A. The interaction between the BoNT/A and the SV2C-LD receptor occurs at the exposed &#x003b2;-strand of the 5th Rfr coil at C-terminal un-capped edge of the PRP domain by forming an interchain &#x003b2;-sheet mediated by backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bonds between the open &#x003b2; strand of SV2C-LD and the &#x003b2;-strand edge of the BoNT/A. Even though the structural features of the multiple SV2C-LD/BoNT/A complexes are similar, the orientation of the BoNT/A relative to the SV2C-LD &#x003b2;-helix receptor varied slightly among the structures due to differences in amino acids sidechains mediating the binding interaction and due to flexibility of the interactions [<xref rid="B61-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. For example, in two structures reported for the same complex SV2C-LD/BoNT/A but crystallized in different space groups and with different resolution (PDB-IDs 5MOY and 6ES1), the orientation of the SV2C-LD &#x003b2;-helix was rotated by 15&#x000b0; relative to BoNT/A to maintain the tight interaction between &#x003b2;-hairpin of BoNT/A and the continuing &#x003b2;-sheet [<xref rid="B61-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>Despite their intriguing structure, and variations therein, the large size of their Pfam superfamily with nearly 39,000 members, and their relative abundance in one of the most ancient and important organisms on earth, i.e., oxygenic cyanobacteria, the biochemical function of PRPs remains remarkably elusive. To date, there are only two examples where the explicit biochemical function of a PRP is known, as discussed in this review. The first cellular function being that of conferring antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinoline antibiotics through the biochemical function of acting as DNA gyrase inhibitors, such as MfpA and the Qnr family of proteins, that exert their function by acting as a DNA mimic, binding to the complex of DNA gyrase and DNA, and blocking binding of fluoroquinoline to the DNA gyrase DNA complex, and therefore blocking its antibiotic activity. The second clear function is seen in SV2C that functions as a BoNT/A receptor in the synaptic vesicles of neurons. In this activity, the BoNT/A toxin binds to the SV2C PRP luminal domain of a synaptic vesicle neurotransmitter membrane protein, with the binding interaction mediated by a dovetailing of the &#x003b2;-strands of the BoNT/A neurotoxin with an exposed &#x003b2;-strand edge of the PRP luminal domain, resulting in the formation of an extended &#x003b2;-sheet that spans and crosses over the PRP luminal domain and the BoNT/A neurotoxin molecule. This completes the list of examples for which a PRP or a PRP domain of a larger protein is known to carry out a specific biochemical function that directly involves the PRP structure itself. From there, our understanding of PRP function becomes less clear. We have seen that PRP domains are present in the SopA ubiquitination inhibitor whose biochemical function is to bind to TRIM56 and TRIM65 and block the host immune response of interferon production that would normally stimulate proteasome targeting of the bacterial proteins as part of the host immune response to infection; however, the PRP domain of SopA does not directly interact with the targeted TRIM proteins leaving the precise function of the PRP domain of SopA in question. From here, a biochemical function has been associated with a few other PRPs, e.g., the prototypical HglK protein was associated with localization of glycolipids to the heterocyst outer layer, but the structure of HglK is unknown and the precise biochemical function of HglK remains unknown. The same is true for RfrA, for which a putative role in regulating an uncharacterized manganese uptake system was proposed, but the structure of RfrA and the nature of the putative manganese uptake system remains uncharacterized. Similarly, HetL has been shown to play a role in regulating heterocyst differentiation, and the structure of HetL has been determined, but no connection between the structure and the proposed biochemical function has been elucidated. The remaining structure/function space of the PRP superfamily remains completely uncharacterized.</p><p>What we can deduce at this point regarding the structure and function of PRPs, and multi-domain proteins containing PRP domains, is that in some cases the function is a consequence of the shape and electrostatic surface potential of the PRP, as is observed in the case of DNA mimicry in MfpA [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the Qnr family of proteins [<xref rid="B3-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B30-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B34-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In other cases, the PRP domain makes a direct interaction with another protein to mediate its function, such as with the SV2C-LD binding to BoNT/A [<xref rid="B58-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

We have also observed many subtle variations in Rfr fold structures that may turn out to be important to function, including small bulges that project from the &#x003b2;-helix structure, variations in the compositions of the &#x003b2;-turns, i.e., the mixture of type I, type II, and type IV &#x003b2; turns, which cause subtle changes in the &#x003b2;-helix dimensions or &#x003b2;-helix twist [<xref rid="B21-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as well as the presence or absence of N-terminal or C-terminal capping &#x003b1;-helices, and whether or not the PRP constitutes a domain in a multidomain protein. </p><p>In closing, while the structure-space of PRPs becomes richer, our understanding of the biochemical function of members of the PRP superfamily lags increasingly behind. Targeted and carefully designed studies are required to begin to chip away at expanding our understanding the repertoire of structures and functions of the enigmatic members of the PRP superfamily.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The research was conducted with the support of Miami University.

The numbers indicate the log base 2 of the relative change following nitrogen deprivation relative to the 0 h time point. Positive values indicate increased expression and negative values indicate decreased expression. Values shaded in blue indicate at least a twofold increase in expression. Values marked by an asterisk (*) indicate statistically significant changes. Values shaded in pink indicate at least a 40% decrease in expression. Values were obtained from the supplementary tables reported by Ehira and Omori [<xref rid="B67-biomolecules-11-00638" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biomolecules-11-00638-g020"/></fig></floats-group></article>
