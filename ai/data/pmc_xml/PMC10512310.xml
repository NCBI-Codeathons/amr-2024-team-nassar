Although progress has been made in the development of methods for extracting nucleic acids for genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of these fungi, most studies are limited in that they do not sample multiple fungal growth phases in batch culture. In this study, we establish a method to harvest RNA from fungal monocultures and fungal&#x02013;methanogen co-cultures, and also determine an optimal time frame for high-quality RNA extraction from anaerobic fungi. Based on RNA quality and quantity targets, the optimal time frame in which to harvest anaerobic fungal monocultures and fungal-methanogen co-cultures for RNA extraction was 2-5 days of growth post-inoculation. When grown on cellulose, the fungal strain <italic>Anaeromyces robustus</italic> cocultivated with the methanogen <italic>Methanobacterium bryantii</italic> upregulated genes encoding fungal carbohydrate-active enzymes and other cellulosome components relative to fungal monocultures during this time frame, but expression patterns changed at 24-hour intervals throughout the fungal growth phase. These results demonstrate the importance of establishing methods to extract high-quality RNA from anaerobic fungi at multiple time points during batch cultivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>anaerobic</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>methanogens</kwd><kwd>CAZymes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Army

This is particularly true when working with fungi that have extensive rhizoid or mycelial networks and chitin-rich cell walls (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Orpin, 1977</xref>), which require difficult lysis and extraction protocols to isolate sufficient quantities of high-quality nucleic acids (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maaroufi et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fredricks et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). For example, anaerobic fungi are non-model organisms that serve as a valuable source of diverse carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), with powerful biomass-degrading capabilities (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Youssef et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Haitjema et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Henske et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wilken et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). This means that they are particularly useful in biotechnology applications to generate value-added products from low-cost waste materials (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et&#x000a0;al., 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Haitjema et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, these fungi also produce unique natural products (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Swift et&#x000a0;al., 2021b</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Swift et&#x000a0;al., 2021a</xref>), which probably enables their function and which could be harnessed as an emerging class of antimicrobials or as therapeutic compounds. Several research teams have worked to develop unique lysis and extraction approaches to overcome challenges associated with obtaining high-quality genomic DNA from anaerobic fungi to access this biotechnology potential (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Youssef et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Calkins et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et&#x000a0;al., 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et&#x000a0;al., 2016c</xref>).</p><p>Although advancements to overcome the challenges associated with extracting DNA and RNA from non-model microbes, such as anaerobic fungi, have been made, universally effective RNA extraction methods are not yet well established for anaerobic fungi. For example, it is extremely challenging to extract similar quantities of high-quality RNA in the lag, exponential growth, and stationary phases that may prove relevant to deciphering the function of certain fungal genes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Most gut fungal RNA studies to date have collected RNA data from one time point in the mid-log growth phase. These studies have focused on the differential regulation of CAZymes and/or the biosynthetic genes, which encode natural products within anaerobic fungi (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et&#x000a0;al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Swift et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), as altered by substrate, or cocultivation with other organisms. The ability to collect RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a full-time course across all growth regimes provides valuable information regarding when the CAZyme and biosynthetic genes of interest are expressed. Determining how widely expression varies as a function of the growth phase would also inform bioreactor design to maximize the production of target products (e.g., enzymes or metabolites) produced by anaerobic fungi, either in isolation or in co-culture.</p><p>To monitor gene expression, a reliable method for the collection of high-quality RNA for transcriptomic analysis is needed. This study investigates how the time of harvest affects RNA quality, RNA concentration, and transcriptional regulation, with a focus on biomass-degrading enzymes and other fungal cellulosome components. We chose to examine fungal&#x02013;methanogen co-cultures and fungal monocultures, as previous studies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Swift et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>) have demonstrated that the transcription of CAZymes increases at a given time point in the fungal growth phase when cocultivated with a methanogen. Fungal monocultures of <italic>Anaeromyces robustus</italic> and co-cultures of <italic>A. robustus</italic> and the methanogen <italic>Methanobacterium bryantii</italic> were cultivated on filter paper and harvested at 24-hour timepoints from the second day of growth to the seventh day of growth post inoculation for RNA extraction and subsequent RNA quality and quantity assessment. The optimal time frame in which to harvest anaerobic fungal monocultures and fungal-methanogen co-cultures for RNA extraction was 2-5 days of growth post-inoculation. During this window of growth, overall fungal CAZyme regulation in anaerobic fungal co-cultures with methanogens as compared with fungal monocultures was dependent on the time of harvest. The genes encoding fungal cellulosome components were upregulated in co-cultures of fungi and methanogens relative to fungal monocultures, with variation in expression occurring at 24-hour intervals. These findings highlight that timing and the phase of fungal growth are important factors to consider when designing experiments and deciphering transcriptomic regulation patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Growing and harvesting cultures for RNA extraction</title><p>Anaerobic serum bottles (120&#x000a0;mL total volume) containing 80&#x000a0;mL of modified medium C (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Theodorou et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) (&#x0201c;MC&#x02013;&#x0201d;), with 0.8&#x000a0;mL of 100&#x000d7;&#x000a0;vitamin solution (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Teunissen et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>) and 0.8&#x000a0;g of reed canary grass, were inoculated with cultures of the anaerobic fungus <italic>A. robustus</italic> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et&#x000a0;al., 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Haitjema et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) and the methanogen <italic>M. bryantii</italic>: 1.0&#x000a0;mL of <italic>A. robustus</italic> or a combination of 1.0&#x000a0;mL of <italic>A. robustus</italic> and 1.0&#x000a0;mL of <italic>M. bryantii</italic> [DSM No.-863, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ)] (routine cultures were cultivated as described previously by Swift, et&#x000a0;al.)

The fungal and methanogen co-cultures and fungal monocultures were grown anaerobically at 39&#x000b0;C in Hungate tubes filled with 7.0&#x000a0;mL of autoclaved modified medium C (&#x0201c;MC&#x02013;&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Theodorou et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), containing 1.25 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L Bacto&#x02122; Casitone, and 7.5 vol% clarified rumen fluid, with 0.08&#x000a0;g filter paper (Grade 3, 23&#x000a0;mm, 100&#x000a0;circles; CAT no. 1003&#x02013;323, Lot No 16932763; Whatman GE Healthcare Life Sciences) as the growth substrate, supplemented with 0.1&#x000a0;mL of vitamin solution post autoclaving, and inoculated with 0.8&#x000a0;mL of the appropriate 80-mL inoculum culture at the mid-log growth phase (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Teunissen et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>). Pressure production was used as a proxy for fungal growth, as described previously (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Theodorou et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>). Daily pressure measurements were taken using a probe pressure transducer (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Theodorou et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>). Once methane was detectable in the co-cultures, indicating that a successful co-culture had formed (starting at 48&#x000a0;hours post-inoculation), three or four cultures were harvested at 24-hour intervals and stored for later RNA extraction. Endpoint methane measurements for co-cultures were taken from the headspaces of the culture tubes before harvesting the cultures. First, the pressure in each sample was measured using a pressure transducer (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Theodorou, 1994</xref>), and the headspace composition was measured using a gas chromatograph (GC)-pulsed, discharge helium ionization detector (TRACE 1300; Thermo Fisher Scientific) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai and Stearns, 2013</xref>). Finally, the headspace pressure of the samples was vented to return the headspace to atmospheric pressure.</p><p>After sampling the headspace gas of the culture to determine if methane was present in the co-cultures, the cultures were opened in an anaerobic chamber and the colonized filter paper was transferred to a 15&#x000a0;mL Falcon&#x02122; tube containing 1&#x000a0;mL of RNAlater&#x02122; using sterilized tweezers. The Falcon&#x02122; tube was then removed from the anaerobic chamber and immediately stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C until later extraction.

Raw gene counts were used to evaluate the level of correlation between biological replicates using Pearson&#x02019;s correlation and to determine which replicates would be used in the differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Any replicate with a correlation above 0.85 qualified for inclusion in the analysis. At least three biological replicates for each condition were used for the RNA quality/quantity evaluation and for RNA-seq.

However, these studies used only one or at the most two time points of RNA collection during the growth phase of fungal monocultures and co-cultures, calling into question whether or not these findings would hold throughout the entire duration of co-culture cultivation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Swift et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>).

Recent research has determined that CAZymes are regulated at the mid-log growth phase and late growth phase of a gut fungal monoculture, and also in co-culture with a methanogen grown on glucose (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), noting a change in CAZyme regulation between the growth phases. However, it remains unclear how differences in growth stage affect the outcome of CAZyme-focused transcriptional studies, and to what extent the timeline of cultivation drives the differences observed in these studies. Determining the optimal time frame for maximal expression of CAZymes is also crucial to informing bioprocessing strategies that seek to use anaerobic fungi, as the prevalence of CAZymes within a bioreactor determines the efficiency with which a batch culture can degrade plant biomass substrates.</p><p>DESeq2 was used to determine that 1,002 unique genes were differentially expressed (419 upregulated and 583 downregulated) by the anaerobic fungus <italic>A. robustus</italic> over the 4 days (days 2&#x02013;5 post-inoculation) when examined in fungal&#x02013;methanogen co-culture as compared with a fungal monoculture.

Days 2&#x02013;4 post inoculation fell within the exponential growth phase and day 5 post inoculation marked the beginning of the stationary growth phase based on measurements of pressure accumulation in the headspace of the cultures, which serves as a proxy for growth in the absence of quantitative methods to measure fungal cells grown on an insoluble substrate (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Theodorou et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>). Although the average accumulated pressure was slightly higher overall under co-cultivation, it did not appear to affect when the shift from exponential growth to stationary growth occurred relative to fungal monoculture. Out of the unique genes that were differentially expressed, 200 of those genes encoded fungal CAZymes. GSEA preranked analysis of CAZyme regulation revealed that CAZymes were enriched in upregulated genes in co-culture compared with monoculture on days 3 and 5 (significant at a false discovery rate, FDR, of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;25%), but not on days 2 and 4, as indicated in the <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

The day that cultures were harvested post-inoculation affected the total number of CAZymes regulated and whether or not more CAZyme genes were upregulated or downregulated when comparing co-cultures with monocultures.
