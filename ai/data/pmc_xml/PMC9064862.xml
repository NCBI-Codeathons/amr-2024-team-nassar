These strategies, however, often entail laborious, multi-step, and time-consuming procedures to recover the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from soil metagenomes for subsequent heterologous expression. Here, we developed an efficient method we called single Nanopore read cluster mining (SNRCM), which enables the fast recovery of complete BGCs from a soil metagenome using long- and short-read sequencing. A metagenomic fosmid library of 83,700 clones was generated and sequenced using Nanopore as well as Illumina technologies. Hybrid assembled contigs of the sequenced fosmid library were subsequently analyzed to identify BGCs encoding secondary metabolites. Using SNRCM, we aligned the identified BGCs directly to Nanopore long-reads and were able to detect complete BGCs on single fosmids. This enabled us to select for and recover BGCs of interest for subsequent heterologous expression attempts. Additionally, the sequencing data of the fosmid library and its corresponding metagenomic DNA enabled us to assemble and recover a large nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) BGC from three different fosmids of our library and to directly amplify and recover a complete lasso peptide BGC from the high-quality metagenomic DNA. Overall, the strategies presented here provide a useful tool for accelerating and facilitating the identification and production of potentially interesting bioactive compounds from soil metagenomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Key points</title><p id="Par2">&#x02022; <italic>An efficient approach for the recovery of BGCs from soil metagenomes was developed to facilitate natural product discovery.</italic></p><p id="Par3">&#x02022; <italic>A fosmid library was constructed from soil metagenomic HMW DNA and sequenced via Illumina and Nanopore.</italic></p><p id="Par4">&#x02022; <italic>Nanopore long-reads enabled the direct identification and recovery of complete BGCs on single fosmids.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00253-022-11917-y.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Metagenomic DNA</kwd><kwd>Fosmid library</kwd><kwd>Nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>Natural products</kwd><kwd>Secondary metabolites</kwd><kwd>Single Nanopore read cluster mining (SNRCM)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>State Postgraduate Fellowship Programme (Landesgraduiertenf&#x000f6;rderung) and DFG (project 398967434-TRR 261)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009139</institution-id><institution>Deutsches Zentrum f&#x000fc;r Infektionsforschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TTU09.716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ziemert</surname><given-names>Nadine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM129344-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eust&#x000e1;quio</surname><given-names>Alessandra S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Germany&#x02019;s Excellence Strategy&#x02013;EXC 2124&#x02013;390838134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mantri</surname><given-names>Shrikant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Eberhard Karls Universit&#x000e4;t T&#x000fc;bingen (1020)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Due to the massive overuse as well as misuse of antibiotics, we currently face a worldwide health threat as a result of the increasing number of deadly infections with multi-drug resistant bacteria (Martens and Demain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>; Church and McKillip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>). New antimicrobial compounds are desperately needed, but for more than 30&#x000a0;years, no new antibiotic classes have been approved for clinical use (Church and McKillip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>). Microbial secondary metabolites, especially the ones produced by soil microorganisms, have been a valuable source of antibiotics and also other important therapeutics such as anti-cancer drugs (Pham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>). These molecules are encoded by so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In each BGC, the genes necessary to build a unique compound are located next to each other within the bacterial genome (Wohlleben et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>). The distinction among different classes of natural products is generally based on the mode of biosynthesis of the molecules. The most important classes in this context comprise compounds synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) as well as terpenes and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) (Ziemert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Many of these compounds were discovered from soil microorganisms by applying culture-based approaches, which rely on the isolation, culturing, and subsequent screening of the microorganisms in the laboratory for the production of bioactive compounds (Katz and Baltz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>). While numerous compounds that are in medical use today have been discovered in this way, the culture-dependent approach soon started struggling with the issue of high rediscovery rates, leading to a decreasing number of novel compounds (Daniel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>; Adamek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>). However, further studies revealed that soils are much richer in microbial diversity than previously anticipated and that only 1&#x000a0;g of soil can harbor thousands of unique bacterial species (Roesch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>). Culture-dependent approaches have so far not been able to access the majority of biosynthetic diversity present in soils and other natural environments because only a tiny proportion (approx. 1%) of bacteria can be cultured in the laboratory with the standard cultivation methods (Kellenberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2001</xref>; Schloss and Handelsman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>; Hug et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">One of the attempts to solve this issue led to the development of culture-independent approaches, i.e., metagenomics, which was made possible by technological advances in sequencing, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology. It is nowadays possible to apply different sequencing approaches to soil metagenomes and yield the complete sequence of BGCs in silico (Crits-Christoph et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>; Waschulin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2021</xref>). However, in order to obtain the corresponding encoded compounds, the metagenomic BGCs need to be recovered and expressed in a heterologous host organism. Therefore, metagenomic DNA is generally cloned in genetic libraries such as cosmid or fosmid libraries to physically access the BGCs.</p><p id="Par8">Different approaches have been applied to identify and recover BGCs from metagenomic libraries. One of these consists of screening metagenomic libraries for clones carrying BGCs via PCR using degenerate primers for biosynthetic domains such as ketosynthase (KS) domains of PKSs or adenylation (A) domains of NRPSs. Positive clones can then be recovered and further investigated for the presence of BGCs and subsequent heterologous expression experiments (Bauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>; Amos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). Especially larger BGCs that exceed the maximum insert size of the respective vector often reveal to be incomplete, but also smaller BGCs might only be partially captured resulting from the random cloning process. In these cases, BGC-specific primers have been used to screen the library for clones carrying the corresponding parts, enabling the assembly of the full cluster using specific cloning techniques (Hover et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). However, this procedure is very time consuming and more importantly requires high coverage of the full metagenome to ensure that a selected BGC is completely captured within the library. Other approaches focus on short-read shotgun sequencing of the fosmid library and subsequent identification of BGCs from the resulting contigs (Santana-Pereira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>). This approach provides more information about the presence of complete BGCs within the library for potential heterologous expression. However, it also does not give direct information on the distribution of the BGCs over different clones, which makes recovery of complete BGCs still a time-consuming labor-intensive process.</p><p id="Par9">Here, we developed a method we called single Nanopore read cluster mining (SNRCM), which uses short- and long-read sequencing data of a fosmid library to accelerate the recovery of complete secondary metabolite BGCs. This approach enabled us to use Nanopore long-reads for the identification of complete BGCs on a single fosmid without prior isolation and analysis of candidate clones. Furthermore, using the sequencing data of the corresponding metagenomic DNA, we were able to directly amplify a complete lasso peptide BGC from metagenomic DNA, as well as assemble a larger NRPS BGC spanning over different fosmids into a complete cluster.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Soil sampling, isolation, and sequencing of metagenomic HMW DNA</title><p id="Par10">The A horizon of the soil type cambisol was sampled from the Sch&#x000f6;nbuch Forest nature reserve (close to T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany) in November 2016. Different metagenomic HMW DNA isolation protocols were applied for subsequent Nanopore and Illumina sequencing of the DNA as described in detail in our previous study (Mantri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>). The HMW DNA used for fosmid library generation was isolated following two methods of our previous study, which are summarized in the following: a small part of the library (approx. 8000 clones) was generated from HMW DNA isolated using the isolation method &#x0201c;for Nanopore sequencing run 1.&#x0201d; Briefly, this method followed a published isolation protocol (Brady <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>) with an additional step to increase the DNA purity. The protocol is based on chemical lysis using a heated lysis buffer (70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) to extract metagenomic DNA from a 250&#x000a0;g fine soil sample. After precipitation with isopropanol, the DNA was purified and size selected using a large agarose gel. For that purpose, the resuspended DNA was loaded into several large wells, followed by electrophoresis at 20&#x000a0;V overnight. Subsequently, a left and right part of the gel each containing the Lambda DNA/HindIII ladder and a small part of a well were cut, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized. The ladder served as reference to mark the location of HMW DNA within the gel. After reassembly of the gel, the marks were used to cut gel slices from the unstained gel containing the HMW DNA. The slices were transferred to dialysis tubes, followed by electroelution of the HMW DNA contained within the gel slices into the dialysis tubes. As an additional step to the published protocol, the dialysis tubes were incubated overnight in 0.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Tris&#x02013;EDTA (TE) buffer. Finally, the DNA was concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator (Amicon, MWCO 30,000) as described by Brady. The main part of the fosmid library (75,700 clones) was generated from HMW DNA isolated using the isolation method &#x0201c;for Nanopore sequencing run 2&#x0201d; described in our previous study. Briefly, this method followed a published isolation protocol (Verma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>) with several modifications to optimize DNA yield and purity. The protocol is based on a combination of enzymatic (37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and subsequent chemical lysis (65&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) to extract metagenomic HMW DNA from 6 fine soil samples, each of 5&#x000a0;g. The extract was first purified with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, followed by precipitation of the DNA with a 0.1 volume of 3&#x000a0;M sodium acetate and a 0.4 volume of 30% poly ethylene glycol (PEG-8000). The DNA was resuspended in TE buffer, and, as an additional step to the published protocol, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of RNase I was added, followed by incubation for 30&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, the DNA was extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. As another modification to the protocol, in the following step, the DNA was not only precipitated with isopropanol as described but also with a 0.1 volume of 5&#x000a0;M sodium acetate. The protocol of Verma et al. was completed by washing the pelleted DNA with a sodium chloride solution and subsequently with 70% ethanol, followed by resuspension in TE buffer. The obtained DNA was further purified and size selected using a large agarose gel as described above. The size of the resulting DNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized using a gel imaging system (Nippon Genetics Europe). This DNA was also used for the amplification of metagenomic BGCs. Concentration and absorbance ratios were determined using the Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Generation of a metagenomic fosmid library and subsequent Illumina and Nanopore sequencing</title><p id="Par11">Isolated metagenomic HMW DNA was directly used for the generation of a metagenomic fosmid library using the CopyControl Fosmid Library Production Kit with pCC1FOS Vector (Lucigen) following the manufactures instructions with the following modifications: Since the DNA was already size selected during the isolation procedure, it had the appropriate size and did not need any shearing or further size selection after end-repair. The ligation reaction was scaled up to 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l for each packaging reaction. Ligation was performed overnight at 16&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

Residual genomic DNA was digested using Exonuclease V (NEB), followed by purification of the fosmids using the Genomic DNA Clean &#x00026; Concentrator-10 kit (Zymo Research).

The BGCs were analyzed for completeness by checking for the presence of the minimal set of the necessary lasso peptide biosynthesis gene homologues A, B, and C. For both BGCs, the B2 and C genes could be identified using Blastx and antiSMASH analysis (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplemental Table S2).

The precursor peptides in BGC 482.1 (A genes) had to be manually annotated as it is often the case for lasso peptide encoding BGCs due to the small size of the gene.

These genes not only showed a similar size to known A genes, but, more importantly, their translated amino acid sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) revealed characteristics common to a lasso peptide (Maksimov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>). These included (i) the presence of a glycine in appropriate distance to an aspartate for ring formation and (ii) appropriate length of the amino acid sequence predicted to form the tail of the lasso peptide, i.e., those amino acids that were located right to the ring forming amino acids within the sequence. The amino acids on the left side of the ring forming glycine would be those cleaved from the precursor peptide. Although a threonine is commonly found at position -2 relative to the core peptide, the threonine can be replaced with amino acids similar in size (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>) such as the leucine and serine predicted here.

To demonstrate this, we chose the lasso peptide BGC 44.1 detected on a contig derived from the soil metagenome sequencing (Online Resource 3). The putative lasso peptide specific genes A, B1, B2, C, and D were identified and analyzed using the bioinformatics methods as described before (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Supplemental Table S4). Using specific primers with restriction site overhangs (SacI, SalI) compatible for subsequent cloning, the genes A, B1, B2, and C, all showing the same orientation, were amplified in a single PCR (3034&#x000a0;bp). Subsequently, the amplified cluster was ligated into an expression vector. In a second step, the translationally coupled genes D1 and D2 were similarly amplified in a single PCR using specific primers with overhangs that allowed the subsequent introduction of the amplified D genes downstream of the other lasso peptide-specific genes via Gibson Assembly. Sequencing of the final construct confirmed the successful cloning of the cluster (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and proved the feasibility of directly amplifying small BGCs from metagenomic DNA for subsequent cloning into expression vectors.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Identification of putative lasso peptide genes of BGC 44.1 using Blastx results, gene sizes, and antiSMASH annotations.

We demonstrated this by recovering an approximately 58&#x000a0;kb NRPS BGC from the fosmid library. The complete NRPS BGC 76.1 was detected on a 139&#x000a0;kb contig derived from the direct soil metagenome sequencing (Online Resource 3), while only parts of the cluster were detected on different fosmid library contigs. Specific primers were designed to screen the fosmid library for those clones that harbored overlapping BGC parts and together covered the complete BGC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Three clones and the respective fosmids were isolated, and the different parts of the BGC were assembled to a complete cluster using TAR cloning (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The final plasmid was cut into two fragments of approximately 57&#x000a0;kb and 16&#x000a0;kb by restriction digestion and sequenced via Nanopore. The Nanopore reads were filtered for the respective fragment sizes and aligned with the reference sequence derived from the metagenome sequencing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) (Online Resource 4), which proved the correct assembly of the complete NRPS BGC. Following this approach, TAR cloned metagenomic BGCs can directly be transferred to compatible heterologous hosts such as <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species as different TAR vectors contain the respective necessary genetic elements for this purpose.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Workflow for the assembly of a large NRPS BGC from cluster parts on different fosmids via TAR cloning. <bold>a</bold> Screening of the fosmid library for clones carrying fosmids with overlapping BGC parts and subsequent isolation of the respective clones.

The isolation of high-quality HMW DNA is not only a crucial step for library generation, but it is also the basis for downstream applications associated with the identification and recovery of complete BGCs such as NGS sequencing, PCR, and DNA cloning. This first step poses a major challenge especially for soils as they harbor various impurities such as humic acids, which are often copurified with DNA (Amorim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Sar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>) and can interfere with the aforementioned downstream applications (Nair et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>; Verma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>). The HMW metagenomic DNA we isolated proved to be suitable for yielding high-quality short- and long-read sequencing data, amplifying complete BGCs via PCR and generating a high-quality metagenomic fosmid library.</p><p id="Par36">Metagenomic libraries are often the starting point for the recovery and heterologous expression of BGCs (Katz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). Screening of a metagenomic library for the presence of clones that carry potentially interesting BGCs is often a time-consuming multi-step process. Here we show that combining short- and long-read sequencing of our metagenomic fosmid library and applying our SNRCM method enable the rapid identification of clones carrying complete BGCs. The alignment of complete BGCs derived from assembled contigs with single Nanopore reads directly reveals the presence of clones that carry complete BGCs, thus overcoming the drawback of classical screening via PCR, which can lead to the recovery of false positive clones, i.e., with a truncated rather than complete BGC. Only BGCs that do not exceed the insert size of 40&#x000a0;kb can be recovered from a single fosmid using our SNRCM approach; however, small BGCs such as RiPPs can nonetheless encode for therapeutically relevant compounds including antibiotics (Waisvisz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1957</xref>; Schmidt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>; Scholz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2011</xref>). As shown in our study, the isolation of HMW metagenomic DNA combined with short- and long-read sequencing also enables the direct recovery of complete BGCs from metagenomes via PCR and cloning into expression vectors, although direct amplification is also limited to small BGCs. For lasso peptide encoding BGCs, either of the two approaches would allow the identification and selection of those that encode an ABC transporter (D gene), as it has been observed that lasso peptides with antimicrobial activity often contain ABC transporter genes within their BGCs that confer self-resistance (Hegemann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). With respect to the heterologous expression attempts of our amplified and cloned lasso peptide BGC 44.1, we could observe transcripts for all genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> (data not shown) but failed to detect the respective lasso peptide via standard high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC&#x02013;MS). In future studies, further efforts will be required to optimize compound detection and analytical methods. It is worth noting that we only covered a fraction of the metagenome because of the limiting sequencing depth and also a comparatively low library size. Nevertheless, we could prioritize among a large assortment of BGCs, and upscaling of the library size and sequencing depth is expected to lead to a greater number of complete and potentially interesting BGCs.</p><p id="Par37">With respect to the recovery of BGCs spanning over multiple fosmids, our hybrid sequencing approach also proved more rapid and efficient than previous strategies. The latter made use of degenerate primers for conserved regions of biosynthetic domains to screen the library for clones of interest. Subsequently, the recovery of clones with overlapping parts was performed in order to assemble complete BGCs (Hover et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>; Stevenson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>). These procedures require the laborious generation of a saturating genetic library with millions of clones to ensure that a chosen BGC of interest is completely covered within the library. In contrast, our approach requires comparatively smaller library sizes as the generated sequencing information immediately pinpoints BGCs that are completely covered within the library. As we have shown, sequencing data of the corresponding metagenome can serve as a reference sequence for the BGCs to be recovered. Additionally, these sequencing data can also be useful for amplifying parts of the BGC that are not covered in the corresponding library to assemble a complete cluster. Also here, upscaling of the clone number and sequencing depth can yield a greater variety of BGCs to be prioritized for recovery and subsequent heterologous expression.</p><p id="Par38">The strategy described here not only enables the fast and efficient identification and recovery of a greater number of complete BGCs from a given soil metagenome and its respective genetic library, but it also expands the options for heterologous expression. In case of completely captured BGCs on fosmids such as RiPPs, the respective clones can directly be used for heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Fosmids can also be transferred into <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that are more suitable for heterologous expression of natural products such as phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPtase) carrying <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (Gruenewald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>; Jaitzig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). Additionally, the fosmid vector backbone can be genetically modified to enable transfer and maintenance of the plasmid in other heterologous hosts. As shown in this study, the amplification of BGCs from metagenomes allows the attachment of different restriction sites for subsequent cloning into suitable expression vectors for different hosts. Finally, different TAR vectors can be chosen for the assembly of large BGCs of interest in order to express them in different hosts such as actinobacterial, proteobacterial, or <italic>B. subtilis</italic> host organisms (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). With an increasing number of recovered metagenomic BGCs, future efforts can be directed to identify more suitable hosts for heterologous expression such as species of the <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> phylum, which is one of the most abundant phyla in soil (Giguere et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). Alternatively, metagenomic BGCs can be codon optimized for already well-established heterologous hosts. These techniques can subsequently be used to improve actual expression rates, which still remain one of the major bottlenecks in compound production from metagenomes.</p><p id="Par39">In summary, our study contributes to accelerate the discovery of new natural products by providing an approach that speeds up and facilitates the recovery of BGCs from soil metagenomes and their prompt expression in heterologous systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="253_2022_11917_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (XLSX 21 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Christina Engesser for the excellent technical support and Libera Lo Presti for scientific discussion.
