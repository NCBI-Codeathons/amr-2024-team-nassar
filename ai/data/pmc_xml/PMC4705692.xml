In the biosynthetic study of azinomycin B, a gene (<italic>orf1</italic>) adjacent to the azinomycin B gene cluster was found to be essential for the survival of the producer, <italic>Streptomyces sahachiroi</italic> ATCC33158. Sequence analyses revealed that Orf1 belongs to the HTH_42 superfamily of conserved bacterial proteins which are widely distributed in pathogenic and antibiotic-producing bacteria with unknown functions. The protein exhibits a protective effect against azinomycin B when heterologously expressed in azinomycin-sensitive strains. EMSA assays showed its sequence nonspecific binding to DNA and structure-specific binding to azinomycin B-adducted sites, and ChIP assays revealed extensive association of Orf1 with chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, Orf1 not only protects target sites by protein&#x02013;DNA interaction but is also capable of repairing azinomycin B-mediated DNA cross-linking. It possesses the DNA glycosylase-like activity and specifically repairs DNA damage induced by azinomycin B through removal of both adducted nitrogenous bases in the cross-link. This bifunctional protein massively binds to genomic DNA to reduce drug attack risk as a novel DNA binding protein and triggers the base excision repair system as a novel DNA glycosylase.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>08 January 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Azinomycin B is a promising antitumor natural product isolated from the soil-dwelling bacteria <italic>Streptomyces sahachiroi</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces griseofuscus</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This new structural class of dual alkylating agents is highly effective against tumor cells by interacting covalently with duplex DNA in the major groove and inducing interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) at 5&#x02032;-GNC or 5&#x02032;-GNT sequences (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Due to the damage effects of alkylation and cross-linking (Supplementary Figure S1), DNA replication is interrupted and ultimately cell death occurs. The unprecedented azabicyclic ring system and highly active epoxide moiety in azinomycin B are two primary electrophilic functional groups responsible for the ICL process (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Covalent ICLs arise from nucleophilic opening of the aziridine at C-10 and the epoxide at C-21 by the N-7 position of purine residues located on the two DNA strands (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, the naphthoate moiety, along with other functional groups within the skeleton of the compound, may also serve to influence the efficiency of ICL formation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Azinomycin B shows a strong propensity to alkylate guanine nucleosides in the major groove of DNA. On the basis of an average G+C content of 70%, there may be a large number of potentially susceptible target sites within the genome of a streptomycete strain. Obviously, efficient cellular self-protection is crucial for azinomycin B producers to protect themselves from the lethal effects of the compound.</p><p>Mechanisms of cellular self-protection mainly include target sites modification, drug inactivation, drug binding and export pumps (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Considering that a single DNA damage is sufficient to cause cell death, multiple modes of resistance determinants are often adopted to ensure efficient self-protection toward a DNA-targeting antibiotic in its producers. For example, two resistance genes, <italic>blmA</italic> and <italic>blmB</italic>, were found to protect the bleomycin-producing strain <italic>Streptomyces verticillus</italic> from DNA damage induced by this cytotoxic agent through drug binding and drug inactivation via acetylation, respectively (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The important antitumor antibiotic mitomycin C is produced by <italic>Streptomyces lavendulae</italic> as an inert prodrug that requires enzymatic or chemical reduction to generate a highly effective alkylating agent. Mitomycin self-resistance occurs via three cellular mechanisms: a flavoenzyme (McrA) that oxidizes the active reduced form of mitomycin C (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), a drug binding protein (Mrd) that prevents reductive activation of the prodrug and a membrane-associated protein (Mct) involved in drug efflux (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>It is common that antibiotic biosynthetic genes are clustered with resistance and regulator genes. The azinomycin B biosynthetic gene cluster in <italic>S. sahachiroi</italic> was reported in 2008. Its biosynthetic pathway, however, is still not completely understood. To date, only the enzymatic cascade leading to the formation of the naphthoate moiety has been unequivocally deciphered (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Since many of the proposed enzymes and reactions are novel, cloning and characterization of correlative genes will contribute to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of its biosynthesis, self-resistance and regulation. Recently, one locus (<italic>aziR</italic>) far away from the azinomycin B gene cluster was identified to mediate azinomycin resistance in <italic>S. sahachiroi</italic>. The <italic>aziR</italic> gene encodes an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase which normally inactivates antibiotics via phosphorylation, but here it behaves as an azinomycin B binding protein conferring azinomycin resistance (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Here we report the identification of another azinomycin resistance locus (<italic>orf1</italic>) (GenBank accession number ABY83174) adjacent to the azinomycin B gene cluster. Expression of this gene in azinomycin-sensitive strains and deletion of it in a non-azinomycin-producing strain supported that it is, indeed, essential for survival of the azinomycin-producing strain, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sahachiroi</italic> ATCC33158.

Owing to lack of candidates for self-resistance and regulation within the published azinomycin B biosynthetic gene cluster, the <italic>orf1</italic> gene adjacent to its right boundary was investigated in our study. All attempts to disrupt <italic>orf1</italic> in the azinomycin B producer <italic>S. sahachiroi</italic> ATCC33158 failed, whereas deletion of native <italic>orf1</italic> was achieved by double-crossover homologous recombination after a second copy of the gene had been introduced into the chromosome at a different location (Supplementary Figure S2).

This family has recently been reclassified as the HTH_42 superfamily (PF06224) by the Pfam protein families database. The helix-turn-helix (HTH) is a major structural motif capable of binding DNA and usually found in many regulator proteins (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The HTH_42 represents a novel DNA-binding domain possibly containing two copies of winged helix-turn-helix motifs. So far, neither precise structure nor definite function for a protein in this family has been published.</p><p>In Pfam database, the HTH_42 superfamily consisted of about 1653 unique proteins (derived from 1193 species) with six different domain architectures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Most of proteins (1582 sequences) contain just one HTH_42 domain, while only 3 proteins have two truncated HTH_42. The remaining 68 sequences including other types of protein domains were proposed to be related to ATP-dependent helicases. The domain architecture of Orf1 belongs to the first group, of which 48 sequences were annotated as putative uncharacterized YcaQ protein. In <italic>E. coli</italic> strain K12, the YcaQ was identified as one of UVC-toxicity modulating proteins with an unknown role (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). It is worth noting that 31 of these putative YcaQ proteins are from common pathogens in Enterobacteriaceae and 3 come from antibiotic producers. These data coincide with the distribution that HTH_42 proteins are primarily found in species of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (causes typhoid fever), <italic>Escherichia</italic> (Gut flora, some strains cause intestinal infection) and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (produce antibiotics) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Statistically, pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic-producing bacteria hold a high percentage in sequences occupancy (37% and 21%, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Extremophiles and tolerant bacteria as well as nitrogen-fixing bacteria also share a proportion of HTH_42 proteins. It seems that members of HTH_42 superfamily play a certain role in some bacteria that could escape the unfavorable conditions.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Bioinformatics analyses of Orf1.

Therefore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments were performed to investigate the interaction between Orf1 and potential promoter regions in the azinomycin B gene cluster. Intriguingly, Orf1 was found to retard all DNA fragment migration, including non-promoter regions and sequences from another streptomycete strain used as negative controls (Supplementary Figure S3B), suggesting that Orf1 exhibits little sequence specificity in DNA binding. A representative gel shift pattern for the binding of Orf1 to a 220-bp linearized DNA is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>. As protein concentration increased, Orf1 produced progressively slower DNA migration, different from the gel retardation pattern of specific interactions.

Likewise, Orf1 bound to four ODNs with no obvious difference in affinity (Supplementary Figure S3C). However, a single sharp retardation band of a site-specific protein&#x02013;DNA complex appeared when the adducted ODN with a single azinomycin B cross-linking site of GCC was incubated with lower concentration of Orf1 (lanes 1&#x02013;3 in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As protein concentration increased, the amount of the specific protein&#x02013;DNA complex initially increased (lanes 1 and 2) and then decreased (lanes 3&#x02013;5) due to the sequence non-specific binding of extra Orf1 to other sites. This phenomenon suggested that the binding mode of Orf1 is biphasic, with higher affinity to azinomycin B-modified sites and lower affinity to native DNA duplex.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>ChIP assays revealed extensive association of Orf1 with chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To test the binding of Orf1 to nucleic acids in physiological environment, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were carried out. In the ChIP assay, DNA recovered from immune or preimmune precipitates was amplified using primers specific for the genomic regions indicated in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. For validating non-specific interactions between Orf1 and DNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, the amplified regions were randomly selected throughout the genome. The Orf1 produced by both the native host and one sensitive host <italic>S. lividans</italic> whose genome sequence is available, was tested for <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding activity using the purified antibody against Orf1. In addition to the preimmune serum being used as a control, immunoprecipitation obtained from <italic>S. lividans</italic>::pWS052 cells was used as an additional negative control for ChIP assays in <italic>S. lividans</italic>::<italic>orf1</italic> cells. DNA corresponding to the eight randomly chosen regions in the genome of the native host or the sensitive host was co-immunoprecipitated with Orf1, while significantly reduced levels of DNA were immunoprecipitated in the negative controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The results of ChIP assays revealed an extensive association between Orf1 and chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The binding of a large amount of Orf1 within the bacterial chromatin might mask target sites through protein&#x02013;DNA interactions to prevent azinomycin B-induced damage. If Orf1 serves to protect chromatin against azinomycin B, it should be in abundance. Therefore, we measured cellular Orf1 levels at different stages in the life cycle of ATCC33158 by quantitative immunoblotting (Supplementary Figure S6A). In western blot analysis, expression of Orf1 was undetectable or only found in trace amounts in the early growth phase, but rose sharply after 24 h and reached a peak at 36 h. Subsequently, levels dipped slightly from 48 h to 60 h and came back up at 72 h (Supplementary Figure S6B). It is reasonable that the initial and then increasing production of Orf1 apparently preceded azinomycin B production to serve as a protector during drug production (Supplementary Figure S6C). The Orf1 protein has also been detected in mutant strains that do not accumulate azinomycin B (data not shown), which implies the <italic>orf1</italic> gene expression is not directly induced by azinomycin B. The Orf1 (40.8 kDa) constituted &#x02248;0.18% of the total protein levels (Supplementary Table S6). If we translated this into molecules per cell, however, there were about 10<sup>6</sup> molecules of Orf1/cell, approximately on par with the number of target sites. These findings support the plausibility of Orf1 conferring azinomycin B resistance by preventing antibiotic occupancy of the accessible target sites on chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> DNA protection assays demonstrated Orf1 prevents DNA from azinomycin-mediated cross-linking via direct target site protection</title><p>For further confirmation, we established a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA protection assays based on the cross-linking effect of the drug. The DNA interstrand cross-linking activities of azinomycin B were initially determined using the linearized plasmid pBluescript SK(+) in an agarose gel assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The linearized plasmid DNA was incubated with the drug or a control solvent prior to alkali denaturation and gel electrophoresis. ICLs induced by azinomycin B covalently link the two strands of the DNA double helix together, and hinder separation of the two strands by denaturation. Thus, native DNA exhibits a different mobility in agarose gels than cross-linked DNA after alkali treatment. DNA cross-linking assays were successfully performed under typical conditions as described previously (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). With increasing concentrations of azinomycin B, the amount of cross-linked double stranded DNA able to withstand alkali denaturation gradually increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In the DNA protection assay, the Orf1 protein was first bound to DNA, and then the protein&#x02013;DNA complex was incubated with azinomycin B. Sufficient amount of protein was used in the test to observe protective effect. Protein&#x02013;DNA complexes resisted cross-linking so that DNA was completely denatured into single strands by subsequent alkali treatment (lanes 5&#x02013;8 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Conversely, the amount of cross-linked double stranded DNA in the control group (without Orf1) gradually raised as azinomycin B concentrations increased (lanes 1&#x02013;4 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results indicated that Orf1 protects DNA against azinomycin B mediated cross-linking.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Characterization of the DNA glycosylase activity of Orf1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

The Orf1 was first incubated with a moderate amount of azinomycin B and then DNA was added. As shown in Supplementary Figure S7A, DNA was not protected from cross-linking regardless if previously sufficient amounts of Orf1 were present in the reaction, which suggested that pre-incubation with Orf1 could not affect the cross-linking activity of azinomycin B. An ultrafiltration process was also applied to detect the interaction between Orf1 and azinomycin B (Supplementary Figure S5). All filtrate separated from the Orf1/azinomycin B pre-incubation reaction using a 10 k ultrafiltration device displayed prominent and equivalent cross-linking regardless of the Orf1 protein concentration used (Supplementary Figure S5A). In contrast, cross-linked DNA decreased as the amount of drug was reduced (Supplementary Figure S5B). Taken together, it is evident that Orf1 neither inactivates nor binds azinomycin B <italic>in vitro</italic>, hence protective effect in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> was achieved because of its DNA binding ability.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Orf1 initiates the repair of azinomycin B induced DNA damage by BER</title><p>Orf1 binds to not only native DNA but also cross-linked DNA in the experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4A). The specific binding activity of Orf1 with cross-linked DNA has prompted us to detect its capacity to repair DNA damage through setting up a DNA repair assay system. Linearized plasmid pBluescript SK(+) DNA was first cross-linked by the drug at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h, and then incubated with excess Orf1 at 30&#x000b0;C for 10 min before alkali denaturation and agarose gel analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, cross-linking was reversed by Orf1, such that DNA was denatured into single strands (lane 7), whereas the negative control without Orf1 (lane 6) maintained the double-stranded structure under alkali denaturation. The reverse cross-linking of DNA implied that Orf1 made an incision in at least one DNA strand near the ICL sites. Three possible mechanisms of ICL DNA repaired by Orf1 were schematically presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>. Besides direct removal of alkyl adducts, alkylation lesions are usually repaired by excision of damaged DNA regions through base excision repair (BER) or nucleotide excision repair (NER). As relatively low-molecular weight DNA was not observed during alkaline sedimentation, incision was more likely to occur between azinomycin B and the adducted nucleoside, instead of at phosphodiester backbone.</p><p>To find out the pattern of incision, we initially used the supercoiled plasmid pOJ260 (scDNA) containing tiny amounts of open circular DNA (ocDNA) as a substrate in ICL DNA cleavage assays. Intercalative binding of azinomycin B to duplex DNA unwinds the double helix and relaxes the tight conformation, resulting in a slower DNA migration through a gel (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, the rate of DNA migration was inversely proportional to the level of cross-linking. The supercoiled DNA as well as the ocDNA was progressively relaxed by increased azinomycin B and migrated in agarose gel at continuously decreasing rates. When Orf1 was supplemented, most of cross-linked DNA was repaired and exhibited the same mobility as ocDNA except a little bit left in lane 5 due to insufficiency of the repair enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). The residual highly cross-linked DNA was also effectively converted into the similar conformation of ocDNA after incubation with a raised concentration of Orf1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>, lane 3), indicating that Orf1 specifically repaired the azinomycin B modified DNA. The reverse of cross-linking was protein concentration-dependent, which produced progressively faster migrating products as the Orf1 concentrations increased (Supplementary Figure S7B). It is apparent that Orf1 removed azinomycin B from the cross-linked DNA by cleavage and thus led to the rewinding of DNA. The same rewinding effects were clearly observed in the cleavage assays of the highly cross-linked linear DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref> and Supplementary Figure S7D). Notably, the original conformation of DNA was not completely restored by Orf1 (Supplementary Figure S7B and S7D). Although cross-linking was reversed, transformation activity of cross-linked pOJ260 DNA was not restored at all after treatment with Orf1 (data not shown). Moreover, the prolonged treatment of ICL DNA with higher concentration of Orf1 caused breaks in DNA strands (Supplementary Figure S7C, lane 5). The uncompacted conformation and easy degradation of repaired DNA suggested the cleavage sites of Orf1 were located within the DNA strands, which excluded the direct reversal and supported the BER mechanism proposed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>.</p><p>The first step of BER is catalyzed by DNA glycosylases that remove the damaged nitrogenous base to create an apurinic or apyrimidnic site (AP site). AP endonucleases specifically recognize the abasic DNA and cleave the phosphosdiester bond exclusively at the AP sites (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, we used Endonuclease IV (Endo IV), a kind of AP endonucleases to detect if depurination occurred during the DNA repair process. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">H</xref>, Endo IV cleavage occurred massively at phosphodiester backbone of the Orf1-treated supercoiled and linear ICL DNA (lane 6), thus leading to complete DNA degradation into a smear of smaller fragments, while there was only a slight degradation in the reactions with the Orf1-untreated ICL DNA due to spontaneous depurination of N7-alkylated products (lane 5). Depurination phenomena were not detected in the control reactions with native circular and linear DNA (lane 4), although Orf1 could bind to it. This result indicated that numerous AP sites were produced by Orf1 in DNA strands of the azinomycin-DNA adducts.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>Orf1 removes two adducted bases in the cross-link as a novel DNA glycosylase</title><p>To determine whether Orf1 hydrolyzes the glycosidic bonds of both purines that are cross-linked, 21-mer DNA duplex with one GCC site (Supplementary Table S3) was treated with azinomycin B and subjected to the cleavage reaction of Orf1 and Endo IV. As previously reported in literature (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), this triplet readily reacted with azinomycin B, giving rise to two kinds of lower-mobility products in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. One was monoalkylated intermediate which ran close to the substrate DNA, the other was cross-linked DNA at much lower mobility (lane 1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). With the addition of Orf1, two kinds of modified DNA disappeared, and instead the intensity of native DNA band greatly enhanced (lane 2), which indicated that the monoalkylation and the cross-link had been successfully reversed by Orf1. The succedent treatment with Endo IV liberated smaller fragments with sizes that corresponded to two predicted split AP products (both are 9-/11-nt DNA duplexes designated as M1 and M2), and led to a drop-off in the intensity of 21-mer DNA band (lane 6). In contrast, Endo IV did not incise the modified DNA without Orf1 pretreatment (lane 5). A limited amount of smaller fragments also appeared in the absence of Endo IV (lane 2), which implied that an alkali-induced strand scission at the abasic sites happened during denaturing PAGE (also seen in Supplementary Figure S8A). To avoid the unexpected DNA strand breaks induced by alkali and observe the formation of double-stranded break (DSB) in the cross-link repair, the same DNA samples were analyzed using native PAGE again. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> showed that apparent short DNA band of expected size appeared only after sequential treatment with Orf1 and Endo IV (lane 6). For further confirmation, another 21-mer DNA duplex with different arm lengths around G-G cross-link was used in the cleavage assay. As expected, two distinct DNA duplexes (a 10-/12-nt and an 8-/10-nt) were generated (lane 6 in Supplementary Figure S8B). The results of denaturing and native PAGE analyses clearly demonstrated that Orf1 incised two adducted G bases in both strands of the cross-linked ODN. Orf1 is supposed to be a new kind of DNA glycosylases without any similarity to known DNA repair proteins, which proved to specifically recognize azinomycin B-mediated DNA crosslinks and remove the adducted bases to repair DNA damage by inducing a BER-like pathway.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Removal of monoalkylated and cross-linked bases by Orf1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

In contrast to the other resistance protein AziR which acts by binding to the drug, the Orf1 may act as a new DNA glycosylase to confer azinomycin resistance. To better elucidate the mode of action of Orf1, probable interactions among drug (azinomycin B), target (DNA) and resistance protein (Orf1) were intensively analyzed and are illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>. Orf1 may confer the azinomycin resistance through drug binding (a), site protection (b) and/or DNA repair (c). Based on its DNA binding ability, the site protection strategy via protein&#x02013;DNA interaction was first put forward. It may sound inconceivable for Orf1 to protect millions of potential target sites in a <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genome. The number of target sites susceptible to azinomycin B attack is, in fact, much lower than expected, due to the high density of chromosome structure and binding of nucleoid-associated proteins (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>aziE</italic> which is located within the azinomycin B gene cluster and encodes a putative export protein, was found to be employed in the drug efflux system (Wang Shan &#x00026; Jing He, unpublished). Drug sequestration associated with efficient efflux systems which plays an important role in bacterial self-protection, maintains a low concentration of intracellular drug (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The relatively fewer target sites, plus low drug concentrations in bacterial cells, are propitious conditions for Orf1 to implement efficacious site protection. This supposition was further supported by <italic>in vivo</italic> ChIP and <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA protection assays. Neither drug binding nor drug inactivation was identified by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, which both ruled out direct Orf1/drug interactions. Our studies <italic>in vitro</italic> subsequently discovered the DNA repair capability of Orf1, which is the most intriguing result of our observation.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Proposed action modes of Orf1.

(<bold>C</bold>) The BER-like repair mechanism initiated by Orf1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkv949fig6"/></fig><p>To our knowledge, three mechanisms exist to repair DNA alkylating/cross-linking damages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Among them, NER is the most common mechanism that could remove ICL lesions induced by a variety of antitumor antibiotics such as anthramycin and mitomycin C (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) by using the UvrABC endonuclease enzyme complex in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The excision of the adducted nucleotide is performed with the UvrA recognizing the helix-distorting lesion, the UvrB unwinding the damaged region, and the UvrC cleaving the phosphodiester bonds near the lesion (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). An additional matter of interest is that UvrA and UvrB proteins are capable of repairing the helix-stabilizing anthramycin-N2 guanine DNA adducts in an alternative way: UvrA coupled with UvrB strongly binds DNA and releases DNA-bound anthramycin without incision of DNA (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A few homologs of UvrA proteins are found to confer self-resistance toward DNA-targeting drugs in antibiotics-producing bacteria. For example, UvrA-like proteins derived from chromomycin A3 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported to participate in self-resistance of the corresponding drugs. The daunorubicin resistance protein (DrrC) in <italic>Streptomyces peucetius</italic> was speculated to bind within DNA regions intercalated by daunorubicin and release pre-bound drug to prevent DNA damage, due to its sequence homology and similar DNA binding properties with UvrA. The <italic>drrC</italic>, as well as <italic>orf1</italic>, is vital to self-resistance and antibiotic production. Moreover, as previously reported, inactivation of <italic>drrC</italic> was only accomplished in non-antibiotic-producing conditions. The DNA binding activity of DrrC is mediated by ATP and enhanced by daunorubicin (DNR) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), while interaction of Orf1 and DNA is independent of ATP and unaffected by azinomycin B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4A).</p><p>Pyrimidine dimers and many of alkylation lesions are commonly repaired by direct reversal as the second repair mechanism in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, but which is rarely seen in the removal of DNA ICL and drug self-resistance (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The last but particularly important mechanism is BER, which repairs small, non-helix distorting base lesions like oxidation, alkylation and deamination (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Recently, YtKR2, a DNA glycosylase homologous protein, was first reported to confer self-resistance toward a DNA-targeting antibiotic by triggering the BER system (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), which removes N3-YTM-alkylated adenine from monoadduct induced by yatakemycin (YTM). Shortly afterward, our study also found out the Orf1 protein, involved in self-resistance to azinomycin B, possesses DNA glycosylase-like activity. BER is normally initiated by DNA glycosylases and further processed by AP endonucleases. Monofunctional glycosylases only remove damaged base by cleaving the N-glycoside bond to liberate an AP site, whereas bifunctional glycosylases possess an extra AP lyase activity that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond 3&#x02032; to the AP site. Orf1 is supposed to be a novel type of monofunctional glycosylases because it only catalyzed base excision in ICL DNA cleavage assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. Orf1 specifically recognizes interstrand azinomycin B-DNA crosslinks and removes modified bases located on the two DNA strands, forming apurinic (AP) sites. The ubiquitous AP endonucleases in cells cleave the phosphodiester bond near the AP site to generate a 3&#x02032; hydroxyl group adjacent to 5&#x02032; deoxyribosephosphate (dRP). DNA polymerase then removes the damaged region using its 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonuclease activity and resynthesizes the missing part using the complementary strand as a template. Considering that BER is usually implicated in the elimination of mono-functional alkylation, we speculate that removal of monoadducts prior to crosslink formation seems to be more rational within the cell.</p><p>The Orf1 protein minimizes the amount of azinomycin B bound to genomic DNA and repairs incidental alkylation to ensure efficient protection. As a protein has the typical domain architecture of HTH_42, Orf1 is the first member of this superfamily to have a defined biological function in bacterial self-resistance identified. Contrary to most regulatory proteins with HTH motifs, we have shown Orf1 binds to DNA irrespective of any particular sequence. This kind of DNA binding pattern is commonly observed in nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) including histone-like DNA-binding proteins (HLPs) and high-mobility group proteins (HMGs) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> HU protein, a well-documented NAP, binds linear DNA fragments with low affinity and this binding was only detectable <italic>in vitro</italic> under low salt conditions (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). High concentration of NaCl (up to 150 mM), however, had no effect on the formation and mobility of the Orf1-DNA complex (Supplementary Figure S4B). Moreover, HU protein was found to bind specifically to DNA recombination and repair intermediates with high affinity although it binds to DNA duplex without sequence specificity. This structure-specific manner also occurred in the binding of Orf1 to the azinomycin B modified DNA. NAPs are usually considered to be involved in all DNA-dependent functions, including replication, repair, recombination and gene regulation (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). A novel bifunctional NAP identified in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> has recently been shown to modulate DNA conformation and transcription during development and stress (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). There were no obvious difference in phenotypic characteristics of colony morphology, spore formation and growth rate between the non-azinomycin-producing strain &#x00394;<italic>aziU3</italic> and the <italic>orf1</italic> gene deletion mutant strain &#x00394;<italic>aziU3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>orf1</italic> observed. Thus Orf1 may not be involved in primary metabolism, but specific to the secondary metabolic pathway of azinomycin B.</p><p>Taken altogether, our present study revealed a novel DNA glycosylase, which could confer resistance in azinomycin B biosynthesis via distinct DNA binding ability and DNA repair capability. Intensive biochemical and structural biology studies of Orf1 will not only elucidate its enzymatic characteristics but also provide insight into the unique structure-function relationship of these newly found HTH_42 superfamily proteins.</p></sec>
