They are widely believed to be responsible for interactions between the producing organism and its environment, with the producer avoiding their toxicities. In our experiments, however, none of the randomly selected 44 species representing different groups of plants and insects can avoid autotoxicity by its endogenous metabolites once made available. We coined the term endocides (endogenous biocides) to describe such metabolites that can poison or inhibit the parent via induced biosynthesis or external applications. Dosage-dependent endocides can selectively induce morphological mutations in the parent organism (e.g., shrubbiness/dwarfism, pleiocotyly, abnormal leaf morphogenesis, disturbed phyllotaxis, fasciated stems, and variegation in plants), inhibit its growth, development, and reproduction and cause death than non-closely related species. The propagule, as well as the organism itself contains or produces adequate endocides to kill itself.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Secondary metabolites (SMs) usually refer to the organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction of an organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Some authors have suggested that SMs may have no explicit role in the internal economy of the producing organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, but it is usually believed that they are responsible for interactions between the producing organism and its environment, particularly in defense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. To refer to biochemical interactions between plants, in 1937, H. Molisch coined the term allelopathy, which was later defined as any direct or indirect, stimulatory and inhibitory effect by one plant (including microorganisms) on another through production of chemical compounds that escape into the environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Allelopathy is usually interspecific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Intraspecific allelopathy, commonly known as autotoxicity occurs when a plant releases toxic chemical substances into the environment that inhibit germination and growth of the same plant species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Since the 1970s, such an exogenous autotoxicity has drawn great interests of scientists from various fields. Recent evidences have indicated that many autotoxicity cases are primarily caused by the indirect effects of autotoxins via influencing microbes or parasitic organisms in the environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Some identified autotoxins or allelochemicals are not necessarily responsible for allelopathy because they may not reach sufficient concentrations and duration in soils to display direct inhibitory effects on their neighbors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Endogenous autotoxicity in producers induced by their own SMs has never been seriously addressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In fact, it has been widely believed that a species can avoid self-toxicity by its own toxic metabolites and thus many studies have focused on organisms&#x02019; avoidance and detoxification mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>To reveal the internal role of some SMs in their producers, we investigated 44 species representing different groups of plants and insects found in the Southeastern United States. It was found that no organism can avoid either endogenous or exogenous autotoxicity by its own metabolites once made available via induced biosynthesis or external applications. The fact of unavoidance and commonness of endogenous autotoxicity in the producing organism induced by its endocides does not support the common knowledge that a species can avoid self-toxicity by its own toxic metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We further found that these agents were usually more toxic to the producing species and its closely-related species than to others. This phenomenon cannot be explained by allelopathy, defense or any other existing theory. Thus, we coined the new term <italic>endocides</italic> (endogenous biocide) to describe such selective toxic SMs that cause both endogenous and exogenous autotoxicity.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Morphological Mutations Induced by Prolonged Soaking of Fruits (Seeds) in Water</title><p>The prolonged soaking of fruits (seeds) in water induced abnormal morphogenesis in each of the 12 woody and herbaceous species investigated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Without any treatment, none of the total 422 seedlings of <italic>Camptotheca lowreyana</italic> developed any abnormal leaves (vs those grown in the native range of China). Following a 9-week prolonged soaking in water, 23 of the total 69 seedlings had morphological mutations in at least one true leaf or stem. The mutations include leaf size, lobed or bifid leaves, compound leaves (e.g., two leaflets per petiole), disturbed phyllotaxis, fasciated stems, or leaf variegation (with white and green bi-color or mosaic pattern). The propagation of two mutated seedlings by shoot cutting led the development of cultivar &#x02018;Katie&#x02019; and &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019;, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Unlike the parent tree that grows up to 20&#x02009;m in height, &#x02018;Katie&#x02019; is a shrub with a maximum height of 3&#x02009;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). It has a vigorous and dense multi-branching growth habit and small lanceolate or elliptic leaves with entire margins in both juvenile and mature stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019; has shorter fruits and smaller cordate leaves with large-tooth leaf margins particularly in juvenile growth stage in comparison with its patent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Seedlings germinated from the fruits of &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019; trees are morphologically consistent with their parents. This is desirable because both cultivars have a higher yield of anti-cancer camptothecin (CPT) in young leaves (0.4778% in &#x02018;Katie&#x02019; and 0.5537% in &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019; vs. 0.3913% in <italic>C. lowreyana</italic>, on dry weight basis), and are more hardy and drought-tolerant than natural taxa of <italic>Camptotheca</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p><italic>Camptotheca</italic> seedlings germinated from the fruits without soaking treatment did not develop any abnormal leaves. After three months of saturated soaking of fruits by rain water, however, about 92.3% of the &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019; seedlings and about 7.9% of <italic>C. acuminata</italic> seedlings germinated under the parent trees had abnormal morphogenesis in at least one true leaf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>). For both species, 24&#x02009;h fruit soaking in water in the laboratory experiment resulted in significantly higher germination rates than either control (no soaking) or prolonged (4 weeks) soaking group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Following a 4-week fruit soaking in water, however, 15.6% <italic>C. acuminata</italic> seedlings developed 2&#x02013;3 branches and 38.5% &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019; seedlings developed 2&#x02013;5 branches from the main stem in comparison with no branch development during the first 2&#x02013;3 months of normal seedling growth.</p><p>Similar to <italic>Camptotheca, Quercus</italic> might develop abnormal morphogenesis after prolonged soaking of acorns. After a month long soaking of bulk acorns in just enough water to cover all acorns, 7.32% of <italic>Q. shumardii</italic>, 8.64% of <italic>Q. texana</italic>, and 19.27% of <italic>Q. michauxii</italic> seedlings developed 2&#x02013;3 stems directly from the same radicle (shrubbiness) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).

The application of 5% extracts of the acorns induced about 18% of the seedlings to develop 3&#x02013;5 stems in comparison with the development of one main stem in the control group (no soaking treatment) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Further, early leaf development of almost all seedlings in the 0.5% or 5% extracts treatment group displayed abnormal morphogenesis (e.g., lobed or bifid leaves, or variegated leaves) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). The HPLC profiles of leaf samples from two normal <italic>Q. shumardii</italic> seedlings are similar each other but different from either normal or bi-lobed leaves from the abnormal seedlings induced by 0.5% extracts. The chromatographs of the extracts also showed that <italic>Q. shumardii</italic> acorns had much less chemical diversity than seedlings. Interestingly, the normal and bi-lobed leaves from the abnormal seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S5f</xref>) are similar in HPLC profiles but both had a compound or compounds that were not detected in either acorns or normal seedlings of <italic>Q. shumardii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The unique compound(s) are likely metabolic products of the abnormal oak seedlings.</p><p>External application of endocides also induced pleiocotyly.

Four of the seven seedlings germinated from the seed treatment of 5% <italic>A. hypogaea</italic> shell extracts for a week and one of the 20 seedlings in the water soaking treatment for a week developed abnormal leaf morphogenesis including one or three developed leaflets (vs. normal four leaflets), lobed leaves, flat petioles, petioleless smaller leaflets with non-entire leaf margins (vs. normal larger leaflets with entire margin), or variegated leaves and fused stems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>Mutations were also observed when other propagules were treated with their extracts.

This is in contrast to the leaves of <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> that are minute and are shed early in the normal development process.</p><p>Like woody species, herbaceous <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> showed shrubbiness, pleiocotyly, and various abnormal leaves in seedlings germinated from the seeds soaked in a 5% solution of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> seed extracts for 48&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Of the 610 <italic>B. oleracea</italic> seedlings germinated from the 900 seeds soaked in a 5% solution of seed extracts for 48&#x02009;h, approximately 1.3% developed 2&#x02013;5 stems directly from the same radicle, approximately 1% had pleiocotyly, and approximately 3.5% had various abnormal leaf morphogenesis including leaves with two lobes or leaves with leaflets on surface. Following the 48&#x02009;h water soaking, no seedling developed with multiple-stems or pleiocotyly and less than 0.5% of seedlings developed with an abnormal leaf. This is lower than the results observed in seedlings induced by the extracts.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Morphological Mutations Induced by Decapitation Pruning</title><p>&#x02018;Katie&#x02019; plants underwent extensive pruning including decapitation to produce over 200 cuttings for propagations.

Enhanced biosynthesis or external applications of endocides can induce mutations in the parent organism (e.g., shrubbiness/dwarfism, pleiocotyly, abnormal leaf morphogenesis, disturbed phyllotaxis, fasciated stems, and variegation in plants) and chemical biosynthesis and derivatization of some SMs. The excessive endocides can inhibit the growth, development, and reproduction and even cause death of the producing organism. None of the tested organisms can avoid endogenous autotoxicity by its endocides once available. An organism or propagule contains or produces adequate endocides to kill itself when externally applied. Endocides are usually more toxic to the producer than to non-closely related species. In fact, a non-closely related species may have antidotal action on exogenous autotoxicity of the producing organism induced by endocides.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Induced Morphological Mutations by Availability or Enhanced Biosynthesis of Endocides</title><p>Soaking seeds in water before planting has long been used to stimulate germination.

Prolonged soaking in water (e.g., several weeks) is always avoided<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Soaking, particularly in a large volume of water or flowing water will leash some endocides away from the embryo and thus promote germination, but unconventional prolonged soaking of fruits (seeds) of plants in water will extract more endocides, making them available to embryos. The available endocides at high dosage can inhibit germination and even make propagules not viable. The available endocides at low dosage will allow propagules to reproduce but induce morphological mutations in propagated seedlings or siblings, e.g., shrubbiness, pleiocotyly and/or cotyledon with two lobes. To develop such mutations, it is necessary to soak propagules with minimum amount of water for an extended period of time at a lower temperature so early reproduction can be avoided and adequate but unfatal concentrations of endocides become available to the propagules. An example is that development of cultivars &#x02018;Katie&#x02019; and &#x02018;Hicksii by a prolonged soaking of <italic>C. lowreyana</italic> fruits.</p><p>Short-time soaking of a propagule in EtOH extracts of the producing organism can yield the same inhibitory effects on its germination or growth and induce similar morphological mutations as is found by prolonged soaking in water. This directly supports the notion that endocides are the causes of the observed inhibition and induced mutations. It also indicates endocides are a major factor in seed dormancy, germination, and development. In normal development, <italic>in planta</italic> germination of mature seeds on plants can be avoided by transport and accumulation of endocides. The secondary dormancy developed after seed/fruit harvest or dispersal is because the level of endocides is still too high. This dormancy may continue until the reduction of endocidal level by degrading or taking them away naturally or artificially. In other words, reduction of endocides is one of the necessary conditions for seed germination. Secondary dormancy can be induced by the availability of endocides (e.g., through prolonged water soaking or external applications of endocides).</p><p>Interestingly, the abnormal morphogenesis in seedlings caused by prolonged soaking of propagules in water or external applications of endocides are similar to the reduced apical dominance and mutations caused by enhanced biosynthesis of endocides following decapitation pruning in woody species.

The distinct characters of full mutations are permanent for the muted individuals and may be fixed by vegetative propagation (e.g., development of shrub &#x02018;Katie&#x02019; from the parent tree). The chimeras could also be good sources for development of desirable cultivars (e.g., &#x02018;CT168&#x02019;, a dwarf cultivar selected from &#x02018;Katie&#x02019;).</p><p>The induced mutations as described above could be observed occasionally in the field with extreme environmental condition. The documented autotoxicity of &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019; seedlings in the field was largely because the fruits had been soaked in water on the soil surface for over three months. During the period of January through March 2015, local rainfall reached more than 500&#x02009;mm, about 50% more than the average, while the average temperature was about 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C lower than the average. In nature, abnormal morphogenesis in plants may be caused by enhanced <italic>in planta</italic> biosynthesis of endocides due to stresses or by exposure of propagules to high levels of endocides. Some observed shrubbiness of tree species or even herbaceous plants may be directly induced by endocidal change or availability. This phenomenon could occur in a place with a long period of saturated water before seed germination. However, this process involves many chance factors and thus it is impossible to make a prediction in nature.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Induced Chemical Biosynthesis and Derivatization by Endocides</title><p>In addition to the enhanced yield of existing endocides, prolonged soaking in water, external applications of endocides, or decapitation pruning can increase chemical diversity of SMs in newly-developed tissues or seedlings.

Similar results were found in insect treatments. A larva of <italic>T. molitor</italic> or <italic>Z. morio</italic> can be killed by its own extracts at a dosage less than the chemical contents a worm can produce. Because only a percentage of the actual chemical constituents in an organism can be extracted by a solvent due to limitations in the extraction techniques, the yield of extracts from an organism or its part is always much lower than its actual chemical contents. Further, only a small portion of the extracts in a soaking solution became available to the plant matter to be treated. We also found that longer periods of endocides application or higher dosage of endocides have more effective inhibition and elimination results.

The antidotal action from other species is mainly because these species absorb or adhere some endocides and thus reduce the risk of autotoxicity in the producing species.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Endocide Concept</title><p>Endocide is a biocide derived from an endogenous toxic metabolite that does not cause apparent poison in normal growth of the producing species but will poison or inhibit the parent when induced into production. It can selectively eliminate the parent or other individuals of the same species, as well as its relatives when externally applied. The endocide concept is different from allelopathy. Reported allelopathic and autotoxic examples usually describe chemical interactions between individuals of different species (occasionally for intraspecific), and the chemicals from an individual are more toxic to neighbouring individuals over the producer. However, endocides involve chemical actions within a species or an individual and may not involve other species or individuals. A species produces endocides which are more toxic to the producer than others. Organisms must use endocidal metabolites to negatively regulate themselves in order to have correct growth, development, or reproduction during the normal process.</p><p>The endocide theory can be applied broadly in all organisms. Yeasts and <italic>Paramecium</italic> in classic Gause&#x02019;s experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> are endocidal regulation examples of kingdoms of Fungi and Protista, respectively. In the Kingdom of Monera, it was found that the accumulation of toxic metabolic waste, lack of nutrients, and unfavorable environmental conditions cause bacterial death in the stationary and death phases of the bacterial life cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p><p>Although the endocidal compounds of most species have not been determined, identified isolates responsible for endocidal activities to date are SMs (e.g., phenolics and apocarotenoids of <italic>S. molesta</italic>, coumarin of <italic>T. sebifera</italic>, alkaloids of <italic>Camptotheca</italic>, alkaloids of <italic>S. invicta</italic>, and formic acid of ants). Endocidal compounds are primarily SMs. Furthermore, we found that the majority of chemical components of the extracts in these species have no endocidal activities. We thus speculate that only some of the endogenous SMs play a role of endocidal regulation in the growth, development, and reproduction of an organism. A low level of endocides will allow the producing organism to have normal physiological processes while a higher level of endocides may result in abnormal processes or dormancy and even death.</p><p>An organism may usually have more than one or one class of endocidal compounds. Closely-related species may produce the same or similar endocidal compounds, but non-closely related species may produce a different class of endocidal compounds. For example, enhanced biosynthesis of CPTs by pruning or through external applications of CPTs induced the same or similar autotoxicity; thus, the alkaloids CPTs are major endocidal compounds in <italic>Camptotheca</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Pruning and soaking of acorns with acorn extracts in <italic>Quercus</italic> induced similar results as observed in <italic>Camptotheca</italic>, but it is likely the phenolics are the major endocidal compounds in <italic>Quercus</italic>. In some cases, it is probably difficult to determine any single potent endocidal compound from the active extracts and interactions of multiple compounds in the same or different classes that may be responsible for endocidal activities. Toxicity of an endocide on a species may primarily depend on the occurrence of the same or similar endocidal agent in this species.</p><p>Endocides are conceptually different from autotoxins which refer to chemicals in the plant exudates or decomposed residues responsible for exogenous autotoxicity. Autotoxins must be released from the producer into the environment and then the sufficient accumulation impacts conspecific individuals via the changed environment (e.g., changes of microorganisms, parasitic organisms, other biotic factors, and physical factors and chemical accumulation). Although they may have direct inhibitory effects on the germination and growth of the producing species, autotoxins are often found to be toxic or even more toxic (allelopathic) to other species. The reports of autotoxins are mainly in some plants and microorganisms. An endocide plays a regulatory role in the producing species of all organisms and can cause endogenous autotoxicity without involvement of any other individuals or environment. When externally applied or massively accumulated in the environment, an endocide can cause exogenous autotoxicity. Unlike the reported autotoxins, however, endocides usually have selective toxicity on producers and their closely-related species.</p><p>An organism has normal growth, development, and reproduction at certain levels of endocides (between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>, usually relatively low concentrations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10</xref>). Due to nutrient deficiency or a gene missing, the endocide in an organism may be below the &#x0201c;<italic>x</italic> level&#x0201d; for normal growth, development, and reproduction. Under this condition, the organism may also develop diseases including tumors. In such a scenario, a supply of endocide would improve the condition to restore its healthy state. Under stress, however, an organism may produce more endocidal chemicals than the upper limit, or &#x0201c;<italic>y</italic> level&#x0201d; for normal growth, development, and reproduction, thus experiencing autotoxicity and abnormal growth, development, and reproduction (e.g., induced tumors by these autotoxic chemicals). To recover its normal (healthy) condition, the organism must decrease or stop the production or supply of endocides.</p><p>The question of why an organism increases the biosynthesis of its endocides under stress cannot be answered by current ecological or defense theories. Based on our data, we assert that self-regulation is the primary role of endocides in the producing organism. Endocidal regulation occurs prior to competition in a pure population. Mutations induced by the enhanced production of endocides under stress are a driving force of new species evolution. Endocide-induced mutations may be directional in some plants, e.g., shrubbiness/dwarfism, pleiocotyly, abnormal leaf morphogenesis, disturbed phyllotaxis, fasciated stems, and variegation. An induced mutation may not be the choice of the producing organism, and a muted form of the producing species is not necessarily more adapted to the environment or more defensive against its competitors or enemies than its original form. The fate of an induced mutation is determined by natural selection although endocidal regulation is a chemical process independent of other natural processes in evolution. The detailed evolutionary implications and mechanisms of endocides in the producing organisms will be addressed in the following paper.</p><p>Mutations induced by enhancing the biosynthesis of or by directly applying endocides provide a novel approach to developing new varieties of the producing or related species. The development of cultivars &#x02018;Hicksii&#x02019;, &#x02018;Katie&#x02019;, and &#x02018;CT168&#x02019; with high levels of endocidal CPTs from the tree species <italic>C. lowreyana</italic> are good examples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The induced chemical biosynthesis and derivatization by endocides can be used in the management of pharmaceutical crops and in the production of novel molecules. When endocides in an organism reach higher levels (&#x0003e; the level <italic>z</italic>), the organism cannot avoid loss of cells or organs, and it may die. Endocides are usually more selective to the producing organism over non-related species because it uses its endocides for self-regulation. External application of endocides can selectively inhibit and prevent the growth and reproduction of the producing species or its tissues. Thus, the endocide concept provides a novel environmentally friendly approach for controlling invasive or unwanted fast-growing species or tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Morphological Mutations Induced by Prolonged Soaking of Fruits (Seeds) in Water</title><p>The species used in the soaking experiments are summarized in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="3"><title>Camptotheca lowreyana</title><p>Fruits of <italic>C. lowreyana</italic> were collected from a single tree.

Extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure. 410&#x02009;g EtOH extracts were obtained and then stored in 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Preparations of Seed Extracts: The seeds were collected from the same source as the leaves and stems and were dried in an oven at 65&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;h. 110&#x02009;g dried seeds were ground to coarse powders and extracted two times for 48&#x02009;h with 95% EtOH (500&#x02009;mL and 400&#x02009;mL, respectively) at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure. 6.3&#x02009;g extracts were obtained and then stored in 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Extracts Yield of Experimental Seeds: Based on the seed weight and extraction rate (5.73%, in dry weight) of the extraction method used, it is estimated that the plant matter for each soaking treatment (60 seeds) could produce 0.41&#x02009;g EtOH extracts. To further reveal the actual amount of the extracts contained in the plant matter, a more effective extraction of 60 seeds (7.1&#x02009;g) was performed using a ASE 2000 Accelerated Solvent Extractor (60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 1500 psi, 30&#x02009;min static time, 100% volume flush, 120&#x02009;s purge, and 2 cycles). According to this extraction rate, 60 seeds contain at least 2.11&#x02009;g EtOH extracts. Soaking Treatments: Both leaf and stem extracts and seed extracts were prepared as an experimental solution with nanopure water at 5% concentration each. A total 900 seeds were prepared for the five following treatrments and each treatment included 60 seeds in Petri dishes at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with three replications per treatment: (1) controls: no soaking treatment, (2) water-24&#x02009;h: soaked in 30&#x02009;mL of nanopure water for 24&#x02009;h, (3) water-6 weeks: soaked in 30&#x02009;mL of nanopure water for six weeks, (4) 5% stem extracts-6 weeks: soaked in a 30&#x02009;mL of 5% solution of leaf and stem extracts (1.5&#x02009;g extracts) for six weeks, and (5) 5% seed extracts-6 weeks: soaked in a 30&#x02009;mL of 5% solution of seed extracts (1.5&#x02009;g extracts) for six weeks.

Extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure. 50&#x02009;g EtOH extracts were obtained. The extracts were prepared as experimental solutions with nanopure water at 0.5 and 5% concentration, respectively. Extracts Yield of Experimental Acorns: Based on the acorn weight and extraction rate (5.09%, in dry weight) of the extraction method, it is estimated that the plant matter for each soaking treatment (30 acorns) could produce 12.22&#x02009;g EtOH extracts. To further reveal the actual amount of the extracts contained in the plant matter, a more effective extraction of small plant sample (24&#x02009;g) was performed using ASE 2000 method. According to this extraction rate, 30 acorns contain at least 18.96&#x02009;g EtOH extracts.

Germination Tests: The acorns were then sowed in the pots with Miracle Grow Potting Mix soil in the greenhouse. Survey of seedlings was conducted three months later. HPLC Analysis of Normal and Extracts-induced Abnormal Leaves of Seedlings: One leaf was randomly collected from each of the two two-month-old normal seedlings, and one normal leaf and one bi-lobed leaf were collected from each of the two abnormal seedlings induced by 0.5% acorn extracts. The samples of acorns and leaves were dried in an oven at 65&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;h. The dried samples were weighed and ground and extracted by using the ASE 2000 method. Each leaf samples (0.2&#x02009;g) and acorn (10&#x02009;g) were loaded in 22&#x02009;mL cells and a 33&#x02009;mL cell. 95% EtOH was used as the solvent. The extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure, transferred into a 10&#x02009;mL volumetric flask, then diluted volume with 95% EtOH and mixed as experimental solutions. The HPLC chromatographs of oak leaves and acorn extracts were established by Agilent 1100 HPLC system coupled to an Agilent 1100 diode array detector, and an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x02009;mm, 3.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) at a flow rate of 0.6&#x02009;mL/min. A gradient elution was performed by using nanopure water (A) and CH<sub>3</sub>CN (B) as mobile phases. Elution was performed according to the following conditions: 2% B at time 0, linear increase to 98% B in 22&#x02009;min, and hold 98% B for 8&#x02009;min. The injection volumes were equivalent to 0.34&#x02009;mg plant material for all analyses. The column temperature was maintained at 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure, and 23.4&#x02009;g shell extracts and 31.2&#x02009;g seed extracts were obtained. 10&#x02009;g each of the extracts were dissolved and suspended in water and prepared separately as 200&#x02009;mL experimental solution at the concentration of 5%. Extracts Yield of Experimental Plant Matter: Based on the plant matter weight and extraction rate (4.68% for shell and 2.08% for seeds, in dry weight) of the above extraction method, it is estimated that the plant matter for each soaking treatment (30 fruits) could produce 0.52&#x02009;g shell EtOH extracts and 0.73&#x02009;g seed EtOH extracts. To further reveal the actual amount of the EtOH extracts contained in the plant matter, a more effective extraction of small plant samples (8&#x02009;g shells and 7.6&#x02009;g seeds) was performed using above ASE 2000 method. According to this extraction rate, 30 fruits contain at least 0.83&#x02009;g shell EtOH extracts and 12.47&#x02009;g seed EtOH extracts. Soaking Treatments: The treatment experiments were conducted at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. 360 seeds in total were prepared and 30 seeds in a plastic container were subjected to one of the four treatments for one week with three replications per treatment: (1) controls: without any treatment and the seeds were directly sowed in the pots in the greenhouse; (2) soaked in 60&#x02009;mL of nanopure water; (3) soaked in a 60&#x02009;mL of 5% solution of shell extracts (3&#x02009;g); and (4) soaked in a 60&#x02009;mL of 5% solution of seed extracts (3&#x02009;g).
