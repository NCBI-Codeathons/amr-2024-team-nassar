The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is found in many bacterial species and is used to target either eukaryotic cells or competitor bacteria. However, T6SS-secreted proteins have proven surprisingly elusive. Here, we identified two secreted substrates of the antibacterial T6SS from the opportunistic human pathogen, <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>. Ssp1 and Ssp2, both encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, were confirmed as antibacterial toxins delivered by the T6SS. Four related proteins encoded around the Ssp proteins (&#x02018;Rap&#x02019; proteins) included two specifically conferring self-resistance (&#x02018;immunity&#x02019;) against T6SS-dependent Ssp1 or Ssp2 toxicity. Biochemical characterization revealed specific, tight binding between cognate Ssp&#x02013;Rap pairs, forming complexes of 2:2 stoichiometry. The atomic structures of two Rap proteins were solved, revealing a novel helical fold, dependent on a structural disulphide bond, a structural feature consistent with their functional localization. Homologues of the <italic>Serratia</italic> Ssp and Rap proteins are found encoded together within other T6SS gene clusters, thus they represent founder members of new families of T6SS-secreted and cognate immunity proteins. We suggest that Ssp proteins are the original substrates of the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS, before horizontal acquisition of other T6SS-secreted toxins. Molecular insight has been provided into how pathogens utilize antibacterial T6SSs to overcome competitors and succeed in polymicrobial niches.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein secretion systems and their substrates are central to bacterial virulence and interaction with other organisms (Gerlach and Hensel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>). Six different secretion systems (Types I&#x02013;VI) are used by Gram-negative bacteria to transport specific proteins to the exterior of the bacterial cell or further inject them into target cells. The most recently described of these is the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) (Filloux <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2008</xref>). T6SSs are complex multi-protein assemblies that span both bacterial membranes and inject effector proteins directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into target cells (Bonemann <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2010</xref>; Cascales and Cambillau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2012</xref>). T6SSs are encoded by large, variable gene clusters that contain 13 &#x02018;core&#x02019; essential components, believed to make up the basic secretion apparatus. Two core proteins, Hcp and VgrG, form the extracellular part of the secretion machinery and depend on a functional T6SS apparatus for their movement to the outside of the bacterial cell (indeed, the presence of Hcp in the secreted fraction has provided a useful assay for basic T6SS assembly and activity; Pukatzki <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2009</xref>). Hcp and VgrG most likely form a needle-like membrane-puncturing device related to the bacteriophage tail spike; this structure is believed to be pushed to the outside of the secreting cell and likely into target cells upon contraction of a tail sheath-like structure (Leiman <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2009</xref>; Bonemann <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2010</xref>; Basler <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2012</xref>). T6SSs occur in many pathogenic bacteria and are implicated in virulence in important pathogens, including <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (Zheng and Leung, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2007</xref>; Cascales, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2008</xref>; Jani and Cotter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>; de Pace <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2010</xref>; Burtnick <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2011</xref>; Rosales-Reyes <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2012</xref>). In several cases, the action of such &#x02018;anti-eukaryotic&#x02019; T6SSs appears to result in disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (Pukatzki <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2007</xref>; Aubert <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2008</xref>; Suarez <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2010</xref>). Exciting recent work has demonstrated that some T6SSs are used to target other bacteria, efficiently killing or inhibiting competitors. This has been reported for T6SSs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (Hood <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2010</xref>; MacIntyre <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2010</xref>; Schwarz <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2010</xref>; Murdoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2011</xref>). The discovery that certain T6SSs may be &#x02018;antibacterial&#x02019; rather than, or in addition to, &#x02018;anti-eukaryotic&#x02019; is highly relevant to the competitive fitness and success of pathogens, particularly within polymicrobial infection sites. Such a system could provide the pathogen with a large competitive advantage against other bacteria in the host or the environment, enabling it to proliferate and mount a successful infection.</p><p>Identifying the proteins secreted by T6SSs is a priority, as they will be the &#x02018;effectors&#x02019; that directly act on target eukaryotic or bacterial cells. A special case of T6-secreted effector is the class of &#x02018;evolved&#x02019; VgrG proteins found in a minority of T6SSs which have extra C-terminal effector domains, e.g. the actin cross-linking domain of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> VgrG1 that is translocated into mammalian cells (Pukatzki <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2007</xref>; Jani and Cotter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>). However, excluding the structural components VgrG and Hcp, very few &#x02018;true&#x02019; T6SS-secreted proteins have been confirmed so far. Best characterized are three effector proteins, antibacterial toxins named Tse1&#x02013;3, secreted by the antibacterial HSI-1 T6SS of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Tse1 and 3 are peptidoglycan hydrolases that attack the cell wall of target bacteria (Hood <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2010</xref>; Russell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2011</xref>). Tse2 is active in the cytoplasm of target cells, where it efficiently induces quiescence (Li <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2012</xref>). All three have adjacently encoded cognate &#x02018;immunity&#x02019; proteins (Tsi1&#x02013;Tsi3) which protect the secreting cell from harming itself or being harmed by its sibling neighbours (Hood <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2010</xref>; Russell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2011</xref>). Significantly, obvious homologues of the Tse and Tsi proteins are not detectable outside of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Hood <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2010</xref>). A recent report has also identified a number of candidate T6SS substrates in <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, one of which was confirmed as a new T6-secreted peptidoglycan amidase (Russell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2012</xref>).</p><p>Opportunistic Gram-negative bacteria cause a large proportion of problematic and antibiotic-resistant hospital-acquired infections. Enterobacteria (especially extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase producing isolates) are among the leading culprits, including <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (Choi <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2007</xref>; Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2007</xref>). We previously reported that <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 possesses a T6SS with potent antibacterial activity (Murdoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2011</xref>). How this activity is mediated, in particular the antibacterial effectors secreted by the T6SS, was unknown. Hence, we sought to identify and characterize novel antibacterial effectors secreted by the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS. We report the identification and characterization of two such effectors, Ssp1 and Ssp2, which are encoded within the T6SS gene cluster and represent novel T6-secreted antibacterial toxins. We have also identified and characterized the Rap proteins, which include the cognate immunity proteins to these toxins. Biochemical analyses demonstrated a tight and specific interaction between secreted and immunity proteins. These secreted toxins and immunity proteins represent two new protein families, co-occurring within T6SS gene clusters of many other organisms. Additionally, determination of high-resolution crystal structures of two members of the Rap protein family revealed that this family possesses a previously undescribed protein fold that is dependent on formation of a disulphide bond.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The T6SS gene cluster harbours self-resistance determinants and candidate secreted effectors</title><p>The T6SS gene cluster of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10, <italic>SMA2244&#x02013;2281</italic>, contains 38 genes, including many with no known function (Murdoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2011</xref>). We speculated that encoded within this cluster might be T6-secreted effectors and/or self-resistance determinants, the latter preventing the T6SS-expressing cell from harming itself or being harmed by its isogenic (sibling) neighbours. In order to determine whether the cluster did indeed contain self-resistance determinants (such as specific immunity proteins analogous to the Tsi proteins), we generated a mutant lacking the entire T6SS gene cluster (&#x00394;T6SS) and examined whether it was fully resistant to the T6SS of the wild type strain. Co-culture of two target strains, wild type Db10 and the &#x00394;T6SS mutant, each with a wild type and a &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic> attacker, showed that the &#x00394;T6SS mutant had lost resistance to T6SS-mediated inhibition or killing by the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>A, left). Recovery of &#x00394;T6SS was decreased 100-fold when it was co-cultured with the wild type strain, compared with when the wild type strain was co-cultured with itself. This effect was dependent on a functional T6SS in the attacker as there was no loss of &#x00394;T6SS when it was co-cultured with a &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic> mutant. The ATPase ClpV is one of the core, structural components of the T6SS and we have shown previously that it is essential for Hcp secretion and T6-mediated antibacterial killing activity of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 (Murdoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2011</xref>). To simplify the analysis of multiple mutants, we defined the &#x02018;resistance index&#x02019; of a strain as the difference between recovery when co-cultured with the wild type strain and recovery when co-cultured with the &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic> mutant, specifically log<sub>2</sub>[recovery vs. wild type/recovery vs. &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic>]. The wild type or other resistant strain will show no difference and have a resistance index of 0. A target strain with reduced ability to resist harm caused by the T6SS will have a negative resistance index, exemplified by the &#x00394;T6SS mutant with a resistance index of &#x02212;7.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>A, right). Self-resistance did not depend on an active T6SS, as a &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic> mutant had a resistance index of 0. Similarly, mutants in other essential core T6SS components, &#x00394;<italic>lip</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>icmH</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>tssK</italic> (Murdoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2011</xref>) also showed no loss of self-resistance (data not shown). Therefore, genes other than those encoding the core conserved T6SS components were implicated in self-resistance. Our attention was particularly caught by a locus in the middle of the gene cluster, where six non-conserved genes, <italic>SMA2260&#x02013;2262</italic>, <italic>SMA2264&#x02013;2266</italic>, are flanked by conserved T6SS components. A mutant lacking all of these genes (but maintaining intact <italic>SMA2263</italic>, encoding Hcp1) was also tested and found to have a negative resistance index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>A). Hence, one or more of these genes contributes to self-resistance and may encode immunity protein(s).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>An internal locus in the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS gene cluster encodes secreted proteins and self-resistance functions.</p><p>A.

SMA2261 and SMA2264 were basic proteins with detectable sequence similarity between them, no discernable cellular localization signals and no predicted function. We hypothesized that they might be secreted substrates, and, given subsequent results, named them Ssp1 and Ssp2 (<underline>S</underline>ecreted <underline>s</underline>mall <underline>p</underline>rotein). SMA2260, SMA2262, SMA2265 and SMA2266 were proteins with classical Sec-dependent N-terminal signal peptides, identified using SignalP (Petersen <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2011</xref>), and thus predicted to be periplasmic. They also had no predicted function but shared detectable sequence similarity with each other. We hypothesized that they would represent specific immunity proteins or other self-resistance determinants, and named them Rap1a, Rap1b, Rap2a and Rap2b (<underline>R</underline>esistance <underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein). The genes encoding all these small proteins fall into two sets, either side of <italic>hcp1</italic> and within genes encoding T6SS structural proteins, <italic>vipB</italic> and <italic>fha</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>B). Homologues of the Ssp and Rap proteins are encoded within T6SS gene clusters in many other bacterial species (and in at least one case apart from the T6SS) and appear to always co-occur (see representative examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>C). We speculated that the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Ssp and Rap proteins represented previously unknown combinations of T6-secreted effectors and cognate immunity proteins. Importantly, mutants lacking one, some or all of the small proteins exhibited wild type levels of Hcp secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). Thus, none of the Ssp or Rap proteins is required for Hcp secretion, i.e. they play no structural role in the T6SS.</p></sec><sec><title>Ssp1 and Ssp2 are Type VI-secreted effectors</title><p>Ssp1 and Ssp2 were shown to be secreted substrates of the T6SS by immunoblotting secreted fractions from the wild type strain, two T6SS mutants, &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>tssE</italic>, and the corresponding complemented strains, using specific anti-Ssp1 and anti-Ssp2 antibodies. Both proteins were detected in the culture supernatant, entirely dependent on a functional T6SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>A). Neither protein was detectable in the cellular fraction, implying they were rapidly turned over if not secreted (data not shown). Secretion of Ssp2 was also independent of Ssp1, and vice versa, again confirming they have no structural or accessory role in the secretion machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>A). In order to establish if the Ssp proteins were antibacterial toxins contributing to the killing or inhibition of the susceptible &#x00394;T6SS mutant by the wild type strain, the recovery of &#x00394;T6SS in the presence of different mutants was determined. Recovery of the &#x00394;T6SS target was increased fivefold with the &#x00394;<italic>ssp2</italic> mutant, or any multiple mutant lacking <italic>ssp2</italic>, as attacker, compared with the wild type attacker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>B). In contrast, in this assay, loss of Ssp1 did not cause a statistically significant impairment in killing of &#x00394;T6SS. None of the Rap proteins was required for targeting of &#x00394;T6SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>B).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Proteins Ssp1 and Ssp2 are secreted by the Type VI secretion system and self-harm is mediated by Ssp2.</p><p>A.

It rapidly became apparent that single mutants in <italic>rap1a</italic> and <italic>rap2a</italic> had severe fitness defects on solid media, both on rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>A) and minimal media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), and particularly &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic>. Culture spots and single colonies of each mutant were &#x02018;thinner&#x02019;, smaller (in the case of &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic>), and with altered surface morphology. Examination of single cells showed that the &#x00394;<italic>rap1a</italic> cells appeared bigger and less uniformly shaped than wild type cells and the &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> cells had striking phenotypes, being either markedly distended or highly elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). These phenotypes could be complemented by expression of the corresponding gene <italic>in trans</italic> (indeed, the additional stress of the selective antibiotic made the phenotypes of &#x00394;<italic>rap1a</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> mutants carrying vector control plasmids even more pronounced; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>A).

These observations are entirely consistent with Rap2a serving as the immunity protein against the Ssp2 toxin and Rap1a being the cognate immunity protein alleviating toxicity mediated by Ssp1. Similarly, when &#x00394;<italic>rap1a</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> mutants were constructed in combination with the &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic> mutation, the double mutants were again apparently healthy on solid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Hence, self-toxicity depended on a functional T6SS, implying it was caused by T6SS-mediated injection of the toxin into a susceptible cell by its neighbours (further supported by the observation that &#x00394;<italic>rap1a</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> did not display comparable growth defects in liquid culture, where contact-dependent targeting is unlikely to occur efficiently; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Self-resistance is mediated by specific Rap immunity proteins cognate to the secreted Ssp proteins.</p><p>A.

To confirm that Ssp2 was directly and entirely responsible for the inhibitory effect of a wild type attacker strain on &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic>, we showed that a &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> target strain is completely resistant to attack by a &#x00394;<italic>ssp2</italic> mutant, with recovery of &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> in the presence of a &#x00394;<italic>ssp2</italic> attacker being the same as its recovery in the presence of a &#x00394;<italic>clpV</italic> attacker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>C).

Complex formation was demonstrated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. All Rap proteins were dimeric in solution, whereas Ssp1 and Ssp2 were monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A and B). When equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a were mixed, all of the protein was detected in a higher molecular weight complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A) and the same was also observed on mixing Ssp2 and Rap2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A). In contrast, no complex formation between Ssp1 and Rap1b or between Ssp2 and Rap2b, no additional three-way complexes and no &#x02018;cross&#x02019; interactions between Ssp2 and Rap1a or between Ssp1 and Rap2a were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). As mixing equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a resulted in detection of only the complexed species, with no unbound form of either protein detectable, this implied a 1:1 molar complex. The 1:1 molar stoichiometry of the Rap1a&#x02013;Ssp1 complex was confirmed by quantitative analysis of the composition of the higher molecular weight peak using in-gel SYPRO Orange staining (Rickman <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>C). Given the dimeric nature of Rap1a and an apparent complex mass by SEC of around 55 kDa [predicted M<sub>w</sub> of 1:1 molar complexes are 34.6 kDa (1:1), 69.2 kDa (2:2), 104 kDa (3:3) or 138 kDa (4:4)], this is most consistent with a heterotetrameric Rap1a<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;Ssp1<sub>2</sub> complex. Similar logic supported a Rap2a<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;Ssp2<sub>2</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A and C). The SEC analyses suggested stable complexes were formed between the cognate Ssp and Rap proteins. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis of complex formation between Ssp1 and the Rap1a dimer and between Ssp2 and the Rap2a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>D) showed that, in both cases, binding was clearly exothermic and tight, at least in the low nanomolar K<sub>d</sub> range. Although apparent K<sub>d</sub> values of 4&#x02013;8 nM were obtained, this is approaching the limit of accuracy for conventional ITC (Wiseman <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">1989</xref>). Finally, we took advantage of the tight Rap&#x02013;Ssp interactions to utilize immobilized Rap2a and Rap1a to affinity-purify secreted Ssp2 or Ssp1, respectively, from culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>).

For Ssp1, we observed an intact C-terminus but the sequence of the very N-terminus corresponds to several tryptic peptides too small to be detectable by standard mass spectrometry, so we were unable to definitively confirm lack of processing at this end (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> interaction between cognate secreted toxins and immunity proteins.</p><p>A. and B.

generates the dimer. Rap2b has two dimers, formed by subunits A : B and C : D, in the asymmetric unit. The four subunits are similar, with the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between superimposed C&#x003b1; atoms ranging from 0.5 &#x000c5; (subunit B and D) to 0.7 &#x000c5; (subunits A and C). The two proteins display obvious similarities in terms of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). An overlay of Rap1b and Rap2b subunits matches 71 C&#x003b1; atoms with a r.m.s.d. of 1.4 &#x000c5;. Of note is the conservation of the disulphide bond, a key structural feature, likely critical to the stable folding of the subunit and subsequent dimerization of the Rap proteins. The Rap subunit is constructed around a helical bundle of five helices (&#x003b1;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;6). A disulphide linkage (Cys54&#x02013;Cys120 in Rap1b, Cys41&#x02013;Cys101 in Rap2b) tethers &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;5 together. This association in turn supports formation of a hydrophobic core that is primarily aliphatic with residues contributed from &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;6. Three helices (&#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;5) form a concave surface on one side of the monomer. A series of hydrogen bonding interactions also helps to stabilize the arrangement of &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;4. By virtue of being longer than Rap2b, Rap1b has an extension of five residues at the N-terminus and 13 at the C-terminus, the latter of which form a short helix &#x003b1;7. These segments of Rap1b are on the surface of the molecules at opposite ends of the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>The Rap proteins display an extensive dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>), consistent with the observation that each Rap protein exists as a stable dimer in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A and B). The Rap1b dimer uses almost 24% of the accessible surface area of a subunit in formation of the dimer. In the case of Rap2b the value is 20%. Such percentages are indicative of highly stable oligomers (Krissinel and Henrick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2007</xref>). The dimer is stabilized by extensive van der Vaals interactions primarily involving aliphatic residues, in conjunction with hydrogen bonding interactions and solvent mediated bridging associations. The most important contributions are from side-chains on the concave surface, formed by &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;5, interacting with the partner across the molecular twofold axis of symmetry. Additional interactions involve a self-association of the loop that links &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3, together with the N-terminus &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;5. Helices &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;5 are thus not only critical for the fold of the Rap subunits but also to creating a suitable interface that leads to a highly stable dimer. This observation, together with the conserved disulphide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>), ties in with the localization of Rap proteins to the oxidative environment of the periplasm where correct folding to support anti-toxin activity must occur.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Conservation of the Rap protein fold.

Not only are the main &#x003b1;-helices observed in both crystal structures closely mimicked by the structural predictions of the other members of the family, the Cys residues contributing to the structural disulphide bond are also conserved. Additionally, Rap2b shares slightly higher sequence identity with Rap2a (23% identity for the mature proteins) than it does with Rap1b (20% identity). Given the similarity of the Rap1b and 2b crystal structures, discussed above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), then this provides confidence that Rap2a shares this new fold and indeed that the Rap fold is a defining characteristic of this protein family, many members of which are likely to represent T6SS immunity proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have identified two proteins, Ssp1 and Ssp2, as true (non-structural) secreted substrates of the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS and confirmed them as new T6SS-dependent antibacterial toxins. We have also demonstrated, genetically and biochemically, that the highly specific, cognate periplasmic immunity proteins, Rap1a and Rap2a, efficiently neutralize the effect of the Ssp proteins. The atomic structures of two other, related Rap proteins reveal that the immunity proteins should exhibit a novel protein fold likely only attained when they are present in the periplasm.</p><p>Our examination of Ssp1 and Ssp2 suggested that they represented novel antibacterial toxins, containing a domain of unknown function, DUF4285, present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. We were unable to detect significant sequence similarity with well-known peptidoglycan hydrolases and the structure prediction program Phyre2 (Kelley and Sternberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2009</xref>) was unable to assign them any peptidoglycan hydrolase-like structure. Nevertheless, as they are clearly periplasmic-acting toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>) and non-resistant mutants showed apparent lytic and/or division defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>), a cell wall targeting function seemed most likely. This idea has very recently been strongly supported by the observation that related proteins exhibit peptidoglycan amidase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (see below; Russell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2012</xref>). Importantly, through analysing secreted Ssp2 isolated from culture supernatant, we have also shown for the first time that T6-secreted effectors are not processed at either terminus during secretion. It seems clear that Ssp1 and Ssp2 are not the only effector proteins secreted by the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS. First, Ssp mutants are still able to kill <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> as effectively as wild type Db10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), implying that other toxins secreted in their absence are sufficient to maintain efficient antibacterial killing. Additionally, the susceptibility of the &#x00394;T6SS mutant to self-targeting by the wild type strain is greater than that of the &#x00394;<italic>rap,ssp</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>A), implying additional immunity proteins and thus cognate secreted toxins within the T6SS gene cluster. Moreover, the magnitude of killing of the &#x00394;T6SS mutant by wild type Db10 is less than that observed during T6-dependent killing of other organisms (Murdoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), suggesting that additional secreted toxins (and cognate immunity proteins) are encoded elsewhere in the genome. Indeed, our unpublished work has identified four other, unrelated, candidate substrates of the <italic>Serratia</italic> T6SS. Hence, we believe that <italic>S. marcescens</italic> uses a species-specific arsenal of secreted toxins to produce the potent and efficient targeting of a variety of competitor bacteria observed (Murdoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2011</xref>).</p><p>Our work provides strong functional evidence for a new family of related T6SS substrates (Ssp1 and Ssp2 homologues) and family of related immunity proteins (Rap homologues) found in many different bacterial species and generally encoded within a main T6SS gene cluster of that organism. Ssp- and Rap-like proteins are found associated with a subset of T6SSs (some, but not all, closely related to the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS), but whether these T6SSs all exhibit antibacterial activity remains to be determined. While this report was in preparation, a bioinformatic study identified four disparate families of predicted T6-secreted peptidoglycan amidases, with Tse1 of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> being a member of &#x02018;Family 1&#x02019; (Russell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2012</xref>). Entirely consistent with our data, Ssp-like proteins were recognized as one of these families, &#x02018;Family 4&#x02019;. A related family of proposed cognate immunity proteins identified as co-occurring with all Ssp/Family 4 proteins is of course the Rap family proteins. Thus, in the nomenclature proposed by Russell <italic>et al</italic>., Ssp1 and Ssp2 could be classified as Tae4.1<sup>SM</sup> and Tae4.2<sup>SM</sup>, and Rap1a and Rap2a as Tai4.1a<sup>SM</sup> and Tai4.2a<sup>SM</sup>. Unlike Families 1&#x02013;3, the Family 4/Ssp proteins are almost unrecognizable as peptidoglycan amidases at a sequence and structure prediction level. Nevertheless, the purified Ssp homologue STM0277 from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium was able to hydrolyse peptidoglycan cross-links at the D-Glu-<italic>m</italic>DAP bond of the acceptor stem (Russell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2012</xref>). Additionally, artificial expression and targeting of STM0277 to the periplasm was shown to be toxic to <italic>E. coli</italic>, with rescue by coexpression of the Rap homologue STM0278. However, studies were not conducted to show that STM0277 is a T6SS substrate or that it plays a role in T6-mediated antibacterial activity, neither was a role for STM0278 in self-resistance in the native, T6-elaborating organism investigated. In contrast, we have provided the comprehensive genetic, <italic>in vivo</italic> and biochemical data necessary to confirm that Ssp/Family 4 proteins are indeed a novel family of T6-secreted antibacterial toxins and moreover that the Rap family contains the cognate immunity proteins. Interestingly, it was recently reported that a mutant in the above Rap2a homologue in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, STM0278, had a defect in replication in macrophages (Mulder <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2012</xref>). The reason behind this is not clear, but it may reflect the fact that this mutant has reduced fitness due to self-toxicity, just as we have shown for the &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> mutant. It should also be noted that Ssp&#x02013;Rap pairs are not always found associated with T6SS genes. A particularly interesting example is the location of such a pair almost adjacent to genes encoding a classical RelE&#x02013;RelB toxin&#x02013;antitoxin pair (T-AT; Yamaguchi and Inouye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2011</xref>) on a plasmid in <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that an original source of T6 toxin/resistance pairs is from plasmid T-AT systems.</p><p>The work of Russell <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2012</xref>) combined with our demonstration that Ssp1 and Ssp2 function as periplasmic-acting toxins is highly consistent with these proteins having a peptidoglycan amidase enzymatic activity. Of particular note, conserved Cys and His residues predicted by Russell <italic>et al</italic>. to represent the catalytic amino acids mediating peptidoglycan amide bond hydrolysis can be readily identified in Ssp1 and Ssp2. These are Cys50 (NT<underline>C</underline>AVRMS) and His133 (G<underline>H</underline>IDLIEP) in Ssp1, and Cys50 (NA<underline>C</underline>AIRMS) and His131 in Ssp2 (G<underline>H</underline>ATLWNG), with the equivalent, conserved regions in STM0277 being (NA<underline>C</underline>PIRMS and G<underline>H</underline>VTLWNG). However, crucially, our data on the Ssp and Rap proteins in the context of T6SS-mediated attack and defence <italic>in vivo</italic> reveal that the situation is more subtle than this. In particular, Ssp1 and Ssp2 are clearly not redundant, despite having the same postulated enzymatic function. Rather, they have distinct activities or roles, with Ssp2 apparently more potent. In particular, we noted that the Ssp-dependent morphological phenotypes of the &#x00394;<italic>rap1a</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rap2a</italic> mutants are different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>), that toxicity in the <italic>E. coli</italic> periplasm is only medium-dependent for Ssp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>), and that the two may be relevant in different biological contexts (e.g. Ssp1 does not significantly contribute to self-targeting under the conditions of our standard assay, yet is clearly required for the self-toxicity observed in a &#x00394;<italic>rap1a</italic> mutant). This specialization is consistent with a clear specificity for only the cognate Ssp&#x02013;Rap partner, as we observed. In the native context, it is clear that none of the other three Rap proteins can confer cross-resistance to Ssp2 in the absence of Rap2a (nor did Ssp2 interact with Rap1a biochemically). The molecular basis for the difference between Ssp1 and Ssp2, which share 24% sequence identity, is not yet clear and will require further study, including determination of <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic activity and atomic structures.</p><p>The <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Rap proteins represent founder members of a new bacterial protein family, members of which represent immunity proteins for T6-secreted toxins, as exemplified by Rap1a and Rap2a. We have determined the structures of two members of this family, Rap1b and Rap2b, revealing a new protein fold. Given the sequence homology, conservation of key residues and shared predicted secondary structure throughout all members of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>; Russell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2012</xref>), this fold appears to be shared across members from different organisms. A conserved disulphide bond and the observed stable dimerization interface, together with canonical N-terminal signal sequences, are consistent with a periplasmic localization for all Rap family proteins. To date, the structures of two other T6 immunity proteins have been solved. The first is the cytoplasmic Tsi2 protein (Li <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2012</xref>; Zou <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2012</xref>). Like the Rap proteins, Tsi2 exhibits a helical fold, is acidic and exists as a stable dimer in solution. However, the structures of Tsi2 and the Rap proteins are unrelated. Second, and very recent, is the structure of the periplasmic Tsi1 protein, complexed with the secreted peptidoglycan hydrolase effector, Tse1 (Ding <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2012</xref>). Tse1 possesses a strikingly accessible active site, facilitating its promiscuous and toxic peptidoglycan amidase activity (Chou <italic>et al</italic>., #b<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1001">1001</xref>). Tsi1 binds to Tse1 in a 1:1 complex, occluding the substrate-binding site of Tse1 in order to neutralize its activity (Ding <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2012</xref>). Critically, although the Rap1a/Rap2a proteins and Tsi1 both mediate resistance to peptidoglycan hydrolase toxins, their structures now appear to be entirely unrelated. Tsi1 exhibits an all &#x003b2; fold, related to a classical &#x003b2;-propeller, whereas Rap family proteins exhibit a novel helical fold. This indicates that the mechanisms by which immunity proteins confer resistance may be divergent even among those with effectors of similar function. Rap1a and Rap2a have an obvious immunity phenotype specific to their cognate secreted toxins, Ssp1 and Ssp2. However, the role of Rap1b and Rap2b is not yet known. While they do not appear to play a role in self-resistance, they may play a role in resistance towards closely related bacteria secreting similar toxins. It is worth noting that other organisms also possess multiple Rap family proteins for a given Ssp family protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>C and data not shown); therefore, whatever the function of Rap1b and 2b turns out to be, it may not be unique to <italic>Serratia</italic>.</p><p>Complementing our genetic and phenotypic demonstration of the cognate toxin-immunity function of Ssp1&#x02013;Rap1a and Ssp2&#x02013;Rap2a, we report detailed biochemical characterization of the interactions between these purified T6-secreted toxins and immunity proteins. For efficient self-protection, these interactions should be tight and highly specific, as was observed. Formation of Ssp1&#x02013;Rap1a and Ssp2&#x02013;Rap2a complexes is exothermic, with low nanomolar K<sub>d</sub>, and with a stoichiometry of 2:2. A binding affinity of this order agrees well with the K<sub>d</sub> of 3 nM reported for the Tsi1&#x02013;Tse1 interaction (Ding <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2012</xref>); however, the Tsi1&#x02013;Tse1 complex has a stoichiometry of 1:1, again highlighting significant differences between different pairs of toxin-immunity proteins. The structure of a Ssp&#x02013;Rap complex and arrangement of the subunits has yet to be determined, although it is likely that the two Ssp proteins bind to the same part of each Rap monomer, exploiting the twofold symmetry. Li <italic>et al</italic>. suggest that Tse2 interacts with an acidic patch on Tsi2 distal to the dimer interface (Li <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2012</xref>). They also note that, like many toxin&#x02013;antitoxin pairs, the resistance proteins Tsi1&#x02013;3 are more acidic than the toxin proteins Tse1&#x02013;3. This pattern is strikingly followed with the Ssp (theoretical pI 9) and Rap (theoretical pI 5&#x02013;6) proteins. Nevertheless, while the highly acidic Rap proteins bind their cognate Ssp partners, which are noticeably basic, with high affinity, the story is not as simple as charge complementarity. Surprisingly for proteins with such low pI values, the striking surface feature conserved in Rap1b and Rap2b structures is a crescent-shaped basic patch on either side of the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>C and D). It is possible that such a basic crescent, if present on toxin-binding Rap proteins, may contribute to orientation of the partner during binding; conversely, it might contribute to the lack of Ssp binding by Rap1b and Rap2b. Additionally, all four <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Rap proteins are acidic and both Ssp proteins basic, yet only two, highly specific interactions are observed (Rap1a&#x02013;Ssp1 and Rap2a&#x02013;Ssp2). While charge complementarity would be expected to be important for specific complex formation, it is likely that shape considerations play an equally important role. The structure of a toxin-immunity protein complex will be necessary to delineate the molecular features that govern specific Rap&#x02013;Ssp association. We are working towards that goal.</p><p>In summary, our data support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>) whereby Ssp1 and Ssp2 are toxins secreted by the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS into the periplasm of a neighbouring cell. If this is an isogenic sibling, the cognate Rap proteins provide an efficient protective barrier, effectively binding and sequestering the toxin, whereas if it is a competitor, Ssp1/2 are free to attack the cell wall. However, Ssp1 and Ssp2 are only two of multiple distinct T6-secreted toxins. This provides the observed redundancy of function: if Ssp1/2 are missing, the other toxins still cause the efficient death of a competitor. This &#x02018;belt and braces&#x02019; approach provides great robustness: if a competitor becomes resistant to one or two toxins, the others will still provide the ability to kill or inhibit the competitor efficiently. Of course, the toxic effect of Ssp1/2 can be seen against self (if the cognate Rap is missing) as Db10 has resistance proteins to neutralize the other toxins. We believe that other effectors most likely act on different cellular targets, analogous to the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-specific, cytoplasmic-acting toxin, Tse2 (Li <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2012</xref>). Finally, we speculate that as the Ssp and Rap proteins are encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, and related genes are found associated with other T6SSs, particularly closely related ones, they may represent the ancestral substrates of the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> T6SS. Subsequently, other toxins could have been horizontally acquired from diverse sources and adopted by this highly versatile secretion machine. The exciting task of deciphering how such species- and strain-specific arsenals of toxins and immunity proteins are co-ordinated by the producing cell and how they contribute to the dynamic composition of polymicrobial communities in infection and the environment lies ahead.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Model for action and context of Ssp and Rap proteins.</p><p>A.

The sample cell contained 6 &#x003bc;M Rap1a dimer or Rap2a dimer and the syringe contained 120 &#x003bc;M Ssp1 or Ssp2. Titrations consisted of 30 &#x000d7; 8 &#x003bc;l injections of Ssp into Rap (or into buffer alone as control). Data analysis was performed with the Origin software provided (MicroCal). For affinity isolation of Ssp1 and Ssp2, 10 &#x003bc;g of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Rap protein was immobilized on magnetic Ni<sup>2+</sup> beads (Qiagen), incubated for 1 h with culture supernatant (after 7 h growth in LB), beads washed and bound proteins eluted by the addition of gel sample buffer. Identified proteins were excised from the Coomassie- (Ssp2) or Silver- (Ssp1) stained gel and identified by mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallographic analyses</title><p>Well-ordered trigonal and orthorhombic crystals of Rap1b and Rap2b, respectively, were obtained. The asymmetric unit for Rap1b consisted of a single subunit, while Rap2b displayed two dimers in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were recorded in-house and experimental phases were derived by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction measurements (Micossi <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2002</xref>), exploiting the signal from endogenous S atoms and I<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions that had been added by soaking. The electron density maps were of high quality, and the models were completed, then refined to high resolution using standard methods (Dawson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2008</xref>). Full crystallographic details are provided in the <italic>Supporting information</italic> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Atomic co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes 4AX2 (Rap1b) and 4B6I (Rap2b).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Royal Society of Edinburgh (Personal Research Fellowship to S.
