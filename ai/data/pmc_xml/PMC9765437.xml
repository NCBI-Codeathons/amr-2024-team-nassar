Morphological differentiation of the filamentous, multicellular bacteria is shaped by a variety of differentiation processes, which include the reorganization of chromosome segregation, cell division, and cell-wall assembly, as well as the formation of a sporulating aerial mycelium (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition, morphological differentiation is coordinated with the extraordinary diverse secondary metabolism. Such complex developmental programs often rely on the activation or inactivation of regulators that may be conferred by transcriptional control, protein modifications, and/or regulated proteolysis. Energy-dependent degradation of short-lived regulators is one essential feature of the compartmentalized, tightly regulated bacterial caseinolytic protease Clp (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), which is intimately involved in the morphological differentiation of <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The Clp protease typically consists of a barrel-shaped, tetradecameric ClpP core that associates with hexameric ATP-consuming unfoldases, so-called Clp-ATPases, for protein degradation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The tetradecameric ClpP core is built of two stacked heptameric rings to form the proteolytic chamber of the Clp protease, keeping the catalytic site residues (Ser97, His122, Asp171 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>) within the inner lumen of the barrel and away from the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Access to the proteolytic chamber is tightly regulated. To prevent undesired substrate degradation, substrate entry is only allowed via two axial pores, which are too small for protein passage. Consequently, in the absence of a cognate Clp-ATPase, ClpP lacks proteolytic activity and only degrades short peptides (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For regulated proteolysis, Clp-ATPases and associated adaptor proteins recognize natural Clp protease substrates, bind to the apical and/or distal surface of the ClpP core, and unfold and translocate the protein substrates under ATP consumption through the entrance pores into the proteolytic chamber of ClpP (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Many bacterial species encode only a single ClpP homolog, thus forming homotetradecameric ClpP complexes, for instance, the model bacteria <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> or pathogens like <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus pneumoniae</named-content> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Other pathogenic bacteria, including mycobacteria, chlamydia, listeria, clostridia, and pseudomonads, possess two ClpP isoforms, i.e., ClpP1 and ClpP2, which may form homotetradecameric complexes of either ClpP1 or ClpP2 or heterotetradecameric complexes involving both ClpP homologs (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Streptomycetes have an even more complex Clp system and mostly encode three or five ClpP homologs. Current knowledge of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp machinery is mainly based on studies using <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptomyces lividans</named-content> cells. In this species, five <italic toggle="yes">clpP</italic> genes are organized in two bicistronic (<italic toggle="yes">clpP1clpP2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">clpP3clpP4</italic>) and one monocistronic (<italic toggle="yes">clpP5</italic>) operon (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), whose expression was shown to be tightly controlled via several negative feedback loops (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). For example, in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content> wild-type cells, the degradation of the transcriptional activators ClgR and PopR depends on the presence of ClpP1 and ClpP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Here, ClgR induces the expression of ClpP1 and ClpP2, while the ClgR paralogue PopR is assumed to recruit the RNA polymerase for <italic toggle="yes">clpP3clpP4</italic> transcription. As PopR was shown to be degraded by ClpP1 and ClpP2 in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> cells, PopR-mediated expression of the <italic toggle="yes">clpP3clpP4</italic> operon is silenced in the presence of these two ClpP homologs (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). On the other hand, ClpP3 and ClpP4 are expressed in <italic toggle="yes">clpP1clpP2</italic> deletion mutants due to the repealed degradation of PopR (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In contrast to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content>, where the function of ClpP is not essential for survival, at least one functional copy of either <italic toggle="yes">clpP1clpP2</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">clpP3clpP4</italic> is essential for the viability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, at least some functional redundancy seems to exist between the ClpP homologs in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> that might represent a rescue mechanism in case the function of ClpP1 and ClpP2 is disturbed or inhibited.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>ClpP1 and ClpP2 form a heterotetradecameric core that interacts with the Clp-ATPases ClpX, ClpC1, and ClpC2 for protein degradation. (A) Clp protease-dependent regulatory network in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic>. (B and C) <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> protein degradation assays with purified Clp proteins indicate that the hydrolysis of protein substrates depends on the presence of ClpP1, ClpP2, and a partner Clp-ATPase. SDS-PAGE analyses of the degradation of the putative natural Clp substrates ClgR and PopR show that ClpX-mediated degradation of both substrates requires the presence of both ClpP1 and ClpP2 (B). Similarly, both ClpP1 and ClpP2 were required for ClpC2- or ClpC1-dependent digestion of &#x003b2;-casein (B) or FITC-casein (C), respectively. The hydrolysis of FITC-casein was recorded as an increase in fluorescence intensity (relative fluorescence units [RFU]) over time. Mean values (normalized to %) of initial linear reaction kinetics are given. Statistical analyses were performed with one-way ANOVA by using three biological replicates, each comprising three technical replicates. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e; 0.05, nonsignificant (ns); ****, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x02264; 0.0001. Error bars indicate standard deviations. For SDS-PAGE images, representative examples of three replicates are shown. (D) Coelution of untagged ClpP1 and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged ClpP2 during Ni-NTA chromatography implies the interaction of the two ClpP homologs. Samples of the flowthrough (F), the second wash fraction (WII), and the elution fractions E2&#x02013;E4 are depicted. The cell lysate used for chromatography was generated after coexpression of ClpP1 (blue asterisk) and ClpP2-His<sub>6</sub> (green asterisks) from two distinct, IPTG-inducible T7 promoters in the pETDUET-vector system. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using specific anti-His<sub>6</sub> or anti-ClpP1 antibodies are shown. The three observed bands marked by the anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody correspond to full-length ClpP2 and processed variants (as discussed in a later section). Of note, the polyclonal anti-ClpP1 antiserum cross-reacted with ClpP2, which resulted in the detection of the same three bands as seen with the anti-His<sub>6</sub> as well as an additional band that corresponds to ClpP1. Flowthrough (F) and second wash fraction (W II) of the affinity chromatography experiment indicate the clearance of unbound ClpP1. In a control pulldown experiment, untagged ClpP1 and 6his-tagged ClpP2 were applied separately to a Ni-NTA column. Here, ClpP1 was only detected in the flowthrough fraction (F), whereas ClpP2 was only detected in the elution fractions (E2&#x02013;E4), thus proving the stringency of the pulldown assay. Assays were performed at least in triplicates, and representative SDS-PAGE images are shown. (E) Cross-linking experiments visualize the heteromeric ClpP1P2 complex. Employing the chemical cross-linker BS3, a protein band with the approximate size of a ClpP tetradecamer appeared only in samples containing both ClpP1 and ClpP2. This band was detected with anti-ClpP1 as well as anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies. A sample containing both ClpP1 and ClpP2 in the absence of BS3 did not yield the tetradecamer band, suggesting rather transient interactions between ClpP1 and ClpP2. Assays were performed at least in triplicates, and representative native PAGE images are shown.

We then performed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> degradation experiments by testing different combinations of ClpP and Clp-ATPase proteins to attempt the digestion of the natural substrates ClgR and PopR as well as the model protein substrates FITC-casein and &#x003b2;-casein, respectively. Our data show that neither ClpP1 nor ClpP2 alone was capable of protein degradation in the presence of a Clp-ATPase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). However, when ClpP1, ClpP2, and Clp-ATPase were used in combination, protein substrates were rapidly digested, thus indicating that both ClpP1 and ClpP2 are required for Clp-ATPase-dependent protein degradation. Of note, not all protein substrates were degraded by all Clp-ATPase combinations or with similar efficiency. When we tested the degradation of ClgR and PopR by ClpP1 plus ClpP2 in the presence of either ClpX, ClpC1, or ClpC2, we observed that the presence of ClpX or ClpC2 leads to the degradation of both ClgR and PopR, although degradation was notably slower with ClpC2, whereas ClpC1 only conferred the degradation of ClgR but not of PopR (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>). The model substrates &#x003b2;-casein and FITC-casein were digested by ClpP1 plus ClpP2 in the presence of either ClpC1 or ClpC2 but not when ClpX was present (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">C</xref>).</p><p>Apparently, the stimulation of activity upon combining ClpP1 and ClpP2 points to the formation of a heterotetradecameric complex consisting of both ClpP homologs. To investigate a potential direct interaction of ClpP1 and ClpP2, we performed coelution and native PAGE experiments using native ClpP1 and C-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged ClpP2. During metal-ion affinity chromatography, ClpP1 was retained on the column by His<sub>6</sub>-tagged ClpP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref>), implying a direct interaction of ClpP1 and ClpP2. However, the interaction within the heteromeric ClpP1P2 complex seemed rather weak, and the complex did not appear on standard native gels. To investigate this interaction further and substantiate the existence of a heterotetradecameric complex, we next performed cross-linking experiments using the chemical cross-linker BS3 to stabilize potential transient and weak interactions between both ClpP homologs. Now, the complex was clearly shown and only the combination of both ClpP1 and ClpP2 allowed for the detection of a tetradecameric complex, as documented by native PAGE and immunoblotting analyses using anti-<italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP1 and anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1E</xref>). In contrast, when ClpP1 or ClpP2 were used individually, no tetradecameric complexes were observed. Hence, our data show that the proteolytic core of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp protease consists of a ClpP1P2 heterotetradecameric complex that interacts with the Clp-ATPases ClpX, ClpC1, and ClpC2 for the degradation of protein substrates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ClpP1 confers proteolytic activity to the complex, and ClpP2 interacts with the unfoldases ClpX, ClpC1, and ClpC2.</title><p>Due to the observed heteromeric nature of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP core, which consists of the two distinct homologs ClpP1 and ClpP2, we wondered whether both ClpP1 and ClpP2 equally contribute to Clp-ATPase-dependent proteolysis or whether each homolog may fulfill certain, distinct functions during the degradation process. To approach this question, we first analyzed the catalytic activity of the heterotetradecameric wild-type ClpP1P2 complex compared to combinations with the corresponding catalytic triad mutants ClpP1<sub>S113A</sub> and ClpP2<sub>S131A</sub>, which had been constructed by replacing the nucleophilic serine moiety of the catalytic triad by an alanine residue via site-directed mutagenesis. Of note, both ClpP1 and ClpP2 of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> comprise canonical Ser-His-Asp catalytic triads, analogous to <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. coelicolor</named-content> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S1D</xref>), but are different from ClpP1 from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Listeria monocytogenes</named-content>. <italic toggle="yes">Listeria</italic> ClpP1 features an uncommon asparagine residue instead of aspartate at position 172 that aligns to an active catalytic triad only when ClpP1 forms a complex with ClpP2 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Studying the turnover of the fluorogenic model substrate casein in the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> ClpC1, we observed that a mixed core of ClpP1 and ClpP2<sub>S131A</sub> retained full proteolytic activity at the level of wild-type ClpP1P2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>). This was in clear contrast to the mixed complexes ClpP1<sub>S113A</sub>P2 or ClpP1<sub>S113A</sub>P2<sub>S131A</sub>, in which protease activity was abolished for both, thus showing that the catalytic activity of the Clp complex is essentially conferred by ClpP1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIG&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>ClpP1 and ClpP2 have different but complementary functions during protein degradation.

SDS-PAGE analyses show that protein degradation is inhibited in samples harboring the hydrophobic pocket mutant ClpP2<sub>hp</sub>, whereas samples with ClpP1<sub>hp</sub> retain wild-type activity, indicating that the Clp-ATPases ClpC2 and ClpX also interact via ClpP2. All assays were performed at least in triplicates, and representative SDS-PAGE images are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbio.01413-22-f002" position="anchor"/></fig><p>Aside from catalytic activity, the interaction with partner Clp-ATPases, which unfold and feed protein substrates into the ClpP degradation chamber, is a prerequisite for the proteolytic activity of the Clp protease. Therefore, we also probed the interaction of ClpP1 and ClpP2 with the cognate Clp-ATPases by generating particular hydrophobic pocket mutations, which had previously been shown to abrogate Clp-ATPase binding to the ClpP core in the related <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> (MtClpP) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The corresponding three conserved aromatic residues (Y74, Y76, and F96) in the crystal structure of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ClpP (EcClpP) are also important for stabilizing Clp-ATPase interactions with ClpP (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and the same positions were also shown to be involved in the binding of ADEP to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> ClpP (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).

To abrogate potential Clp-ATPase/ClpP interactions, but avoid substantial interference with protein structure and folding, suitable amino acids for exchange were selected according to the physicochemical properties and size of the amino acids, i.e., the bulky, aromatic tyrosine was replaced by a valine, whereas the smaller, hydrophilic serine was replaced by an alanine, yielding the hydrophobic pocket mutant proteins ClpP1<sub>hp</sub> (Y76V, Y78V, and Y98V) and ClpP2<sub>hp</sub> (S94A, Y96V, and Y116V) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S1D</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>). When different combinations of wild-type and hydrophobic pocket mutant proteins of ClpP1 and ClpP2 were used in <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> degradation assays, it emerged that protein substrates were only digested in the presence of wild-type ClpP2, no matter which of the three ATPases was tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref> to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Mutagenesis of the ClpP2 hydrophobic pocket residues resulted in complete inhibition of substrate turnover. In contrast, the corresponding mutations in ClpP1<sub>hp</sub> did not affect protein degradation, and substrate turnover was comparable to the wild-type protein, indicating that the partner Clp-ATPases bind to the heterotetradecamer exclusively via ClpP2. Hence, our data clearly show that ClpP1 and ClpP2 of the heterotetradecameric ClpP core fulfill separate but complementary functions in the degradation process. ClpP1 confers catalytic activity to the complex, while ClpP2 is essential for the necessary interaction with the partner Clp-ATPases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ADEP antibiotics induce oligomerization and proteolytic activation of ClpP1 but not of ClpP2.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> is the producer of the natural product antibiotic ADEP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref>) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and Mazodier and colleagues (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) demonstrated in a previous <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content> cell study that ClpP1 is targeted by this antibiotic. We therefore set out to further investigate the effect of ADEP antibiotics on the Clp system of the producer genus and to characterize the potential deregulation of the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> peptidase and protease activity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> ClpP1 and ClpP2 in the presence of ADEP1. To do so, we first used the fluorogenic dipeptide Suc-Leu-Tyr-aminomethylcoumarin (Suc-LY-AMC) as a substrate in peptidase activity assays and measured the fluorescence signal that results from peptide cleavage and concomitant AMC release. Our results showed that neither ClpP1, ClpP2, nor ClpP1P2 possessed notable peptidase activity in the absence of ADEP1. However, ADEP1 clearly induced the hydrolysis of Suc-LY-AMC by either ClpP1 alone or by the mixed complex ClpP1P2 but not by ClpP2 alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Corroborating our results above, peptidase activity was lost in all assays when ClpP1 was replaced by the active site mutant protein ClpP1<sub>S113A</sub>, while replacing ClpP2 by ClpP2<sub>S131A</sub> had no effect on the activity of mixed complexes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>). A similar result was observed, when Z-GGL-AMC, Ac-WLA-AMC, or Ac-Ala-hArg-2-Aoc-ACC was used as the substrate in peptidase activity assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3D</xref>), although some peptidase activity of ClpP1P2 was notable when using Ac-WLA-AMC in the absence of ADEP1. Probing the binding site, ADEP1 failed to induce peptide hydrolysis when ClpP1 was exchanged by the hydrophobic pocket mutant protein ClpP1<sub>hp</sub>, whereas replacement of ClpP2 by ClpP2<sub>hp</sub> had no effect on substrate hydrolysis by the mixed complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>). These results indicate that ADEP1 interacts with ClpP1, but not with ClpP2. Thermal shift assays confirmed the binding affinity of ClpP1 toward ADEP1, demonstrated by an increase of &#x0003e;16&#x000b0;C in the melting temperature of the homotetradecamer in combination with ADEP1. In contrast, ADEP1 could not increase the melting temperature of ClpP2, hereby confirming that ClpP2 does not interact with ADEP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3E</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S2A</xref>). Such observed asymmetric binding was not restricted to ADEP1 but was also detected for ADEP2 and ADEP4, two synthetic derivatives previously optimized for potent anti-<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> activity (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Uniformly, all tested ADEPs induced peptidase activity via binding to ClpP1 but not to ClpP2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Interestingly, ClpP1P2 exhibited slightly higher peptidase activity when activated by ADEP1, compared to ADEP2 and ADEP4, thereby indicating that the binding of the natural compound ADEP1 to <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP1 may have been evolutionarily optimized. Mixed ClpP1P2, ClpP1P2<sub>S131A</sub>, and ClpP1P2<sub>hp</sub> exhibited superior peptidase activity in the presence of ADEP1 compared to ClpP1 alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>), implying a stimulation of ClpP1 catalytic activity by the interaction with ClpP2. Of note, the presence of ADEP-ClpP1P2 complexes was verified by native PAGE and size exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S2B</xref> to <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="supplementary-material">F</xref>). Similar results were observed in protease activity assays using fluorogenic FITC-casein as a substrate and measuring FITC release upon casein degradation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3G</xref>). In addition, here, ADEP1 induced proteolysis of casein by either ClpP1 alone or by mixed ClpP1P2 but not by ClpP2, and again the mixed complex performed better than ClpP1 alone. Thus, our data reveal that ADEP1 activates the purified and otherwise dormant <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP core to Clp-ATPase-independent peptidase and protease activity by binding to and deregulating the activity of ClpP1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIG&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>ADEP binds to and deregulates ClpP1 but not ClpP2. (A) Chemical structures of the natural product ADEP1 and its synthetic congeners ADEP2 and ADEP4. ADEP1, representing &#x0201c;factor A&#x0201d; of the A54556 antibiotic complex produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> NRRL 15010, consists of a macrolactone core, an aliphatic side chain, and an <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acylphenylalanine linker. Differences in the chemical structures between these ADEP derivatives are indicated in gray. (B to E) Effect of ADEP on the peptidase activity of ClpP1 and ClpP2. Peptidase activity assays using the fluorogenic dipeptide Suc-LY-AMC as the substrate show that in the absence of ADEP1 (DMSO controls), ClpP1 and ClpP2 alone or combined are devoid of peptidase activity. (B) Addition of ADEP1 triggered peptidase activity of ClpP1 alone and, even stronger, of the ClpP1P2 heterocomplex, while ClpP2 alone remained inactive. Peptide hydrolysis was prevented in samples containing the catalytic triad or hydrophobic pocket mutant proteins ClpP1<sub>S113A</sub> or ClpP1<sub>hp</sub>, respectively, but not in the corresponding ClpP2 mutants, thus indicating ADEP1 binding via ClpP1. The slopes of initial degradation rates are shown, normalized in %. (C) Elevated concentrations of ADEP1 (100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M or 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) did not lead to detectable peptidase activity of ClpP2 (4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M). ClpP1 served as a positive control. The slopes of initial degradation rates are shown (normalized in %; ClpP1 activity set to 100%). The right panel is the magnified area near the baseline (<italic toggle="yes">y</italic> axis from &#x02212;0.5% to 1%). ClpP1 activity without ADEP is only 0.15% of the ClpP1 activity in the presence of ADEP. (D) Peptidase assays using the fluorogenic peptide substrates Z-GGL-AMC, Ac-WLA-AMC, and Ac-Ala-hArg-2-Aoc-Acc confirm that peptidase activity is mediated by ClpP1 but not by ClpP2. (E) Thermal shift assays confirmed the binding affinity of ClpP1 toward ADEP1, demonstrated by an increase of 16.27&#x000b0;C in the melting temperature of the homotetradecamer in combination with ADEP1. In contrast, ADEP1 could not increase the melting temperature of ClpP2, hereby confirming that ClpP2 does not interact with ADEP1. (F) Peptidase assays using the derivatives ADEP2 and ADEP4 in comparison to ADEP1. The data indicate that asymmetric binding to ClpP1 is not restricted to ADEP1 but occurs also for ADEP2 and ADEP4. Of note, ClpP1P2 exhibited slightly higher peptidase activity in the presence of ADEP1 compared to ADEP2 and ADEP4. (G) Effect of ADEP1 on the protease activity of ClpP1 and ClpP2 using FITC-casein as a substrate. ADEP1 activated casein degradation by ClpP1 alone and even more by the ClpP1P2 heterocomplex, while ClpP2 alone remained inactive. DMSO was used in control reactions. Mean values (normalized to %) of initial linear reaction kinetics are given. In B to F, error bars represent standard deviations.

ADEP1 triggered the shift of the ClpP1 peak, potentially indicating a transformation from the compressed form of the ClpP1 tetradecamer to its active, extended form, which would explain the independent peptidase and protease activity of ADEP1-activated ClpP1. In contrast, the peak of ClpP2 did neither significantly shift nor form homotetradecamers in the presence of ADEP1. DMSO was used as a control.

Whereas ADEP1 increased the melting temperature of ClpP1 by 16.27&#x000b0;C (&#x000b1;0.97&#x000b0;C), the melting temperature of ClpP2 did not change in the presence of ADEP1 (B) Native PAGE, ClpP:ADEP ratio 1:3. On native PAGE gels, proteins bands with the size of tetradecamers (indicated by an arrow) were only observed in the presence of ADEP1 for samples comprising ClpP1P2 or ClpP1 alone. Immunoblotting using anti-ClpP1 or anti-6His antibodies identified those bands as ClpP1 homotetradecamers. Despite similar ClpP1 concentrations, the band of the ClpP1 homotetradecamer detected in the ADEP-ClpP1P2 sample appeared weaker on the native PAGE gel compared to the ADEP-ClpP1 sample. No protein bands with the size of tetradecamers were observed in the absence of ADEP1. However, immunoblotting using anti-6His antibodies detected heptameric ClpP2 in both samples ClpP1P2 and ClpP2 in the absence and presence ADEP1. (C) Native PAGE, ClpP:ADEP ratio 1:1.25. With the use of decreased ADEP1 concentrations (ADEP1:ClpP1/ClpP2 ratio of 1.25:1), a tetradecamer band in the ClpP1P2 sample was no longer detectable, whereas ClpP1 homotetradecamers were still detected in the ClpP1 sample, although similar ClpP1 concentrations were used in both assays. (D) Cross-linking experiments. In the absence and presence of ADEP1, the addition of the cross-linker BS3 and the complex stabilizing agent sodium citrate led to the detection of ClpP1P2 heterotetradecamers via native PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. Remarkably, larger amounts of ClpP1 homotetradecamers were only detected in the ClpP1 sample in the presence of ADEP1 and absence of ClpP2. (E) Increasing the amount of both ADEP and ClpP, while keeping their ratio constant, improved the detection of the tetradecameric protein band in the ClpP1P2 sample. (F) Size exclusion chromatography of ClpP1P2 and ClpP1 alone and in the presence of ADEP1. Here, tetradecamers were detected in the ADEP-ClpP1P2 sample, which eluted slightly earlier than the tetradecameric fraction in the ADEP-ClpP1 sample. Hence, despite the rather small difference in size of ~18 kDa, the size-exclusion data allow for the differentiation of ADEP-bound ClpP1P2 heterotetradecamers versus and ADEP-bound ClpP1 homotetradecamers. The calculated mass of both ClpP1P2 and ClpP1 complexes, processed (indicated by an asterisk) or unprocessed, are shown. The data are representative of three biological replicates.

Regarding ClpP1, it emerged that the addition of ADEP1 clearly led to a distinct shift of the peak representing a ClpP1 tetradecamer (calculated molecular mass of 305.2&#x02009;kDa), potentially shifting an existing compressed form of the ClpP1 tetradecamer to its active, extended form. In contrast, the elution profile of ClpP2 did not change in the presence of ADEP1, and ClpP2 mainly eluted as heptamers (calculated molecular mass of 182.2&#x02009;kDa) or lower oligomeric species, while ClpP2 tetradecamers (calculated molecular mass of 364.4&#x02009;kDa) were not detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3H</xref>). Hence, our data show that ADEP1 binds to ClpP1 and triggers its oligomerization into catalytically active ClpP1 tetradecamers. This explains the independent peptidase and protease activity of ClpP1 in the presence of ADEP1, while ClpP2 does not appear to interact with ADEP1 under the conditions tested.</p><p>In line with this, it is noteworthy that the ClpP1 and ClpP2 proteins underwent processing reactions in the course of our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> degradation experiments (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic>, processing of ClpP1 relied either on the binding of ClpXP2 or on the binding of ADEP (regardless of ClpP2), while processing of ClpP2 strictly depended on the presence of ClpP1 but not on ClpX or ADEP (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S3A</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>).

(A) ClpP1 and ClpP2 are processed when used in combination and in the presence of ClpX. Processed proteins are marked by colored asterisks (ClpP1*, blue; ClpP2*, green). Processing of ClpP1 depends on activation by Clp-ATPase binding to ClpP2 and is prevented in the hydrophobic patch mutant ClpP2<sub>hp</sub>. In contrast, ClpP2 processing solely depends on heterotetradecamer formation, but not on binding and activation by a Clp-ATPase. (B) ADEP1 induces processing of ClpP1 and accelerates processing of ClpP2. Samples were incubated in the absence or presence of ADEP1 over time. Processing of ClpP1 requires the presence of an activator (here ADEP1). The processing of ClpP1 occurred in samples with mixed ClpP1P2 and more slowly by ClpP1 alone as indicated by blue asterisks. Thus, ADEP, in contrast to a Clp-ATPase, can stimulate ClpP1 processing in the absence of ClpP2. Unlike ClpP1, processing of ClpP2 solely depends on heterotetradecamer formation but not on binding and activation by ADEP1. However, processing of ClpP2 is notably accelerated in the presence of ADEP1. (C) Processing of ClpP1 and ClpP2 depends on the catalytic function of ClpP1.

When analyzing the hydrophobic pockets of ClpP1 and ClpP2, it became apparent that both isoforms differ in the first amino acid residue that was selected for mutation of each ClpP hydrophobic pocket (Y76 in ClpP1 and S94 in ClpP2, see above). Since tyrosine and serine obviously differ regarding their size and physicochemical properties, we hypothesized that this difference may influence the binding capability of ClpP1 versus ClpP2 for ADEP and corresponding Clp-ATPases. We therefore exchanged Y76 of ClpP1 by a serine and, vice versa, S94 of ClpP2 by a tyrosine, thereby yielding the hydrophobic pocket mutant proteins ClpP1<sub>Y76S</sub> and ClpP2<sub>S94Y</sub>. Native PAGE showed that ClpP1<sub>Y76S</sub> was notably impaired in ADEP-induced assembly of homotetradecamers (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S2G</xref>), and consequently, in the presence of ADEP, ClpP1<sub>Y76S</sub>-containing complexes showed substantially decreased peptidase activity compared to wtClpP1 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S2H</xref>), together indicating that the binding of ADEP to ClpP1<sub>Y76S</sub> was impaired. Of note, ClpC1-mediated protease activity of ClpP1<sub>Y76S</sub>P2 was also reduced, suggesting that Y76 may also have a role in Clp protease assembly and/or catalysis. Now, probing ClpP2<sub>S94Y</sub>, protease activity of ClpC1P1P2<sub>S94Y</sub> was significantly reduced, suggesting impaired interaction of ClpC1 with ClpP2<sub>S94Y</sub>. However, the ClpP2<sub>S94Y</sub> mutation did not suffice to make ClpP2 responsive to ADEP (peptidase activity could not be activated by ADEP). Thus, our results clearly indicate that Y76 in ClpP1 and S94 in ClpP2 play crucial roles in conferring the specificity to ADEP versus ClpC1, respectively. However, switching Y76 in ClpP1 and S94 in ClpP2 was not sufficient to switch the individual binding specificities regarding ADEP and ClpC1 entirely, which may be due to the individual protein characteristics of both ClpP1 and ClpP2, e.g., intramolecular bonds, folding characteristics, cavity spacing, and/or further potentially contributing amino acids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cell-based studies corroborate the existence of a heteromeric, asymmetric Clp protease complex in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic>.</title><p>Our study so far employed purified <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> proteins <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> to elucidate the molecular composition and function of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp protease.

The data show that the digestion of PopR by ClpC1P1P2 is accelerated by ADEP1 compared to the DMSO control.

All assays were performed in triplicates and representative SDS-PAGE images are shown. DMSO was used in control reactions. (B) ClpC1-mediated ATPase activity in casein degradation assays. To answer the question of whether the observed increase of Clp-ATPase/ClpP1P2 activity in the presence of ADEP1 was due to more rapid utilization of ATP by the AAA+ ATPases, we directly measured the turnover of ATP to ADP by ClpC1 in casein degradation assays. Here, ATP turnover was not increased in the presence of ADEP (compared to the DMSO control), neither for ClpCP1P2 nor ClpC1 alone. Hence, stimulated ATPase/ClpP1P2 activity in the presence of ADEP1 is most probably unrelated to ATP turnover. Instead, ADEP1 binding may affect the overall structural network of the ClpP1P2 complex, including stabilization in the extended conformation and the adjustment of the active site residues as well as pore opening, as was previously described for ADEP-activated ClpP in other bacteria (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).

The ssrA-tag is a common degron that is recognized by Clp-ATPases and results in the subsequent degradation of the fusion protein by the Clp protease (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The kinetics of GFP-ssrA hydrolysis can be conveniently followed by measuring a decrease in fluorescence (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In line with our previous results, ADEP1 clearly stimulated GFP-ssrA degradation by ClpXP1P2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5B</xref>). Neither ClpP1P2 alone nor ClpX alone, in the absence or presence of ADEP1, could degrade the substrate, demonstrating the strict necessity of a fully assembled Clp protease complex for GFP-ssrA hydrolysis. In our control sample with ClpXP1<sub>S113A</sub>ClpP2<sub>S131A</sub>, we did not detect a decline in relative fluorescence units (RFU), indicating that the drop in RFU, measured for ClpXP1P2, is due to unfolding and cleavage of the substrate. Similarly, ADEP1 notably induced the degradation of FITC-casein by ClpC1P1P2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5C</xref>) and &#x003b2;-casein by ClpC2P1P2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5D</xref>). Drawing this conclusion from experiments with casein, which can serve as a substrate for ADEP-activated as well as Clp-ATPase-activated ClpP1P2, is possible by comparing the degradation rates of the individual complexes. Degradation efficacy was the highest when both activators were present at the same time (forming ADEP-ClpP1P2-Clp-ATPase complexes) and significantly lower (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.0001) for ClpP1P2-Clp-ATPase, ADEP-ClpP1P2, and ADEP-ClpP1 (activity decreasing in that order; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5C</xref> to <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). The fact that ADEP addition to the ClpP1P2-Clp-ATPase complex further stimulated casein proteolysis speaks against the significant formation of the less active ADEP-only complexes. Further noteworthy, the stimulated Clp-ATPase/ClpP1P2 activity in the presence of ADEP was not due to an increased ATP turnover, since the conversion of ATP to ADP was unchanged in ClpC1-mediated casein degradation assays in the absence and presence of ADEP (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S6B</xref>). In summary, our data clearly show that ADEP1 accelerates the Clp-ATPase-driven degradation of protein substrates by the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> housekeeping Clp protease.</p><p>Further noteworthy, under these conditions and after &#x003b2;-casein had been fully digested, ClpC2 was slowly degraded as well (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5D</xref>).

Such vast biosynthetic capacity of streptomycetes, which is accompanied by a complex developmental life cycle, clearly requires tight regulation and coordination of the involved processes. Regulated proteolysis has emerged as an important level of regulation that is intricately linked to cell cycle progression and physiological transitions (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We aimed to study the molecular function of the housekeeping <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp protease machinery, an essential compartmentalized protease in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> and a major player of regulated proteolysis in bacteria (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp system is one of the most complex known to date, since streptomycetes encode up to five different ClpP homologs and at least four different Clp-ATPases (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Previous work by Mazodier and colleagues on <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content> cells provided the first important insights into the potential working mode of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp protease (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). They observed that the presence of ClpP1 and ClpP2 precluded the expression of ClpP3 and ClpP4 and that the presence of both ClpP1 and ClpP2 was necessary for the digestion of PopR or ClgR. Hence, their data suggested the presence of housekeeping Clp proteases with one or more proteolytic cores, consisting of either ClpP1, ClpP2, or even both homologs, as well as a back-up conferred by ClpP3 and/or ClpP4 that takes over the most important cellular functions in case of a dysfunction of the housekeeping Clp machinery.</p><p>Almost two decades later, we have now deciphered the composition and molecular operation mode of the housekeeping Clp protease in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> via <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> reconstitution of the protease system side-by-side with corresponding cell-based studies. Here, we prove that the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> housekeeping Clp protease contains a heterotetradecameric, proteolytic core of both ClpP1 and ClpP2 that interacts with the corresponding Clp-ATPases ClpX, ClpC1, or ClpC2 for the degradation of proteins, such as the natural Clp substrates ClgR and PopR. Within the assembled Clp protease variants, we show that ClpP1 and ClpP2 fulfill distinct but complementary functions with regard to substrate hydrolysis. Our results clearly indicate that mainly ClpP1 confers catalytic activity to the proteolytic core, while ClpP2 is essential for the interaction with the corresponding Clp-ATPases to allow for substrate unfolding and translocation into the degradation chamber of ClpP1P2.</p><p>Our data further indicate that the heteromeric ClpP1P2 core is formed by two separate homoheptameric rings of either ClpP1 or ClpP2. Functional Clp-ATPases are hexamers, and all six IGF-loops of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ClpX (EcClpX) are required for productive substrate digestion by EcClpXP (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In that study, even the loss of a single IGF-loop reduced the affinity of EcClpX to EcClpP by approximately 50-fold. In the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP1P2 core, the mutation of the ClpP1 hydrophobic pocket did not affect the hydrolysis of native substrates at all, which clearly argues against the presence of even a single ClpP1 monomer in the Clp-ATPase-interacting ClpP2 ring. In addition, both <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP1 as well as ClpP2 exist as homoheptamers (as well as homotetradecamers for ClpP1) as revealed by size exclusion chromatography in our study, making the presence of mixed heptamers in the active protease highly unlikely. The presence of two homoheptameric rings of either ClpP1 or ClpP2 in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> further correlates with the composition of the ClpP system in the closely related <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium smegmatis</named-content> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) as well as <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), which form heterotetradecamers composed of a ClpP1 heptamer stacked to a ClpP2 heptamer and those complexes bind Clp-ATPases solely via ClpP2.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> is the producer of the ClpP-interfering antibiotic ADEP1, the natural product progenitor of a promising class of potent acyldepsipeptide antibiotics (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and the ADEP mode of action has been investigated in more detail in the major target bacteria. Until now, the effects of ADEP on the housekeeping Clp protease of the producer genus <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> have remained mostly elusive. Pioneering cell-based studies by Mazodier and colleagues (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) using the ADEP-sensitive <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content> showed that ClpP1 is a target for ADEP1, since the deletion of the <italic toggle="yes">clpP1</italic> gene conferred ADEP resistance in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content>. In addition, we have recently reported on the presence of a self-resistance factor in the ADEP producer <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> NRRL 15010, which is an accessory ClpP protein with a yet unknown mechanism (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). To obtain further insights into the role of ADEP in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic>, we here investigated the effect of ADEP on the molecular function of the housekeeping Clp protease systems of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content>. Of note, the ClpP1 and ClpP2 proteins of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> show very high amino acid sequence similarities to their corresponding homologs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content>, thus suggesting a similar operation mode of ClpP1P2 in both species (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.&#x000a0;S1D</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies on the mode of action of ADEP antibiotics have identified two distinct molecular mechanisms that, either together or individually, lead to bacterial killing. Intriguingly, the killing mode depends on the bacterial species and growth environment, and both mechanisms are described as follows. First, since Clp-ATPases and ADEP accommodate the same binding site on ClpP in the species studied so far, the binding of ADEP to ClpP displaces the commonly associated Clp-ATPases from the proteolytic core (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This leads to an inhibition of all physiological functions of the Clp protease in the bacterial cell, including regulated proteolysis. Second, ADEP binding induces an opening of the ClpP entrance pores and allosterically activates the catalytic centers, thereby allowing access of nonnative substrates to the ClpP degradation chamber that are efficiently degraded (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The latter activation of the independent proteolytic core ClpP is the primary cause of bacterial killing in species harboring nonessential ClpP proteins, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, in an infection situation, where the Clp protease is essential for the expression of important virulence factors, inhibition of the natural functions will also attenuate a pathogen in the host environment (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). In <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content>, the Clp protease is essential for viability under all conditions (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and we have previously shown that an ADEP-conferred mechanism of Clp protease inhibition leads to cell death in mycobacteria (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Considering the essentiality of the Clp protease in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> and the comparative phylogenetic closeness to mycobacteria (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), it was thus tempting to hypothesize a mechanism of Clp protease inhibition as the basis of ADEP-dependent killing of <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic>. To our surprise, ADEP did not abrogate the Clp-ATPase-mediated substrate digestion. All our data consistently show that the presence of ADEP leads to an unexpected stimulation of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp protease to digest its natural substrates in a Clp-ATPase-dependent, more efficient manner, rather than leading to an inhibition of its natural functions. Furthermore, ADEP-stimulated Clp-ATPase/ClpP1P2 activity was not due to an increased ATP turnover. Hence, stimulation may be solely attributed to the ADEP effects that are exerted on the structural network of the entire ClpP1P2 complex. This may include adjustment of the active site residues in ClpP1 as well as pore opening for ClpP1 and ClpP2, as was previously described for ADEP-activated ClpP in other bacteria (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Therefore, the current study reveals a third, yet unobserved, mode of ADEP action.</p><p>This new ADEP effect observed here can be explained by our observation that, in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic>, the proteolytic ClpP1P2 core can be powered simultaneously by two different activator types. We found ADEP to bind solely to ClpP1 of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content>. Very recently, asymmetric binding of ADEP to ClpP1 was also observed for ClpP1P2 heterotetradecamers of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptomyces cattleya</named-content> (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) suggesting that this binding mode is a general characteristic of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic>. Furthermore, our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and cell-based data consistently reveal that the ClpP2 apical face of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP1P2 core serves as the sole docking site for three different Clp-ATPases. The simultaneous and unhindered binding of ADEP and a Clp-ATPase to opposite sides of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP core is unique among all the Clp systems investigated so far.</p><p>Considering previous studies on ClpP proteins from other bacteria and the effects of ADEP antibiotics, structural analyses identified three different conformations of the ClpP tetradecamer: a proteolytically active, extended conformation, an inactive, compact intermediate, and an inactive, compressed conformation. The conformations all differ in the height of the ClpP barrel as well as the alignment of the catalytic triad residues (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref><xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The Clp protease core is understood to dynamically switch between these different conformations, thereby exhibiting separate steps of substrate hydrolysis and product release during processive substrate degradation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Here, degradation products might exit the degradation chamber through transient equatorial pores that emerge in the proteolytically inactive, compressed conformation rather than through the axial pores that may be blocked by the partner Clp-ATPases (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Importantly, we and others have previously shown that the binding of ADEP to ClpP leads to long-distance conformational changes, thereby opening the entrance pores to the degradation chamber and locking the ClpP tetradecamer in the active, extended conformation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In our current study, binding of ADEP1 led to the presence of proteolytically active ClpP1 homotetradecamers, potentially shifting ClpP1 homotetradecamers from the compressed, inactive conformation to the extended, active conformation. Also, ADEP binding stimulated proteolysis by ClpP1P2<sub>hp</sub> heterotetradecamers carrying a defective ClpP2 hydrophobic pocket.</p><p>Both findings clearly indicate the capacity of ADEP1 to open the entrance pores to the degradation chamber by docking to <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP1, since this is a prerequisite for the entry of protein substrates and subsequent protein digestion (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We therefore propose the following model of ADEP action in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>): the partner Clp-ATPase binds to the ClpP1P2 proteolytic core via ClpP2 and unfolds and feeds the natural protein substrates into the degradation chamber. The simultaneous binding of ADEP to the opposite side of the proteolytic core via ClpP1 stabilizes the core in the proteolytically active, extended conformation (including the correct arrangement of the active centers for catalysis) and stimulates the proteolysis of natural Clp substrates that are fed by the Clp-ATPase via ClpP2. This process may be further accelerated by a more efficient product release through an opened pore of the ADEP-bound ClpP1 heptamer of the proteolytically active tetradecameric core. We have previously shown that ADEP-activated EcClpP degrades largely unstructured proteins like casein with reduced processivity compared to EcClpAP (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). This may be explained by the diffusion of partially cleaved substrates through the opened axial pores in ADEP-activated EcClpP, thereby impeding processive cleavage, whereas such escape of degradation intermediates is prevented in EcClpAP (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, in our model for the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp protease, Clp-ATPase-dependent processive cleavage would be allowed even in the presence of ADEP, potentially stimulating the degradation of natural Clp substrates. In the closely related <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content>, ADEP binds to only one side of the ClpP heterotetradecamer exclusively (i.e., to MtClpP2) but was shown in crystal structures to open the entrance pores on both sides of the barrel (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Thus, it may be further hypothesized that upon binding of ADEP to <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP1, long-distance conformational shifts might help to widen the diameter of the ClpP2 axial pore, which could additionally ease the feeding of proteins substrates by the Clp-ATPase.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIG&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Mechanisms of action of ADEP antibiotics in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> and other bacteria.

By binding to the ClpP1P2 proteolytic core via ClpP2, the Clp-ATPases unfold and feed natural protein substrates into the degradation chamber in an ATP-dependent manner. Simultaneous binding of ADEP can occur at the opposite side of the proteolytic core via ClpP1, which locks the core in the proteolytically active extended conformation and stimulates the proteolysis of natural Clp substrates that are fed by a Clp-ATPase via ClpP2. Binding of the antibiotic to ClpP1 also widens the ClpP1 entrance pore to allow entry of nonnative substrates into the ClpP1P2 heterotetradecamer. In addition, ADEP triggers the oligomerization of ClpP1 into a homotetradecamer, which is thereby activated for Clp-ATPase-independent proteolysis of nonnative substrates. As the presence of ClpP1 alone (i.e., in the absence of ClpP2) is sufficient to sensitize <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> against ADEP, the degradation of nonnative protein and polypeptide substrates is the primary reason for cell death in this species. Nonetheless, while the physiological protein substrates of the Clp protease can still be degraded in the presence of ADEP, accelerated degradation of native substrates will probably also stress the cells through protein imbalance. (B) Summary of mechanisms of action of ADEP antibiotics across different bacterial species. We have previously described that ADEP antibiotics can lead to the inhibition of natural Clp protease functions (1) as well as to the uncontrolled degradation on nonnatural Clp substrates in the absence of otherwise regulating Clp-ATPases (2). We here present a third, new mechanism of ADEP action that manifests in the producer genus <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> and leads to the acceleration of the Clp-ATPase-dependent digestion of natural Clp protease substrates (3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbio.01413-22-f006" position="anchor"/></fig><p>Indeed, our results clearly indicate the existence of an inherent communication network between the ClpP1 and ClpP2 heptameric rings of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> ClpP barrel. For example, the binding of a Clp-ATPase to ClpP2 led to catalytic stimulation of ClpP1, potentially implying an allosteric activation mechanism for ClpP1 upon concerted conformational rearrangements in both heptameric rings. In addition, self-processing of ClpP1 was induced by the binding of ClpX to ClpP2 at the opposite side of the heteromeric complex <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Inter-ring communication is not unusual among Clp proteases studied to date (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref><xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). For example, Weber-Ban and colleagues (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>) showed that in asymmetric <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ClpP tetradecamers, composed of one wild-type and one catalytically inactive heptameric ring, ClpA-ATPase activity could be stimulated by ClpP regardless of whether ClpA bound to the wild-type or the catalytically inactive ring. Recently, it has also been shown that the presence of catalytically active ClpP proteins is required to activate ClpA. This happens through an allosteric signal across the ClpA-ClpP interaction surface (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>).</p><p>The results presented in this study unravel the composition and molecular operation mode of the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> housekeeping Clp protease machinery as well as its unique stimulation by ADEP antibiotics. The protein imbalance upon enhanced degradation of natural Clp substrates can be expected to cause severe cellular stress. However, the ADEP-mediated catalytic acceleration of the Clp-ATPase-controlled digestion of natural Clp substrates is not the only kind of deregulation that ADEP inflicts on the <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> Clp protease machinery. The efficient degradation of casein by the ADEP-bound ClpP1P2 heterotetradecamer and ClpP1 homotetradecamer shows that nonnative substrates gain access to both ADEP-activated proteolytic cores, via the opened entrance pore of the ClpP1 heptameric ring. Also, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. lividans</named-content> mutants carrying ClpP1 but lacking ClpP2 were killed by ADEP application. This illustrates that Clp-ATPase-independent and thus uncontrolled proteolysis of essential and nonessential polypeptide or protein substrates is already sufficient to cause cell death in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of plasmids for protein expression.</title><p>Plasmids for the expression of <italic toggle="yes">clp</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">clgR</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">popR</italic> genes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. hawaiiensis</named-content> NRRL 15010 were obtained by ligating PCR-amplified gene sequences with linearized pET11a or pET22b vectors (Merck-Novagen), respectively.

However, during sequence analysis of ClpP2, a second putative start codon was detected, which would give rise to a shortened protein (ClpP2<sub>ATG2</sub>). To ensure that ClpP2<sub>ATG2</sub> would behave similarly compared to full-length ClpP2, we also cloned and purified ClpP2<sub>ATG2</sub>, determined its processing site, and performed degradation experiments using ClpP2 and ClpP2<sub>ATG2</sub> side by side.
