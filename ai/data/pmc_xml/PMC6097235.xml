The post-genomics era has brought a renaissance in natural product discovery using synthetic biology tools<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. However, compared to traditional bioactivity-guided approaches, genome mining of natural products with specific and potent biological activities remains challenging<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Here we present the discovery and validation of a highly potent herbicide lead that targets a critical metabolic enzyme that is required for plant survival. Our approach is based on the coclustering of a self-resistance gene in the natural product biosynthetic gene cluster<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, which serves as a window to potential biological activity of the encoded compound. We targeted dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthetic pathway in plants, the last step in this pathway often targeted for herbicide development<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. We showed the fungal sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid (AA) discovered using this method is a submicromolar inhibitor of DHAD and is effective as an herbicide in spray applications. The self-resistance gene <italic>astD</italic> was validated to be insensitive to AA and was deployed as a transgene in establishment of plants that are resistant to AA. This herbicide-resistance gene combination complements urgent efforts in overcoming weed resistance<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Our discovery demonstrates the potential of using a resistance-gene directed approach in mining of bioactive natural products.</p><p id="P2">Weeds are a major source of crop losses, and the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds has led to an urgent need for new herbicides with novel modes of action<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The BCAAs biosynthetic pathway is essential for plant growth<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. It is not present in animals and is therefore a validated target for highly specific weed control agents<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The BCAA biosynthetic pathway in plants is carried out by three enzymes: acetolactate synthase (ALS), acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (KARI), and DHAD (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Given the success of targeting ALS for herbicide development<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, it is surprising that no herbicide that targets either of the other two enzymes has been developed. DHAD which catalyzes &#x003b2;-dehydration reactions to yield &#x003b1;-keto acid precursors to isoleucine, valine and leucine, is an essential and highly conserved enzyme among plant species<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Efforts toward synthetic DHAD inhibitors resulted in compounds with submicromolar <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>; however, the compounds have no <italic>in planta</italic> activity<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Filamentous fungi are prolific producers of natural products (NPs), many of which have biological activities that aid the fungi in colonizing and killing plants<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, fungal NPs represent a promising source of potential leads for herbicides. The abundance of sequenced fungal genomes enables genome mining of new NPs with novel biological activities<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Although no NP inhibitors of DHAD are known to date, we reason a fungal NP with this property might exist, given the indispensable role of BCAA biosynthesis in plants<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To identify NP biosynthetic gene clusters that may encode a DHAD inhibitor, we hypothesized that such cluster must contain an additional copy of DHAD that is insensitive to the inhibitor, thereby providing the required self-resistance for the producing organism to survive. The presence of a gene encoding a self-resistance enzyme is frequently found in microbial NP gene clusters, as highlighted by the presence of an insensitive copy of HMGR or IMPDH in the gene clusters for lovastatin (that targets HMGR) or mycophenolic acid (that targets IMPDH), respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This phenomenon has been used to predict molecular targets of NPs, as well as to identify gene clusters of NPs of known activities<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">To identify possible self-resistance enzymes, we scanned sequenced fungal genomes to search for colocalizations of genes encoding DHAD with core biosynthetic enzymes, such as terpene cyclases, polyketide synthases, etc<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We identified a well-conserved set of four genes across multiple fungal genomes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), including the common soil fungus <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> that is best known to produce lovastatin. The conserved gene clusters include genes that encode a sesquiterpene cyclase homolog (<italic>astA</italic>), two cytochrome P450s (<italic>astB</italic> and <italic>astC</italic>), and a homolog of DHAD (<italic>astD</italic>). Genes outside of this cluster are not conserved across the identified genomes and are hence unlikely to be involved in NP biosynthesis. AstD is the second copy of DHAD encoded in the genome, and is ~70% similar to the housekeeping copy that is well-conserved across fungi (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, AstD is potentially a self-resistance enzyme that confers resistance to the encoded NP. Like a majority of biosynthetic gene clusters in sequenced fungal genomes, the <italic>ast</italic> cluster has not been associated with the production of a known NP<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To identify the NP encoded by the <italic>ast</italic> cluster, we heterologously expressed <italic>astA, astB,</italic> and <italic>astC</italic> genes in the host <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RC01<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. New compounds that emerged were purified and their structures were elucidated with NMR spectroscopy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). RC01 expressing only <italic>astA</italic> produced a new sesquiterpene (<bold>1</bold>), which was confirmed to be (&#x02212;)-daucane (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). RC01 expressing both <italic>astA</italic> and <italic>astB</italic> led to the biosynthesis of a new product that was structurally determined to be the &#x003b1;-epoxy carboxylate (<bold>2</bold>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). When <italic>astA</italic>, <italic>astB</italic> and <italic>astC</italic> were expressed together, a new compound (<bold>3</bold>) became the dominant product (~ 20 mg/L). Full structural determination revealed the compound to be the tricyclic aspterric acid (<bold>AA</bold>), which is a previously isolated compound (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. The biosynthetic pathway for <bold>AA</bold> is therefore concise: following cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate by AstA to create the carbon skeleton in <bold>1</bold>, AstB catalyzes oxidation of <bold>1</bold> to yield the epoxide <bold>2.</bold> Further oxidation by AstC at carbon 15 yields an alcohol, which can undergo intramolecular epoxide opening to create <bold>AA</bold> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Upon its initial discovery, <bold>AA</bold> was shown to have inhibitory activity towards <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> however, the mode of action was not known<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Our resistance-gene directed approach led to rediscovery of this compound with DHAD as a potential target. We first confirmed that <bold>AA</bold> is able to potently inhibit <italic>A. thaliana</italic> growth in an agar-based assay (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). <bold>AA</bold> was also an effective inhibitor of root development and plant growth when applied to a representative monocot (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) and dicot (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). To test if <bold>AA</bold> indeed targets DHAD, we expressed and purified housekeeping DHAD from both <italic>A. terreus</italic> (XP_001208445.1, fDHAD) and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (AT3G23940, pDHAD), as well as the putative self-resistance enzyme AstD (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Both housekeeping DHAD enzymes converted dihydroxyisovalerate to ketoisovalerate (pDHAD: <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 1.2 sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> = 5.7 mM) as expected. The enzyme activities, however, were inhibited in the presence of <bold>AA</bold> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> values of <bold>AA</bold> towards fDHAD and pDHAD were 0.31 &#x003bc;M and 0.50 &#x003bc;M at an enzyme concentration of 0.50 &#x003bc;M, respectively (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). <bold>AA</bold> was further determined to be a competitive inhibitor of pDHAD with a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 0.30 &#x003bc;M (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). <bold>AA</bold> displayed no significant cytotoxicity towards human cell lines up to 500 &#x003bc;M concentration, consistent with the lack of DHAD in mammalian cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P8">AstD catalyzes the identical &#x003b2;-dehydration reaction as DHAD, albeit with a significantly more sluggish turnover rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 0.03 sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> = 5.4 mM). However, the enzyme was not inhibited by <bold>AA</bold>, even at the solubility limit of 8 mM (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). To determine if AstD can confer resistance to <bold>AA</bold>-sensitive strains, we developed a yeast based assay. The genome copy of DHAD encoded by <italic>ILV3</italic> was first deleted from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain DHY <italic>&#x00394;URA3</italic>, which resulted in an auxotroph that requires exogenous addition of Ile, Leu and Val to grow. We then introduced either <italic>fDHAD</italic> or <italic>astD</italic> episomally, both of which allowed the strain to grow in the absence of the three BCAAs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). However, yeast expressing fDHAD was approximately 100 times more sensitive to <bold>AA</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> of 2 &#x003bc;M) compared to yeast expressing AstD (IC<sub>50</sub> of 200 &#x003bc;M) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Collectively, the biochemical and genetic assays validated <bold>AA</bold> as the first natural product inhibitor of fungal and plant DHAD; and AstD serves as the self-resistance enzyme in the <italic>ast</italic> biosynthetic gene cluster.</p><p id="P9">The (<italic>R</italic>)-&#x003b1;-hydroxyacid and (<italic>R</italic>)-configured &#x003b2;-ether oxygen moieties in <bold>AA</bold> mimic the (<italic>2R, 3R</italic>)-dihydroxy groups present in natural substrates such as dihydroxyisovalerate. The &#x003b2;-ether oxygen in <bold>AA</bold> is in position to coordinate to the 2Fe-2S cluster that is a required cofactor in both fungal and plant DHAD<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. To understand potential <bold>AA</bold> mechanism of action, we determined the crystal structure (2.11 &#x000c5;) of the pDHAD complexed with 2Fe-2S cluster (<italic>holo-</italic>pDHAD) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>, and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). We identified a binding chamber at the homodimer interface, similar to that found in the <italic>holo</italic> bacterial L-arabinonate dehydratase<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The interior of the chamber is positively charged (2Fe-2S and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) while the entrance is lined with hydrophobic residues. The modeled binding mode of &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-dihydroxyisovalerate and <bold>AA</bold> predicted by computational docking are shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>. The pocket is sufficiently spacious to accommodate the bulkier <bold>AA</bold>, and provide stronger hydrophobic interactions than the native substrate with a 5.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 kcal/mol gain in binding energy (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Base on the <italic>holo-</italic>pDHAD structure, we constructed a homology model of AstD to determine potential mechanism of resistance (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Comparison of pDHAD and the modeled AstD structures shows that while most of the residues in the catalytic chamber are conserved, the hydrophobic region at the entrance to the reactive chamber in AstD is more constricted as a result of two amino acid substitutions (V496L and I177L). Narrowing of the entrance could therefore sterically exclude the bulkier <bold>AA</bold> from binding in the active site, while the smaller, natural substrates are still able to enter the chamber.</p><p id="P10">To explore the potential of <bold>AA</bold> as an herbicide, we performed spray treatment of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> with <bold>AA</bold>. We added <bold>AA</bold> into a commercial glufosinate formulation known as Finale&#x000ae; at a final <bold>AA</bold> concentration of 250 &#x003bc;M<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We then sprayed <bold>AA</bold> solution onto glufosinate resistant <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Finale&#x000ae; alone had no observable inhibitory effects on plant growth, but adding <bold>AA</bold> severely inhibited plant growth (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). In addition, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants treated with <bold>AA</bold> before flowering failed to form normal pollen, which was also observed previously<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We found that the pistil of treated plants could still be successfully pollinated using healthy pollen from the untreated <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> indicating that <bold>AA</bold> preferentially affects pollen but not egg formation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref> and <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). This effect was also observed with a lower concentration of <bold>AA</bold> (100 &#x003bc;M). Thus, in addition to its herbicidal properties, <bold>AA</bold> could potentially be used as a chemical hybridization agent for hybrid seed production<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">We next investigated whether plants expressing <italic>astD</italic> are resistant to <bold>AA</bold>. This was motivated by the successful combination of glyphosate and genetically modified crops that are selectively resistant to glyphosate (Roundup Ready&#x000ae;)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The <italic>A. terreus astD</italic> gene was codon optimized and the <italic>N</italic>-terminus was fused to a chloroplast localization signal derived from pDHAD. Wild type or <italic>astD</italic> transgene-expressing <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was then grown on media that contained 100 &#x003bc;M <bold>AA</bold>. In the presence of <bold>AA</bold>, the growth of wild-type plants was strongly inhibited, and arrested at the cotyledon stage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, the growth of <italic>astD</italic> transgenic plants was relatively unaffected by <bold>AA</bold>, as indicated by the normally expanded rosette leaves, elongated roots, and whole plant fresh weight (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). The expression of AstD was verified by western blot (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). A spray assay was also performed using T2 <italic>astD</italic> transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants, which showed no observable growth defects under such treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In contrast, the control plants carrying the empty vector showed a strong growth inhibitory phenotype when treated with <bold>AA</bold> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Quantitative measurements of plant height showed AstD effectively confers <bold>AA</bold> resistance to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In summary, resistance-gene directed discovery of NPs in the fungus <italic>A. terreus</italic> led to the discovery of a natural herbicide <bold>AA</bold> and the determination of its mode of action. In addition, introducing <italic>astD</italic> as a transgene or editing the sequence of the plant DHAD endogenous gene could be used to create <bold>AA-</bold>resistant crops.

Cubic boxes centered on the ligand mass center with a radius 8 &#x000c5; for all ligands defined the docking binding regions. Flexible ligand docking was executed for all structures. Ten poses per ligand out of 20,000 were included in the post-docking energy minimization. The best scored pose for the ligand was chosen as the initial structure for further study. The MM/GBSA method was introduced to evaluate the ligand binding affinity based on the best scored docking pose in Schrodinger software.

Both of native substrate &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-dihydroxyisovalerate and <bold>AA</bold> were docked into the catalytic site of pDHAD. The cross-section electrostatic surface map shows this unique catalytic pocket has a positively charged internal and a hydrophobic entrance, which binds to negatively charged &#x0201c;head&#x0201d; and hydrophobic &#x0201c;tail&#x0201d; of substrate or <bold>AA</bold> respectively. Thus the negatively charged &#x0201c;head&#x0201d; can lead both of the substrate and <bold>AA</bold> into the catalytic chamber. The bulky hydrophobic tricyclic moiety of <bold>AA</bold>, however, provides stronger hydrophobic interactions to the entrance and blocks the entrance of active site due to the hydrophobic residues at the entrance, including G68, A71, I72, I134, A133, M141, V212, F215, M498 and P501. In contrast, the smaller &#x0201c;tail&#x0201d; of native substrate provides less interactions to entrance because the smaller size limits efficient hydrophobic contact to nearby residues. This implies that once <bold>AA</bold> binds to pDHAD, it can prevent substrate approaching the active site. We also introduced molecular mechanics generalized Born and surface area (MM/GBSA) continuum solvation method, an widely used approach for relative binding energy calculation, to evaluate the relative binding affinity for both ligands<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.
