Cercosporin has almost universal toxicity to cells due to its production of reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen. For that reason, <italic>Cercospora</italic> species, which are highly resistant to their own toxin, are good candidates to identify genes for resistance to cercosporin and to the reactive oxygen species it produces. In previous research, the zinc cluster transcription factor <italic>CRG</italic>1 (<italic>c</italic>ercosporin <italic>r</italic>esistance <italic>g</italic>ene 1) was found to be crucial for <italic>Cercospora</italic> species&#x02019; resistance against cercosporin, and subtractive hybridization analysis identified 185 genes differentially expressed between <italic>Cercospora nicotianae</italic> wild type (wt) and a <italic>crg1</italic> mutant. The focus of this work was to identify and characterize the hypothetical proteins that were identified in the <italic>Cercospora nicotianae</italic> subtractive library as potential resistance factors. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the 20 genes encoding hypothetical proteins showed that two, <italic>24cF</italic> and <italic>71cR</italic>, were induced under conditions of cercosporin toxicity, suggesting a role in resistance. Transformation and expression of <italic>24cF</italic> and <italic>71cR</italic> in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus, <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, showed that <italic>71cR</italic> provided increased resistance to cercosporin toxicity, whereas no significant increase was observed in <italic>24cF</italic> transformants. Gene disruption was used to generate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae 71cR</italic> mutants; these mutants did not differ from wt <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> in cercosporin resistance or production. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed induction of other resistance genes in the <italic>71cR</italic> mutant that may compensate for the loss of 71cR. Analysis of 71cR conserved domains and secondary and tertiary structure identify the protein as having an NTF2-like superfamily DUF1348 domain with unknown function, to be intracellular and localized in the cytosol, and to have similarities to proteins in the steroid delta-isomerase family.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by US-Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund through the USDA cooperative agreement# 58-3148-1-161, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/dsc/egypt/index.htm">http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/dsc/egypt/index.htm</ext-link>.

One of the reasons for the success of these pathogens is their production of cercosporin, a photoactivated perylenequinone toxin [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mutants deficient in cercosporin production are significantly less virulent on their host plants, thus engineering cercosporin-resistant crop plants via expression of cercosporin resistance genes may be an ecologically friendly method for controlling these damaging diseases.</p><p>Our work has focused on identifying cercosporin-autoresistance genes from <italic>Cercospora</italic> species, as cercosporin is almost universally toxic to cells due to its production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the light, cercosporin is converted to an energetically activated triplet state, which reacts with oxygen, generating ROS including singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), a highly toxic species of ROS. Unlike free-radical forms of ROS that are components of cellular metabolism and for which defense mechanisms are understood, cellular resistance to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is not well characterized [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and cercosporin is toxic to mice, bacteria, and many fungi in addition to host and non-host plants. During disease development, production of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and other ROS leads to peroxidation of cell membrane lipids in host plants and can also damage nucleic acids, proteins and lipids in the target cells [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Cercospora</italic> fungi are immune to cercosporin toxicity, thus they may be a source of genes for engineering crop resistance [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and also serve as a model for understanding cellular resistance to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Characterization of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> mutants selected for sensitivity to cercosporin [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] led to the discovery of the zinc cluster transcription factor <italic>CRG</italic>1 (<italic>c</italic>ercosporin <italic>r</italic>esistance <italic>g</italic>ene 1) [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] required for autoresistance to cercosporin. To identify putative resistance genes, a subtractive cDNA library was generated between the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> wild type and a <italic>crg1</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. From the library, 185 differentially regulated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found that are candidate resistance genes. The ESTs were classified into functional categories based on their homology to known sequences. These functional categories include ones known to be involved in cercosporin resistance including reductases [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], antioxidants and quenchers of ROS [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and membrane transporters [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several of the library genes have been characterized for their role in cercosporin resistance. For example, two genes encoding transporters in the library, <italic>CnATR1</italic> and <italic>CnCFP</italic>, were determined to have an important role in resistance [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as disruption of either of these genes in <italic>Cercospora</italic> species caused the disruptant strains to be sensitive to cercosporin. In addition, tobacco transformed to express CFP showed significantly reduced lesion size after inoculation with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic>, confirming a role in resistance and suggesting that CFP might be useful for engineering plants for disease resistance [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the case of ROS quenchers, vitamin B6 was shown to quench <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and be involved in defense against cercosporin [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies to engineer tobacco to constitutively express <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> B6 biosynthetic genes (PDX1 and PDX2), however, resulted in no statistically significant increase in levels of the B6 vitamers, due to heavy regulation of these genes in plants [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although antioxidants have been implicated in cercosporin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a recent study of a gene encoding glutathione S-transferase from the library failed to demonstrate a link with cercosporin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In addition to genes that were categorized into defined functional categories, the library contains genes encoding hypothetical proteins whose functions are not yet characterized. Most studies of cellular resistance to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> have been done with photosynthetic organisms, as <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is a byproduct of photosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, a model for studies of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> resistance, resistance is associated with protein synthesis and turnover, amino acid metabolism, and glutathione-dependent and&#x02013;independent detoxification pathways, among others [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A recent study comparing putative resistance genes from our <italic>Cercospora</italic> subtractive library with orthologs identified in transcriptional studies of <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>
<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> resistance, however, showed little commonality between the two species [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus <italic>Cercospora</italic> fungi must have unique mechanisms not common to photosynthetic organisms. We thus chose to investigate the library genes encoding hypothetical proteins as possible novel sources of cercosporin and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Culture conditions, fungal strains, and plasmids</title><p>Potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco, Sparks, MD) was used for growth and maintenance of all <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> strains including the wild type (wt) strain ATCC18366. <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> strains including the wt strain ORS-6a (Fungal Genetics Stock Center) were grown on Vogel&#x02019;s medium [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>DNA plasmid isolation, cloning, and ligation used standard molecular techniques [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. iProof High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase from Bio-Rad Laboratories and OneTaq&#x000ae; DNA Polymerase from New England Biosciences were used along with the gene-specific primers (Tables <xref rid="pone.0140676.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0140676.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) for standard PCR work.

The pocket multiplicity value predicted for steroid binding is 74, and we compared it to the pocket multiplicity of a known steroid delta-isomerase (Accession number: P07445); its pocket multiplicity was also 74, providing high support for 71cR binding to steroids.

This analysis predicts that the PFL_3262 tertiary structure aligns most closely with steroid delta-isomerase proteins, with z values of 14.1&#x02013;15.4. This finding suggests that 71cR orthologs are most similar to steroid delta-isomerase proteins, a finding consistent with the Raptor software&#x02019;s prediction of steroid binding. To further investigate this association, we re-ran the analysis with a known steroid delta-isomerase protein (Accession number: 3t8n). Z-scores between the steroid delta-isomerase protein (3t8n) and other steroid delta-isomerase proteins were higher, in the range of 20.4&#x02013;25.7.

Among this list are three transporters, ATR1, ATR2 and CFP, that have been shown to have a role in resistance [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this paper, we characterized genes in the library encoding hypothetical proteins. These were of particular interest to us, as resistance to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is poorly understood. To understand putative functions of the proteins encoded by the genes, the EST sequences were blasted against the NCBI protein database. Most of the ESTs aligned with orthologs with high similarity, however all of the orthologs identified encode proteins of unknown function. We then used the full length sequences of the closest orthologs to identify functional domains (<xref rid="pone.0140676.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The results revealed diverse functional domains, most of which do not correspond to known mechanisms of cercosporin or <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> resistance.</p><p>To test the possible role of these hypothetical proteins in cercosporin resistance, we assayed for changes in gene expression when the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> cercosporin-sensitive <italic>atr1</italic> transporter mutant was exposed to cercosporin toxicity. This mutant is sensitive due to a mutation in the ATR1 transporter involved in transport of cercosporin out of the cell [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and has been used previously to identify genes that are upregulated under conditions of cercosporin toxicity and impart cercosporin resistance when expressed in sensitive fungi [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Only two of the 20 hypothetical protein-encoding genes, <italic>24cF</italic> and <italic>71cR</italic>, were significantly up-regulated. These results led us to further characterize them for a possible role in resistance.</p><p>To test the ability of these genes to increase cercosporin resistance, the cercosporin-sensitive fungus <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> was transformed with the complete gene sequences of <italic>71cR</italic> and <italic>24cF</italic> under the control of a constitutive promoter, and the resulting transformants were screened for increases in cercosporin resistance, an assay previously utilized to identify other cercosporin resistance genes [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Under the conditions of our cercosporin-sensitivity assay, growth of wt <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> is inhibited by about 70% whereas growth of the resistant <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> is inhibited by about 40%. No significant increase in resistance was seen in any of the <italic>24cF</italic> transformants tested, however significant increases in cercosporin resistance were found in some <italic>71cR</italic> transformants, with inhibition as low as 20%. Resistance of the <italic>71cR</italic> transformants varied, with some showing no increase. This variation might be explained by the random integration of the insert and different levels of transgene transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To confirm that the resistance seen in <italic>71cR</italic> transformants was due to the transgene, expression of the <italic>71cR</italic> transgene was tested from randomly picked transformants, two that showed significant resistance and two that did not. The results showed that transformants that showed increased resistance had high expression of the gene compared to the expression of the gene in the transformants that did not have increased resistance. Thus for 71cR transformants, expression of cercosporin resistance correlated with <italic>71cR</italic> gene expression. For 24cF, each of the transformants assayed had high levels of expression without imparting increases in resistance. Thus we concluded that 24cF alone cannot impart significant levels of cercosporin resistance. Given that <italic>24cF</italic> is upregulated under conditions of cercosporin toxicity, it is possible that it can play a role in resistance in combination with other genes. Our domain analysis (<xref rid="pone.0140676.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showed that the protein has domains similar to those of phospholipid methyltransferases in the PEMT superfamily, but the precise function of this protein is unknown and further characterization will be needed to explore how it might contribute to resistance.</p><p>To further characterize the role of 71cR in cercosporin resistance, <italic>71cR</italic> was disrupted in wt <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic>, and resistance to cercosporin was assayed. The resistance of the disruptants to cercosporin was not significantly different than the wt <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic>. The cercosporin production in <italic>71cR</italic> disruptants was also compared to wt, and no difference in cercosporin production was observed. We hypothesized that the disruption of <italic>71cR</italic> may be compensated for by induction of other resistance genes. We thus assayed two of the <italic>71cR</italic> disruptants for expression of known resistance genes and for genes in the cercosporin biosynthetic pathway, when the disruptants were treated with cercosporin. Three genes, <italic>CFP</italic>, <italic>CTB5</italic> and <italic>CTB7</italic>, were found to be induced in the <italic>71cR</italic> disruptant mutants when they were exposed to cercosporin toxicity. CFP is an MFS transporter previously characterized to have a role in cercosporin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Oxidoreductase activity has been hypothesized to be involved in cercosporin resistance through reduction of cercosporin [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and these genes are also induced in the cercosporin-sensitive <italic>atr2</italic> background [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Further studies with <italic>ctb5</italic> and <italic>ctb7</italic> disruption mutants need to be done to conclusively characterize a possible role in cercosporin resistance.</p><p>The ability of 71cR to impart cercosporin resistance in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> led us to further characterize it. To identify the closest orthologs of 71cR, tblastn and blastp searches were done against the NCBI database, and 71cR was found to have high homology (up to 84% amino acid similarity) to hypothetical proteins from diverse fungi including members of both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. To better understand species distribution within the fungal kingdom, we searched for orthologs of 71cR in each sequenced fungal genome from JGI using tblastn. This analysis showed that 71cR orthologs are widely distributed in the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota but that distribution is not ubiquitous within species in these groups. In the Ascomycota, orthologs were common in the Pezizomycotina, especially in the classes Dothidiomycetes (containing <italic>Cercospora</italic>), Eurotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes. Orthologs of 71cR are also present in most fungal genomes in other subphyla in Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</italic>, the only sequenced genome from Glomeromycota, also had an ortholog of 71cR. However, 71cR orthologs were absent from sequenced genomes from other clades traditionally included in Zygomycota, as well as basal fungal lineages such as Chytridiomycota and Microsporidia (<xref rid="pone.0140676.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Although there are limited genomes available in JGI from these more basal lineages, the absence of this ortholog could indicate that 71cR evolved later in the evolutionary history of fungi.</p><p>As the most conserved orthologs to 71cR were not characterized for function, we used the Conserved Domain Database in the NCBI website [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Pfam [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] to identify domains. 71cR was shown to have an uncharacterized domain in the DUF1348 family in the NTF2 superfamily. The NTF2-like superfamily contains families with a common fold that results in a cone-like shape with a cavity inside. Although sharing a common fold, the proteins have very poor sequence similarity [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], thus explaining the lack of bootstrap support to cluster families within clades in our phylogenetic analysis (<xref rid="pone.0140676.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The NTF2-like superfamily contains both enzymatically active and non-enzymatically active proteins. SnoaL polyketide cyclase, scytalone dehydratase, limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase and &#x003b4;5-3-ketosteroid isomerase are examples of the enzymatically active group, which are typically intracellular [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Non-enzymatically active NTF2-like protein domains are mainly extracellular. The examples of proteins with non-enzymatically active NTF2-like domains are the C-terminus of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], Mba1, a putative ribosome-binding receptor [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], proteins involved in DNA transfer during bacterial conjugation [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and immunity proteins in the bacterial polymorphic toxin systems [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed that 71cR formed a clade with other proteins containing a DUF1348 domain. The next closest characterized ortholog was a SnoaL-like polyketide cyclase from <italic>Methylomicrobium album</italic>, however, the bootstrap value for this relationship was extremely low (21%). Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the possible function of 71cR from the phylogenetic analysis.</p><p>Since we could not predict a function of 71cR based on sequence homology, we turned to characterization of the 71cR secondary and tertiary structures. Raptor software [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] predicted that the 71cR protein has antiparallel beta strands forming a half barrel structure with one of the main alpha helix structures buried inside this half barrel. The protein is predicted to form a dimer. Solvent Accessibility prediction [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] shows several ligand binding regions and predicted localization in the cytosol. With this information, the 71cR protein was predicted to have an enzymatically active group as it is intracellular. Furthermore, the Raptor server predicted that 71cR binds steroids (pocket multiplicity of 74), and predicted amino acid residues that would be important for ligand binding. We confirmed that most of the predicted ligand binding sites are conserved throughout the close orthologs of 71cR.</p><p>Further analysis of tertiary structure was done using the Dali server [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Using Dali, the 71cR protein aligned closely with steroid delta-isomerase proteins. Steroid delta-isomerase proteins are common in diverse organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. They catalyze the isomerization of steroids by transferring protons in a two-step reaction [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and are involved in both steroid biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and steroid degradation pathways [<xref rid="pone.0140676.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Although this was the closest association, z values were not high enough to conclude with confidence that 71cR is a steroid delta-isomerase, and it may catalyze a different reaction. We hypothesized that 71cR may impart resistance by degrading or altering the structure of the polyketide cercosporin molecule, but were unable to obtain evidence to support this hypothesis. It is interesting that so many fungi have orthologs to 71cR as most of these are not known to produce photoactivated perylenequinones or to be resistant to such compounds. It is possible that the enzymes, although all having DUF1348 domains, are very different. Alternatively, it is possible that they carry out similar reactions, but that the substrates are different in different species. Further research will be required to characterize the specific function of the 71cR protein as well as orthologs in other fungal species.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that the <italic>71cR</italic> gene, encoding a hypothetical protein, is upregulated in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> in response to cercosporin toxicity, and that expression of this gene in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> can impart cercosporin resistance. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> disruption mutants are not more sensitive to cercosporin than wt, but other genes previously documented to play a role in resistance are up-regulated in these mutants upon exposure to cercosporin toxicity, suggesting that the fungus compensates for loss of resistance genes by up-regulation of other resistance mechanisms. Analysis of 71cR sequence, phylogeny, conserved domains, and secondary and tertiary structure identify the protein as having an NTF2-like superfamily domain with unknown function, to be intracellular, localized in the cytosol, to have enzymatic activity, and to have similarities to steroid delta-isomerase proteins. Current research is focused on expression of <italic>71cR</italic> in plants to determine if it has utility for engineering <italic>Cercospora-</italic> and cercosporin-resistant plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140676.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>
