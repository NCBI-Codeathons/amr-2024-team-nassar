One widely discussed survey from antimicrobial resistance collaborators, published in early 2022, estimated that 4.97 million deaths globally were associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 2019 alone (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The majority of currently used antibiotics target a limited number of processes common to most microorganisms: cell wall integrity (beta-lactams and glycopeptides), cell membrane (lipopeptides), translation (chloramphenicol and macrolides), transcription (rifamycins), and DNA replication (fluoroquinolones). Several papers have argued that new antimicrobial treatments may be discovered if we can alter the bacterial metabolic state, as many antibiotics are only bactericidal against metabolically active bacteria (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This is exemplified by the increase in bacterial aminoglycoside uptake stimulated by the addition of simple metabolites, such as fructose, mannitol, or glucose, the catabolism of which increases the proton motive force (PMF) and electric potential across the membrane (&#x00394;&#x003a8;) and kills otherwise dormant bacteria (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Similarly, it has been reported that differences in bicarbonate concentration between an infection and typical <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> screening in Mueller-Hinton broth can affect drug translatability. Farha et al. elegantly showed that this is probably because bicarbonate dissipates the &#x00394;pH component of the PMF, causing a compensatory increase in the &#x00394;&#x003a8; (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>These deviations from a simplistic model of one antibiotic blocking a single essential process beg a more nuanced view of bacterial physiology during infections and the ultimate causes of bacterial death beyond the target-focused proximal causes, as discussed by Baquero and Levin (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Polyether ionophores, natural products typically produced by <italic toggle="yes">Streptomycetes</italic>, fit this particular description well. They are a large class of structurally diverse amphiphilic antibiotics with the ability to perturb cellular ion gradients by affecting the transmembrane electroneutral exchange of ions/protons down a concentration gradient (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The molecules achieve this by undergoing a dynamic conformational change upon binding to the cation. This initial ion complex then undergoes a conformational change to fully encapsulate the bound ion by orienting multiple polar groups toward the cavity interior. Conversely, hydrophobic groups are directed to the exterior, allowing diffusion of the ionophore-ion complex across the lipid bilayer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The action of ionophores in (bacterial) cells depends on multiple parameters that transcend this simple, canonical mechanism. Depending on their specific structure, ionophores have differential affinities for different cations and likely have differing ion-transport dynamics and membrane affinities. As such, exposure to a given ionophore constitutes a unique perturbation of both metal-ion and proton gradients that a bacterium would attempt to counteract. Polyether ionophores can also affect eukaryotic cells, and while some compounds are used extensively as oral antiparasitic agents in agriculture, the development of ionophore antibiotics for human use has not been pursued due to the risk of toxicity. This is clearly a multifaceted situation; however, the best interpretation currently is that many organisms can tolerate polyether ionophores and that dosing schedules can be adapted to increase compliance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Despite their extensive use in animals, there is no evidence of cross-resistance between polyether ionophores and other antibiotics, which is interesting in relation to antimicrobial resistance (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that the differences in membrane composition between mammalian and bacterial cells can be exploited to prepare ionophores with acceptable therapeutic indices for use in certain clinical scenarios to treat resistant bacterial infections in humans. Recently, as an initial milestone toward this end, we described synthetic polyether ionophores with enhanced inhibitory selectivity for bacterial cells versus mammalian cells compared to a series of benchmarked natural products (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the present study, we systematically compared eight members of the natural polyether ionophore class (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). While many of these agents have been subject to earlier investigation for their antibiotic properties, these data are often generated under different experimental conditions, which we suspected might confound similarities (or differences) between the compounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the antimicrobial properties of this class of compounds against bacterial biofilms and persister cells. Our data demonstrate surprising differences between members of this family of antibiotics and, furthermore, uncover inhibitory profiles for selected compounds that prompt investigations in preclinical infection models and further structure activity relationship (SAR) investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion" id="s2"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polyether ionophores are effective across a panel of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains from bloodstream infections.</title><p>To immediately establish clinical relevance for investigating ionophores as antibacterial compounds against <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content>, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for several natural product ionophores against both methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> clinical isolates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>, Table S4). Two observations stand out from these experiments: (i) all ionophores were equally effective across all tested strains, and (ii) all ionophores had a large difference between relatively low MIC values and MBC values that were not measurable in the tested range, making the compounds bacteriostatic. A similar activity profile was observed with the vancomycin control. The only exception was calcimycin, a structurally atypical polyether ionophore (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Polyether ionophore bioactivity in methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> (MRSA) strains. Polyether <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> isolates from bloodstream infections were obtained from Aarhus University Hospital (AUH), Denmark. Five methicillin-sensitive <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strains (A) and three MRSA strains (B) were obtained, and bioactivity was determined using MIC and MBC analyses in a defined minimal medium M9 (CM-M9). All results are listed as the obtained concentration ranges (&#x003bc;g/mL) of at least two biological repetitions, each with technical triplicates (distinct wells).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="spectrum.00625-23-f001" position="float"/></fig><p>We conducted these experiments in a defined minimal medium CM-M9 (M9 salts with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> adjusted to physiological levels) and, serendipitously, noticed a large discrepancy between these values and those previously reported using type strains in Lysogeny broth (LB) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Due to the rather broad mechanistic role of polyether antibiotics as ion transporters, we suspected that the medium composition might play a significant role. Consequently, we determined the MIC values of our polyether ionophore panel in a small set of commonly used media: Lysogeny broth, Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), cation-adjusted MHB (CA-MHB), and the defined minimal medium M9 (CM-M9) (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Compared to vancomycin, whose activity varied from 0.5 to 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL depending on the medium composition (maximum 8-fold change), some of the ionophores appeared more sensitive to change (more than 8-fold). Apart from maduramycin and nanchangmycin, the ionophores had the lowest MIC value in LB and the highest in CM-M9. A similar trend has been reported for calcimycin and ionomycin against <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We also determined the MIC in MHB supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (25&#x02009;mM) to approach more clinically relevant screening conditions because supplementation with sodium bicarbonate has been shown to improve the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> translatability of MHB (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The MIC values mirrored those determined for the CM-M9 medium. Because the chemically defined CM-M9 allows much better control over concentration of individual cations we chose to proceed with this medium in the subsequent experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIG&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>MIC of polyether ionophores in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> in the presence of different growth media.

This prompted us to systematically investigate the effect of changing the concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a full factorial design. Experimentally, the cation concentrations were set to vary within physiologically relevant ranges in a CM-M9-based medium. The ranges were set as follows: Na<sup>+</sup>, 65 to 125&#x02009;mM; K<sup>+</sup>, 5 to 25&#x02009;mM; Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.05 to 2&#x02009;mM; and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0.1 to 2.5&#x02009;mM; and we used growth as the response variable upon challenge with ionophores at 0.25&#x000d7;, 1&#x000d7;, or 4&#x000d7; MIC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref>). To validate the experimental setup, we also tested daptomycin, which should exhibit calcium dependence, and vancomycin, which we did not expect to be influenced by changes in cation concentration within the set ranges. Indeed, daptomycin was potentiated with increasing calcium concentration and, to a lesser extent, increasing magnesium concentration. Vancomycin inhibition showed a slight inverse correlation with sodium concentration, but generally negligible cation dependency, as expected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref>). Compared to that of daptomycin, the ionophores&#x02019; inhibitory effects were generally less impacted by changing cation concentrations and fell into two broad groups: calcimycin and ionomycin inhibition correlated with <italic toggle="yes">increasing</italic> calcium concentrations and, interestingly, with <italic toggle="yes">decreasing</italic> magnesium concentrations, whereas lasalocid, salinomycin, narasin, and maduramycin inhibition correlated with increasing sodium and decreasing potassium concentrations. Calcimycin has also been reported to drastically lower the tolerated amount of added iron, manganese, and calcium to <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). These data largely reflect the affinity toward either monovalent (salinomycin, monensin, narasin) or divalent cations (calcimycin, ionomycin) that have been historically reported (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), although it is also clear that each compound has a unique profile.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIG&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Cation dependency of polyether ionophores. (A) A full factorial design of experiment (DOE)-approach was used to study how ionophore activity depends on cation concentrations (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>). The concentrations of the four cations were chosen as factors, and the percentage change in growth compared to a control as the response. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> was treated with the compounds at 0.25&#x000d7; MIC (1&#x000d7; MIC for daptomycin) in the presence of cations in the concentration ranges listed in the figure. Bacterial growth was evaluated after overnight treatment, and MODDE Pro was used for data processing. Daptomycin and vancomycin were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. Results are average of technical triplicates. (B) Ionophore effects on membrane potential were studied using the membrane-potential sensitive dye 3,3-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide [DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5)]. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> was loaded with 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) (1%), and after the dye had stabilized, the culture was treated with 10&#x000d7; MIC (CM-M9 medium). Valinomycin (20&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL) and nigericin (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL) were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. Results are average of technical triplicates (distinct wells), and bars are means &#x000b1; SD (standard deviation) (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="spectrum.00625-23-f003" position="float"/></fig><p>As a consequence of their dual ion-transport and membrane-binding activities, polyether ionophores may acutely disrupt cellular membrane potential. This effect could be the cause of both their anti-bacterial and cytotoxic effects. To probe the effect of ionophores on membrane potential, we used the dye 3,3-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide [DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5)]. DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) aggregates within the bacterial membrane, causing self-quenching of its fluorescence; however, upon disruption of the membrane electrical potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;), the dye is released into the medium, accompanied by an increase in fluorescence intensity. We tested eight naturally occurring polyether ionophores at 10&#x000d7; MIC in this setup (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>). As a positive control, we used the pore-forming K<sup>+</sup> ionophore valinomycin, which is known to dissipate the &#x00394;&#x003a8;. Compared to valinomycin, the polyether ionophores did not dissipate &#x00394;&#x003a8;, as the fluorescence intensity remained stable for 60&#x02009;min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>). Only calcimycin caused a slight increase in fluorescence intensity, although much less than valinomycin. Work by Farha et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) has shown that DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) can indirectly probe the proton gradient (&#x00394;pH) across the membrane because bacteria respond to a decreasing &#x00394;pH by increasing &#x00394;&#x003a8;, thereby leading to decreased fluorescence readout by DiSc<sub>3</sub>(5). The latter effect was reported previously for nigericin, but we did not observe any significant response for the ionophores tested here. In conclusion, our data indicate that the ionophores do not disrupt the membrane potential in any significant way. Another study by Farha et al.(<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) showed that the drastic changes in antibiotic potency at increased sodium bicarbonate levels are caused by a selective dissipation of the &#x00394;pH. They also showed that dissipators of &#x00394;&#x003a8; (valinomycin, I1, I2, and I3) act synergistically with bicarbonate. If the ionophores did in fact function as potent dissipators of membrane potential, we should see a more pronounced effect on the measured MIC values when adding bicarbonate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Selected polyether ionophores kill bacterial persisters and biofilms.</title><p>We next investigated antibacterial effects beyond simple early exponential growth. Two of the most substantial clinical challenges related to infections are the formation of biofilms and persister cells, both of which are primary causes of chronic and recurrent infections (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Upon antibiotic treatment, bacterial cells can transform into metabolically inactive persister cells, making them highly resilient to treatment and allowing them to &#x0201c;escape&#x0201d; the antibiotic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>). When antibiotic treatment is discontinued, the persister cells eventually transition back into metabolically active cells, creating recurrent infections. Biofilms, which typically grow on surfaces of medical implants or host tissue, are characterized by increased tolerance to antibiotic treatment. This increased tolerance is attributed to a lower growth rate, decreased antibiotic diffusion, higher oxidative stress tolerance, and a larger subpopulation of persister cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To investigate the effects of polyether ionophores on metabolically inactive persister cells, we used a recently developed high-throughput method which screens the ability to kill non-growing cells by performing the test without a carbon source (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In short, we transferred <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> cells to CM-M9 medium with the carbon source omitted&#x02014;preventing any growth and mimicking the subpopulation left after antibiotic treatment&#x02014;and incubated them with antibiotics for 24&#x02009;h before determining the viable cell count. We used ciprofloxacin (50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL) as the negative control (no inhibitory activity against persister cells) and the DNA-cross-linker mitomycin C (40&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL) as the positive control for killing persister cells. When tested at 50&#x000d7; MIC, the ionophores displayed very different inhibitory potential in this context (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>). While most compounds were completely inactive, calcimycin showed a modest effect on the persister cells at 50&#x000d7; MIC, but lasalocid showed a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the persister cells and a remarkable potency at &#x0003e;75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL. Next, using a 96-well assay based on peg-lids, we determined the minimum biofilm inhibition concentration (MBIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) for the ionophores (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4D</xref>).

However, lasalocid, nanchangmycin, and calcimycin stood out with promising MBEC values similar to their MBC, indicating that under these test conditions, the biofilm matrix and the persister phenotype in these biofilms do not sufficiently protect the bacteria against the antimicrobial action of the ionophores; however, the proximate cause of this is still unclear.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIG&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Polyether ionophore action on <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> persister cells and biofilms.

In addition, this can also provide insights into an antibiotic&#x02019;s mechanism of action, as mutations which confer resistance can reveal the compound&#x02019;s target. The organisms which produce the ionophores often contain genes conferring self-resistance. In the case of the ionophore tetronasin, Linton et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) showed that two genes encoding a ATP-dependent efflux system in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptomyces</named-content>
<named-content content-type="genus-species">longisporoflavus</named-content> conferred resistance to tetronasin when transferred to otherwise susceptible <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptomyces lividans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptomyces</named-content>
<named-content content-type="genus-species">albus</named-content>. Similarly, the biosynthetic gene clusters associated with monensin (BGC0000100), lasalocid (BGC0000087), and nanchangmycin (BGC0000105) found in the MIBiG (Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster) database (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) all contain predicted efflux systems, indicating that this is the dominant resistance mechanism among the producing strains. To investigate this in a human pathogen, we examined resistance against selected ionophores: first, unsuccessfully, in the standard single-step challenge of a dense inoculum on agar plates containing 1&#x000d7; MBC, and next by a sequential passaging method in which an <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> culture was treated with sub-inhibitory concentrations every day for 4&#x02009;weeks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>). In this type of experiment, as the bacteria become less susceptible over time, and perhaps resistant, the MIC value will increase. However, after 25&#x02009;days of continuous treatment, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> culture was barely affected by the exposure. For lasalocid, salinomycin, and calcimycin, only a 4-fold increase in the tolerated concentration was observed, which was comparable to the vancomycin control. In comparison, resistance to ciprofloxacin developed rapidly, as expected. These data mirror prior observations in the literature in which resistance toward polyether ionophores is not easily achieved and that their frequency of resistance is very low considering their extensive use (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Interestingly, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> culture treated with nanchangmycin was slightly more affected after the first 25&#x02009;days of treatment, with a 16-fold change in inhibitory concentration, and this treatment was therefore continued. After 40&#x02009;days of continuous treatment, susceptibility was decreased, resulting in an apparent 64- to 128-fold increase in the MIC. However, when isolating single colonies to determine the final MIC values of the resistant strains, a modest 4- to 16-fold increase in the MIC was observed compared to the wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6B</xref>). The nanchangmycin-resistant strains were checked for cross-resistance toward the other three ionophores, as this could have indicated whether a shared resistance mechanism was involved. However, none of the isolates showed any difference in tolerance to lasalocid, salinomycin, or calcimycin, thereby ruling out a common acquired resistance phenotype. We sequenced the genomes of three resistant strains and that of the wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain, which revealed several genes with mutations common to all three mutants and absent from the wild type (see Table S2). Among these were the gene encoding TrkH (WP_000021864.1), involved in potassium uptake; the gene encoding MspA (WP_001161085.1), a protein hypothesized to be membrane-stabilizing (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); and the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator SarV (WP_000066900.1), which is involved in the autolysis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Several mutations in both <italic toggle="yes">mspA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">sarV</italic> were common to strains 1 and 3, while strain 2 only showed one mutation in each. These results matched previous reports that acquired ionophore-resistance is linked to efflux or decreased permeability (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), but the proximate cause remains elusive. To gain additional insight into the ionophores&#x02019; mechanism of action, we screened the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (NTML), a mutant library in an MRSA strain with transposons inserted into 1,920 individual non-essential genes, for increased sensitivity to lasalocid, salinomycin, calcimycin, and nanchangmycin in an agar plate assay. Here, we primarily found hits with perturbations in the electron transport chain to be more sensitive to the ionophores (see Table S3). Measuring the MICs of the mutants in a liquid-based assay revealed that inactivation of <italic toggle="yes">aroC</italic> (encoding chorismate synthase) or <italic toggle="yes">hemB</italic> (encoding delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase) had the biggest effect on ionophore sensitivity, while mutations in genes of the quinol oxidase subunits I, II, or III (<italic toggle="yes">qoxABC</italic>), NADH:ubiquinone reductase (<italic toggle="yes">ndh2</italic>), or protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (<italic toggle="yes">cyoE</italic>) produced 2-fold decreases in the MICs of lasalocid, salinomycin, and nanchangmycin. None of the mutations influenced calcimycin sensitivity in a liquid setting.

Although their ability (documented in this study) to target drug-resistant, Gram-positive clinical isolates, as well as persister populations and bacterial biofilm, is undoubtedly appealing, their lack of activity against Gram-negative pathogens is a clear limitation of this compound class. It is likely that polyether ionophores cannot efficiently penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and that this is the reason for their low activity. Although uptake efficiency, to the best of our knowledge, has not been experimentally determined for all of the polyether ionophores in Gram-negative strains, Guyot et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) showed that calcimycin bound to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> but never entered the cells. This lack of penetration is also supported by studies using <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> mutant strains with increased outer membrane permeability that remain sensitive to polyether ionophores and by studies showing that the polymyxin derivative PMBN sensitizes <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> to calcimycin (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

None of the ionophores had any stand-alone effect against <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (or <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Acinetobacter baumannii</named-content>, Fig. S2), but salinomycin (fractional inhibitory concentration [FIC] 0.25), calcimycin (FIC 0.125), and nanchangmycin (FIC 0.25) all lowered the MIC value for polymyxin B in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). Conducting the same experiment with an antibiotic with an intracellular target (kanamycin, ribosome) indicates that the outer membrane is in fact the only thing preventing ionophores from exerting their effect on Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, lasalocid did not have clear synergy with polymyxin B, an observation that we are not currently able to explain.

For isolation of gDNA, the Monarch Genomic DNA purification kit was used (T3010S) together with bead-beating with zirconia/silica beads. The procedure for the Monarch kit was followed with a few adjustments, as follows. Overnight cultures (16 to 18 h, 37&#x000b0;C, 140&#x02009;rpm) of each resistant strain and wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> DSM 20231 were grown to densities of ~1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL and pelleted (1&#x02009;min, 14,000&#x02009;rpm). Pellets were resuspended in Tris-buffer and transferred to bead columns. Samples were bead-beaten (40&#x02009;sec, 6.0 m/s), beads were pelleted (10&#x02009;min, 12,300&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>), and supernatant was stored in the freezer overnight.

The desired concentrations of NaCl, KCl, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and MgSO<sub>4</sub> could then be added. We wanted to test 17 different cation combinations and thus prepared 17 different media.</p><p>A culture was grown aerated overnight (16 to 18 h, 37&#x000b0;C, 140&#x02009;rpm) and diluted to a final density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL.

In another black 96-well plate, compounds were dispensed as a 20&#x000d7; solution. Compounds were tested at 10&#x000d7; MIC, so stock solutions of 200&#x000d7; MIC were prepared in DMSO (final concentration = 5%). After the dye was stabilized inside the bacterial membrane, the culture loaded with dye was transferred to the compound plate, yielding the final concentration of 10&#x000d7; MIC.
