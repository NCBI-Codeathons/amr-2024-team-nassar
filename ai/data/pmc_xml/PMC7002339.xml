Among quinones, naphthoquinones are especially important as secondary metabolites (SMs) or their precursors in fungi (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). To date, more than 100 naphthoquinones with various structures and physicochemical properties have been identified from more than 60 filamentous fungi (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These compounds display various biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities due to their propensity to inhibit respiration and damage DNA (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Accordingly, several drugs with a naphthoquinone pharmacophore have been developed and marketed, such as doxorubicin against metastatic cancers, idarubicin against acute myeloid leukemia, mitoxantrone against prostate cancer and multiple sclerosis, and vitamin K against hemorrhagic disease (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Naphthoquinones have also been considered model compounds to study polyketide biosynthesis in filamentous fungi because of their wide distribution and various bioactivities (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Unexpectedly, these studies revealed significant differences in naphthoquinone biosynthesis, indicating that the corresponding pathways are polyphyletic (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Fungi also need to develop self-protection strategies to avoid committing suicide upon the production of bioactive SMs; thus, fungal SM biosynthetic gene clusters routinely encode one or more self-resistance determinants (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Importantly, the genes encoding such self-resistance mechanisms serve as one of the major pools of preexisting antimicrobial resistance for horizontal gene transfer into clinically important microorganisms (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The same self-resistance determinants also serve as models and predictors for the various mechanisms by which human cells develop resistance to cytotoxic drugs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thus, elucidation of self-resistance mechanisms not only unmasks basic cellular processes in the producing fungi, but also reveals possible avenues of resistance against applied therapeutics (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Unfortunately, only a few studies have addressed resistance against naphthoquinones. While these studies concentrated on enzymatic degradation by reductases (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), it is still unclear if other naphthoquinone resistance determinants exist in fungi.</p><p>Recently, we found that 1,4-naphthoquinone-based natural product congeners with antimicrobial activities cooccur with <italic>Monascus</italic> azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs). MonAzPs have been used extensively as natural food coloring agents for more than two thousand years, and we and others have intensively investigated their biosynthesis in previous studies (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The 1,4-naphthoquinone coproducts, hereinafter called monasones (<italic><underline>Monas</underline>cus</italic> naphthoquin<underline>ones</underline>), are detectable only in trace amounts in MonAzP fermentations of wild-type isolates of <italic>Monascus</italic> spp. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, monasones are produced in substantial amounts by various mutants with gene knockouts in the <underline>M</underline>on<underline>A</underline>zP <underline>b</underline>iosynthetic <underline>g</underline>ene <underline>c</underline>luster (MABGC) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Nevertheless, the biosynthetic steps that yield these naphthoquinone polyketides and the self-resistance mechanisms of the producer fungus against these antimicrobial products remain uncharacterized (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we first prove that monasones are bona fide antimicrobial SMs produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Monascus ruber</named-content> M7 upon elicitation by competing microorganisms. Then, we elucidate the biosynthesis of monasones and show that the relevant enzymes are encoded within an independently regulated subset of the MABGC. We also show that this subset of genes may endow self-resistance against monasones through detoxification and specific efflux. Our results reveal an unexpected mechanism by which filamentous fungi repurpose pluripotent early SM intermediates and flexible SM biosynthetic enzymes to produce structurally and functionally distinct SMs under different physiological and ecological conditions. We also show that the biosynthesis of these distinct metabolites is encoded in a nested, composite biosynthetic gene supercluster that imparts multilevel synergistic resistance against the potential self-harm caused by these compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Monasones are bona fide SMs of <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7.</title><p>Our previous studies have indicated that MonAzPs are largely (but not entirely) absent and that trihydroxynaphthalene <bold>2</bold> and monasones <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>) are the major products of an <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7 mutant in which <italic>mrpigC</italic>, a gene within the MABGC, was deleted (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

All MonAzPs and the monasone congeners <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, and <bold>4</bold> should be derived from <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7, since these compounds were not detected upon monoculture of the challenger microorganisms (Fig. S1, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Penicillium expansum</named-content> ATCC 7861 as an example [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]).

MrPigH is a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase similar to enol reductases acting on various aromatic hydrocarbon substrates (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Since monasones <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> feature enol groups, we wondered whether MrPigH may also be involved in the biosynthesis of naphthoquinone derivatives.

The structures of all four products were elucidated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Table S8 and Fig. S10 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). We conclude that MrPigH catalyzes a stepwise reduction sequence.

Inevitably, naphthoquinone-producing fungi also must evolve self-protection mechanisms against their own SMs to avoid suicide. These mechanisms may involve active efflux, which also helps to &#x0201c;broadcast&#x0201d; these antimicrobial agents into the environment, and modification of residual SMs inside the producer cells to reduce their toxicity (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Based on the results described in the present study, we propose a model for the biosynthesis and detoxification of the antifungal and antibiotic monasones in <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>). MrPigA and MrPigN, encoded by genes in the MABGC regulated by MrPigB, catalyze the biosynthesis of monasone A (compound <bold>3</bold>) and monasone B (compound <bold>4</bold>) via the intermediate trihydroxynaphthalene <bold>2</bold>. MrPigP, a multidrug transporter also encoded by the MrPigB regulon of the MABGC, exports these toxic metabolites out of the mycelia, thereby protecting <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7 and inhibiting competing microorganisms in the environment. Meanwhile, residual monasones A and B inside the cells may be reduced to nontoxic compounds such as trihydroxytetralone <bold>12</bold> and tetrahydroxytetralin <bold>16</bold> by MrPigH also encoded by the MrPigB regulon, with the help of MrPigC from MonAzP biosynthesis or other reductases of <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7.

The MABGC has previously been considered to have evolved to produce azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs) and to yield metabolites such as trihydroxynaphthalene <bold>2</bold> and monasone A (compound <bold>3</bold>) only as shunt products upon the blockade of the normal course of MonAzP assembly (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, we believe that this view of monasones as mere derailment products is unjustified. First, monasone production is elicited upon challenge by various microorganisms (Table S3 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), and these compounds show antifungal and antibacterial activities (Table S5 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Second, the monasone subcluster encodes not only biosynthetic enzymes but also a transcriptional regulator and proteins responsible for two distinct monasone resistance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Third, orthologues of <italic>mrpigA</italic> whose nrPKS products generate a common polyketide intermediate for naphthoquinone congeners and MonAzPs are much more widely associated with genes that are involved in naphthoquinone biosynthesis, resistance, and regulation than with those that are specific for MonAzP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). In fact, several genes in MABGCs were found not to play an essential role in azaphilone biosynthesis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Consequently, we propose that naphthoquinones are bona fide SMs whose biosynthetic mechanisms served as the foundation for the evolution of MonAzP biosynthesis in a group of naphthoquinone-producing fungi. Thus, MonAzP biosynthesis sequesters the pluripotent and unstable polyketide intermediate <bold>1</bold> to afford azaphilones, metabolites that occupy a distinct segment of the SM structural space compared to that by the ancestral naphthoquinones. Nevertheless, the two pathways remain intertwined not only by the corresponding genes being physically colocated on the chromosome but also by several enzymes playing double duty in the two pathways.</p><p>MrPigC and its functional equivalent(s) in <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7 reduce the C-11 carbonyl of intermediate <bold>1</bold>
<italic>en route</italic> to MonAzPs, and MrPigH contributes to (although is not strictly necessary for) the reduction of enolic intermediates to afford yellow MonAzPs such as monascin and ankaflavin (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, the same enzymes also take part in the reduction of the analogous carbons in monasone derivatives to eliminate the self-toxicity of residual intracellular naphthoquinones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). In contrast, MrPigN is also involved in both pathways but in different capacities. For MonAzP biosynthesis, MrPigN hydroxylates the C-4 position of benzaldehyde <bold>5</bold>, while for naphthoquinone biosynthesis, the same enzyme facilitates C1/C10 aldol condensation in intermediate <bold>1</bold> to afford monasone A (compound <bold>3</bold>), with only minor amounts of C-4 hydroxylated analogues produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p>Another level of connection is provided by the cluster-specific regulator MrPigB that affects both pathways through controlling the expression of MrPigA (an nrPKS). This regulator also controls most of the identified genes of the naphthoquinone pathway (<italic>mrpigN</italic>, <italic>mrpigH</italic>, and <italic>mrpigP</italic>), while only a small subset of the MonAzP genes belong to the MrPigB regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Similar composite &#x0201c;superclusters&#x0201d; responsible for the production of more than one SM each were also observed recently in other fungi such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus terreus</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus nidulans</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These superclusters have evolved by expansion, merger, and diversification of ancestral gene clusters responsible for the production of archetypal SMs. Just as with the monasone-MonAzP biosynthetic gene supercluster, certain genes of these superclusters are involved in the biosynthesis of more than one SM, while other genes only take part in the biogenesis of one particular SM (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This mosaic nature of superclusters makes bioinformatic prediction of gene functions problematic, but coupled with functional analysis, it will help to illuminate the evolutionary paths that fungal SM biosynthesis has traveled.</p><p>Secondary metabolite natural products are often produced as allelochemicals, and as such, their production is often triggered by interactions of the producer with other microorganisms or plant and animal hosts (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Cocultivation of microorganisms has also been applied in the laboratory to elicit the biosynthesis of novel SMs or to promote the production of known SMs (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Our reassessment of monasones as genuine SMs with ecological roles independent of those of MonAzPs was prompted by the observation that cocultivation of <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7 with other microorganisms stimulates the production of these naphthoquinones but not that of the azaphilones (Tables S3 and S4 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Together with their antibacterial and antifungal activities, these results suggest that the biosynthesis of monasones is an ecological fitness trait that helps <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7 defend its niche (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). At the same time, production of monasones may be further promoted by optimizing cocultivation parameters by varying the microbial challengers and the interaction modes.</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms by which microorganisms that produce antimicrobial agents avoid suicide is crucial for developing new anti-infective drugs that are less susceptible to, and less prone to provoke, resistance in targeted pathogens and nontarget microorganisms of the host microbiome (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Resistance to antimicrobial agents may involve exclusion or inactivation of the compound, alteration of the target, and phenotypic resistance. Inactivation of toxic (naphtho)quinones by reductases or dehydrogenases has been reported in some microorganisms (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our results show that the monasone producer <italic>M. ruber</italic> M7 may apply two-tiered self-defense by using the naphthoquinone-specific and naphthoquinone-inducible transporter MrPigP to expel monasones A and B from the mycelia and may utilize MrPigH and MrPigC to reduce residual intracellular monasones to compounds <bold>12</bold> and <bold>16</bold> that show no notable antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>).</p><sec id="s3.1" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions.</title><p>Our work provides an example for the existence of mosaic-like superclusters in fungi. These superclusters are responsible for the biosynthesis of more than one SM with highly divergent structures and encode regulators, resistance determinants, and biosynthetic enzymes that may be shared by the constituent pathways or may be relevant only for an individual pathway. Common core enzymes encoded by these superclusters may yield malleable pluripotent intermediates that are further processed by promiscuous tailoring enzymes into structurally and functionally distinct products. Such SM biosynthetic and genomic parsimony provides important clues for the evolution of SM diversity in microorganisms. Functional characterization of the MABGC supercluster also delineates a two-tiered resistance mechanism against naphthoquinones that may transfer to pathogenic microorganisms or emerge in targeted mammalian cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Strains and plasmids.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus oryzae</named-content> strain M-2-3, an arginine auxotroph, was obtained from Colin Lazarus (University of Bristol, UK). <named-content content-type="genus-species">Monascus ruber</named-content> strain M7 was previously described (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
