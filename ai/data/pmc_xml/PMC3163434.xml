Cinnamycin is a 19 amino acid lantibiotic that contains one Lan and two MeLan. Cinnamycin also contains an unusual lysinoalanine (Lal) bridge formed from the &#x003b5;-amino group of lysine 19 and a serine residue at position 6, and an <italic>erythro</italic>-3-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-aspartic acid resulting from the hydroxylation of <sc>l</sc>-aspartate at position 15. These modifications are critical in mediating the interactions of cinnamycin with its target, phosphatidylethanolamine. Recently, the cinnamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (<italic>cin</italic>) from <italic>Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus</italic> DSM 40005 was reported. Herein, we investigated the biosynthetic machinery using both in vitro studies and heterologous expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. CinX is an &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent hydroxylase that carries out the hydroxylation of aspartate 15 of the precursor peptide CinA. In addition, CinM catalyzes dehydration of four Ser and Thr residues and subsequent cyclization of Cys residues to form the three (Me)Lan bridges. The order of the post-translational modifications catalyzed by CinM and CinX is interchangeable in vitro. CinX did not require the leader sequence at the N-terminus of CinA for activity, but the leader peptide was necessary for CinM function. Although CinM dehydrated serine 6, it did not catalyze the formation of Lal. A small protein encoded by <italic>cinorf7</italic> is critical for the formation of the cross-link between Lys19 and dehydroalanine 6 as shown by coexpression studies of CinA, CinM, CinX, and Cinorf7 in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ja205783f</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ja-2011-05783f</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes id="notes-1"><title>Author Contributions</title><p><sup>&#x02225;</sup> These authors contributed equally.</p></notes></front><body><!--with a head--><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides that undergo extensive post-translational modifications to attain their active antimicrobial forms.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>) They are characterized by the presence of thioether cross-linked amino acids called lanthionine (Lan) and methyllanthionine (MeLan), which are formed by intramolecular addition of cysteine thiols to dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) residues, respectively.

Instead of a GG or GA protease cleavage motif seen in most class II lantibiotics, an AXA motif is present between the leader sequence and the core region of CinA (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate the alanine residue at the last position of the leader peptide of CinA (position&#x02013;1) to lysine. The resulting His<sub>6</sub>-CinA(A&#x02013;1K) mutant enables removal of the leader peptide using the commercial endoproteinase LysC for bioactivity assays. This substrate analogue was used as a precursor peptide throughout this study. Both His<sub>6</sub>-CinA(A&#x02013;1K) and His<sub>10</sub>-CinM were heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). Approximately 6&#x02013;10 mg of His<sub>10</sub>-CinM was obtained per liter of cell culture. The His<sub>6</sub>-CinA(A&#x02013;1K) peptide was further purified after IMAC by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) resulting in 40 mg of purified peptide per liter of cell culture that was detected as the Na<sup>+</sup> adduct after LysC protease cleavage (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The enzyme CinM migrated as a protein of approximately 120 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel filtration analysis, close to the predicted monomeric molecular weight of His<sub>10</sub>-CinM (118.8 kDa) (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate dehydration activity, His<sub>6</sub>-CinA(A&#x02013;1K) (20 &#x003bc;M) was incubated with His<sub>10</sub>-CinM (5 &#x003bc;M) at 25 &#x000b0;C for 6 h in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and immobilized tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Use of immobilized reducing agent was required to prevent unwanted additions of reducing agents (TCEP/dithiothreitol) to the dehydrated precursor peptide. Analysis of the core peptide by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) after LysC endoproteinase treatment revealed a mass corresponding to loss of four water molecules (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). This finding demonstrates that CinM is responsible for the dehydration of the two threonine (Thr11 and Thr18) and two serine residues (Ser4 and Ser6) in the core region of CinA. Addition of cysteine thiols to the dehydroamino acids does not cause a change in mass, which prevents observation of cyclization by MALDI-ToF MS. To investigate the cyclization activity of CinM, iodoacetamide (IAA), a thiol alkylating agent that induces a mass increase upon reaction with cysteine thiols, was used. His<sub>6</sub>-CinA(A&#x02013;1K) and His<sub>6</sub>-CinA(A&#x02013;1K) modified by His<sub>10</sub>-CinM were treated with IAA and LysC protease and then subjected to MALDI-ToF MS analysis. As expected, His<sub>6</sub>-CinA(A&#x02013;1K) that had not been treated with His<sub>10</sub>-CinM showed a mass increase corresponding to alkylation of the three cysteines in the core peptide (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). In contrast, only minor alkylation products were observed in the His<sub>10</sub>-CinM treated sample (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). The data strongly support conversion of the majority of the free thiols to thioether rings by His<sub>10</sub>-CinM, although one Cys(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) appears to be less efficiently cyclized resulting in some peptide with one IAA adduct (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CinM functions as a bifunctional LanM enzyme that catalyzes both dehydration and cyclization reactions to form the thioether cross-links.

A sample that was not treated under alkaline conditions did not produce a zone of growth inhibition, which demonstrates the requirement of Lal for antimicrobial activity of cinnamycin. Unfortunately, this in vitro process to produce cinnamycin did not allow comparison of its bioactivity with authentic cinnamycin because the sample contained unknown amounts of material derived from the biosynthetic enzymes, the leader peptide, and LysC. Therefore, the concentration of cinnamycin within the sample was not known. Attempts to purify the cyclized core peptide by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) produced very low quantities of cinnamycin, preventing comparison with authentic cinnamycin.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Coexpression of CinA, CinM, and CinX in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>Quantification of Lal formation after alkaline treatment by GC&#x02013;MS has been challenging because of the large background resulting from the leader peptide and the biosynthetic enzymes.

These two OPA adducts originate from the N-terminal amino group and the &#x003b5;-amino group of Lys.

His<sub>10</sub>-CinM dehydrated two threonine and two serine residues in the core region of His<sub>6</sub>-CinA and catalyzed the subsequent cyclization by cysteine thiols to form three thioether rings. The observation that CinM dehydrated Ser6 confirms that the Lal is formed with the intermediacy of a dehydroalanine despite the <sc>l</sc>-stereochemistry at the &#x003b1;-carbon of the former Ser residue. Although His<sub>10</sub>-CinM dehydrated Ser6, it did not catalyze the formation of the Lal ring. Considering that LanC/LanM enzymes typically stereoselectively protonate the enolate formed during the Michael-type addition to provide <sc>d</sc>-stereochemistry at the &#x003b1;-carbon, it is not surprising that Lal formation, which results in the <sc>l</sc>-configuration at the newly formed stereogenic center,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> is not catalyzed by CinM. In addition, CinM is much better suited to activate a thiol nucleophile with the Zn<sup>2+</sup> in its active site than to activate a primary amine.</p><p>CinX is shown to be an Fe(II)/&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase that catalyzes the &#x003b2;-hydroxylation of Asp15 in the CinA precursor peptide. Interestingly, His<sub>6</sub>-CinX accepted the core region of CinA as a substrate without the need of the leader sequence. Similar observations were made for the oxidative decarboxylase EpiD,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>) suggesting that tailoring enzymes that introduce post-translational modifications beyond dehydration and cyclization may not require the leader peptide. However, as observed for other lanthionine synthetases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> His<sub>10</sub>-CinM required the leader peptide for efficient processing. Changing the order of incubation of the precursor peptide with His<sub>10</sub>-CinM or His<sub>6</sub>-CinX resulted in the same product.</p><p>In vitro biosynthesis of cinnamycin was accomplished by inducing nonenzymatic formation of the Lal by raising the pH after treatment of CinA with His<sub>10</sub>-CinM and His<sub>6</sub>-CinX in vitro or after heterologous coexpression of CinM and CinX with the precursor peptide in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The high bioactivity of the resulting peptide suggests that the nonenzymatic cyclization occurs with high stereoselectivity, assuming that cinnamycin with a Lal residue with incorrect stereochemistry has no or low antimicrobial activity. At present, we cannot test this assumption, but high stereoselectivity for nonenzymatic formation of Lan and MeLan has been demonstrated previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> No such investigations have been conducted for Lal formation, but a previous study on the structure elucidation of cinnamycin concluded that the alternative configuration of Lal results in high strain energy.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) The Lan and MeLan residues generated by CinM may preorganize the conformation of the peptide to favor stereoselective formation of Lal, similar to a recent proposal for a lanthionine synthetase that generates a large number of thioether cross-links of high structural diversity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>)</p><p>Genetic studies have identified the <italic>cinorf7</italic> gene to be essential in the biosynthesis pathway of cinnamycin.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) This gene, composed of just 360 nucleotides, is located immediately upstream of <italic>cinA</italic> and the two genes are cotranscribed.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) We show here that Cinorf7 is required for lysinoalanine formation. Unfortunately, in vitro reconstitution of its activity has been unsuccessful to date. Sequence analysis of Cinorf7 shows that it does not have significant homology to other functionally characterized proteins. Two other genes encoding proteins with high sequence similarity to Cinorf7 were identified in the protein databases (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S9A</xref>). One of these, found in the genome of <italic>Lyngbya majuscule</italic>, has two nearby likely precursor peptides, whereas the second, found in the genome of <italic>Frankia Sp.</italic>, has one gene encoding a possible precursor peptide nearby (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S9B</xref>). Both <italic>cinorf7</italic> orthologues also are near LanM-like genes. Although the sequences of the predicted leader peptides of these putative precursor peptides vary, their core regions showed very high sequence identity to the cinnamycin group of lantibiotics (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S9B</xref>), suggesting these gene clusters have the genetic capacity to generate cinnamycin-like peptides.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate here that CinM is responsible for dehydration of two Ser and two Thr residues and also generates the three thioether cross-links in cinnamycin. Furthermore, we show that CinX hydroxylates a single Asp in a 78-residue substrate and that it also accepts just the core peptide as substrate. Finally, our data indicate that Cinorf7 is critical for the formation of the unique cross-linked lysinoalanine. These studies set the stage for the generation of cinnamycin analogues and investigations of the mechanism by which Cinorf7 achieves Lal formation.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Section</title><!--with a head--><sec id="sec4.1"><title>General</title><p>All sources of materials, molecular biology procedures, and protein purification procedures are provided in the <xref rid="notes-2">Supporting Information</xref>.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec4.2"><title>CinM Dehydration and Cyclization Activities in Vitro</title><p>CinM assay components consisted of 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 &#x003bc;M CinA(A&#x02013;1K) peptide, 2.5 mM ATP, 5 &#x003bc;M enzyme, and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) or dithiothreitol (DTT).
