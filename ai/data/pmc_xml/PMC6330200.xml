We know of myriad, day-periodic, fundamental physiological processes in humans that are governed by an endogenous clock-like system that is receptive to zeitgebers such as the pivotal light&#x02013;dark cycle. This system is known as the circadian system which generates rhythms of approximately 24-hour period length (&#x02018;circadian&#x02019; from Latin circa and dies, meaning &#x02018;about a day&#x02019;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The &#x02018;master clock&#x02019; or &#x02018;pacemaker&#x02019;, that receives light&#x02013;dark information via the retinohypothalamic tract from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus region of the brain.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Neuroendocrine output is the current postulated mechanism for circadian alignment throughout the body.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Importantly, the synchronisation (or entrainment) of circadian rhythms to zeitgeber periods significantly contributes to physical performance, cognitive performance and overall health.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>
</p><p>Zeitgeber information which an individual experiences can come from multiple sources and may interact with extreme consequences. It may allow said individual to &#x02018;run-like clockwork&#x02019; or may turn his/her circadian system into a &#x02018;ticking time bomb&#x02019;.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Modern societal demands can provide conflicting zeitgeber information insufficient for, or detrimental to, the chronobiological health of individuals and populations. For example, shiftwork that involves circadian disruption was classified as a group 2A carcinogen (&#x0201c;probably carcinogenic to humans&#x0201d;) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2010.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Plausible effects of modern societal demands and conflicting zeitgebers could contribute to the current epidemic of sleep deficiency and the increasing global burden of mental, metabolic, cardiovascular and cancer diseases associated with chronobiological ill-health.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;17</xref> Conversely, zeitgeber information acting synergistically at the right times may foster chronobiological homeostasis and ultimately health. To this end, it remains to identify zeitgebers comprehensively and to coordinate or align the information from multiple time-cues as much as possible to reinforce each other with resulting high zeitgeber strength in appropriate time windows.</p><p>The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine instilled additional interest in the field of chronobiology. Sport, sports medicine, and exercise physiology may be particularly relevant fields in which chronobiology should be explored as exercise has been discussed as a potential zeitgeber for the human circadian system.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;22</xref> Therefore, we explored the validity of that hypothesis through a systematic review of the literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic literature search of the PubMed database was conducted on 19 October 2017 for relevant experimental, field and epidemiological studies and reports concerning chronobiology and exercise/physical activity in humans.

We shall apply these criteria in our synthesis. Furthermore, there are confounders and effect modifiers that we need to be aware of. For instance, when addressing the effectiveness of zeitgebers, Aschoff emphasised that&#x02014;in most settings&#x02014;several zeitgebers compete. Moreover, within any given zeitgeber multiplicity, entrainment is determined by both external intensity and internal susceptibility.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Determinants of the strength of zeitgebers include intensity, duration, phase timing and periodic frequency while the susceptibility of the receiving organism to such information can be assessed by the phase of internal time (indicating a phase response curve),<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and potentially by circadian system robustness.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In effect, multiple zeitgebers such as light, noise, meals or social contacts may act synergistically or antagonistically, that is, they interact in terms of their &#x02018;push&#x02019; or &#x02018;pull&#x02019; on circadian rhythm phase.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Best evidence supporting the hypothesis would include an entraining ability of the exercise zeitgeber with circadian phase drifting after removal of that zeitgeber. Additional support for the hypothesis would include evidence for an exercise phase response curve in phase-shifting a biological rhythm. Time-of-day dependent effects of exercise, which support the existence of a phase response curve, will also be discussed as potential evidence.</p><p>Overall, support for the &#x02018;exercise is a zeitgeber for humans&#x02019; hypothesis should include a sufficiently strong and timed exercise stimulus being able to phase-shift the circadian rhythm of the SCN in accordance with Aschoff&#x02019;s blueprint.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> If there are no data to this effect, other biological processes co-governed with circadian rhythmicity must be assessed as proxies for SCN output for example, body temperature (BT), melatonin rhythm, exercise performance rhythm or sleep rhythm. Relevant chronotype information, that is, cases wherein it may be used as a proxy for circadian phase, will also be considered. While proxies are not without limitations,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> they are frequently necessary in human circadian biology research. Diminishing effects on rhythm amplitudes may result from an exercise stimulus representing conflicting zeitgeber information or differential speeds of rhythms entraining to the exercise stimulus phase and period. Additionally, the zeitgeber may or may not affect individual rhythm amplitudes. A &#x02018;washout&#x02019; period may be required to delineate specific effects on the circadian system from more immediate &#x02018;masking&#x02019; effects of exercise. These criteria are also reviewed in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

This is expected given the difficulty in accessing the human SCN. Furthermore, there are no reports of chronotype changes following exercise intervention. Evidence for a phase response curve to exercise in humans has been reviewed by Edwards <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and our systematic search revealed no new studies that have attempted to demonstrate a phase response curve to exercise in humans. Edwards <italic>et al</italic> note that these studies represent supporting evidence that exercise might be a human zeitgeber but fall short of conclusively claiming that an exercise-zeitgeber has been demonstrated for humans.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Thus, evidence for phase response curves will only be considered in brief.</p><p>There is abundant evidence of phase-shifting effects of exercise on commonly measured proxies of circadian rhythm (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Exercise, depending on time of day or internal time of stimulus application, has been shown to phase-shift the melatonin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and BT rhythms.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 27&#x02013;32</xref> However, whether this effect is the result of masking or whether it persists after stimulus removal is unclear. From one study, no significant effect from the first exercise stimulus was observed, rather periodic bouts were required to manifest melatonin phase changes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This would suggest a zeitgeber effect rather than a masking effect.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Buxton <italic>et al</italic> observed counter-intuitive phase-shifting responses to exercise at certain times with morning exercise eliciting phase delays and evening exercise eliciting phase advances.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The authors plotted a tentative phase response curve based on their data.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> That the responsiveness to exercise followed a different timing pattern than would be expected for light may suggest the phase-shifting was the result of exercise per se and not light exposure.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Van Reeth <italic>et al</italic> also plotted a tentative phase response curve to exercise.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In a shortened forced sleep&#x02013;wake schedule study, exercise did not aid adaptation to the new schedule, rather the melatonin ascending limb was phase-delayed compared with non-exercise by day 8.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Furthermore, the phase points of the rhythm shifted in a temporally different manner with the descending phase not statistically different between groups after the initial 8 days but different after 14 days.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In other words, some phase-shift differences took longer to manifest than others. If the effects observed are immediate effects rather than entraining effects, the time-period for manifestation of phase-shifts suggests an adaptation to the immediate effects. We would find this more difficult to reconcile than entrainment. In a longitudinal case study, high intensity exercise delayed the expression of clock genes in human hair cells compared with a following period of no exercise.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Unfortunately, the first non-exercise circadian measurements were taken ~3 weeks after the exercise period ended; thus, a drifting of the phase was not tested.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Added to this, phase differences were observed between the initial exercise-period circadian measurements and the second exercise-period circadian measurements.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Hence, it is difficult to conclude that exercise was the zeitgeber. For instance, seasonal effects on phase of entrainment might have been detected. A repeat of this study, with more immediate observations after removal of the exercise stimulus could provide interpretable evidence of an exercise-induced circadian stimulus.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Exercise can phase-shift melatonin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and body temperature (BT)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Author, year</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Finding</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Van Reeth <italic>et al</italic> 1994<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>

However, we do not know how the different exercise schedules may have affected the timing of other zeitgeber exposure. For instance, morning exercise groups, as opposed to evening exercise groups, may be waking up earlier and being exposed to light earlier in the day. Over several weeks, they will entrain to this earlier light exposure, and their performance rhythm will also be expected to advance, which could explain the observations. On the other hand, some studies noted no differences in morning or evening BT between morning-trained and evening-trained groups which suggests either light exposures are not different between groups or are not sufficiently different to differentially affect the BT rhythm.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 36</xref> A case study of exercise earlier in the day, measuring BT at several time points, identified changes in BT amplitude post-intervention but not in the observed phase timing of peaks or troughs.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Another study demonstrates changes in diurnal variation of performance but not in the diurnal rhythm of testosterone or cortisol.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This leads to the question: &#x0201c;why might the performance rhythm phase-shift separately from other well-described circadian rhythms such as BT, cortisol or testosterone?&#x0201d; A &#x02018;masking effect&#x02019; of exercise on exercise performance could offer an explanation.

Regarding health and disease, informed timing of exercise may be useful as an adjunct therapeutic or preventative strategy to foster chronobiological homeostasis. Equally clearly, when taken together, these studies strongly suggest that exercise is a zeitgeber signal for the human circadian system.</p><p>Regarding Aschoff&#x02019;s criterion 1, no studies wherein a potential periodic sport zeitgeber is switched off and a drift of circadian phase back to its original timing were returned by our systematic search. However, several studies took measurements of the diurnal variation in performance from 48 hours up to several weeks after the exercise intervention is removed and found that the change in diurnal variation persisted.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 36 37</xref> On the one hand, these measurements are not strictly indicative of a performance circadian rhythm. On the other hand, it is difficult to reconcile why these effects persist if not for the circadian system. We put forward that such studies taking repeated circadian measurements following a &#x02018;switched off&#x02019; exercise zeitgeber may be feasible in athletes who are injured and unable to participate in periodic sport. In contrast to being switched off, the switching on of an exercise-zeitgeber in humans is, in effect, presented in the literature. In contrast to switching off, we should expect that switching on causes a given biological periodicity or entrained rhythm to deviate. Indeed, we observe this in the phase-shifting effects of exercise on melatonin, BT, and TSH.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 27&#x02013;32</xref> In many cases, recurrent zeitgeber signalling is required before a significant phase-shift is observed. Evidence of criterion 2 is also compatible with exercise being a zeitgeber insofar as there is evidence that the timing of exercise is crucial to eliciting phase-shifting effects and differentiating between phase-delaying and phase-advancing effects.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 26&#x02013;32</xref> In regard to Aschoff&#x02019;s zeitgeber criterion 3, there is one study where the zeitgeber frequency is increased alongside a shortened sleep schedule; namely periodic recurrence every 23 hours and 40 mins.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Contrary to the potential zeitgeber aiding entrainment to the new period, exercise phase-delayed the melatonin rhythm in comparison to controls.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p><p>The zeitgeber effects of light depend on frequency, timing, intensity and light history. We have discussed facets of frequency and timing of exercise when applying Aschoff&#x02019;s zeitgeber criteria above. We lack detailed and comparable studies of varying zeitgeber effects of different exercise intensities and exercise history. Regarding the latter, exercise has been shown to elicit greater improvements in the rhythmicity of individuals with poor circadian rhythm<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> conveying the notion that the history of rhythmic activity is important. Regarding the former, we can make inferences based on the fact that the experimental groups of the studies will not have been completely inactive during the study (ie, that some activity beyond the stimulus will be necessary for daily life, eg, walking, driving, cooking, cleaning, work etc). In this regard, the exercise stimulus represents a higher intensity of physical activity compared with other activities. Following this, the higher activity intensity affected phase-shifting responses. This may also be considered as supporting evidence for Aschoff&#x02019;s criterion 2.</p><p>Interestingly, two studies demonstrate counter-intuitive phase-shifting effects due to exercise that is, different directions to light.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 31</xref> Moreover, changes in performance rhythms have been observed independent of other rhythms.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This opens questions of whether phase-shifting effects of exercise are acting at the level of the SCN, and whether central output determining performance rhythms is truly from the SCN. Javierre <italic>et al</italic> have already speculated that physical performance rhythm may be co-governed by a different oscillator to that of BT.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
</p><p>Concerning limitations of the synthesised studies, the low frequency measurements over the course of a day in the diurnal variation in performance studies and often low numbers of participants (as can be the case in human interventions studies) are apparent. We also note a limitation in terms of potential for selection bias. Studies into exercise effects on humans, especially at certain times of day, may attract participants whose own schedules suit the schedules used in these studies. Thus, this may lend to internal time and chronotype bias among participants, although chronotype is often accounted for. The authors note that only one study observed no phase-shifting effects of an exercise stimulus; the potential exists that more studies demonstrating no zeitgeber effects remain unpublished due to publication bias. Lastly, most studies in <xref rid="T2 T3" ref-type="table">tables 2 and 3</xref> consider effects on participants who have not regularly trained for several months and we lack comparison with elite athletes, sedentary individuals and individuals of different ages. Differences in physical fitness and age may affect sensitivity to an exercise stimulus.</p><p>Aschoff suggested that in most instances there are several zeitgebers, that they compete and that regularly one will take the lead and dominate over the others.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This has been complemented by Crowley and Eastman<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and with specific regard to sport by Youngstedt <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> showing that rather than one zeitgeber dominating a zeitgeber competition, in many settings there will be zeitgeber interaction<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 48</xref>&#x02014;be it antagonistic or synergistic. In this vein, we suspect that in some individuals who actively engage in exercise, the zeitgeber effects of exercise may compete&#x02014;or act antagonistically&#x02014;against other zeitgebers to the detriment of performance and of chronobiological health. In effect, this may, of course, be less conspicuous due to the known benefits of exercise per se. However, identification and removal of potential adverse zeitgeber effects, that is, appropriate alignment of exercise within the zeitgeber multiplicity and in reference to internal time, may provide athletes with added effects of exercise and/or provide a &#x02018;difference-making&#x02019; effect on performance. Importantly, in our view, having unambiguous and strong&#x02014;rather than confusing and weak&#x02014;zeitgeber information at the right times could foster chronobiological homeostasis and ultimately health and act as a performance enhancer.</p><p>In closing, we do not expect that our systematic literature search is factually complete. Indeed, we do expect that some research targeting the nexus of chronobiology and performance will have been conducted in secrecy to allow competitive edges and thus remain unpublished. The answer to the question as to whether exercise has been conclusively demonstrated to be a zeitgeber for humans in a single study is, as of yet, no&#x02014;but the supporting evidence of an exercise-zeitgeber for humans is nonetheless strong.</p><p>For health specialists and sport performance specialists, sufficient evidence thus far supports a role for exercise as a zeitgeber for the human circadian system and for chronobiological insights affecting performance that may be used to foster health and improve performance. Exercise, appropriately timed, must be advocated in line with &#x02018;zeitgeber hygiene&#x02019; and preventive medicine against circadian disruption. Indeed, when not contraindicated as judged by physicians, exercise as a zeitgeber to foster chronobiological health would be preferable to pharmacomedication due to its additional known beneficial effects on health. For the purist scientist, the question of &#x02018;how&#x02019; can exercise be a zeitgeber remains unanswered. We suspect it likely that the exercise stimulus modifies the internal environment in a manner that allows systemic signalling to the circadian coordinating centres of the brain (eg, myokine circadian rhythm<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In the evolutionary context, the ability to shift the timing of peak performance or sleep based on previous timing of an activity stimulus can be envisaged to have provided competitive edges (viz., predictive homeostasis) to organisms.</p><p>In conclusion, informed timing of exercise can be advocated in performance and disease contexts as a physical enhancer and as an adjunct therapeutic or preventative strategy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LK, JVG, TCE: began initial work into this area.
