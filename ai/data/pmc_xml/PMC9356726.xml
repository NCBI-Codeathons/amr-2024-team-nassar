Genome sequencing of the alaremycin-producing bacterial strain and enzymatic analysis revealed that the first step of alaremcyin biosynthesis is catalysed by the enzyme, AlmA, which exhibits a high degree of similarity to 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) expressed by animals, protozoa, fungi, and &#x003b1;-proteobacteria. Site-directed mutagenesis of AlmA revealed that the substitution of two amino acids residues around the substrate binding pocket transformed its substrate specificity from that of alaremycin precursor synthesis to ALA synthesis. To estimate the evolutionary trajectory of AlmA and ALAS, we performed an ancestral sequence reconstitution analysis based on a phylogenetic tree of AlmA and ALAS. The reconstructed common ancestral enzyme of AlmA and ALAS exhibited alaremycin precursor synthetic activity, rather than ALA synthetic activity. These results suggest that ALAS evolved from an AlmA-like enzyme. We propose a new evolutionary hypothesis in which a non-essential secondary metabolic enzyme acts as an &#x02018;evolutionary seed&#x02019; to generate an essential primary metabolic enzyme.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>5-aminolevulinate synthase</kwd><kwd>5-aminolevulinic acid</kwd><kwd>ancestral sequence reconstruction</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd><kwd>primary metabolic enzyme</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolic enzyme</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="msac164-s0"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibiotics are substances produced by micro-organisms antagonistic to the growth of other micro-organisms. The origin of antibiotics is ancient and some antibiotic production occurred over hundreds of million years ago (<xref rid="msac164-B43" ref-type="bibr">Wright 2007</xref>). Moreover, antibiotic resistance genes occurred over 2 billion years ago, indicating that antibiotic production also existed at that time (<xref rid="msac164-B14" ref-type="bibr">Hall and Barlow 2004</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B10" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Costa et al. 2011</xref>). It is an interesting question to know whether antibiotics influenced the evolution of ancient life.</p><p>Antibiotics&#x02019; production is often considered &#x02018;secondary metabolism&#x02019; because it is unessential for the growth of the organism. In the natural environment, antibiotics kill or prevent the growth of competitive organisms. Thus, the role of antibiotics is to inhibit the growth of competitors; however, sub-lethal levels of antibiotics provide various effects on organisms, such as transcriptional modulation or enhancement of genetic variability (<xref rid="msac164-B12" ref-type="bibr">Goh et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B8" ref-type="bibr">Couce and Bl&#x000e1;zquez 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kohanski et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B13" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bleich et al. 2015</xref>). Here we report a novel evolutionary role for antibiotic metabolism as a secondary metabolic enzyme that contributes to the origination of a primary metabolic enzyme.</p><p>Previously, we discovered a novel antibiotic, &#x0201c;alaremycin&#x0201d;, from the soil bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. A012304 (<xref rid="msac164-B2" ref-type="bibr">Awa et al. 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="msac164-F1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1</xref>). The molecular structure of alaremycin is related to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA); therefore, it was designated alaremycin, from &#x0201c;<underline>ALA</underline><underline>re</underline>lated antibiotic&#x0201d; produced by <italic toggle="yes"><underline>Streptomyces</underline></italic> sp. ALA is a universal precursor of porphyrin in almost all living organisms and is converted to several important cofactors, such as heme and chlorophyll (<xref rid="msac164-B37" ref-type="bibr">Stojanovski et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bryant et al. 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="msac164-F1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1</xref>). Alaremycin competitively binds to the substrate binding pocket of porphobilinogen synthase, which condenses two molecules of ALA to produce porphobilinogen for porphyrin biosynthesis (<xref rid="msac164-B16" ref-type="bibr">Heinemann et al. 2010</xref>). In our attempt to identify the biosynthetic genes of alaremycin, we unexpectedly found that one of the alaremycin synthetic enzymes is a close relative of ALA synthase (ALAS).</p><fig position="float" id="msac164-F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Structures of alaremycin and ALA. The unique structures in alaremycin are highlighted in red.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="msac164f1" position="float"/></fig><p>ALAS synthesizes ALA by condensing glycine and succinyl-co-enzyme A (CoA). This single-step pathway for ALA biosynthesis, known as the Shemin pathway, occurs in animals, protozoa, fungi and &#x003b1;-proteobacteria (<xref rid="msac164-B34" ref-type="bibr">Shemin and Rittenberg 1946</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B37" ref-type="bibr">Stojanovski et al. 2019</xref>). In humans, ALAS catalyses the rate-limiting step for heme biosynthesis and its dysfunction is responsible for serious diseases, such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLPP) (<xref rid="msac164-B3" ref-type="bibr">Balwani 2019</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B26" ref-type="bibr">Peoc&#x02019;h et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B37" ref-type="bibr">Stojanovski et al. 2019</xref>). Most bacteria, archaea and plants synthesize ALA through an alternative pathway known as the C<sub>5</sub> pathway (<xref rid="msac164-B19" ref-type="bibr">Jahn et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B7" ref-type="bibr">Brzezowski et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B22" ref-type="bibr">Layer 2021</xref>). This pathway includes three-step reactions beginning with glutamate (<xref rid="msac164-B24" ref-type="bibr">Nogaj and Beale 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the diversity of ALA biosynthetic pathways is in contrast to the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway wherein most steps are highly conserved among nearly all living organisms, although some procaryotes have been known to possess alternative pathways (<xref rid="msac164-B9" ref-type="bibr">Dailey et al. 2017</xref>). Since the C<sub>5</sub> pathway is widely distributed in prokaryotes, it is considered a primitive pathway for ALA synthesis, whereas the Shemin pathway is modern. However, it is still unknown how and why the Shemin pathway developed and replaced the established C<sub>5</sub> pathway in some ancient organisms.</p><p>In the process of elucidating the alaremycin biosynthetic pathway, we discovered a significant similarity and phylogenetic relationship between ALAS and an alaremycin synthetic enzyme named AlmA. This led us to the idea that ALAS may have originated from an AlmA-like enzyme. We surmised that a feature of an antibiotic enzyme, which is non-essential but advantageous for survival, may enable an antibiotic enzyme to serve as an excellent evolutionary seed for a novel enzyme. This hypothesis contends that antibiotic synthetic enzymes play a role in enhancing evolution in a unique way that has not been previously considered.</p><p>Here, we describe the results of genome sequencing of the alaremycin producer strain and subsequently characterize the alaremycin synthetic enzymes. Then, we demonstrate an evolutionary relationship between the alaremycin synthetic enzyme, AlmA and ALAS by two distinct approaches: a functional transformation of AlmA to ALAS by site-directed mutagenesis and the characterization of a predicted AlmA/ALAS common ancestor by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). We discussed the evolutionary trajectory of ALAS and the evolutionary role of secondary metabolic enzymes, including AlmA-like proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="msac164-s1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="msac164-s1.1"><title>Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of Alaremycin</title><p>The draft genome sequencing of the alaremycin producer strain, <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. A012304, was performed to identify gene(s) involved in the biosynthesis of alaremycin. Therefore, we obtained 3.93 Gbp and 38.6 million reads, and 36.3 million reads were applied for an assembly. Consequently, we established a draft genome of 9.67&#x02005;Mbp. The number of contigs was 281, and the average length was 34.4&#x02005;kbp. The minimum and maximum length of the contigs was 131&#x02005;bp and 432&#x02005;kb, respectively. A total of 28,768 open reading frames (ORFs) with a length of 30 a.a. or more were found, of which 10,407 ORFs were positive by basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis. Of these, we selected two ALA synthetic gene homologues as candidates for the biosynthetic gene of alaremycin. We assumed that either one is responsible for ALA synthesis, whereas the other is involved in alaremycin biosynthesis. One showed homology with the prokaryotic <italic toggle="yes">hemA</italic> genes encoding glutamyl-tRNA reductase within the C<sub>5</sub> pathway of ALA biosynthesis. The other exhibited homology with the <italic toggle="yes">ALAS</italic> genes encoding ALAS within the Shemin pathway. This gene was later named <italic toggle="yes">almA</italic>. Although most bacteria do not contain ALAS, some <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> species have a homologue enzyme, known as cyclic ALAS (cALAS), which catalyses the cyclization of ALA to produce the C<sub>5</sub>N unit moiety found in several antibiotics (<xref rid="msac164-B28" ref-type="bibr">Petr&#x000ed;cek et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B29" ref-type="bibr">Pet&#x00159;&#x000ed;&#x0010d;kov&#x000e1; et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hanh et al. 2018</xref>). Thus, we initially suspected that AlmA is a member of the cALAS family. However, the phylogenetic tree comprised of ALAS, cALAS and AlmA showed that the branch of AlmA is out of the cALAS clade and is closer to the ALAS clade (<xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">fig. 2</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">A</xref></italic>). This phylogenetic topology suggests that AlmA has a distinct function compared with that of cALAS. Next, we attempted to determine which one was responsible for ALA biosynthesis to exclude the ALA synthetic gene and to identify the alaremycin synthetic gene.</p><fig position="float" id="msac164-F2" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of alaremycin.

As shown in <xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">fig. 2</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref></italic>, MGHA01 carrying a plasmid vector did not grow on an L agar plate in the absence of ALA. Under these conditions, a plasmid carrying the <italic toggle="yes">hemA</italic> homologue of A012304 restored the growth of MGHA01 in the absence of ALA, whereas that carrying <italic toggle="yes">almA</italic> did not. This result clearly indicates that the <italic toggle="yes">hemA</italic> homologue is responsible for ALA synthesis in A012304 as with most bacteria. This is also supported by the observation that the A012304 genome contains a <italic toggle="yes">hemL</italic> gene, which is an essential component of the C<sub>5</sub> pathway. Additionally, several genes involved in heme biosynthesis are also found downstream of the <italic toggle="yes">hemA</italic> homologue, that is, <italic toggle="yes">hemB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">hemC</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">hemD,</italic> which encode porphobilinogen synthase, porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen III synthase, respectively (<xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">fig. 2</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref></italic>). It was suggested that the <italic toggle="yes">ALAS</italic> homologue is involved in alaremycin biosynthesis. Notably, three serial genes were found downstream of the <italic toggle="yes">ALAS</italic> homologue, annotated as <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetyltransferase, oxidoreductase and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, respectively (<xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">fig. 2</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref></italic>), which may be responsible for alaremycin biosynthesis together with the <italic toggle="yes">ALAS</italic> homologue. To test this, the gene cluster was introduced into <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> JM109 and the ability of the cells to produce alaremycin was examined. As shown in <xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">fig. 2</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">E</xref></italic>, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by MS analysis revealed that the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> JM109 strain expressing these four genes produced alaremycin extracellularly. When the MFS transporter homologue was deleted, extracellular levels of alaremycin decreased, suggesting that it functions as an alaremycin exporter and may contribute to self-resistance. Conversely, <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strains expressing <italic toggle="yes">almA</italic> encoding the ALAS homologue and its downstream gene encoding <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetyltransferase or <italic toggle="yes">almA</italic> did not produce alaremyicn. Based on these results, we concluded that <italic toggle="yes">almA</italic> and the two genes encoding <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetyltransferase and oxidoreductase are required for alaremycin biosynthesis. The last gene encoding the MFS transporter is required for alaremycin extrusion. Accordingly, these four genes were designated <italic toggle="yes">almA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">almB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">almC</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">almE</italic> (<xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">fig. 2</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref></italic>).</p></sec><sec id="msac164-s1.2"><title>Enzymatic Reaction Catalysed by AlmA</title><p>In the biosynthetic pathway of alaremycin, it is expected that the AlmA catalyses the condensation of succinyl-CoA and amino acid. Considering the structural similarity between ALA and alaremycin, amino acids having one-carbon side chain may serve as a substrate, such as alanine or serine. To confirm the enzyme reaction catalysed by AlmA, we conducted an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> enzyme assay using purified AlmA protein. AlmA was fused with a His-tag on its N-terminus, and the His-tagged AlmA protein was purified. Next, its enzymatic activity was measured using glycine, alanine, serine and threonine as a substrate (<xref rid="msac164-F3" ref-type="fig">fig. 3</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F3" ref-type="fig">A</xref></italic><xref rid="msac164-F3" ref-type="fig">and</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F3" ref-type="fig">B</xref></italic>). Therefore, the AlmA efficiently catalysed the condensation of serine and succinyl-CoA. Conversely, AlmA showed no detectable activity for alanine or threonine (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material</xref> online). The K<sub>m</sub> value for serine is 6.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4&#x02005;mM, which is comparable to that of <italic toggle="yes">Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic> ALAS for glycine (2.31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.12&#x02005;mM) (<xref rid="msac164-B38" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al. 2019</xref>) and <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic> ALAS for glycine (8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7&#x02005;mM) (<xref rid="msac164-B36" ref-type="bibr">Stojanovski et al. 2016</xref>). This indicates that AlmA adopts serine as a substrate. Moreover, the k<sub>cat</sub> value of AlmA for serine and succinyl-CoA condensation is 2.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x02005;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is almost the same as that of the <italic toggle="yes">Rp. palustris</italic> ALAS for glycine and succinyl-CoA condensation (2.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.28&#x02005;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref rid="msac164-B38" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al. 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, the k<sub>cat</sub> value of AlmA for serine and succinyl-CoA condensation is 10-fold higher than that of <italic toggle="yes">M. musculus</italic> ALAS for glycine (0.25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.004&#x02005;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref rid="msac164-B36" ref-type="bibr">Stojanovski et al. 2016</xref>). These kinetic parameters clearly indicate that AlmA catalyses the condensation of serine and succinyl-CoA to synthesize 5-amino-6-hydroxy-4-oxohexanoic acid, which is the intermediate I of alaremycin (<xref rid="msac164-F3" ref-type="fig">fig. 3</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref></italic>).

As described in the Introduction, it is likely that the Shemin pathway emerged in an ancestral species of &#x003b1;-proteobacteria after the C<sub>5</sub> pathway had already been distributed throughout the bacterial domain. We inferred that the AlmA-like antibiotic-synthesizing enzyme, which produces ALA as a by-product, developed into a robust ALA synthetic enzyme and was adopted as a novel ALA synthetic pathway within the ancestral species of &#x003b1;-proteobacteria.</p><p>To estimate the evolutionary relationship of AlmA and ALAS, we first compared the amino acid sequences of AlmA and several ALAS from &#x003b1;-proteobacteria, yeast and human, focussing on the amino acid residues composing the substrate binding pocket (<xref rid="msac164-F4" ref-type="fig">fig. 4</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F4" ref-type="fig">A</xref></italic>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary fig.

The 3D structure of <italic toggle="yes">R. capsulatus</italic> ALAS (RcALAS: Protein Data Bank [PDB] number 2BWP) and that of AlmA constructed by 3D homology modeling show that these amino acid residues are close to the substrate amino acid, glycine. Distances between the substrate and the amino acid residues (4.9&#x02005;&#x000c5; in AlmA and 3.6&#x02005;&#x000c5; in RcALAS) suggest that the space of the substrate binding pocket of AlmA is larger than that of ALAS (<xref rid="msac164-F4" ref-type="fig">fig. 4</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="msac164-F4" ref-type="fig">B</xref></italic>). This may explain why AlmA prefers the bulkier substrate serine over glycine. Additionally, we focused on the 86th Gly of AlmA wherein the corresponding residues among ALAS are conserved as bulkier Ser or Ala. This residue is located in a glycine-rich loop, which is important for succinyl-CoA binding (<xref rid="msac164-B1" ref-type="bibr">Astner et al. 2005</xref>). Based on these findings, we suspected that the 82nd Ser and 86th Gly of AlmA are responsible for substrate specificity and are related to the divergence of AlmA and ALAS. To confirm the effect of these two residues on substrate specificity, we constructed five AlmA variants by introducing site-specific substitutions: S82T, G86A, G86S, S82T/G86A and S82T/G86S.

Consequently, AlmA-S82T lost most of its synthetic activity for the intermediate I but still retained weak ALA synthetic activity. The additional G86S substitution increased the affinity for glycine, while maintaining low affinity for serine. Consequently, AlmA-S82T/G86S produced ALA more efficiently than AlmA-S82T. The behaviour in complementation tests may be explained by these <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> results.

First, an ancestral bacterium having the C<sub>5</sub> pathway acquired an AlmA-like enzyme as an antibiotic-synthesizing enzyme.

Afterwards, the ancestral &#x003b1;-proteobacteria lost the C<sub>5</sub> pathway, whereas ancestral ALAS with low ALA synthetic activity was able to develop an efficient ALA synthetic enzyme through mutations and natural selection. Thereafter, ALAS may have been inherited to an ancestral eukaryotic organism via symbiosis, when ancestral eukaryotic organisms acquired mitochondria. This is based on reports that suggest that &#x003b1;-proteobacterial symbiosis is the origin of mitochondria (<xref rid="msac164-B47" ref-type="bibr">Zimorski et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B31" ref-type="bibr">Roger et al. 2017</xref>) and human ALAS localizes within the mitochondria (<xref rid="msac164-B23" ref-type="bibr">Munakata et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="msac164-B25" ref-type="bibr">Nomura et al. 2021</xref>).

In this case, the AlmA-like enzyme had acted as an &#x0201c;evolutionary seed,&#x0201d; which created a novel enzyme. We assume that the antibiotic-synthesizing enzyme, like AlmA, may be an excellent evolutionary seed for two reasons. First, since the antibiotic gene is unessential for the host, it is capable of accepting radical mutations that cause a loss of function. Secondly, antibiotics are often substrate analogues, which inhibit a target enzyme by binding to its substrate binding pocket competitively. Thus, such analogue synthesizing enzymes may be easily converted to a novel enzyme producing the substrate itself, which may be how the AlmA-like enzyme evolved to ALAS. If an evolved enzyme is dominant to a primitive one, it may be incorporated as a new part of a biosynthetic pathway.</p><p>Here, we propose a hypothesis that non-essential secondary metabolic enzymes act as evolutionary seeds to generate essential primary metabolic enzymes.

Plasmids for the complementation assay were introduced into MGHA01 using electroporation. A complementation test was performed by streaking overnight cultures of transformants, which were grown on L broth. For complementation tests on M9 media, overnight cultures grown on L broth were washed with saline. Serial dilutions of the cell suspension were spotted onto an M9 agar plate. Then, 1&#x02005;mM IPTG was added for gene induction.

The supernatant was extracted by repeated solvent dissolution with ethyl acetate/water (1:1, v/v) at pH 2, 9 and 2. The resultant organic phase was evaporated to remove solvent and the extract was resolved in acetonitrile. Samples were then subjected to HPLC analysis using a Prominence system (Shimadzu) equipped with a COSMOSIL HILIC packed column (nacalai tesque). The separation was done with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/30&#x02005;mM ammonium acetate (4:1, v/v) at a flow rate of 1&#x02005;ml/min. Alaremycin was detected by absorption at 253&#x02005;nm. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) using a micrOTOF II (Bruker). For sample preparation, the HPLC fraction around 7.9&#x02005;min was collected and extracted with ethyl acetate, pH 2, and the resulting organic phase was evaporated.
