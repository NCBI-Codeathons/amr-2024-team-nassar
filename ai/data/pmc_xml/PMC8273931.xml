Bioactivities can be beneficial for both interaction partners or provide a competitive advantage only for the producer. Colonizers of confined habitats such as biofilms are known as prolific producers of a great number of bioactive secondary metabolites and are a potential source for novel compounds. We investigated the strain <italic>Paracoccus marcusii</italic> CP157, which originates from the biofilm on the carapace of a shell disease-affected <italic>Cancer pagurus</italic> specimen, for its potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. Its closed genome contains 22 extrachromosomal elements and several gene clusters potentially involved in biosynthesis of bioactive polyketides, bacteriocins, and non-ribosomal peptides. Culture extracts of CP157 showed antagonistic activities against bacteria from different phyla, but also against microalgae and crustacean larvae. Different HPLC-fractions of CP157 culture extracts had antibacterial properties, indicating that several bioactive compounds are produced by CP157. The bioactive extract contains several small, antibacterial compounds that partially withstand elevated temperatures, extreme pH values and exposure to proteolytic enzymes, providing high stability toward environmental conditions in the natural habitat of CP157. Further, screening of 17 <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. revealed that antimicrobial activity, hemolysis and production of <italic>N</italic>-acyl homoserine lactones are common features within the genus. Taking into account the large habitat diversity and phylogenetic distance of the tested strains, we hypothesize that bioactive secondary metabolites play a central role in the ecology of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. in their natural environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Paracoccus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic></kwd><kwd>growth inhibition</kwd><kwd>genome analysis</kwd><kwd>natural products</kwd><kwd>bioactivity</kwd><kwd>antibiosis</kwd><kwd>microbial interactions</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="79"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among other processes, secondary metabolites mediate antagonistic or mutualistic interactions and are key components in microbial ecology (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Beyersmann et al., 2017</xref>). Increased production of bioactive metabolites often correlates with strong competition within habitats restricted in availability of nutrients or space (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Molloy and Hertweck, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Mullis et al., 2019</xref>). Especially marine epibiotic bacteria were identified as prolific producers of a broad range of antagonistic compounds. Some substances are excreted to gain direct competitive advantage over neighboring species, or mediate interactions with a host organism by protection from fouling organisms or settlement of pathogens (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Egan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Molloy and Hertweck, 2017</xref>). However, host-bacteria interactions are not always mutually beneficial. <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Seyedsayamdost et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrated that <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, which leaches from aging microalgae, triggers production of algicidal compounds in <italic>Phaeobacter inhibens</italic>. Consequently, a chemically induced shift of <italic>P. inhibens</italic>&#x02019; lifestyle to opportunistic pathogenicity leads to rapid release of large amounts of nutrients via algal lysis and eventually detachment from the dying host.</p><p>Epibiotic microbial communities on the carapace of the arthropod <italic>Cancer pagurus</italic> (CP) were analyzed in several previous studies, reporting presence of bacteria mainly belonging to the phyla <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Quinn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2020</xref>). British, Irish, and German populations of <italic>C. pagurus</italic> were found to be heavily affected by the &#x0201c;black spot&#x0201d; shell disease (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Wootton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2020</xref>). Characteristic symptoms are progressive melanization and degradation of the exoskeleton (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chistoserdov et al., 2012</xref>). Most authors assume a polyphasic development that involves initial damage of the non-chitinous outermost surface layer (epicuticle) and subsequent degradation of the chitinous inner layer (procuticle) (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Vogan et al., 2002</xref>). Both processes are linked to changes in the arthropods microbiome, bacterial degradation via chitinolytic bacteria and secondary colonization by opportunistic pathogens (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Smolowitz et al., 2005</xref>). In a recent study, 75 new strains were isolated from the biofilm on the carapaces of &#x0201c;black spot&#x0201d; shell disease-affected <italic>C. pagurus</italic> specimens (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bergen, 2018</xref>). Several bacterial isolates are affiliated with the genus <italic>Paracoccus</italic>, among which strain <italic>Paracoccus marcusii</italic> CP157 was obtained from a black spot. CP157 corresponds to an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) that made up &#x0003e;1% of the bacterial community in the respective sample, while the same OTU was present, but less abundant, in unaffected areas of the carapace. Thus, CP157 is assumed to play a role in the development or progression of black spot shell disease in <italic>C. pagurus</italic>. Even though <italic>Paracoccus</italic> is one of the largest genera within the <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic>, and despite great interest in secondary metabolism of other members of this family, details on biosynthesis and modes of action of bioactive secondary metabolites produced by <italic>Paracoccus</italic> are scarce.</p><p>So far, the genus <italic>Paracoccus</italic> was studied mainly because of its versatile primary metabolism (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. have been isolated from diverse marine and terrestrial habitats including associations with insects, corals and bryozoans (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lasek et al., 2018</xref>). This ability to thrive in different environments is most likely based on high metabolic flexibility, a general feature of the <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Brinkhoff et al., 2008</xref>), including production of bioactive secondary metabolites. Experimental and genomic approaches revealed that <italic>Paracoccus</italic> sp. Arc7-R13 is capable of extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles, when incubated with silver nitrate (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These particles have strong antibacterial activity against strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Other studies reported antibacterial activity of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> sp. S4493 and of culture extracts prepared from <italic>Paracoccus pantotrophus</italic> FMR19 (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Machado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Faridha Begum et al., 2016</xref>). <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref> found algicidal activity against the dinoflagellate <italic>Prorocentrum donghaiense</italic> in <italic>Paracoccus</italic> sp. Y42, and <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2012)</xref> reported activity of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> sp. PC101 against <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Moreover, several studies described complex structures of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> genomes with multiple extrachromosomal elements and putative gene clusters involved in the synthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dziewit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Maj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lasek et al., 2018</xref>). However, no comprehensive investigation of the potential of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. to produce bioactive secondary metabolites has been conducted. In this study, we reveal the potential for secondary metabolite production of the new strain <italic>P. marcusii</italic> CP157, based on genomic and physiological characteristics. To identify whether the detected features are specific adaptations of CP157 or common traits within the genus, we compared the results for CP157 to further 17 <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. that originate from other habitats such as soils, sea water, or associations with higher organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Origin and Cultivation of Organisms</title><sec id="S2.SS1.SSS1"><title>Source of Strains</title><p><italic>Paracoccus marcusii</italic> CP157, used here as a model strain to study its potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites, originates from a diseased spot on the carapace of a CP specimen.

Observations from the laboratory confirm the production of an orange pigment by CP157. In addition, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bergen (2018)</xref> identified the carotenoid as astaxanthin via HPLC-MS. Interestingly, the genes <italic>crtIYZW</italic> (CP157_02148-02151) were identified as part of the potential GI_05. However, these five genes were only recognized by one of three algorithms incorporated into IslandViewer and form the boundaries of the GI.</p><p>Four genes of the biosynthesis pathway for the siderophore petrobactin, <italic>asbABEF</italic> (MIBiG cluster BGC0000942), were detected by antiSMASH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Material</xref>). However, the two genes <italic>asbCD</italic> that would complete the petrobactin BSGC were not found, neither by antiSMASH nor direct pBLAST. Due to experimental evidence for siderophore production of CP157 (Martine Berger, ICBM, private communication), it can be hypothesized that other genes mediate the encoded functions of <italic>asbCD</italic>, yielding a product similar but not identical to petrobactin. For instance, upstream of <italic>asbAB</italic>, an acyl-carrier protein (CP157_00999) is encoded that may take over the role of the aryl-carrier protein encoded in <italic>asbD</italic> in the petrobactin biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Nusca et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Biosynthetic gene clusters potentially involved in bioactivity include PKSs, NRPSs, bacteriocins, and betalactones. Their gene products and cluster organization are often more diverse and hence show lower similarity with known database entries. The bacteriocin cluster found on pCP157_02 consists of ten genes, of which three are upstream of the core biosynthesis gene and oriented in reverse direction. The core biosynthesis gene is uncharacterized, but contains a DUF692, which is characteristic for bacteriocin biosynthesis genes. AntiSMASH identified one large hybrid BSGC on pCP157_02 consisting of the extrachromosomal AHL synthase gene (CP157_03447) mentioned above, several putative PKS and NRPS genes. Most of the PKS and NRPS genes show a 30&#x02013;60% amino acid sequence similarity to homologous genes in the MIBiG database. A separate PKS cluster was found on cCP157, with a type 3 polyketide synthase as core biosynthesis gene, several response regulators and histidine-kinases. The chromosomal betalactone cluster includes several catabolic genes and a sensor histidine-kinase, but shows no overall correlation with known BSGCs. The similarity to antiSMASH database entries was low (5&#x02013;28%) and yielded no matches with other <italic>Paracoccus</italic> genomes.</p><p>AntiSMASH results obtained for CP157 were compared with those for 50 other <italic>Paracoccus</italic> strains. A total of 303 BSGCs belonging to 15 different cluster types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>) were identified by antiSMASH. The chromosomal AHL cluster of CP157 had very high synteny (92&#x02013;100%) with other <italic>Paracoccus</italic> AHL clusters. BSGCs involved in AHL production were found in all <italic>Paracoccus</italic> strains. While 75% of the compared strains harbored only one AHL cluster, 25% had 2&#x02013;4 different ones, indicating that <italic>quorum sensing</italic> is a general and important feature of this genus. The next most common cluster types were NRPS (in 63% of the compared <italic>Paracoccus</italic> strains), PKS-NRPS-HSR-hybrid clusters (60%) and bacteriocin (52%). NRPS clusters of 13 <italic>Paracoccus</italic> in the database showed partial (20&#x02013;42%) similarity with biosynthesis pathways of known siderophores, for instance myxochelin, fusachelin, and vicibactin. In most cases, the similarity extended over 3&#x02013;4 core or accessory biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The HSR-PKS-NRPS hybrid cluster (on pCP157_02) of CP157, was also found in the genomes of <italic>P. haeundaensis</italic> CCGMCC 1.8012 and <italic>Paracoccus</italic> sp. Arc7-R13 (&#x0003e;95% identity). The same elements found in the hybrid BSGC were identified, however, as individual clusters in the genomes of <italic>P. marcusii</italic> and <italic>P. hibiscisoli</italic> type strains. It can be assumed that their separation on different scaffolds has prevented identification as one large cluster. Comparison of the CP157 bacteriocin cluster with antiSMASH database entries led to matches between all ten genes and bacteriocin BSGCs found in the close relatives <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. 228 and Arc7-R13. Interestingly, all other hits in the database show a high synteny as well, but possess only the seven genes that neighbor the core biosynthesis gene in the CP157 gene cluster. Further fairly common BSGCs encode for ectoine (39%), betalactone (29%), T1PKS (27%), terpene (27%, mostly carotenoids), T3PKS (24%), and siderophore (24%). T1PKS and T3PKS do not occur together in most strains, the exceptions being <italic>Paracoccus</italic> sp. BM15, CP157 and its close relative <italic>Paracoccus</italic> sp. PAMC 22219. All BSGCs found in the genomes of CP157, DSM 11574T, CCGMCC 1.8012, and Arc7-R13 were highly similar (80&#x02013;100%) in organization and size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, the similarity between BSGCs found in the type strain of <italic>P. hibiscisoli</italic> and the clusters detected in the other four strains was much lower (30&#x02013;60%), which coincides with their lower genome similarity revealed via DDH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4.SS3"><title>Bioactivity of CP157 Culture Extracts</title><sec id="S4.SS3.SSS1"><title>Broad-Range Antimicrobial Activity of CP157 Culture Extracts</title><p>Extracts prepared from CP157 cultures grown in MB showed antagonistic activity toward eight out of ten target strains and inhibited all strains retrieved from the same habitat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).

Inhibition of extracts after growth with proline was only observed for 2/3 of the biological replicates. For extracts prepared after growth with glucose only one technical replicate showed antagonistic activity, which did not allow calculation of AU. Reproduction of this result led to the conclusion that glucose does not provide a suitable substrate for reproducible production of the antibacterial compound.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3.SSS2"><title>Effect of CP157 Cultures and Extracts on Growth of Microalgae and <italic>A. salina</italic> Larvae</title><p><italic>Thalassiosira rotula</italic> did not show any response to the presence of CP157 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

Growth of <italic>S. marinoi</italic> was also negatively affected by any type of extract (MB/culture), possibly related to MB medium components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Clear differences between treatment with CP157 extract or MB extract were observed only at the lowest concentration (10 mg/ml). <italic>S. marinoi</italic> cultures treated with 10 mg/ml CP157 extract showed a strong decrease in relative fluorescence (&#x02212;46%) within the first 24 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Subsequently, relative fluorescence continued to decrease until only 19% fluorescence was retained at the end of the experiment. In contrast, <italic>S. marinoi</italic> cultures treated with 10 mg/ml MB extract showed a strong increase of relative fluorescence within the first 2 days (+79%). This was followed by a continuous decrease of measured values. At the end of the experiment 73% fluorescence was retained, indicating that adverse effects caused by MB components are most pronounced at high concentrations thus concealing any other effects possibly caused by CP157 extracts. It should be noted, that chain formation of microalgae and the resulting uneven distribution in the wells led to high variations between measured values obtained for biological or technical replicates.</p><p>The effect of CP157 cells and culture extracts on <italic>A. salina</italic> larvae was observed for 4 days. Natural mortality of larvae in untreated wells increased greatly after day 3 due to starvation and accumulation of waste products. Consequently, only effects of tested treatments observed within the first 3 days after exposure are presented.

No living larvae were observed after day 1. Even though treatment of <italic>A. salina</italic> with MB extract (medium control) also resulted in increased mortality (40&#x02013;60%, day 1), the effect was clearly less pronounced compared to CP157 culture extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

For 15 strains more peaks were recorded in XAD-16 than XAD-7 extracts.

Even though the distribution of strains among the clusters is not identical for the two datasets, several subclusters are similarly arranged. In both cases, extracts from C13, DSM 14827T, and LMG 25392T show high euclidean distances to all other extracts and are moderately to highly dissimilar to each other. Extracts of the closely related type strains of <italic>P. marcusii</italic> DSM 11574T and <italic>P. haeundaensis</italic> LMG P-21903T and of their close relatives CP32 and CP35 are grouped together with low distances. Extracts of the latter two strains cluster very closely together, which indicates that their metabolite profiles are very similar. Interestingly, extracts from CP157 do not belong to this group, but cluster with DSM 8512T, DSM 19484T, KACC 18933T, and GWS-SE-H131. Extracts in this CP157 subcluster show moderate to high similarity to each other (indicated by low euclidean distances), especially the closely related strains CP157, GWS-SE-H131 and the type strain of <italic>P. hibiscisoli</italic> KACC18933T. In the XAD-16 dataset the CP157 subcluster further includes extracts from its close relative 49B05. In both datasets extracts from <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. CP137 and 3501 do not fall within a distinct cluster but have quite high distances to all other extracts. In the XAD-16 dataset no significant correlation between euclidean distance of culture extracts and the phylogenetic distance of their producers was observed, while a weak correlation was found in the XAD-7 dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). This is most clearly illustrated in the case of close relatives of CP157 which fall into several different subclusters in either of the two datasets. Moreover, no significant correlation between similarity of extracts and the habitats of their producers was observed.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p><italic>Paracoccus</italic> culture extracts prepared with <bold>(A)</bold> XAD-7 or <bold>(B)</bold> XAD-16 are clustered according to their similarity (decreasing euclidian similarity from bright to dark) based on their composition (presence/absence of compounds) and the intensity of individual signals.

The presence of inactive fractions between active ones allows the assumption that CP157 crude extracts contain several antibacterial compounds. Further separation of bioactive fractions yielded 243 subfractions out of which 51 were tested positive for antibacterial activity. Out of those, 27 subfractions produced inhibition zones in at least two technical replicates and were thus considered as suitable candidates for downstream analysis (data not shown). The low amount of biological material, however, did not suffice to identify an antibacterial compound.

Furthermore, antibacterial activity of CP157 and 16 other <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. was observed. Bioactivity of the here tested <italic>Paracoccus</italic> strains extends from antibiosis over signaling to hemolysis, of which the latter has so far not been reported for members of this genus. Corresponding genes found in the CP157 genome are similar (&#x0003e;40%) to those of &#x003b1;-hemolysin (<italic>hlyA</italic>) and adenylate-cyclase toxin (<italic>cyaA</italic>) of pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Gardiner et al., 2017</xref>). In both cases, the gene products are known to possess cytotoxic activity toward a broad range of eukaryotic cell types (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig and Goebel, 2006</xref>). These products induce pore formation causing leakage of nutrients from the target cell, which can contribute to survival of the producing bacterium in harsh environments thus increasing the number of potential habitats available to CP157 for colonization (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Mogrovejo-Arias et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Though culture extracts had a broad-range antibacterial activity, the effect on closely related strains from the same habitat was the strongest. This is a characteristic of bacteriocins, which are low mass weight, protein-like compounds of variable chemical character (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Morton et al., 2015</xref>). They have a multitude of functions, but receive most attention for their antimicrobial properties (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azevedo et al., 2015</xref>). We found a bacteriocin BSGC with the characteristic DUF692 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>) in the genome of CP157. In addition, bacteriocin clusters are among the three most common BSGCs of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. However, (core) biosynthesis genes could not be associated with any known bacteriocin clusters. Consequently, we assume that CP157 produces a so far unknown bacteriocin-like bioactive compound.</p><p>Further, PKS and NRPS clusters are not only encoded in the genome of CP157 but are the most abundant BSGCs found in <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. Products from PKS and NRPS clusters are among the most prominent bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant natural compounds (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hringer et al., 2017</xref>). Their activities range from antibacterial and iron scavenging to the biosynthesis of cell wall components or surfactants (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lautru and Challis, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Desriac et al., 2013</xref>). Our analysis indicates that in several cases <italic>Paracoccus</italic> NRPS clusters are more likely involved in biosynthesis of siderophores than production of antimicrobials. This theory is further supported by findings from <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2014)</xref>, who assigned the synthesis of individual parabactin moieties in <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> to NRPS. Especially type 1 PKS are, however, known to directly synthesize antimicrobial compounds such as macrolides (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Le et al., 2014</xref>), type 3 PKS often provide the building blocks for subsequent modification and tailoring by T1PKS or NRPS (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Katsuyama and Ohnishi, 2012</xref>). Differences observed between <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. in their range of antibacterial activity, might possibly trace back to such downstream modification of gene products or synthesis from different substrates. For example T3PKS and especially the adenylation domains of NRPSs are known to accept various substrates, hence producing multiple structural analogs (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lautru and Challis, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hug et al., 2019</xref>). Both leads to the synthesis of strain-specific compounds that differ in their mode of action and thus their efficacy toward bacterial targets (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hug et al., 2019</xref>). <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">de Bruijn et al. (2015)</xref> sequenced and compared the genomes of five <italic>Lysobacter</italic> spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) with experimental evidence for antimicrobial activity spectra and production of extracellular, lytic enzymes. Similarly to our comparison of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. they found so far unrecognized potential for bioactivity in all tested strains, but distinct differences in the extent of antagonistic activity. Taking into account the different isolation sources of the here tested strains, &#x0201c;customized&#x0201d; bioactive compounds could be the result of adaptation to new environmental conditions (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Guerrero-Garz&#x000f3;n et al., 2020</xref>). This is further supported considering the diverse metabolic profiles found in <italic>Paracoccus</italic> culture extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Even though no significant correlation between extract composition and producer habitat could be found, we speculate that highly different and thus rather unique culture extracts of host-associated strains such as C13 or DSM 14827T hint to habitat-specific metabolite production. Future in-depth analysis and comparison of more <italic>Paracoccus</italic> genomes with regard to PKS/NRPS BSGCs and their gene products will help validating this assumption.</p><p>In confined habitats characterized by bacterial communities with high species richness such as biofilms, strong selective pressure favors the diversification of metabolic products (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). The low similarity of detected BSGCs with known bacteriocin or NRPS/PKS clusters suggests that their gene products are likely to be novel compounds (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, there are no described bacteriocins, bioactive polyketides, or ribosomal peptides of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. even though PKS and NRPS clusters have been found in several members of the genus (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gra&#x000e7;a et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Machado et al., 2015</xref>).

Y41 that shows antagonistic activity toward <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gromek et al., 2016</xref>). Our comparisons thus indicate a so far unrecognized potential of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. for biosynthesis of diverse bioactive compounds.</p></sec><sec id="S5.SS2"><title>CP157 Produces Multiple Small Antibacterial Compounds</title><p>Physico-chemical characterization of crude extracts of CP157 showed that the active compounds are rather polar, resist proteinase K treatment and acidic pH, but slowly degrade over time when exposed to heat and alkaline pH. As stated above, analysis of the CP157 genome indicates that the strain might produce a bacteriocin. Due to their proteinaceous nature, bacteriocins are usually sensitive to heat and proteolytic enzymes. But specialized chemical structures such as salt bridges and hydrogen bonds increase resistance of bacteriocins to unfavorable conditions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ansari et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our results, we assume that a bacteriocin-like compound produced by CP157 may be equipped with such modifications, which, to a certain degree, protect it from degradation by heat or changes in pH.</p><p>Most bacteriocins described for Gram-negative bacteria are larger than 20 kDa and only few exceptions within the Gammaproteobacteria such as microcins or colicins are smaller than 10 kDa (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Papagianni and Anastasiadou, 2009</xref>). Considering the detection limit of our instrumentation to substances &#x0003c;2 kDa, we assume that none of the candidate compounds identified in the culture extract of CP157 represents a bacteriocin, but that they correspond to other, smaller bioactive molecules. Hence we conclude that multiple small antibacterial compounds are produced by CP157 in addition to the presumed bacteriocin. This assumption is further supported by identification of multiple bioactive fractions in CP157 culture extracts. The presence of several chemically distinct, bioactive compounds would also explain the retained inhibition of target strains after heating. Thermal degradation of the bacteriocin would lead to the smaller inhibition zones, while antimicrobial activity of other, heat-stable compounds remains. Based on the identified BSGCs, we assume that further antimicrobials are products of PKS and NRPS or hybrids thereof. <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Timmermans et al. (2017)</xref> summarized information on marine bioactive metabolites, mentioning several examples of PKS-NRPS hybrids such as thalassospiramides and didemnines as products of Alphaproteobacteria. Among the described polyketides are several compounds with masses &#x0003c;1 kDa. Multiple bioactivities are reported for polyketides and NRPs including antibacterial, antifungal or anticancer activities (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Desriac et al., 2013</xref>). Our attempts to isolate and characterize chemical species from <italic>Paracoccus</italic> culture extracts were limited by low amounts of obtained biological material and the detection range of our instrumentation. Development of improved extraction and isolation procedures for instance via modification of culture conditions and upscaling, to enable the implication of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, would be required for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S5.SS3"><title>Ecological Niche of CP157 and Role of Secondary Metabolites in Adaptation</title><p>With 22 ECs, CP157 currently has the genome with the highest number of ECs documented for members of the <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic>. This high number of ECs is a proof for genetic flexibility and might provide the basis for fast adaptation to new environmental conditions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2015</xref>). The genetic components required for successful adaptation are often obtained via horizontal gene transfer from an existing bacterial community (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Guerrero-Garz&#x000f3;n et al., 2020</xref>). The numerous ECs likely provide a competitive advantage for CP157, for instance due to additional BSGCs on plasmid pCP157_02.</p><p>Based on our results, we assume that CP157 and possibly other <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. investigated in this study are opportunistic pathogens to their hosts. This is supported considering that CP157 is ubiquitous on the carapace of diseased <italic>C. pagurus</italic> specimens, but occurs in strongly elevated abundances in black spots (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bergen, 2018</xref>). So far, an opportunistic lifestyle of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> spp. has only been described for strains of <italic>Paracoccus yeei</italic>, contributing to wound infection in humans (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lasek et al., 2018</xref>). In a state prior to disease development, CP157 may protect its host from settlement of larvae and other pathogens, as has been demonstrated for another member of the <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic>, <italic>Phaeobacter inhibens</italic> 2.10, a symbiont of the macroalga <italic>Ulva australis</italic> (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2007</xref>). The type of interactions between bacteria and their host organism is determined by multiple environmental factors and exchanged metabolic products. Bacterial symbionts may switch from mutualistic to pathogenic when the external parameters change, as described for <italic>P. inhibens</italic>, producing algicides, once the aging algal host leaks increasing amounts of <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Vibrio corallilyticus</italic>, a coral pathogen, presence of chitin leads to changes in its exometabolome and an increase in secondary metabolite production (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Giubergia et al., 2016</xref>). In its natural environment, CP157 occurs together with several <italic>Aquimarina</italic> spp. that are particularly abundant in diseased areas on the <italic>C. pagurus</italic> carapace (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Aquimarina</italic> spp. are known chitin-degraders and presumed to play a role in disease progression or even development (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Quinn et al., 2017</xref>). We assume that CP157, which is not able to degrade chitin or its monomer <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine itself, benefits from the progressing penetration of the exoskeleton by <italic>Aquimarina</italic> spp. Our hypothesis is supported by a study from <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Smolowitz et al. (2005)</xref>, describing the stages of progressing epizooic shell disease in the American lobster, <italic>Homarus americanus</italic>. Initial physical injury is followed by microbial colonization and degradation by chitinolytic bacteria. This is largely accompanied by non-chitinolytic bacteria that colonize spaces in the crystal lattice of chitin, where they feed on proteins and amino acid-rich substrates. This scenario fits particularly well, taking into account that amino acids enable growth of CP157 and production of bioactive metabolites when supplied as single substrates. Considering the growth inhibition of <italic>Aquimarina</italic> sp. CP51 by CP157 culture extracts, we hypothesize that secondary metabolite production of CP157 might be influenced, similarly to <italic>V. corallilyticus</italic>, by elevated concentrations of chitin, its degradation products or the increasing availability of amino acids that may result from abrasion or microbial degradation of the cuticle. Co-cultivation experiments of CP157 with <italic>Aquimarina</italic> strains from the same habitat, or the evaluation of the impact of chitin on CP157 may provide further insight into the ecological role of CP157 secondary metabolites and the interactions with its neighbors.</p><p>With regard to bacteria-bacteria interactions, we assume that secondary metabolites of CP157 have a strong impact on the composition of the epibiotic community of <italic>C. pagurus</italic>. Via production of its diverse bioactive compounds, CP157 may prevent or enhance the settlement and development of specific community members in its immediate environment. Exemplarily, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al. (2007)</xref> demonstrated that AHLs produced by <italic>Phaeobacter inhibens</italic> 2.10 actively select for specific organisms to colonize <italic>U. australis</italic>. In addition, they showed, that <italic>P. inhibens</italic> 2.10 is able to prevent settlement of other bacteria even at low cell densities. We have observed such selective antibiosis in the inhibition patterns of CP157. The strong antibacterial activity of CP157 to closely related strains combined with self-resistance may thus provide a competitive advantage over occupants of the same ecological niche (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Egan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Mullis et al., 2019</xref>). Simultaneously, settlement of &#x0201c;useful&#x0201d; neighbors that provide metabolic products as substrates, or a mature biofilm matrix may be favored by attracting them via signaling compounds (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Giubergia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wolter, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, antimicrobial activity of another <italic>Phaeobacter</italic> strain (<italic>P. gallaeciensis</italic> BS107) was most pronounced when kept in co-culture with <italic>Vibrio anguillarum</italic> 408 (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Ponte et al., 1999</xref>). Assuming that CP157 is both emitter and recipient of QS signals, CP157 may respond similarly to environmental factors and microbial cues, either by increased or decreased production of bioactive metabolites.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the degree of antibiotic activity in CP157 culture extracts does not increase significantly with incubation time. In a closed system this may result from feedback repression once a certain threshold concentration is reached. This is supported, considering the stability of CP157 culture extracts under the tested conditions, making it more likely that bioactive compounds are not degraded, but that production has ceased. To resolve questions regarding biosynthesis and production kinetics, identification and isolation of pure substances is required. This would further enable investigation of dose-dependent interactions between CP157 secondary metabolites and other microbial community members or host organisms to determine their ecological role.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
