So far, the best pest control strategy is still the application of streptomycin, which is also a first-line antibiotic in veterinary medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kumar et al. 2010</xref>). In Europe, the use of streptomycin is strongly restricted, in order to prevent residues of the antibiotic in fruits and honey. Furthermore, the development of streptomycin resistance in plant pathogens decreases efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">McManus et al. 2002</xref>). Therefore, alternative treatments are desirable. The use of antagonistic microbes as biological control organisms (BCOs) offers an alternative approach for environmentally friendly plant protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mayerhofer et al. 2009</xref>). BCOs possess properties that allow them to quickly establish a stable population on leaf surfaces and suppress plant pathogens in the competition for space, water, nutrients, and trace elements, for example, by production of antibiotics and nutrient-scavenging substances such as siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Loper and Buyer 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Raaijmakers et al. 2002</xref>). Moreover, some BCOs interfere with the quorum-sensing processes that are necessary for expression of virulence genes of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Dong et al. 2004</xref>). BCOs are naturally occurring, nonpathogenic, epiphytic organisms and could pose a lower risk to human health than conventional chemical pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Berg 2009</xref>). In biological control research, the fast-growing Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> is of great interest, and three isolates are registered for fire blight control in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, that is, <italic>Pantoea vagans</italic> (formerly: <italic>P. agglomerans</italic>) C9-1 as BlightBan C9-1&#x02122;, <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> E325 as Bloomtime Biological&#x02122;, and <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> P10c as BlossomBless&#x02122;. <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> strains are ubiquitous and a variety of isolates produce antibiotics such as pantocin A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Sutton and Clardy 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jin et al. 2003</xref>), <sc>d</sc>-alanylgriseoluteic acid (AGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giddens and Bean 2007</xref>), andrimid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jin et al. 2006</xref>), and the E325 antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Pusey et al. 2008</xref>). Recently, 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine (APV) was identified from <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> and was found to inhibit the growth of a broad range of bacterial plant pathogens (e.g., <italic>E. amylovora</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pathovars, <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>), and also the growth of the human pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and the yeast <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sammer et al. 2009</xref>). APV has been detected in in vitro cultures of <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> 48b/90 (Pa48b). The so-called dapdiamides antibiotics are closely related to APV and were found in the strain <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> CU0119. A recent study describes the production of APV in the BCO <italic>P. vagans</italic> C9-1, which produces in addition the antibiotic pantocin A. The latter is associated with the suppression of <italic>E. amylovora</italic> in planta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ishimaru 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Stockwell et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dawlaty et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kamber et al. 2012</xref>). However, the efficiency of APV in the interaction between pathogens and the antagonist has not been studied in apple blossom assays, which are close to the natural infection process. Immature pear slice assays revealed so far a weaker biocontrol efficacy of an APV-negative mutant than the wild-type <italic>P. vagans</italic> C9-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kamber et al. 2012</xref>). APV is the only antibiotic compound produced by strain Pa48b, and it is produced in vitro in high concentrations (up to 0.9 mg/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sammer et al. 2009</xref>). Therefore, strain Pa48b is an ideal candidate to investigate the influence of APV on the biocontrol of bacterial pathogens. We performed comparative plant experiments between wild-type Pa48b and an APV-negative mutant coinoculated with <italic>E. amylovora</italic> in order to evaluate their biocontrol activity. Additionally, we used <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv<italic>. glycinea</italic> (Psg) on soybean as a second plant model system to test the relevance of APV in biocontrol interactions. The successful biological control of Psg by Pa48b has been shown previously under both greenhouse and field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">V&#x000f6;lksch et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">V&#x000f6;lksch and May 2001</xref>). In previous studies, APV inhibits Psg under laboratory conditions, but its minimal inhibitory concentration is 10-times higher compared with that of <italic>E. amylovora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sammer et al. 2009</xref>). Here, we address the growth inhibition capacity of APV on bacterial plant pathogens in plant experiments under greenhouse conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, we describe in this study the production profiles of APV of two <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> strains in detail and their relevance for their biocontrol efficacy against <italic>E. amylovora</italic> and Psg in plant experiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and media</title><p>Bacteria used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> and <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic> strains were maintained on Standard I (St1; Roth, Karlsruhe) agar plates and cultured at 28&#x000b0;C. <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>glycinea</italic> was cultured and maintained on King's B agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">King et al. 1954</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> S17-1&#x003bb;pir was maintained on St1 and grown at 37&#x000b0;C.

The control inoculation with Psg caused typical chlorotic halos under both temperature conditions, whereas in coinoculation with Pa48b or Pa48b-C1, no chlorotic symptom formation was observed. Under moderate temperature conditions in single inoculation, the pathogen population reached about 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/wound. The coinoculation of Psg with Pa48b or its APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1 leads to a decrease of the pathogen population by two orders of magnitude at 20&#x02013;26&#x000b0;C compared with the growth of the pathogen alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A).

This was due to the nonoptimal temperature conditions for growth of Psg. The resulting ratio was therefore 1:2 instead of 5:1 (antagonist:pathogen). Under these conditions, the high initial pathogen population allowed the pathogen to establish and spread faster compared with the lower initial pathogen populations at 20&#x02013;26&#x000b0;C.

Same is postulated for <italic>P. vagans</italic> C9-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kamber et al. 2012</xref>). DdaI is predicted to be a transmembrane efflux pump and is supposed to mediate self-resistance to the antibiotic. DdaC, an Fe(II)/&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase homolog, was shown to catalyze the epoxidation during diaminopeptide biosynthesis, which occurs only in one of the five DAPs of <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> CU0119 (DAP E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sammer et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hollenhorst et al. 2010</xref>) that is very similar to APV.

Megaplasmid preparation and Southern blot analysis using a 0.5-kb fragment of the <italic>apvD</italic> gene as DIG-labeled DNA probe for hybridization showed that the APV biosynthesis gene cluster is also located on a megaplasmid in Pa48b. Interestingly, antibiotics with similar chemical structures to APV occur in a range of Gram-negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Shoji et al. 1989</xref>) and Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Molloy et al. 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cooper et al. 1988</xref>).

Most likely, the different strains acquired the necessary genes by horizontal gene transfer. The location of the gene cluster on a megaplasmid could have facilitated the transfer to other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Thomas and Nielsen 2005</xref>). The sequence of the APV gene cluster was also found in the genome of <italic>S. proteamaculans</italic> 568, but the production of APV by this strain has not been described so far. In silico analysis of the APV biosynthesis gene cluster revealed two gene overlaps of 8 and 14 bp, respectively, which are likely to be involved in the regulation of APV biosynthesis in Pa48b. We assume that the APV biosynthesis is highly regulated on both transcriptional and translational level due to the high toxicity of the antibiotic to growing cells. The overlaps could enhance coordinated transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Krakauer 2000</xref>) in order to ensure the coordinated biosynthesis of APV. This would prevent the accumulation of cytotoxic 2,3-diaminopropionate-containing precursor of APV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hollenhorst et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dawlaty et al. 2010</xref>).

Mutations that caused the loss of herbicolin I production resulted in reduced pathogen suppression on immature pear slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kamber et al. 2012</xref>). We assessed the possible role of APV in out-competing of other microorganisms by studying the interaction between APV nonproducing antagonists and plant pathogenic bacteria in different model systems which represent natural infection sites such as apple flowers and wounded leaves. Relevance for in planta antagonism had been shown before for other classes of antibiotics produced by <italic>P. agglomerans</italic>. Pantocin A and B negative double mutants of <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> Eh318 had a weaker biocontrol efficacy on <italic>E. amylovora</italic> than the wild-type. However, single mutants of Eh318 deficient in the production of either one of the two antibiotics were similarly active against <italic>E. amylovora</italic> as the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Wright and Beer 1996</xref>). Likewise, the production of the phenazine antibiotic AGA of Eh1087 significantly enhanced the competitiveness against <italic>E. amylovora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Giddens et al. 2003</xref>). APV of Pa48b strongly inhibits the growth of <italic>E. amylovora</italic> under laboratory conditions. A single transposon insertion in <italic>apvB</italic> resulted in the complete loss of growth inhibition of <italic>E. amylovora</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv<italic>. glycinea</italic> in agar diffusion assays. The disruption of <italic>apvB</italic> leads to an absence of <sc>l</sc>-2,3-diaminopropionate, which acts as a glutamine analog in susceptible organisms. This inhibits the enzyme activity of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlmS), a key enzyme in cell wall biosynthesis. In plant experiments, apple blossoms and soybean leaves were treated with wild-type Pa48b and the APV deficient mutant Pa48b-C1 and were infected with the pathogens <italic>E. amylovora</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv<italic>. glycinea,</italic> respectively. The APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1 still suppressed the fire blight pathogen <italic>E. amylovora,</italic> as well as disease symptoms on apple blossoms, but its efficacy was inferior to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>A). The bacteriostatic effect of APV can be compensated for in vitro by supplementation with <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine, a compound that is likely not abundant on apple blossom surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Milewski 2002</xref>). Biochemical analysis of pomaceous stigma exudates showed a high quantity of sugars like glucose, fructose, and sucrose and extremely low amounts of amino acids. The predominantly found amino acids were proline, asparagines, glutamine, and serine in a total amount of 0.35 pg per flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Pusey 2006</xref>).</p><p>In order to show the impact of purified APV on the pathogen Psg inoculated in soybean leaves, APV was applied directly onto infected wounds. The application of APV on the leaves only leads to a minor decrease of Psg population compared with nontreated Psg-infected wounds. The antibiotic may not diffuse into the leaf and therefore did not reach the pathogen inside the leaf. Additionally, Psg is less sensitive to APV than <italic>E. amylovora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sammer et al. 2009</xref>). Moreover, increased concentrations of APV (20 &#x003bc;g/wound) caused severe damage of leaf tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, coinoculation with Pa48b caused a significant decrease in the pathogen population in infected wounds and prevented symptom development. Furthermore, no differences in the biocontrol efficacies of Pa48b and its APV deficient mutant Pa48b-C1 on Psg on soybean leaves were observed. Under all tested temperature conditions, the antagonists equally inhibited the growth of the pathogen Psg despite their difference in APV production. Therefore, APV could not be a key factor in the antagonism. Interestingly, both Pa48b and Pa48b-C1 benefit from the coinoculation with the pathogens, <italic>E. amylovora</italic> or Psg, which resulted in a one to two orders of magnitude higher population compared with their single inoculation. Similar observations were described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Braun et al. (2009</xref>) for the potential biocontrol organism <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv<italic>. syringae</italic> 22d/93 (Pss22d) in coinoculation with Psg. Pss22d grows 10-fold higher in coinoculation than in single inoculation and may cause starvation of Psg that keeps the pathogen below the threshold for disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Braun et al. 2009</xref>). Likewise, Pa48b and Pa48b-C1 quickly established a stable population in artificial wounds on soybean leaves and therefore represent a competitor for nutrients. The utilization of the same class of organic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates as energy sources is likely. <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> have a large overlap in their spectrum of usable carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Wilson and Lindow 1994</xref>). Moreover, only 5&#x02013;10% of the initial pathogen population survived the inoculation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Braun et al. 2010</xref>). Psg, as a soybean-adapted pathogen, recovers rapidly within 1 day in single inoculations, whereas in competition with Pa48b, the pathogen population grows much slower. Interestingly, no decline of the antagonist population (Pa48b and Pa48b-C1) was observed after inoculation. Another aspect regarding nutritional competition is connected to the low iron availability on leaf surfaces and the production of iron-scavenging siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Loper and Buyer 1991</xref>). Preliminary tests showed that Pa39b produces five times more of the high-affinity siderophore enterobactin than Pa48b (data not shown). Iron limitation caused by the antagonist could also be involved in pathogen suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Temple et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Wensing et al. 2010</xref>) However, from this study we can conclude that the production of APV is not the key factor for <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> Pa48b to out-compete plant pathogens. But, APV could contribute to increase the overall fitness of <italic>P. agglomerans</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Wensing et al. (2010</xref>) showed that the production of siderophores by antagonists support their successful and fast colonization of harsh habitats like plant surfaces. Further studies on the siderophore production of Pa48b and Pa39b will reveal the role of siderophores in the biocontrol of Psg or <italic>E. amylovora</italic>.</p><p>The production of secondary metabolites is a necessary tool to compete with plant pathogens secreting effector proteins (van Dijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">1999</xref>) and/or phytotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">N&#x000fc;ske and Fritsche 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bender et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barzic 1999</xref>) that are formed at 18&#x02013;20&#x000b0;C by different <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pathovars typical of cold weather pathogens. Phytotoxins such as phaseolotoxin, coronatine, or persicomycin enable the pathogen to infect the plant and cause damage on plant tissue, implying a severe change in the habitat of epiphytic organisms such as <italic>P. agglomerans</italic>. Furthermore, temperature fluctuations between day and night could favor APV production at colder nights. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pusey and Curry (2004</xref>) showed that <italic>E. amylovora</italic> colonizes apple blossoms even at temperatures between 9 and 14&#x000b0;C which is also the optimal temperature for APV production. Interestingly, the closely related pathogen <italic>E. amylovora</italic> is even more affected by Pa48b and Pa39b than Psg. In immature pear slice assays, Pa39b inhibited <italic>E. amylovora</italic> strains more effectively than Pa48b. Considering that Pa39b produces only minimal amounts of APV but five times more enterobactin than Pa48b, this could be involved in pathogen suppression and will be further investigated with siderophore knockout mutants. Furthermore, we showed that both <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> strains established stable populations on plant surfaces as quickly as the pathogens or faster. We conclude that a rapid colonization of the habitat by the antagonist in a broad temperature range is a major factor for the successful biocontrol of plant pathogens and that the production of secondary metabolites supports that process. The heterogeneity of <italic>Pantoea</italic> strains that was shown in this study as a result of the production of both antibiotic and siderophores could be useful for biocontrol. A new approach in the application of biocontrol organisms could be to use mixtures of different <italic>Pantoea</italic> strains which was also discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Stockwell et al. (2011</xref>). A mixture of biocontrol strains that produce different antibiotics could prevent resistance development in a pathogen population. Moreover, a broader spectrum of secondary metabolites (i.e., siderophores) that are produced by the antagonists could lead to a better adaption to environmental conditions and to reliable pathogen suppression. However, in previous field trials with mixed inocula of the BCOs <italic>P. vagans</italic> C9-1 and <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> A506 against <italic>E. amylovora</italic>, it was revealed that there was an incompatibility between the two strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Stockwell et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">2011</xref>). An extracellular protease of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> A506 cleaves pantocin A, an antibiotic of <italic>P. vagans</italic> C9-1 essential for its biocontrol efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Anderson et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>We believe that a mixture of <italic>Pantoea</italic> strains promises less incompatibility problems. We propose for future studies to investigate these strain mixtures in order to get better suppression of fire blight and bacterial blight disease, not only in the laboratory and greenhouse but also under field conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Ulrike F.
