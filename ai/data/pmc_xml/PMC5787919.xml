Deletion of <italic>rifQ</italic> had little impact on bacterial growth, but resulted in improved rifamycin production, which was consistent with the reverse transcription PCR results that RifQ negatively regulated <italic>rifP</italic>&#x02019;s transcription. With electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I Footprinting assay, RifQ was found to directly bind to the promoter region of <italic>rifP</italic>, and a typical inverted repeat was identified within the RifQ-protected sequences. The transcription initiation site of <italic>rifP</italic> was further characterized and found to be upstream of the RifQ binding sites, well explaining the RifQ-mediated repression of <italic>rifP</italic>&#x02019;s transcription in vivo. Moreover, rifamycin B (the end product of rifamycin biosynthesis) remarkably decreased the DNA binding affinity of RifQ, which led to derepression of rifamycin export, reducing the intracellular concentration of rifamycin B as well as its toxicity against the host.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Here, we proved that the export of rifamycin B was repressed by RifQ in <italic>Amycolatopsis mediterranei</italic>, and the RifQ-mediated repression could be specifically relieved by rifamycin B, the end product of rifamycin biosynthesis, based on which a feedback model was proposed for regulation of rifamycin export. With the findings here, one could improve the antibiotic yield by simply inactivating the negative regulator of the antibiotic transporter.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12934-018-0863-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rifamycin</kwd><kwd><italic>Amycolatopsis mediterranei</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>rifQ</italic></kwd><kwd>Export</kwd><kwd>Feedback regulation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31430004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Guoping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Actinomycetes produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, including more than 70% of known antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is generally thought that antibiotics are produced by the hosts to inhibit competing microorganisms in the environment, guaranteeing competitive growth advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the antibiotics could also be toxic to the host cells, and therefore the synthesis of antibiotics is usually under strict control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Besides, the hosts have developed several other strategies to protect themselves, which may include chemical modification of the antibiotics, mutation of the intracellular target of the antibiotics and export of the antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In many cases, two or more strategies are employed to provide the best protection of the host from the threat of the antibiotic toxicity.</p><p id="Par5">Rifamycin belongs to ansamycin, consisting of a naphthalene chromophore bridged by a long aliphatic chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and it specifically binds to the &#x003b2;-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) with high affinity, blocking the mRNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As rifamycin and its derivatives are especially effective against mycobacteria, they are still used as the first-line drugs for treating infections caused by tuberculosis, leprosy and&#x000a0;the mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Rifamycins are mainly produced by <italic>Amycolatopsis mediterranei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], although there was a report that a marine bacterium, <italic>Salinispora arenicola</italic>, also possessed the ability to synthesize rifamycins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To facilitate the study of the rifamycin biosynthesis, the nearly 100-kb rifamycin biosynthetic cluster (<italic>rif</italic>) was first sequenced in <italic>A. mediterranei</italic> S699 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Totally, 44 genes were revealed in the cluster, including five large polyketide synthase genes, eight genes associated with the 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) biosynthesis, two regulators and several tailor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, RifZ, one of the two regulators within <italic>rif</italic> cluster, was found to be involved in rifamycin biosynthesis and was characterized as a pathway-specific regulator for <italic>rif</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, it is still unclear whether the export of rifamycin is regulated. Besides, the biological function of RifQ, the other regulator annotated within <italic>rif</italic> cluster, is also unknown.</p><p id="Par6"><italic>rifQ</italic> locates downstream of <italic>rifP</italic>, which encodes a rifamycin efflux pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and the two genes co-transcribe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Unlike RifZ, which is a LuxR-family regulator, RifQ belongs to the TetR family. In this study, we systematically studied RifQ and characterized it as a specific repressor for <italic>rifP</italic>&#x02019;s transcription, demonstrating its regulatory role in rifamycin export. Similar to what found with TetR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the end product of rifamycin biosynthesis, rifamycin B, was found to specifically decrease the RifQ binding affinity against the promoter of <italic>rifP</italic>, which therefore derepressed the rifamycin export to reduce the intracellular concentration of rifamycin B as well as the antibiotic toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Disruption of <italic>rifQ</italic> dramatically improved the rifamycin production</title><p id="Par7">The RifQ regulator belonged to the TetR-family and was highly homologous to the VarR in <italic>Streptomyces virginiae</italic> (63% identity, 78% similarity) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To investigate the biological function of RifQ, we in-frame knocked out <italic>rifQ</italic>, and measured both the growth and rifamycin production of the <italic>rifQ</italic> null mutant (<italic>&#x00394;rifQ</italic>).

We also noticed the rifamycin production was partially restored in <italic>rifQ</italic>+, and this incomplete complementation of the phenotype was probably caused by the unstable expression of <italic>rifQ</italic>, which was cloned on an episomal plasmid pDXM4. For example, the transcription of <italic>rifQ</italic> was relatively stable throughout the tested growth stages (i.e., 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h) in the wild type, but decreased dramatically in <italic>rifQ</italic>+ (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The growth and rifamycin B yield of different <italic>A. mediterranei</italic> strains. <bold>a</bold> Measurement of the growth curves.

</p><p id="Par10">The transcription of <italic>rifP</italic> and <italic>rifQ</italic> was previously found to initiate from <italic>rif35</italic>, forming a large <italic>rif35</italic> operon transcribing from <italic>rif35</italic> to <italic>rifQ</italic> in <italic>rif</italic> cluster (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, except <italic>rifP</italic>, the transcription of other genes in this large operon was not significantly repressed by RifQ (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4), which indicated that <italic>rifP</italic> had its own promoter. To check this possibility, primer extension assay was employed to determine the possible transcription initiation site (TIS) of <italic>rifP</italic>. Two primers, which were complementary to different regions in <italic>rifP</italic> promoter, were designed for the experiments, and consistent results were obtained (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5). <italic>rifP</italic> was proved to transcribe from the &#x02212;&#x000a0;447th nucleotides relative to the <italic>rifP</italic> coding sequence (CDS). Besides, a primer was also designed for <italic>rifQ</italic>, but no TIS was detected (data not shown), indicating the co-transcription of <italic>rifP</italic> and <italic>rifQ</italic>.</p><p id="Par11">To further investigate the molecular mechanism of RifQ-mediated repression of <italic>rifP</italic>&#x02019;s transcription, both electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I Footprinting assays were employed, using purified recombinant RifQ. As revealed by the gel filtration analysis, RifQ functioned as a homodimer (i.e. 46.9 KD) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S6), which was like most other TFRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Based on the EMSA results, RifQ was found to specifically bind to the <italic>rifP</italic> promoter, and all <italic>rifP</italic> probe was shifted when only 0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M RifQ was added in the reaction mix (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Then, the RifQ-protected DNA sequences (5&#x02032;-ACCGACC<underline>CTTATA</underline>TGGTG<underline>TATAAG</underline>AA-3&#x02032;) were precisely determined by DNase I Footprinting assay, extending from the &#x02212;&#x000a0;61st to &#x02212;&#x000a0;35th relative to the <italic>rifP</italic> CDS. An inverted repeat DNA binding motif, which was commonly known for TFR binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], was identified and underlined in the RifQ-protected sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). As the <italic>rifP</italic> TIS located upstream of the RifQ binding sites, RifQ must act as a roadblock to block the transcriptional elongation of <italic>rifP</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S7).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>RifQ specifically bound to the <italic>rifP</italic> promoter region. <bold>a</bold> EMSA analysis of RifQ binding of <italic>rifP</italic> promoter.

RifQ was pre-incubated with Rif_B, and the RifQ binding affinity was determined through DNase I Footprinting assay. When the final concentration of Rif_B reached 0.6&#x000a0;mM, the RifQ binding affinity to <italic>rifP</italic> promoter slightly decreased, and RifQ completely lost the DNA binding affinity when Rif_B concentration increased to 2.5&#x000a0;mM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a).

Either DMSO or Rif_B was added into the growth medium and samples were collected at both 12 and 24&#x000a0;h after rifamycin addition. As indicated in the DNase I Footprinting assay, 2.5&#x000a0;mM Rif_B was able to completely deactivate the RifQ binding activity, and therefore a final concentration of 2.5&#x000a0;mM Rif_B was added into the growth medium</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2018_863_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par13">Then, we further tested the role of Rif_B in inactivating RifQ in vivo. Rif_B was directly added into the culture medium of <italic>LYZL11</italic>, which was a <italic>rifA</italic> frameshift mutant and produced no rifamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Meanwhile, the effect of Rif_SV on <italic>rifQ</italic> transcription was also tested in vivo; however, no difference could be found between conditions with and without Rif_SV supplementation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S8), which was consistent with the results of the DNase I Footprinting assay.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par14">In our research, RifQ was proved to negatively regulate the transcription of <italic>rifP</italic>, and <italic>rifP</italic>&#x02019;s TIS was determined to decipher the molecular mechanism of RifQ-mediated repression.</p><p id="Par15">Based on these findings, a feedback model is proposed for the regulation of rifamycin export (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). At the early growth stage, the intracellular Rif_B concentration is low, and the RifQ activity is unaffected by Rif_B, resulting in active RifQ (RifQ-ac). In such a circumstance, RifQ-ac negatively regulates <italic>rifP</italic> transcription, repressing rifamycin export, which leads to the increased Rif_B accumulation within the cells. When cells enter the late growth phase, the intracellular Rif_B concentration reaches a threshold and inactivates RifQ by either direct binding or an unknown manner. Then, the inactivated RifQ (RifQ-in) releases from the promoter region of <italic>rifP</italic>, which derepressed <italic>rifP</italic> transcription to accelerate Rif_B export. Therefore, with this self-regulatory feedback model, the concentration of intracellular Rif_B is controlled under a relatively low level, protecting hosts from the toxicity of endogenous rifamycin.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>A proposed feedback model for RifQ-mediated regulation of rifamycin biosynthesis and export in <italic>A. mediterranei</italic>. At the early growth phase, RifQ represses Rif_B export, accelerating the accumulation of intracellular Rif_B. When the intracellular Rif_B concentration reaches a threshold, rifamycin B was able to inactivate RifQ by either direct binding or an unknown manner, and the export of Rif_B is remarkably promoted, reducing the intracellular concentration of Rif_B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2018_863_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par16">In fact, the feedback autoregulation is widely used by the producers to regulate the antibiotic biosynthesis, avoiding the accumulation of intracellular antibiotic. For example, antibiotics such as jadomycin B and daunorubicin regulate their own biosynthesis, where the end products can inactivate the activators to slow down the antibiotic biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Moreover, deletion of RifQ resulted in a more than twofold improvement of rifamycin production in medium because of the overexpression of <italic>rifP</italic>. In <italic>&#x00394;rifQ</italic>, the accelerated export of rifamycin may reduce the intracellular rifamycin concentration and relieve other possible feedback inhibition of rifamycin biosynthesis, which could possibly be raised by the accumulation of intracellular rifamycin. As a result, the rifamycin biosynthesis may keep sustained in <italic>&#x00394;rifQ</italic>, leading to increased final production. Therefore, one may use similar strategies to improve the industrial production of other antibiotics whose export is specifically regulated by a repressor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par18">Export of antibiotics is an important means for the producer to reduce the intracellular antibiotic concentration as well as its toxicity. Although both scientific research and industrial production of rifamycins have lasted for decades, little is known about the regulation of the export of this important antimycobacterial antibiotic. Here in this study, RifQ was proved to directly bind to the <italic>rifP</italic> promoter to repress its transcription. As RifP was a rifamycin pump protein, RifQ therefore repressed the export of rifamycin. Besides, we also found the RifQ-mediated regulation to <italic>rifP</italic> could be relieved by Rif_B, indicating Rif_B as an allosteric compound to induce the conformational change of RifQ. Based on the findings above, we concluded a feed-back model to illustrate the regulation of the rifamycin B export in <italic>A. mediterranei</italic> S699.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Bacterial strains, media, and primers</title><p id="Par19"><italic>Amycolatopsis mediterranei</italic> S699 and its mutants were grown in Bennet medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.
