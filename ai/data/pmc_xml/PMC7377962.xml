Many nucleoside antibiotics inhibiting translocase I (TL1) involved in peptidoglycan synthesis have recently been discovered<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, and several biochemical studies have already established numerous examples of the latter<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. One group of TL1 inhibitors is structurally characterized by a disaccharide core consisting of a 5&#x02032;&#x02032;-amino-5&#x02032;&#x02032;-deoxyribose (ADR) linked to a high-carbon sugar nucleoside, (5&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>,6&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>)-5&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-glycyluridine (GlyU), represented by FR-900493 (<bold>1</bold>), caprazamycin B (<bold>2</bold>), A-90289 B (<bold>3</bold>), sphaerimicin A (<bold>4</bold>), and muraymycin D1 (<bold>5</bold>) and D2 (<bold>6</bold>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The structures of <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>5</bold> diverge outside of the shared ADR-GlyU disaccharide core, with each appended via a 6&#x02032;-<italic>N</italic>-alkylamine linker to a unique glycosylated fatty acid, polyketide, or peptide moiety. Compound <bold>1</bold>, the structurally simplest of this nucleoside group with antibiotic activity, is modified with a methylated aminopropyl (C<sub>3</sub>N) group attached to the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core. Structural inspection of <bold>5</bold> reveals the identical C<sub>3</sub>N group, while <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> contain an aminobutyryl (C<sub>4</sub>N) group that is further modified to a diazapenone ring.</p><p id="P5">The assembly of the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core has been previously delineated in vitro using the recombinant enzymes involved in <bold>3</bold> and <bold>5</bold> biosynthesis<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The pathway requires six enzymes that convert UMP and <sc>l</sc>-Thr to the ADR-GlyU disaccharide (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), and bioinformatic analysis suggests these steps are shared for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold> (the gene cluster for <bold>1</bold> is unknown)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, the origin of the C<sub>3</sub>N or C<sub>4</sub>N units in these TL1 inhibitors and the mechanism for their incorporation onto the ADR-GlyU disaccharide scaffold has not been defined. Similar C<sub>3</sub>N and C<sub>4</sub>N units are found in several unrelated metabolites, for example various polyamines and siderophores, and they are known or hypothesized to be derived from either <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine (AdoMet) or, less frequently, <sc>l</sc>-Asp-&#x003b2;-semialdehyde<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Here we provide evidence to support a shared mechanism for the insertion of the C<sub>3</sub>N group of <bold>5</bold> and the C<sub>4</sub>N group of <bold>3</bold> that employs AdoMet as the direct metabolic precursor. Unlike other AdoMet-dependent alkylations, however, the process is highlighted by a fundamentally different catalytic strategy that involves &#x003b3;-replacement by a pyridoxal-5&#x02032;-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. Furthermore, the alkyl acceptor was unexpectedly determined to be the phosphorylated version of the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core, which was recently identified as the product of the kinase Mur28 from the <bold>5</bold> biosynthetic pathway<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.

HR-MS/MS was likewise consistent with the regioselective incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-[1-<sup>13</sup>C]Leu (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).

Comparison of the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra suggested no substantial enrichment upon feeding <sc>l</sc>-[<sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N]Asp, while an increase in the signal intensity of four peaks was observed when feeding <sc>l</sc>-[<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N]Met (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The peak signal at 58.0 ppm, previously assigned as the 2&#x02032;&#x02032; methyl ether, was enriched, which is consistent with alkylation catalyzed by an AdoMet-dependent <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase. The remaining three signals at 45.6 (d), 25.0 (t), and 35.8 (dd) ppm&#x02014;corresponding to C1&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032;-C3&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032; of the aminopropyl linker of <bold>5</bold>, respectively&#x02014;were similarly enriched, which is consistent with AdoMet as the direct precursor.

The gene cluster for <bold>5</bold> encodes for a single protein (Mur11) with an AdoMet-dependent MTase domain. Homologous genes, however, are not found in the <bold>2</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> biosynthetic gene cluster, and the gene product was tentatively assigned as the catalyst for 2&#x02032;&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation to convert <bold>6</bold> to <bold>5</bold>. Armed with the knowledge that AdoMet or an <sc>l</sc>-Met-derived metabolite would ultimately need to undergo decarboxylation to generate <bold>5</bold>, similar to polyamine biosynthetic pathways that proceed through AdoMet decarboxylation prior to C<sub>3</sub>N group transfer<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, the gene cluster for <bold>5</bold> was further analyzed for the presence of any remaining gene encoding a putative PLP-dependent decarboxylase. This search uncovered Mur23, which has similarity to proteins annotated as diaminopimelate decarboxylases belonging to the conserved domain family of COG0019 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). A Mur23 homolog is not encoded in the <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> gene cluster, as expected, if Mur23 is indeed a decarboxylase. Another putative PLP-dependent protein Mur24, with sequence similarity to proteins annotated as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthases, is encoded immediately downstream of <italic>mur23</italic>. The similarity of Mur24 to ACC synthases, which are PLP-dependent enzymes that utilize AdoMet to catalyze intramolecular C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> bond formation with concomitant C<sub>&#x003b3;</sub>&#x02013;S bond cleavage to produce ACC and methylthioadenosine (MTA)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, was intriguing due to the evidence that <sc>l</sc>-Met&#x02014;likely by way of AdoMet&#x02014;serves as the C<sub>3</sub>N source of <bold>5</bold>. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Mur24 occupies a separate clade, and hence might harbor a distinct activity, when compared to plant ACC synthases or the recently characterized bacterial ACC synthase, GnmY (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In contrast to <italic>mur23</italic>, genes homologous to <italic>mur24</italic> were identified within the <bold>2</bold> (<italic>cpz13</italic>) and <bold>3</bold> (<italic>lipJ</italic>) gene clusters, suggesting that this enzymatic step is shared in these pathways<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. A gene (<italic>sphL</italic>) encoding a protein with sequence similarity to Mur24 was also identified within the <bold>4</bold> gene cluster<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The Mur24 homologs, which range from 34&#x02013;50% in sequence identity using pairwise alignments, are part of the class I aminotransferase superfamily, and all retain a conserved Lys (corresponding to Lys234 for Mur24 and Lys229 for LipJ) that is predicted to be critical for PLP binding and enzymatic activity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Recombinant Mur24, purified to near homogeneity from <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> TK24 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), was initially screened for activity with two potential alkyl acceptors: (5&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>,6&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>)-GlyU (<bold>7</bold>), the demonstrated isomeric product of LipK and Mur17 involved in <bold>3</bold> and <bold>5</bold> biosynthesis, respectively; and ADR-GlyU (<bold>8</bold>), the disaccharide product of the six-enzyme pathway that was previously characterized (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The acceptors were prepared by both chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis, and the identity was confirmed by spectroscopic analyses (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). Based on the results from the isotopic enrichment experiments, <sc>l</sc>-Met, dcAdoMet, and AdoMet were tested as potential alkyl donors. Analysis of the reactions performed under a variety of conditions including with or without exogenously supplied PLP, however, failed to reveal a new peak. Reactions with recombinant LipJ and SphL (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) also gave negative results.</p><p id="P9">Mur28 was previously shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of the 3&#x02032;&#x02032;-OH of <bold>6</bold> and <bold>8,</bold> the latter generating 3&#x02032;&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-phospho-<bold>8</bold> (<bold>9</bold>) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Single-substrate kinetic analysis revealed an approximately 60-fold higher catalytic efficiency with <bold>8</bold>, suggesting that phosphorylation occurs prior to the attachment of the C<sub>3</sub>N-linked peptide component. Consequently, ATP and Mur28 were included in the Mur24 activity screen to generate <bold>9</bold> in situ as a potential alkyl acceptor for Mur24. HPLC analysis revealed the formation of a new peak that was dependent upon the inclusion of AdoMet (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). MS analysis was consistent with Mur24-catalyzed alkylation of <bold>9</bold> to generate <bold>10</bold> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). Subsequently, <bold>9</bold> was enzymatically prepared and purified, and comparison of the MS and NMR spectra was consistent with 3&#x02032;&#x02032;-OH as the site of phosphorylation as previously reported (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Using purified <bold>9</bold> as the alkyl acceptor, the identical result was obtained (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>). HR-MS analysis of the product <bold>10</bold> yielded an (M + H)<sup>+</sup> ion at <italic>m/z</italic> = 630.1643, which is consistent with the molecular formula for C<sub>4</sub>N-modified-<bold>9</bold> [expected (M + H)<sup>+</sup> ion at <italic>m/z</italic> = 630.1660 for C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>16</sub>P]. Analysis by NMR spectroscopy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>) further supported the structure of the Mur24 product <bold>10</bold> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMBC correlations between C6&#x02032; of GlyU and C1&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032; of the C<sub>4</sub>N group supported the expected regiochemistry for C<sub>4</sub>N attachment. The formation of <bold>10</bold> suggests 5&#x02032;-deoxy-5&#x02032;-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA) is generated as the co-product, which was detected by HR-MS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). High background levels of MTA as a consequence of nonenzymatic AdoMet degradation, however, precluded a quantitative assessment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Overall, the data are consistent with the functional assignment of Mur24 as an AdoMet:<bold>9</bold> aminobutyryltransferase (ABTase), generating <bold>10</bold> and likely MTA as co-products.</p><p id="P10">The activity of the Mur24 homologs LipJ and SphL, which are involved in the biosynthesis of <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, respectively, was next interrogated. The gene cluster for <bold>4</bold> does not encode for a Mur28 phosphotransferase homolog, suggesting the possibility that phosphorylation of <bold>8</bold> is not a prerequisite for C<sub>4</sub>N transfer by SphL. Conversely, the gene cluster for <bold>3</bold> encodes two Mur28 homologs, LipX (36% sequence identity) and LipI (23%), suggesting that LipJ has the same substrate specificity with respect to the alkyl acceptor as Mur24. Activity tests of LipJ with <bold>9</bold> and AdoMet revealed the formation of <bold>10</bold>, and the reaction was dependent upon a phosphorylated acceptor as the substrate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>,<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">b</xref>). Contrary to expectations, SphL catalyzed the same reaction wherein activity was strictly dependent upon a phosphorylated acceptor <bold>9</bold> as the substrate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13c</xref>), despite the absence of a phosphotransferase candidate. Overall the results establish the functional assignment of this group of proteins as AdoMet:<bold>9</bold> ABTases that catalyze &#x003b3;-replacement of AdoMet, thereby breaking the C&#x003b3;&#x02013;S bond while generating a new C&#x003b3;&#x02013;N bond.

Interestingly, unlike many PLP-dependent enzymes including CSG synthase<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, the recombinant ABTases do not co-purify with PLP under a variety of conditions screened. Following the formation of a pseudo-Michaelis (ternary) complex, a general base&#x02014;likely Lys234 for Mur24&#x02014;abstracts the C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> proton. This step, again well established for many PLP-dependent enzymes, is supported by the deuterium labelling experiments. Due to the lack of a diagnostic absorption band for a quinonoid (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>), C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> deprotonation is likely immediately followed by C4&#x02032; protonation, generating the ketimine II.

However, the data establish a strong preference for the exchange of a single hydrogen per molecule instead of two (62-fold difference), suggesting that one site, which we propose is C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>, is better shielded from bulk solvent and hence cannot support &#x003b3;-addition starting with <sc>l</sc>-VG. The differences in reactivity of CSG synthase and the ABTases could also be the result of the nature of the acceptor nucleophile. Thiols/thiolates, for example, the <sc>l</sc>-Cys acceptor for CSG synthase, are excellent nucleophiles for conjugate additions, and the softness enables orbital effects to dominate the reaction with the relatively soft electrophilic center at C<sub>&#x003b3;</sub><sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.
