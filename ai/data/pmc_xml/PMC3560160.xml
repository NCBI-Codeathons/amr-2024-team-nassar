experimental settings, antibody-based anti-CD20/rituximab and small molecule proteasome inhibitor (PI) bortezomib (BTZ) treatment proved effective modalities for B cell depletion in lymphoproliferative disorders as well as autoimmune diseases. However, the chronic nature of these diseases requires either prolonged or re-treatment, often with acquired resistance as a consequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here we studied the molecular basis of acquired resistance to BTZ in JY human B lymphoblastic cells following prolonged exposure to this drug and examined possibilities to overcome resistance by next generation PIs and anti-CD20/rituximab-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Characterization of BTZ-resistant JY/BTZ cells compared to parental JY/WT cells revealed the following features: (a) 10&#x02013;12 fold resistance to BTZ associated with the acquisition of a mutation in the <italic>PSMB5</italic> gene (encoding the constitutive &#x003b2;5 proteasome subunit) introducing an amino acid substitution (Met45Ile) in the BTZ-binding pocket, (b) a significant 2&#x02013;4 fold increase in the mRNA and protein levels of the constitutive &#x003b2;5 proteasome subunit along with unaltered immunoproteasome expression, (c) full sensitivity to the irreversible epoxyketone-based PIs carfilzomib and (to a lesser extent) the immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914. Finally, in association with impaired ubiquitination and attenuated breakdown of CD20, JY/BTZ cells harbored a net 3-fold increase in CD20 cell surface expression, which was functionally implicated in conferring a significantly increased anti-CD20/rituximab-mediated CDC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate that acquired resistance to BTZ in B cells can be overcome by next generation PIs and by anti-CD20/rituximab-induced CDC, thereby paving the way for salvage therapy in BTZ-resistant disease.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Proteasome inhibitors</kwd><kwd>Anti-CD20/rituximab therapy</kwd><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>Autoimmune disorders</kwd><kwd>Resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Since the initial approval of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, in 1997, it has become the cornerstone in the treatment of B cell lymphoproliferative diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Additionally, B cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), for which reason over the past decade rituximab has been added as B cell depleting therapy of auto-immune diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, it is well recognized that a considerable number of patients are either primary resistant to rituximab, or experience a limited period of response
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The efficacy of rituximab is associated with proficient CD20 expression on the surface of B cells, and indeed, acquisition of rituximab resistance appears to be correlated with down-regulation of CD20
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic modalities. Beyond immunotherapy approaches, small molecule targeting of B-cells has been achieved with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as bortezomib (BTZ)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Bortezomib-induced apoptosis and cell death has been reported for a large panel of human B cell lines, including those resistant to rituximab therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, a clinical effect of BTZ in B cell driven diseases has been found. BTZ is highly effective in inducing plasma cell death, thus, is now being implemented both in first line and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. BTZ has also shown clinical efficacy in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and Waldenstr&#x000f6;m&#x02019;s Macroglobulinemia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the latter also in combination with rituximab
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], indicating its effectivity in inducing cell death in earlier stages of B-cell development. In the autoimmune disease setting, clinical studies with PIs are far less advanced, although in pre-clinical studies, PI therapy demonstrated promising results as anti-arthritic treatment strategy, also by B cell depletion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>One hypothesis for proficient B cell targeting by PIs is that their substantial turnover and secretion of proteins renders these cells highly susceptible to interference in protein homeostasis, in particular following inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The UPS is the master regulator of cellular homeostasis by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of proteins that control apoptosis induction, and also mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine production via NF&#x003ba;B activation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Most mammalian cells express constitutive proteasomes which harbor the &#x003b2;5 subunit (PSMB5), the &#x003b2;1 subunit (PSMB6) and the &#x003b2;2 subunit (PSMB7) and cleave proteins (or long peptides) after hydrophobic, acidic, and basic amino acid residues, respectively
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. After stimulation with IFN-&#x003b3; and/or TNF-&#x003b1;, these constitutive proteasome subunits are replaced by immunoproteasome subunits: &#x003b2;5i (LMP7), &#x003b2;1i (LMP2), and &#x003b2;2i (MECL1)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These proteasome entities are part of the immunoproteasome, which is mainly expressed in cells of hematological origin and can generate a distinct peptide repertoire for MHC-class I presentation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As a first generation PI, Bortezomib targets both constitutive and/or immunoproteasome subunits via a reversible binding to the proteasome, however, nowadays several next-generation PIs have been rationally designed and tested, harboring the capacity to specifically target the constitutive and/or immunoproteasome subunits through irreversible binding
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Given the chronic nature of autoimmune-related diseases, with patients facing long-term treatment, it is anticipated that PI treatment may also be accompanied by loss of treatment efficacy/onset of drug resistance over time (Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012), as has been described in extensively-treated MM patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We, as well as others, have described the development of resistance to BTZ in several models of hematological cancer cells, including T-cells, myeloid cells, and plasma cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. For both benign and neoplastic B cells, however, the long term effects of BTZ exposure are largely unexplored and deserve further investigation.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of B-cell exposure to BTZ and onset of resistance to BTZ using EBV-transformed JY lymphoblast cells as a benign autoimmune disorder <italic>in vitro</italic> B-cell model. Beyond characterizing the molecular basis of resistance to BTZ in JY cells, we report two modalities to overcome BTZ resistance in B cells; (a) by next-generation epoxyketone-based irreversible PIs, and (b) by enhanced rituximab-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), exploiting the upregulated cell surface expression of CD20 in BTZ-resistant JY cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Acquisition of bortezomib resistance and cross-resistance to other proteasome inhibitors</title><p>The human JY B cell line was used as a model to examine the cellular effects of long-term exposure of B cells to BTZ, including the acquisition of BTZ resistance.

JY cells stably growing in BTZ concentrations of 35nM (JY/35) and 100nM (JY/100) were used for further characterization.</p><p>Figure

Remarkably, however, JY/35 and JY/100 cells retained full sensitivity towards the next-generation irreversible PI, carfilzomib.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Acquisition of bortezomib (BTZ) resistant JY cells and proteasome inhibitor cross-resistance profile.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] have previously discovered a mechanism of BTZ resistance in various haematological cell lines. This mechanism included BTZ-induced single point mutations in the PSMB5 gene, as well as a selective overexpression of mutant PSMB5 protein
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Here, we tested whether this mechanism would also apply for BTZ-resistant JY cells. We first determined whether <italic>PSMB5</italic> harbored any of the previously described mutations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Indeed, in JY/35 cells as well as JY/100 cells, a single G to T nucleotide shift was identified at nucleotide position 311 in exon 2 of the <italic>PSMB5</italic> gene (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). In the mature and functional &#x003b2;5-subunit protein, this mutation introduced a Met to Ile substitution at amino acid 45. It is noteworthy that the mutation in <italic>PSMB5</italic> in JY/35 and JY/100 cells is heterozygous, indicating that these cells would still harbor one unaffected allele. We next determined the expression of the constitutive and immunoproteasome subunits at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Compared to JY/WT cells, mRNA levels of the constitutive proteasome subunits, in particular PSMB5 (&#x003b2;5) and PSMB7 (&#x003b2;2), were significantly increased (up to 4.5 fold) in JY/BTZ cells, whereas the increase in the mRNA of immunoproteasome subunits was much less pronounced (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Consistent with these data, protein levels of constitutive proteasome subunits were increased in BTZ-resistant JY cells (up to 2-fold), whereas the expression levels of immunoproteasome subunits remained largely unaltered (Figure

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and we therefore examined whether or not BTZ selection would induce alterations in markers involved in antigen presentation. In fact, no significant changes were found in the cell surface expression of HLA-ABC (MHC-class I), HLA-DR (MHC-class II), and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40 in JY/35 and JY/100 cells compared to JY/WT cells (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2). Further confirmation that BTZ selection had no impact on antigen presentation was provided by the observation that JY/WT and BTZ-resistant cells showed no difference in their capacity to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3). Of note, short term (24 hr) incubations with maximal non-toxic concentrations of BTZ also did not affect their ability to induce proliferation of allo-T-cells (Additional file

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] or protective cytokine environments
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. To this end, we examined the secretion profile of the prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; by activated JY cells and explored whether or not this profile is altered in JY/BTZ cells. Beyond basal secretion levels, we also assessed the impact of co-incubation with BTZ on TNF-&#x003b1; production. Upon activation with PMA and ionomycin, JY cells produced TNF-&#x003b1; levels of 7000 &#x000b1; 3700 pg/ml, which was diminished by 20% in the presence of 10 nM BTZ (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Basal levels of TNF-&#x003b1; production in JY/35 cells was approximately half of JY/WT cells, and could be further suppressed in the presence of 35 nM BTZ. Strikingly, basal TNF-&#x003b1; production in JY/100 was markedly decreased to levels &#x0003c; 5% of JY/WT cells. Together, these results indicate that upon acquisition of BTZ resistance, JY cells are markedly suppressed in their capacity to secrete TNF-&#x003b1;<italic>.</italic></p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>TNF-&#x003b1; release by JY/WT cells and BTZ-resistant variants JY/35BTZ and JY/100BTZ.</bold> Cells were activated for 24 hours with 10 ng/ml PMA and 750 ng/ml Ionomycin, in the absence or presence of the indicated concentration bortezomib.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Unlike in JY/WT cells, treatment of JY/35 and JY/100 cells with BTZ (35 nM and 100 nM BTZ, respectively) had no significant effect on CD20 expression (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In order to establish whether protein ubiquitination status after short-term (24&#x02013;48 hr) BTZ treatment is associated with down-regulation of CD20 expression in JY/WT cells and unaltered CD20 expression in JY/BTZ cells, Western blot analysis of total ubiquitinated proteins was performed with control and BTZ- exposed cells.

Conversely, no accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins were observed in JY/35 and JY/100 cells exposed to 35 nM and 100 nM BTZ, respectively. These results suggest that aberrant protein ubiquitination and degradation could be a contributing factor towards elevated levels of CD20 in BTZ-resistant JY cells.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of BTZ on CD20 (A) and HLA-DR (B) expression in JY/WT and BTZ-resistant JY cells.</bold> Short term incubations of 24 hours and 48 hours were performed with 5nM BTZ for JY/WT, 35nM for JY/35BTZ cells and 100nM BTZ for JY/100BTZ cells.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In the treatment of autoimmune diseases, rituximab also now has an accepted place
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], but BTZ or other PIs still await clinical evaluation. Ideally, based on their non-overlapping mechanisms of action, rituximab and bortezomib could potentially replace each other when development of resistance to one or the other occurred. In this context, it has been reported that rituximab-resistant B cells retain sensitivity for BTZ, but the reverse has not been demonstrated. In view of the need for chronic treatments in autoimmune diseases, there are concerns about the emergence of resistance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], thus highlighting the need to unravel underlying mechanisms of resistance, in order to design strategies to overcome acquired resistance. To address these issues, we provoked acquired resistance to BTZ in a human B cell line model and investigated its impact on rituximab sensitivity and next-generation PIs designed to overcome BTZ-resistance.</p><p>Here we mimicked the onset of acquired BTZ resistance in human B cells using human JY lymphoblastic cells as benign autoimmune disorder <italic>in vitro</italic> model, by a classical approach of cell exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of BTZ (5 through 100 nM), representing clinically-achievable plasma levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Characterization of the BTZ-resistant JY cells (10&#x02013;12 fold compared to WT cells) revealed the following main features: 1) acquisition of a point mutation in the <italic>PSMB5</italic> gene (encoding for the constitutive &#x003b2;5 proteasome subunit) along with overexpression of &#x003b2;5 subunit protein, 2) retention of sensitivity to epoxyketone-based PIs including carfilzomib, 3) an altered cytokine environment indicated by a marked reduction in the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1;, and 4) immunophenotypically, a significantly reduced expression of the B cell surface marker CD19 and a concomitant increase in CD20 levels.</p><p>BTZ-resistance associated with a single point mutation in <italic>PSMB5</italic> has been demonstrated by us and others for leukemia cell lines of lymphoid and myeloid origins, as well as solid tumor cell lines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These mutations introduced amino acid alterations that clustered in critical positions (Thr21, Met45, Ala49 and Cys52) in the BTZ binding pocket within the &#x003b2;5 subunit
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Based on data from the present study, it is revealing that beyond hematological malignant cells, <italic>PSMB5</italic> mutations can also be identified in BTZ-resistant JY lymphoblastic cells. It is noteworthy that the mutation in <italic>PSMB5</italic> in JY/BTZ cells is heterozygous, indicating that cells still retained an intact WT allele. This may underlie a relatively lower level of BTZ resistance observed in JY/BTZ cells as compared to the substantially higher resistance levels (&#x0003e; 100-fold) noted in leukemic cells harboring homozygous mutations in <italic>PSMB5</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Notwithstanding this fact, expression levels of mutant &#x003b2;5 subunits were upregulated in JY/BTZ cells, likely as a compensatory mechanism to sustain basal proteasome activity. The Met45Ile substitution identified in BTZ-resistant JY cells consistently resided in the highly-conserved substrate/inhibitor-binding domain of the &#x003b2;5 subunit. Met45 is well recognized to be essential for proteasome-substrate interactions, as well as for binding of the leucine boronic acid moiety (P1 site) of BTZ
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In this context, it may be anticipated that replacement of the non-polar, spatially flexible Met45 for another slightly more non-polar, bulkier, and more rigid amino acid as Ile, would affect optimal BTZ binding, thereby resulting in the conferring of drug resistance. From this perspective, it is intriguing to note that the Ala49 and Met45 mutations in the &#x003b2;5 subunit were also identified in marine bacteria as a self-protection mechanism against the natural PI, salinosporamide A, that they produce
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>A major finding in the current study is that JY/BTZ cells harboring the Met45Ile mutation in the &#x003b2;5 subunit retained full sensitivity to carfilzomib, an epoxyketone-based PI. Previous studies from our laboratory also indicated that carfilzomib retained appreciable activity against BTZ-resistant leukemia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and solid tumor cell lines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]; similar findings were observed with ONX 0912
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], an orally- bioavailable analog of carfilzomib which provokes irreversible binding via the epoxyketone group to the active site Thr1 residue in the &#x003b2;5 subunit. This unique property, rather than reversible binding by boronate-based BTZ, may still facilitate inhibition of the catalytic activity in mutated &#x003b2;5, thereby resulting in retention of drug sensitivity. Since levels of immunoproteasome subunits were largely unaltered and no mutations were observed in the &#x003b2;5i subunit in JY/BTZ cells, it may also explain the marginal levels of cross-resistance that were observed for the immunoproteasome-specific inhibitor ONX 0914. In this context, it is worthwhile mentioning that recent crystal structure studies identified Met45 in &#x003b2;5i as a major determinant in the efficient docking of ONX 0914 to the catalytic binding site
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The Met45Ile mutation in the constitutive &#x003b2;5 subunit has apparently lesser consequences for ONX 0914 activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Together, constitutive and immunoproteasome targeted epoxyketone-based PIs like carfilzomib, currently evaluated in phase I-III clinical trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], as well as ONX 0914 may readily overcome BTZ-resistance.</p><p>Besides antiproliferative effects, BTZ can also elicit potential anti-inflammatory effects by suppression of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this respect, TNF-&#x003b1; has received the most attention as one of the critical cytokines in the pathophysiology of arthritis, and is thus a major druggable target for biological agents and small molecules
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Consistent with data from the Komano group
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], we noted that JY/WT cells could produce appreciable levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, which could be partially inhibited by BTZ. Of additional interest was the notion that alongside these short term effects, acquisition of BTZ resistance in JY cells provoked a dramatic reduction in the basal levels of TNF-&#x003b1; production, being most pronounced in JY/100 cells. It remains to be established whether or not this effect is due to diminished response to activation stimuli, or aberrations in TNF-&#x003b1; secretion <italic>per se</italic>. In either case, prolonged BTZ exposure may elicit potential anti-inflammatory effects even when anti-proliferative effects are compromised.</p><p>Acquisition of BTZ resistance in JY cells was associated with opposite impacts on cell surface expression of two common B-cell surface markers: down regulation of CD19 and upregulation of CD20. CD19 is a transmembrane protein and co-receptor molecule that modulates signals through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) to control B cell-differentiation from pro/pre-B cells to resting pre-B cells in bone marrow. Consistently, CD19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have exhibited defects at stages of early B cell development and reduced levels of circulating B-cells, as reviewed in Del Nagro et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. It is yet unclear whether reduced CD19 levels in JY/BTZ cells would result in a B cell differentiation arrest; this should be subject for further studies using panels of B cell differentiation-restricted cell surface markers.</p><p>CD20 serves as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel protein expressed on B cells from immature to mature stages of differentiation, as recently reviewed by Thaunat et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. BTZ has been reported to induce disregulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, triggering caspase activation and initiating apoptosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. It is unknown whether this off-target effect of BTZ alters CD20 function and expression during resistance development. Rather, recent studies have pointed to the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system in the regulation of CD20 expression, as rituximab-resistant lymphoma cells have displayed upregulated expression of proteasome subunits
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and treating Raji human Burkitt lymphoma cells with BTZ for 24&#x02013;48 hours has down-regulated CD20 expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In accordance with these studies, we now showed that impaired (poly) ubiquitination of proteins upon 24&#x02013;48 hour BTZ treatment in resistant JY/BTZ cells attenuated degradation of CD20, resulting in a net 3-fold increase in CD20 expression in JY/100 cells and markedly enhanced rituximab-mediated CDC in JY/100 cells as compared to JY/WT cells. Based on the differential impact on CD20 expression in BTZ-sensitive and BTZ-resistant cells, one should take caution when considering combining rituximab and BTZ for B cell targeting; efficacy may only be realized in BTZ-resistant cells. Moreover, the current findings for JY lymphoblastic cells should also await further corroboration for B-cell neoplasms (e.g. mantle cell lymphoma) for which BTZ is a therapeutic option. Finally, it would be of additional future interest to explore whether aberrations in protein ubiquitination provoked by prolonged exposure to either BTZ or other types of PIs, may be instrumental to upregulated expression of other B cell surface markers that could elicit antibody-mediated CDC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study presented two novel strategies to overcome acquired resistance to BTZ in human B lymphoblastic cells: one is a small molecule approach with irreversible epoxyketone-based PIs, whereas the second relates to an immunological approach by anti-CD20/rituximab-mediated CDC, exploiting the upregulation of CD20 in BTZ-resistant cells.
