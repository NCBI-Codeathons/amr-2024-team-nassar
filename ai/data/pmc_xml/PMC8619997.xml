In this study, we used a commercial fumagillin on cultures of two cell types (A549 pneumocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages). This toxin joins its target, MetAP2 protein, inside cells and, as a result, significantly reduces the electron chain activity, the migration, and the proliferation ability on the A549 cells, or affects the viability and proliferation ability of the RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, the toxin stimulates the germination and double branch hypha production of fungal cultures, pointing out an intrinsic resistant mechanism to fumagillin of fungal strains. In this study, we also used a fumagillin non-producer <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> strain (&#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic>) as well as its complemented strain (&#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA::fmaA)</italic> and we tested the fumagillin secretion of the fungal strains using an Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) method. Furthermore, fumagillin seems to protect the fungus against phagocytosis in vitro, and during in vivo studies using infection of immunosuppressed mice, a lower fungal burden in the lungs of mice infected with the &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> mutant was demonstrated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fumagillin</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic></kwd><kwd>virulence factor</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>RAW 264.7</kwd><kwd>A549</kwd><kwd>mice infection</kwd><kwd>UHPLC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-jof-07-00936"><title>1. Introduction</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> is a saprophytic fungus that can colonize diverse ecological niches facilitated by its great plasticity to adapt to different environments and the wide dispersal of its small, airborne spores called conidia [<xref rid="B1-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The conidia allow <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> to reach all chambers of the human respiratory tract, where the fungus is able to cause a wide range of infections depending on the immune status of the patient [<xref rid="B3-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The biological characteristics that allow <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> to colonize and/or infect the respiratory tract are known as virulence factors. These include the fungal cell wall and the proteins involved in its formation, the resistance of the conidia to ultraviolet radiation and dryness, the mechanisms to evade the immune response, and the production of proteases and toxins [<xref rid="B6-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, the <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> genome contains a great variety of biosynthetic clusters [<xref rid="B7-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that provide the fungus with complex and bioactive secondary metabolites, including the production of toxins [<xref rid="B9-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among the variety of toxins produced by <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic>, several have been linked with enhanced virulence and include gliotoxin [<xref rid="B12-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], fumitremorgin A and B [<xref rid="B16-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], hexadehydroastechrome [<xref rid="B18-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], hemolysin, and mitogillin [<xref rid="B19-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The role of fumagillin in fungal virulence has not been completely elucidated yet. This toxin has been widely studied for other reasons, such as tumor control due to the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and its effect as an anti-tumor molecule [<xref rid="B20-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been used as an antibiotic agent in the treatment against different pathogens, such as microsporidia, parasites, and as a treatment of diseases such as AIDS and obesity [<xref rid="B21-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The mycotoxin is produced by a series of enzymes encoded in a biosynthetic cluster located on chromosome 8 of <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> [<xref rid="B22-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The members of the biosynthetic cluster are overexpressed in the lungs of intranasally infected mice [<xref rid="B23-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and include the fumagillin pathway-specific transcription factor [<xref rid="B24-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In fact, a non-fumagillin producer mutant strain caused significantly less cellular damage than the wild type in vitro, demonstrating a potential relevance of this toxin in virulence [<xref rid="B23-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Given these previous data and the need to deeply analyze the involvement of secondary metabolites in virulence [<xref rid="B25-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the aim of the present study was to assess the role of fumagillin in the pathogenesis of <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic>. For this purpose, we studied the effect of commercial fumagillin on <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> itself, macrophages, and epithelial cells. Additionally, a non-fumagillin producer mutant strain was used in co-incubation with cell cultures and during murine infection to determine the potential impact of the toxin on fungal virulence.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jof-07-00936"><title>2.

Quantification of Fumagillin by UHPLC (Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) in RPMI Samples</title><p>Quantitative analysis of fumagillin was carried out using an Acquity Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system (Waters, Milford, CT, USA) coupled to a photodiode array (PDA) detector, following a methodology previously published [<xref rid="B29-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 mm &#x000d7; 50 mm, 1.7 &#x003bc;m) from Waters. The mobile phases used were a 10 mM ammonia/ammonium buffer (pH 10) as the aqueous mobile phase (A) and acetonitrile as the organic modifier (B). A flow rate of 0.40 mL/min was used with an elution gradient as follows: 0&#x02013;0.5 min, 20% B; 0.5&#x02013;5.5 min, linear change from 20% to 95% B; 5.5&#x02013;6.5 min, 95% B; 6.5&#x02013;7.0 min, from 95% to 20%. During the chromatographic analysis, the column was maintained at 35 &#x000b0;C with a thermostat, and the samples were kept at 4 &#x000b0;C in the autosampler. Wavelengths of 336 and 280 nm were employed for fumagillin and diclofenac (internal standard, IS), respectively. System control, data collection, and data processing were accomplished using Empower 2 software.</p><p>Prior to the chromatographic analysis, a solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure was applied to the RPMI samples. Each 500 &#x003bc;L RPMI sample was spiked with 25 &#x003bc;L of 20 mg/mL IS solution in methanol and 475 &#x003bc;L of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 12). After vortex mixing, the solution was transferred to Oasis MAX cartridges (30 mg, 1 cm<sup>3</sup>) from Waters. The cartridges had been previously activated with 1 mL methanol and conditioned with 1 mL phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 12). After sample loading, the cartridges were washed with 1 mL phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 12):methanol (55:45) followed by 5 min drying at high vacuum, and then 1 mL of 3.5% formic acid solution in methanol was used for eluting the analyte.

However, little is known about its effect on the fungus or other cell types or its role in fungal virulence in vivo during the development of pulmonary aspergillosis.</p><p>To study this, we used a deletion mutant strain of the <italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> gene and its complement strain where <italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> encodes a terpene cyclase required for fumagillin synthesis [<xref rid="B22-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. First, an UHPLC method for the detection of fumagillin in samples of RPMI obtained after in vitro assays was standardized. Using this method, we were able to detect as low as 0.1 &#x000b5;g/mL of fumagillin. Furthermore, we confirmed that the &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain was not able to secrete fumagillin, corroborating the previously published data [<xref rid="B22-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Then, we performed a macroscopic phenotypical and growth study that showed that the mutant strain &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> did not present any difference compared to the Wt strain when they grew in the presence of structural, osmotic, and oxidative stresses (<xref rid="app1-jof-07-00936" ref-type="app">Figures S1 and S3</xref>). We also observed that <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> was not susceptible to exogenous fumagillin (<xref rid="app1-jof-07-00936" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>), but that fumagillin may be a germination-stimulating factor (<xref rid="jof-07-00936-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These results could support our hypothesis that the gene Afu8g00410, encoding a methionine aminopeptidase located inside the fumagillin cluster, confers resistance to the fungus. This gene would be co-expressed with the rest of the cluster, providing a resistant MetAP2 to the fungus and may explain the results obtained in <xref rid="jof-07-00936-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Continuing with fungal strains&#x02019; germination ability, it is notable that the &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain reached higher germination and branching rates than the other strains growing without cells and in the presence of fumagillin. The increased branching rates observed in the &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain may indicate that fumagillin could be involved in a polarization process, or in contrast, the increased branching observed could be a consequence of the adaptive process to the fumagillin presence. In any case, both hypotheses should be studied in depth.</p><p>Analysis of the effect of synthetic fumagillin on both A549 pneumocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages, which are common cell lines to perform toxin/molecule/drug response analysis [<xref rid="B23-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B34-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], demonstrated that each cell type uptakes the mycotoxin in different ways (<xref rid="jof-07-00936-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Fumagillin was clearly depleted from the supernatant (93.5%) of pneumocytes but to a much lesser degree (23.5%) macrophages culture. Furthermore, the lysis of both cell types using RIPA buffer and subsequent detection of the toxin by UHPLC suggested that the reduction in fumagillin from the media was due to its uptake by the cell. One explanation could be attributed to the different expression levels of the MetAP2 enzyme between both cell types (<uri xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org">https://www.proteinatlas.org</uri>; accessed 15 August 2021). Moreover, we cannot forget that macrophages can express different efflux systems that could expel the toxin from the cytosol. Finally, we cannot totally discard that cells could also degrade fumagillin, but no peaks similar to the ones observed after the fumagillin degradation assays (light, temperature, and acid environment) were detected either in the supernatants or the pellets (<xref rid="app1-jof-07-00936" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, it seems that fumagillin could passively cross the cell membrane reaching the cell cytosol [<xref rid="B36-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and bind to MetAP2, thus leading to loss of the toxin in the supernatant.</p><p>The MTT results shown in this study are in accordance with the ones previously published [<xref rid="B34-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B37-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but our interpretation of the MTT results varies with the other studies. In this study, we used the MTT assay as a technique suitable to measure the ETC [<xref rid="B39-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], while other authors used it to measure cell viability. On the other hand, it is important to note that our highest fumagillin concentration used (2 &#x000b5;g/mL) was the lowest of all these above-cited studies. In contrast, it is important to note that during the infection process in vivo or during the contact between the fungus and host cells, the toxin concentration reached could be higher. For instance, the production of candidalys in by <italic toggle="yes">Candida albicans</italic> in the invasion pocket produced an extremely high concentration of the toxin at the contact site between the fungus and the cell [<xref rid="B40-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This hypothesis could explain why a previous study performed with this same &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain demonstrated that it was less toxic than the Wt to the A549 cell line as assessed by <sup>51</sup>Cr release assays [<xref rid="B23-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Our results support the affectation of the ETC activity, as both the wound healing assay and the CFSE analysis performed by flow cytometry demonstrated that the proliferation of epithelial cells was affected after fumagillin exposure but not its cellular viability. Specifically, the covalent binding of fumagillin to its molecular target, MetAP2, results in an inhibition of all functions that MetAP2 orchestrates inside the cell [<xref rid="B21-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. They include the membrane signaling pathway involving proteins, such as Gi/o, Gi&#x003b2;&#x003b3;, PI3K, PLC, DAG, or IP3 that govern cell migration and proliferation [<xref rid="B41-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The results obtained with the RAW 264.7 cells were slightly different from those obtained from the pneumocytes since although they suffered a drop in the ETC activity and a delay in the cell proliferation after exposure to fumagillin, the effect was less marked than observed in pneumocytes and was not dependent on concentration. These results are apparently in contradiction with previous studies of other authors on rat alveolar macrophages using trypan blue to measure cell viability, which is a less sensitive method [<xref rid="B44-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Currently, it is unknown why macrophages, but not epithelial cells die at such a high rate; the different effects of the fumagillin depending on the cell type might be explained because the MetAP2 concentration could vary among tissues and cell types (<uri xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org">https://www.proteinatlas.org</uri>; accessed 15 August 2021).</p><p>In addition, fumagillin seems to protect, at least in early hours, the fungus from phagocytosis as assessed from increased phagocytosis of &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> conidia. In fact, when RAW 264.7 phagocytic cells were pre-treated with fumagillin, the phagocytic ability of these cells was significantly decreased after 6 and 8 h of co-incubation in comparison with the phagocytosis rates at this same time points of the cells untreated. Furthermore, the phagocytosis of the cells pre-treated was still significantly higher in contact with &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain at all times. These results, alongside the evidence that phagocytosis of the heat-inactivated conidia is similar in mutants and Wt strains, points out that the inhibition of the phagocytosis observed is because of the toxin effect over the macrophages and not because of an external structure defect of the conidia cell wall produced as a consequence of the genetic manipulation of the fungal strains. Moreover, it is important to note that the fumagillin produced by the Wt and complemented strains could be modulating the macrophages&#x02019; ETC and viability influencing the cell response, from their phagocytosis ability to TNF production. Indeed, TNF induction by BMMs was also overall lower in response to the &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain than to the Wt and complemented strains, although it was not statistically significant except at 4 h.</p><p>Regarding in vivo assays, Liu and coworkers evaluated the virulence ability of the mutant <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> non-fumagillin producer strain &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">fumR</italic> [<xref rid="B24-jof-07-00936" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For that, they used a corticosteroid immunosuppressed mice model, and they did not describe any virulence difference between the mutant and the Wt strain. Therefore, and due to the differences in the phagocytosis assays observed (<xref rid="jof-07-00936-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), we wanted to assess a neutropenic murine aspergillosis model to look at the role of the <italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> gene in virulence. Unexpectedly, the &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic>::<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain was significantly more lethal than the Wt and &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strains. In contrast, the lowest mortality rate (although not significantly different to the Wt) was observed in those mice infected with the &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain.</p><p>On the other hand, the CFUs analysis showed that most of the surviving mice infected with &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> strain did not contain viable fungus in their lungs, whereas a high fungal burden was detected in mice infected with the other strains at the end of the experiment. These results may indicate that the mortality caused by &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic>, only observed during the first four days of infection, could be the result of the ability of this mutant to germinate faster than the others. Furthermore, the possible production of other virulence factors, such as proteases or other toxins, could be compensating for the lack of fumagillin, but this hypothesis has not been analyzed in this study.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is not the first fumagillin research, but it is the first in-depth study of the role of fumagillin on <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> virulence, showing that this molecule can affect host cell homeostasis and that <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic> shows an intrinsic resistance to its own toxin. Finally, in our murine model, whereas we found that mice infected with &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">fmaA</italic> survived with lower fungal burden than those infected with the wild type or the complemented strain, there was little overall difference in virulence dependent on this toxin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank SGIker for the technical and human support provided (UPV/EHU/ERDF, EU).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-jof-07-00936"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/jof7110936/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/jof7110936/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Phenotypic characterization of fumagillin mutant strains; Figure S2: Growth curves of the fungal strains after exposition to 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 &#x000b5;g/mL of fumagillin for 70 h; Figure S3: Fumagillin detection and its degradative products by UHPLC; Figure S4: Inhibition assay of the fungal strains exposed to 30%, 15%, 7.5%, and 3.75% of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 48, 75, and 96 h; Table S1: Clinical scoring table.</p><supplementary-material id="jof-07-00936-s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="jof-07-00936-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, X.G., A.R.-G. and A.R.; methodology, X.G., U.P.-C., A.P., S.C.-S., E.P.-M. and O.G.; formal analysis, X.G., F.L.H., E.M., J.A., R.M.A., N.P.K., A.R.-G. and A.R.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, X.G., writing&#x02014;review and editing, all authors.
