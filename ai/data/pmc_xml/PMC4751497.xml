SCO4439 harbors a DD-CPase domain and a putative transcriptional regulator domain, separated by a putative transmembrane region. The recombinant protein shows that <sc>DD</sc>-CPase activity is inhibited by penicillin G. The spores of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant are affected in their resistance to heat and acid and showed a dramatic increase in swelling during germination. The mycelium of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant is more sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). The DD-CPase domain and the hydrophobic transmembrane region are highly conserved in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, and both are essential for complementing the wild type phenotypes in the mutant. A model for the biological mechanism behind the observed phenotypes is proposed, in which SCO4439 DD-CPase releases D-Ala from peptidoglycan (PG) precursors, thereby reducing the substrate pool for PG crosslinking (transpeptidation). PG crosslinking regulates spore physical resistance and germination, and modulates mycelium resistance to glycopeptides. This study is the first demonstration of the role of a DD-CPase in the maturation of the spore cell wall.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Streptomycetes are mycelial microorganisms characterized by their complex developmental cycles, including programmed cell death (PCD) and hyphae differentiation, which leads to aerial mycelium formation and sporulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

The PBPs constitute a family of acyltransferases with a common evolutionary origin and a common substrate (the D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptides present in the pentapeptide stems of PG precursors), that are collectively known as DD-peptidases. DD-peptidases include transglycosylases, which catalyze the polymerization of glycan chains composed of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM); DD-CPases, which remove the terminal D-alanine from muramyl pentapeptide; transpeptidases, which catalyze the cross-link formation between one D-Ala of one PG strand and one amino acid of the other strand; and endopeptidases, which cleave the cross-linked peptide side-chains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The DD-peptidases are classified on the basis of their molecular mass, amino acid sequence and enzyme activity at high molecular mass (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. HMM DD-peptidases are usually bifunctional transglycosylases/transpeptidases (also classified as class A), or monofunctional transpeptidases (class B) anchored to membranes. LMM DD-peptidases are monofunctional carboxypeptidases or endopeptidases, and the majority are also anchored to membranes (class C). LMM DD-peptidases are usually not essential, and they are not found in most studies and reviews on PBPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Most bacteria have multiple PBPs with varying degrees of redundant activity. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that Actinobacteria have an average of five HMM DD-peptidases per genome; this number doubled only in streptomycetes (13 DD-peptidases in the case of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Many DD-peptidases belong to the SEDS (shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) clusters of genes involved in PG synthesis and remodeling and are essential for growth, cell division, and cellular viability. DD-peptidases that are not included in the SEDS clusters are considered dispensable for growth and viability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and their biological function remains poorly investigated. <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> harbors four SEDS clusters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, that include four transpeptidases (SCO2090, SCO2608, SCO3847 and SCO5301).</p><p>This work contributes characterizing the biological function of the largely ignored redundant and non-essential LMM DD-peptidases by studying the activity and role of <italic>SCO4439</italic>, a gene encoding a putative DD-CPase. <italic>SCO4439</italic> is a very unusual DD-CPase that is highly conserved in streptomycetes and is therein fused with a putative transcriptional regulator domain (see below). <italic>SCO4439</italic> was found to be slightly over-expressed during the aerial mycelium and sporulation stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, however, its biological role remained unclear.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutation of <italic>SCO4439</italic> affects spore swelling during germination, increases spore resistance to acid/heating and reduces the glycopeptide resistance</title><p>Cosmid D6.2.B06_046 harboring a copy of <italic>SCO4439</italic> interrupted by Tn5062 was used to obtain the <italic>S. coelicolor SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant using the methodology developed by Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Mart&#x000ed;nez <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The early stages of <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant spore germination were similar to those in the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> wild strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;h</xref>); however <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant showed a clear and distinctive phenotype at later stages, consisting of a dramatic increase in spore swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k,l</xref>) with respect to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i,j</xref>).</p><p>The kinetics of spore germination in the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> wild type and in the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant were studied by using time-lapse confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m,n</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref>). The spores of the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> parental strain swelled until they reached a diameter of 2.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (5-hour culture), before the emergence of the germ tube, which coincided with a deswelling and a consequent reduction of the spore diameter (from 2.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m at 5-hours to 1.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m at 8-hours) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m,r</xref>). At early time points, the swelling of the spores of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant was slower than the swelling of the spores of the wild strain (compare 5&#x02009;hour-time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m,n</xref>), but they continued to swell after the emergence of the germ tube, reaching a diameter that was the double that of the wild type spores (3.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;m&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) before deswelling and reducing the spore diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1n,r</xref>). Another difference between the wild type and the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant was that, after germination and deswelling, the cell membrane permeability inside the spores remained intact in the wild type strain (SYTO9 staining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1o</xref>), but not in the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant (PI staining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1p</xref>). The increase in spore swelling affected 100% of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant spores at 15&#x02013;18&#x02009;hours (average diameter of 3.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1r</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to expectations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, DNA sequencing demonstrated that the insertion of Tn5062 into cosmid D6.2.B06_046 generated a deletion. Tn5062 was inserted at position 640 of <italic>SCO4439</italic> and 669 of <italic>SCO4440</italic>, generating a loss of 1,641&#x02009;bp, which affected the 5&#x02032;-terminus of <italic>SCO4439</italic> and most of the <italic>SCO4440</italic> open reading frame (ORF) (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).

To identify the gene responsible for the observed phenotype, plasmid pMS82<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> was used to introduce different fragments of the <italic>SCO4437</italic>-<italic>SCO4442</italic> chromosomal region, into the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant strain (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

SCO4439 is not essential for growth; however its mutation resulted in a dramatic increase in both spore resistance to acid/heating and swelling during germination.</p><p>DD-CPases are usually anchored to cell membranes at their N-terminus, and their active sites are exposed to the periplasmic space in which they catalyze the final stages of cell wall biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. SCO4439 is very unusual, because in addition to the DD-CPase domain, it harbors an additional putative transcriptional regulator domain. Other DD-CPases, including most HMM DD-CPases, are multi domain proteins and harbor glycosyl transferase domains involved in cell wall maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, to our knowledge, SCO4439 is the first DD-CPase that is associated with a putative transcriptional regulatory domain. SCO4439 has a high molecular mass of 84&#x02009;kDa, resulting in its classification as an HMM DD-CPase. However, the DD-peptidase domain of SCO4439 is homologous to LMM DD-peptidases and exhibits the DD-CPase activity that is peculiar to LMM DD-peptidases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The putative transmembrane domain of SCO4439 is located in the middle of the protein, separating the DD-CPase and the putative transcriptional regulator domains, which is also unusual. The (1) Phobius prediction of the protein structure, (2) the presence of DD-CPase activity only in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> insoluble fractions (membranes and cell wall debris) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>) and (3) the presence of the essential nature of the transmembrane domain for biological activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) suggest that the DD-CPase domain is exposed to the periplasmic space, whereas the putative transcriptional regulatory domain is likely located on the cytosol side of the cell membrane. Further work is required to understand the biological function, if any, of the putative transcriptional regulatory domain located at the N-terminus of SCO4439. The presence of this domain in all SCO4439 orthologs suggests that it may have a relevant function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, its relatively low conservation (44% average similarity), its exclusive occurrence in streptomycetes, and finally, its unessential role in complementing the spore germination and resistance phenotypes in the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant may indicate that this domain has not an essential function.</p><p>Spore germination comprises a succession of distinctive steps that were organized by Hardisson <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> into three stages: darkening, swelling, and germ tube emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). The biomolecular mechanisms controlling these stages remain poorly characterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. There are two examples of proteins known to be involved in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spore germination. NepA was described as a structural cell wall protein involved in the maintenance of spore dormancy in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. SsgA was identified as a protein marking cell-wall sites in which germination takes place<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The phenotype of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant observed in this work indicates the existence of a new stage that includes the deswelling of the spores once they cannot resist further swelling. The occurrence of this stage was demonstrated via time-lapse microscopy in both the wild type and the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m,n</xref>). In the wild-type strain, spore deswelling coincided with germ tube emergence, whereas the spores of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant continued to swell after the emergence of the germ tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). In the partially complemented <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant (the strain complemented with the <italic>SCO4439*</italic> mutated gene), spore swelling persisted also after germ tube emergence, but the maximum swelling was lower than in the mutant (maximum spore diameter of 3.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;m vs. the 4.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;m reached in the mutant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1p,q</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">4</xref>).</p><p>The proposed biomolecular model to account for the observed phenotypes in the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant is schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>. Accordingly, a deficiency in SCO4439 DD-CPase increments the pool of available transpeptidase substrates (PG pentapeptides), thereby enhancing the activity of these enzymes and promoting the formation of PG crosslinks. Spores with highly crosslinked PG are more resistant to heating and acid and swell more slowly at early germination time points, but they can reach greater dimensions before lysing due to osmotic shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). The mutation in SCO4439 that replaces Leu<sub>684</sub> with Pro<sub>684</sub>, halved the native DD-CPase activity, and when the <italic>SCO4439*</italic> gene was introduced into the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant, the phenotype was only partially restored. This demonstrates that spore swelling during germination is proportional to SCO4439 DD-CPase activity. The model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> would also be valid for new PG synthetized in the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant after spore germination, at the latest stages of the swelling, which will have more cross-linking than the wild strain.</p><p><italic>Streptomyces</italic> mutants created in germination such as <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic>, represent a key tool that provides insight into this process. Up to now, the osmotic mechanism controlling spore swelling is largely unknown. Germ tube emergence is marked by SsgA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and uncharacterized lytic enzymes regulate the splitting of the spore covers at this germination point<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Spore swelling may facilitate the emergence of the germ tube<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and germ tube emergence coincides with the end of the swelling in the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m</xref>). The dramatic swelling of the spores in the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant after germ tube emergence suggests that the high osmotic pressure in the spore cytoplasm feeds this swelling. In the weaker spores of the wild-type strain (low PG crosslinking), spore swelling culminate with the emergence of the germ tube. However, spores of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant have higher PG crosslinking, and the swelling continues after the emergence of the germ tube. In this scenario, the cells likely still detect the high osmotic pressure that in normal conditions would indicate the absence of germination, thus they increase swelling and osmotic pressure to facilitate germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Further work is required to fully comprehend this phenomenon. Interestingly, some studies have already suggested a role for PBPs in spore germination in other sporulating bacteria such as <italic>Bacillus.</italic> Neyman and Buchanan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and Murray <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> described how some DD-peptidases are expressed differentially during <italic>Bacillus</italic> sporulation and germination, and Buchanan and Gustafson<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> showed that <italic>dacB</italic> mutants produce spores with unusual resistance to chemicals and heating in <italic>Bacillus</italic>.</p><p>The lack of the DD-CPase activity in <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant strain increases the pool of PG pentapeptide, the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptides of which are the molecular target of glycopeptide antibiotics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Consequently, the mycelium of the <italic>SCO4439::Tn5062</italic> mutant was more sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin than the mycelium of the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> resistance to vancomycin (but not to teicoplanin), was described to be due to the canonical set of <italic>vanRSHAX</italic> genes induced by vancomycin (but not by teicoplanin) that are responsible for replacing the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptides with the resistant D-Ala-D-Lac dipeptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Recent work demonstrated that other enzymes (VanY-like) contribute to glycopeptide resistance in actinomycetes by removing the last D-Ala from the PG-pentapeptide precursors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Interestingly, these enzymes are membrane-associated LMW DD-CPases with a minor activity on dipeptides and are in some cases inhibited by &#x003b2;-lactams<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>SCO4439</italic> DD-CPase gene is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), whereas the specific DD-CPase enzymatic activity decreases during development (from 5&#x02009;U/mg protein at 16&#x02009;hours, to 3&#x02009;U/mg protein at 72&#x02009;hours) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).

Loss of DD-CPase activity may be due to the increasing protein instability in the above conditions. Anyhow, the occurrence of other specific post-translational modifications regulating the DD-CPase activity cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Overall, this work demonstrates that the SCO4439 DD-CPase regulates the proportion of PG crosslinking in the spore cell walls, a process that is critical for the regulation of spore germination.
