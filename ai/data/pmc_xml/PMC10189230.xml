It has antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-psoriasis, and antitumor activities. Therefore, its overproduction in addition to gene expression analysis was our main target. Through this study, we isolated a novel potent mycophenolic acid (MPA) producer strain of the genus <italic>Penicillium</italic> from the refrigerated Mozzarella cheese and it was identified with the molecular marker ITS and <italic>benA</italic> genes as <italic>P. arizonense</italic>HEWt1. Three MPA overproducer mutants were isolated by exposing the wild type to different doses of gamma-rays, and the fermentation conditions for the highest production of MPA were optimized. The results indicated that MPA amounts produced by the mutants MT1, MT2, and MT3 were increased by 2.1, 1.7, and 1.6-fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type. The growth of both mutant and wild-type strains on PD broth, adjusted to pH 6 and incubated at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15 d, were the best conditions for maximum production of MPA. In a silico study, five orthologs genes of MPA biosynthesizing gene clusters in <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> were predicted from the genome of <italic>P. arizonense</italic>. Sequencing and bioinformatic analyses proved the presence of five putative genes namely <italic>mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG</italic>, and <italic>mpaH</italic> in the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> HEWt1 genome. Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR indicated an increase in the transcription value of all annotated genes in the three mutants over the wild type. A highly significant increase in the gene expression of <italic>mpaC, mpaF</italic>, and <italic>mpaH</italic> was observed in <italic>P. arizonense</italic>-MT1 compared with wild-type. These results confirmed the positive correlation of these genes in MPA biosynthesis and are the first report regarding the production of MPA by <italic>P. arizonense.</italic></p><p id="Par2">Kew word.</p><p id="Par3">Mycophenolic acid, <italic>Penicillium arizonense</italic>, mutagenesis, gene expression.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12866-023-02884-z.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Zagazig University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &#x00026; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">The wide metabolic variety within the fungal kingdom continues to supply an opulent source for novel drugs. The physiological and chemical diversity in the fungal kingdom leads to the identification of novel bioprocesses depending on fungi that can meet the demands of the current society for creative pharmaceuticals and antimicrobials. Huge numbers of secondary metabolites were previously detected in the fungal kingdom. However, the evolution of the discovery of proper bioactive secondary metabolites to their applications remains a challenge. <italic>Penicillium</italic> is a diverse genus distributed worldwide in various habitats. Although DNA sequences are necessary for the strong identification of different species of <italic>Penicillium</italic>, there is currently no universal reference database for verification of its genus. <italic>Penicillium</italic> genera contain more than 354 accepted species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which are a vital industrial unit for the biosynthesis of many chemically and structurally diverse bioactive secondary metabolites, including significant pharmaceutical compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the representation of fungal kingdoms in industrial bioprocesses is still limited, and the improvement of the production of significant compounds is considered an intensive challenge and remains expensive. Mycophenolic acid (6-(4-hydroxy-6-methoxy methyl 3oxophthalanyl)-4-methyl-4-hexenoic acid, C17H20O6 (MPA) is a famous secondary metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] that was discovered as a product of <italic>Penicillium brevicompactum</italic> before the start of the 20th century. Some <italic>Penicillium</italic> species have also been reported to produce it, including <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic>, <italic>P. viridicatum, P. stoloniferum</italic> and <italic>P. roquefourti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mycophenolic acid and its precursors, 5-methylorsellinic acid and 5,7-dihydroxy4-methylphthalide, were also identified as secondary metabolites of the yeast <italic>Byssochlamys nivea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Due to its immunosuppressive and antimicrobial properties, it has been characterized as an important bioactive compound with various biomedical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, MPA has regular medical applications as an immunosuppressive drug in the form of mycophenolate mofetil, which has been used to treat different autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Much interest has been directed to the industrial production of MPA due to its potent antiviral effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recent studies proved that MPA has an effective antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)&#x02010;OC43, HCoV&#x02010;NL63, and SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and reported that the combination of MPA and interferon can be used for the treatment of COVID-19. For this intensive importance of MPA, it is necessary to search for a new <italic>Penicillium</italic> species to produce MPA and to improve its productivity through the batch fermentation process. Cheese is a favorable substrate for the growth of various species of <italic>Penicillium</italic> because of its favorable preservation conditions for fungal growth, such as low temperature and moisture content. Previous studies reported the distribution of <italic>Penicillium</italic> species in a wide range of refrigerated cheeses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although it seems to be no record of the appearance of harmful effects in humans following the consumption of fermented blue cheese, scientific research has increased attention on the production of some secondary metabolites by <italic>Penicillium</italic> species isolated from these cheeses. A known metabolite of <italic>Penicillium</italic> connected with blue cheeses is mycophenolic acid (MPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, it was used as a source for the isolation of a new MPA-producing species belonging to the <italic>Penicillium</italic> genus.</p><p id="Par5">The molecular basis of MPA biosynthesis was recently investigated in both <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> and <italic>P. roqueforti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The MPA gene cluster in <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> consists of 8 open reading frames (<italic>mpaA, mpaB, mpaC, mpaD, mpaE, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH)</italic>, which encode a putative prenyltransferase, a protein with unknown function, a polyketide synthase, a natural fusion of a cytochrome P450 domain, a hydrolase domain, an inosine-5&#x000b4;-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an O-methyltransferase, and an oxidative cleavage enzyme, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The <italic>mpaC</italic> is responsible for the first step in MPA biosynthesis through the production of 5-methylorsellinic acid (5-MOA, which is encoded by polyketide synthase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, it was recently illustrated that the <italic>mpaF</italic> gene encodes an MPA-insensitive inosine-5&#x000b4;-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which confers self-resistance toward MPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The investigation of the molecular basis of MPA production in producer fungal species has a significant impact on facilitating the understanding of the mechanism of its production and controlling how it can be improved, especially when the producer species is the first record. The gene cluster of bioactive metabolites typically consists of the genes that confer the needed toleration on the compounds. MPA is an inhibitor of IMPDH, which is responsible for the conversion of IMP to XMP in the novel pathway of GMP biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This reaction is important for all living microorganisms. Inosine-5&#x02019;-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) genes are highly conserved among various species of microorganisms.</p><p id="Par6"><italic>P. arizonense</italic> is a strong producer of various secondary metabolites and different proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Large numbers of secondary metabolites, such as tryptoquivalines, pyripyropenes, austalides, fumagillin, pseurotin A, xanthoepocin, and curvulinic acid, were investigated in the cell extract of <italic>P. arizonense</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Genome sequencing analysis of <italic>P. arizonense</italic> was assembled into 33.7&#x000a0;Mb containing 12,502 predicted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Between these genes, 62 putative biosynthetic gene clusters are involved in lipid metabolism and secondary metabolite production. Up till now, there have been several incompletely annotated open reading frames (ORFs) in the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome. For these reasons, we aimed to overproduce MPA by a novel producer species of <italic>Penicillium</italic>, namely, <italic>P. arizonense</italic>, and to study the expression of the MPA-producing genes through identification and cloning of the synthesizing genes of <italic>P. arizonense</italic> that are orthologous to the MPA biosynthesizing gene cluster in <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic>. We also focused on studying the gene expression of the identified genes in combination with a physiological analysis of MPA production. There is no previous study on the phenotypic and genotypic analysis of MPA production by <italic>P. arizonense</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par7">All chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

It was noticed that the ranges of pH values suitable for mycelial growth ranged from 5 to 8 while the maximum growth of both wild type and mutant strains was observed at pH value 5 (7.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.20 and 7.31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.57&#x000a0;mg mL<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> culture medium, respectively). After incubation of both the wild-type and mutant strains at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10 days, the optimum incubation temperature for optimum production of MPA by both <italic>P. arizonense</italic> HE-MPWt and <italic>P. arizonense</italic> HE-MPM1 strains (5.974&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.31 and 12.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2404&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g mL<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>, respectively) and for maximum mycelial growth (6.16&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.42and 5.28&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.29&#x000a0;mg mL<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> culture medium, respectively) was recorded at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C <bold>(</bold>Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref><sub><bold>d</bold></sub><bold>)</bold>. Although well growth of both mutants and wild type was observed at 10&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, all strains failed to produce MPA at this temperature. These results indicate that the growth of all experimental strains on PD broth adjusted to pH 6 and incubated at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15 d were favorable for MPA production. In general, there were significant differences in MPA production by the wild-type and all mutant strains under all tested environmental conditions according to independent samples t-tests (P&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05). Additionally, there was no relation between the mycelial growth and the MPA production in most of the tested conditions. The optimal environmental conditions of the three selected mutants were identical in all experiments. Therefore, the highest producer mutant, MT1, was represented in this study as a model mutant in comparison with the wild-type strain.</p><p id="Par32">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">Mycophenolic acid is a fungal secondary metabolite with a variety of pharmaceutical activities and is widely applied in clinical practices. For its vital importance in the biomedical field, in this study we aimed to isolate a new MPA producer species from the genus <italic>Penicillium</italic> and to improve its production. <italic>Penicillium</italic> is a vital industrial unit for the biosynthesis of many chemically and structurally diverse secondary metabolites, including significant pharmaceutical compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These compounds include penicillin, roquefortine, chrysogine, and fungisporin which represent the starting point for the investigation of highly efficient antibiotics, a milestone in therapeutic medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The most principal scientific discovery of the 20th century was Penicillin antibiotics which were among the first drugs to be effective against several diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. MPA is one of the most important secondary metabolites, which was discovered in 1893 and has been identified as an essential bioactive substance with immunosuppressive, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, and various activities. It has been produced by many <italic>Penicillium</italic> species including <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> (also known as <italic>P. stoloniferum</italic>), <italic>P. paxilli, P. olivicolor, P. canescens</italic> (also known as <italic>P. raciborskii</italic>), <italic>P. roqueforti, and P. viridicatum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In this study, we isolated a new antibiotic-producer strain of <italic>P. arizonense</italic> from refrigerated Mozzarella cheese, and it was found to be a strong producer of MPA when it was grown in submerged PD broth culture. Large numbers of secondary metabolites, such as tryptoquivalines, pyripyropenes, austalides, fumagillin, pseurotin A, xanthoepocin, and curvulinic acid, were investigated in the cell extract of <italic>P. arizonense</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The morphological identification and marker gene analysis of rRNA and <italic>benA</italic> confirmed the highest similarity of our isolate with <italic>P. arizonense</italic> CBS141311. Because many of the preferable compounds are naturally produced in considerable amounts, fungi have a great potential as specific hosts for the biosynthesis of small molecules. The broad benefit in fungi has led to the hole sequencing of numerous fungal genomes. This number is expected to a dramatically increase in the upcoming years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Information concerning the molecular basis of MPA biosynthesis in <italic>P. arizonense</italic> would be very helpful for both the potential production of MPA and the control of its contamination in food products; however, there is no previous information about the biosynthetic pathway. In this study, two contigs containing five orthologous genes of MPA gene clusters were identified in the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome, namely, <italic>mpaA, mpC, mpaF</italic>, <italic>mpaG</italic>, and <italic>mpaH</italic>. The genes <italic>mpaA</italic>, which encodes a putative prenyltransferase; <italic>mpaC</italic>, which encodes a polyketide synthase; <italic>mpaDE</italic>, which encodes a natural fusion of a cytochrome P450 domain and a hydrolase domain; <italic>mpaF</italic>, which encodes a protein with high similarity to inosine-5&#x000b4;-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH); <italic>mpaG</italic>, which encodes an O-methyltransferase; and <italic>mpaH</italic>, which encodes an oxidative cleavage enzyme, were identified as gene clusters for MPA biosynthesis in the <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> genome. The <italic>mpaC</italic> gene is responsible for the biosynthesis of 5-methylorsellinic acid (5-MOA), which is the initial step in MPA synthesis. The following conversion of 5-MOA to 4,6-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methylbenzoic acid and 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methyl phthalide (DHMP) was performed by the enzyme <italic>mpaDE</italic>. The final step in the biosynthesis process is completed by <italic>mpaG</italic> (the putative O-methyl transferase), which stimulates the methylation of dimethyl mycophenolic acid (DMMPA) to form MPA. The strong amplification of these genes from the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome indicates their participation in the biosynthesis of MPA. In silico study, no contig containing the ORFs encoding similar proteins to <italic>mpaB, mpaE</italic>, and <italic>mpaD</italic> were identified in the genome of <italic>P. arizonense</italic>. This result indicated that there are no homologous sequences of the three unidentified genes, <italic>mpaB, mpaE, and mpaD</italic>, with the related orthologous genes of both <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> and <italic>P. roqueforti</italic>. To predict these genes, additional studies are required for the identification of the putative proteins encoded by these genes. The gene cluster encoding MPA was recently investigated in both <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and <italic>P. roqueforti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. <italic>P. arizonense</italic> is defined as one of a group that belongs to the <italic>Penicillium</italic> section <italic>Canescentia</italic> and contains a large number of genes participating in lipid metabolism and a secondary metabolite production. Sequencing analysis of the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome revealed that it was assembled into 33.7&#x000a0;Mb containing 12,502 predicted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Additionally, 62 putative biosynthetic gene clusters involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis were identified in its genome. Up till now, the putative genes that participated in the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome have not been completely annotated, and their phenotypic action is still under investigation. It was previously investigated whether <italic>P. arizonense</italic> contains gene clusters responsible for austalide (meroterpenoid) production. Mycophenolic acid is an important compound related to meroterpenoids that is composed of a terpene-derived side chain and an acetate-derived phthalide nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This phthalide structure is also present in the austalides, so it is likely that austalides and mycophenolic acid have identical biosynthetic gene clusters. Orthologs to <italic>mpaC, mpaD</italic>, and <italic>mpaA</italic> genes evolving in the MPA biosynthesis cluster of <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> were found in the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This report agrees with our investigation, where a homologous partial sequence of 5 genes with locus tags, PENARI_c010G07427, PENARI_c010G07355, PENARI_c010G04864, PENARI_c005G09215, and PENARI_c010G08752, were annotated in the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome, and they were found to be orthologs to the MPA gene cluster <italic>mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH</italic>, respectively, in <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic>. The use of mutations to improve several microorganisms for the overproduction of industrial products has been applied for over 50 years and is still accepted as a valuable agent for the improvement of different microbial strains. The random mutagenesis against the wild type of fungal strains leads to a series of mutants, some of them change the production of target secondary metabolite. Most improvements lead to a decrease or lack of production change, but some mutants may show an increase in the production of secondary metabolite. Through the exposure of wild-type <italic>P. arizonense</italic> to random mutagenesis by gamma irradiation, potential producer mutants for MPA were obtained. We succeeded in isolating three stable mutants of <italic>P. arizonense</italic> that had the ability to produce approximately double the amount of MPA compared with the wild-type strain. This result indicates the technological modification of our isolate to be more productive for MPA. Such a mutagenic strain could minimize the cost of the manufacturing processes and enhance the productivity of MPA. The improvement of MPA production was previously investigated by exposing <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> to 250&#x000a0;Gy of gamma radiation, which led to an increase in MPA production productivity by 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Gamma rays may cause various mutations in the gene cluster regulating several secondary metabolites, leading to an increase or decrease in their production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. These metabolites are regulated by a network of master regulators. One such regulator is the Velvet protein complex which is mainly conserved as the regulator of the fungal evaluation and secondary metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A key regulator of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is the LAEA protein that interacts with other components of the velvet complex. The overproduction of MPA may also result from the modification of different processes such as inhibition or secretion of other secondary metabolites in the mutant strains. The variation in the colored pigments of the mutant&#x02019;s metabolite indicated the production of other secondary metabolites compared to the wild-type strain. This result indicated that the mutated programs affect other genes such as <italic>lea</italic> and <italic>velvet</italic> genes which control secondary metabolites production and this likely has impacted the expression of several secondary metabolites encoding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Because <italic>P. arizonense</italic> is considered a new producer strain for MPA, the eco-physiological parameters for its production must be optimized to achieve maximum productivity. The incubation temperature and time were effective factors in the production activity of MPA by both wild-type and mutant strains. Generally, like other secondary metabolites, the production of MPA was noticed to be increased during the stationary phase of fungal growth. MPA is a secondary metabolite, so its production was affected by the time of incubation, where the elongation of incubation time to 10 and 15 days enhanced the productivity of our experimental strains. Similarly, <bold>Vinokurova et al.</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] reported that MPA synthesis was dramatically concentrated during the stationary phase of growth after 10 days of incubation. This investigation agrees with our results, where the mycelial growth of all mutant and wild-type strains did not correlate with MPA production. Additionally, the initial pH value and the incubation temperature were critical factors affecting the production of MPA by <italic>P. arizonense</italic>. The highest production of MPA was observed when all fungal strains were grown on PD broth adjusted to initial pH 6 and incubated at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Accompanied by our results, <bold>Patel et al.</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] recorded that the optimum culture conditions for maximum production of MPA were detected after incubation of <italic>P. brevicompactum</italic> for 12 d at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C using pH 5 as an initial value. Additionally, <bold>Wu et al.</bold>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] reported that MPA production was 58.1% higher under optimum fermentation conditions than that initial fermentation condition without optimizations. Overproduction of MPA in mutated strains was confirmed with expression analysis of the main predicted MPA biosynthesizing genes. Expression analysis of these genes in all MPA over producer mutants showed a highly significant fold increase over the wild type after incubation times of 5 and 10 days. Additionally, the expression values of all genes were higher after 10 d than after 5 d of incubation. This result agrees with the physiological study of MPA production by mutant and wild-type strains of <italic>P. arizonense</italic>, where the amount of MPA was significantly higher in all mutant strains compared to wild-type and increased after 10 d of incubation compared to 5 d. The obtained results indicated a positive relationship between the transcription value of the MPA genes, <italic>mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH</italic>, and the production of MPA under different environmental conditions. Additionally, these results confirmed the vital role of the annotated genes in the biosynthesis pathway, which was considered an indication of the capability of the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> HEwt strain to produce MPA in submerged culture. The significant similarity between the five sequence amplicons with their related putative protein-encoding genes of <italic>P. arizonense</italic> CBS141311, deposited in the GenBank database, is considered strong evidence for the correct identification of our strain. This is the first report concerning the overproduction of MPA by <italic>P. arizonense</italic>, in addition to the expression analysis of the orthologous MPA genes and their correlation with phenotypic analysis. This investigation could be a new platform for the industrial biosynthesis of this vital compound using a new producer species of <italic>Penicillium</italic> and considered a new annotation of five MPA genes shared in MPA biosynthesis in the <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">We concluded from this study that the <italic>Penicillium</italic> group contains various species that have the capability to produce several important secondary metabolites. A new local strain <italic>of P. arisonense</italic> was isolated from refrigerated cheese and identified <italic>as P. arizonense</italic> HE-wt. This strain showed high productivity for MPA during its growth in PD broth. The production of MPA was improved by mutagenesis of the wild type and isolation of three stronger stable mutants for MPA production. The optimized conditions for maximum production of MPA by both mutant and wild type revealed that the growth of all strains on PD broth adjusted to pH 6 and incubated at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15 d were optimum for MPA production. The molecular basis for MPA production in <italic>P. arizonense</italic> was also investigated in our research. Through bioinformatic analysis and partial sequencing analysis of the MPA ortholog genes, we confirmed the presence of five open reading frames of locus tags PENARI_c010G07427, PENARI_c010G07355, PENARI_c010G04864, PENARI_c005G09215, and PENARI_c010G08752, that were orthologous to the MPA gene cluster <italic>mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH</italic> in <italic>P. arizonense</italic> HE genome. The phenotypic and genotypic analyses showed their importance in the biosynthesis of MPA by <italic>P. arizonense</italic> and suggested that three of them, namely, <italic>mpaC, mpaF, and mpaG</italic>, have an intensive role in the biosynthesis process. This is the first report regarding the isolation of a new MPA producer strain belonging to section <italic>Canescentia</italic> and the improvement of this production by mutagenesis of the wildtype strain by Gama radiation in addition to the expression analysis of the biosynthesizing orthologous genes in <italic>P. arizonense</italic> genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
