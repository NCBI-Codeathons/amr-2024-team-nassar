Streptomycetes produce a staggering number and variety of natural products, including genotoxic DNA-damaging antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These agents may covalently alkylate or non-covalently intercalate the DNA nucleobases, forming mutagenic and/or toxic adducts that inhibit replication, transcription, or chromosome maturation, leading to chromosome rearrangement and instability, cell death, aging, and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Among the most potent genotoxic secondary metabolites are those of the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone (SCPCHD) family, which includes yatakemycin (YTM), gilvusmycin, CC-1065, and duocarmycin A and SA (DSA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)&#x02014;all of which exhibit high cytotoxicity against tumor cells and pathogenic fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways serve to eliminate the majority of alkyl-DNA lesions.

To counter this toxicity, at least two of the Streptomycetes that produce SCPCHD natural products encode DNA glycosylases within the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).

Moreover, the utility of the non-base-flipping mechanism employed by these enzymes to recognize SCPCHD adducts has not been explored outside YTM and AlkD. To elucidate how YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to efficiently eliminate lesions generated by diverse SCPCHD natural products, we performed a comparative biochemical, biophysical, and structural analysis to identify differences between AlkD and these specialized homologs that are responsible for conferring enhanced cellular resistance against YTM, CC-1065, and DSA. Our data indicate that reduced product affinity, not enhanced substrate recognition, is the key factor associated with improved cellular resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SCPCHD adducts stabilize the DNA duplex through a network of CH-&#x003c0; interactions</title><p id="Par7">The five known SCPCHD natural products can be divided into three sub-types based on the number and arrangement of the indole and pyrroloindole subunits (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). To better understand how these differences affect toxicity and repair, we selected one compound from eac`h group for biochemical and biophysical characterization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We previously demonstrated that a single YTM adduct in a short oligonucleotide retains a B-DNA conformation and dramatically increases the stability of the duplex, providing an explanation for why these lesions are poorly repaired by the NER pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Similarly, earlier work showed that multiple CC-1065 adducts greatly increase the melting temperature of genomic DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To directly compare the effects of the different SCPCHD sub-types on DNA stability and structure, we introduced a single YTM, DSA, or CC-1065 adduct onto a central adenine within the same GC-rich DNA dodecamer. The circular dichroism spectra of each construct showed negative and positive bands at ~240 and 270&#x02009;nm, respectively, indicative of B-form DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Additional features in the spectra likely result from either minor structural perturbation of the DNA or dichroism of the SCPCHD adducts themselves, which produce broad peaks above 300&#x02009;nm in the absorbance spectra (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). To assess the effect of each compound on duplex stability, thermal denaturation was monitored by an increase in absorbance at 260&#x02009;nm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Relative to unmodified DNA, the presence of a single DSA, YTM, or CC-1065 adduct increased the melting temperature by 23, 36, or &#x02265;41&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively. The increase in duplex stability correlated with the stability of the adduct. After 28 days at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, only 16%, 11%, and 8%, respectively, of DSA, YTM, and CC-1065 adducts had spontaneously depurinated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Despite being maintained as rigid bodies, all adducts fit in the minor groove without steric clashes. In these hypothetical models, the hydrophilic edges of the subunits are exposed to solvent, whereas the hydrophobic faces are sandwiched between the backbones of the two DNA strands. As we previously described with YTM adducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, this arrangement creates an extended network of CH-&#x003c0; interactions. Although these interactions are individually often weak (~1&#x02009;kcal/mol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, the combined strength of many such interactions generates a strong energy barrier to duplex denaturation and lesion depurination. Indeed, DNA stability and lesion half-life correlate with the number of nucleotides that form CH-&#x003c0; interactions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Thus, this network of weak interactions explains the trends in duplex stability and nucleotide half-life that we observe with each adduct. Importantly, our models and conclusions are consistent with a previously published NMR structure of DSA-DNA (PDB accession <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1DSA/pdb">1DSA</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), which further highlights the importance of CH-&#x003c0; interactions on the stability of SCPCHD-modified DNA duplexes. Relative to ideal B-form DNA, the DSA adduct in the experimental structure induces a slight narrowing of the minor groove and twisting of the DNA backbone, which maximizes the number and strength of the CH-&#x003c0; interactions formed between the adduct and the DNA. Thus, through a network of CH-&#x003c0; interactions, SCPCHD adducts create an induced fit in the minor groove that tethers the opposing DNA strands and prevents gross deformation to the B-DNA conformation, explaining how these adducts pose a significant challenge to repair by the UvrABC NER excinuclease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065</title><p id="Par9">Historically, bulky DNA lesions, such as SCPCHD adducts, have been regarded as substrates for the NER pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. However, we previously showed that NER provides <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> with only limited resistance against YTM, while AlkD-mediated BER provides a modest degree of additional resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

As previously observed with eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, YTM was the most toxic, inhibiting growth at the lowest drug concentration, followed by CC-1065 and then DSA. In cultures containing YTM, only YtkR2 provided clear and significant resistance, shortening the lag phase before exponential growth. Similarly, in cultures containing CC-1065, C10R5 provided the greatest resistance, although YtkR2, and to a much lesser extent AlkD, also provided additional resistance. The same trend was observed in cultures containing DSA; C10R5 provided the greatest resistance, followed by YtkR2 and then AlkD. These data are consistent with the notion that YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065, respectively. However, both proteins also confer substantial resistance against DSA, and YtkR2 provides moderate resistance against CC-1065. This lack of specificity suggests that the features of YtkR2 and C10R5 responsible for drug resistance are largely independent of the differences between the SCPCHD compounds. The only exception to this generalization appears to be the lack of resistance against YTM provided by C10R5.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Determination of drug resistance.</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells transformed with either an empty plasmid (blank) or a plasmid encoding AlkD, YtkR2, or C10R5 were grown in the presence of various concentrations of YTM, DSA, or CC-1065.

Under single-turnover conditions, in which the enzymes are in molar excess of the DNA substrates, both AlkD and YtkR2 rapidly excised all three adducts, approaching the endpoints of the reactions within 15&#x02009;s (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). C10R5 rapidly excised DSA and CC-1065 lesions, albeit more slowly than AlkD and YtkR2, but removed YTM adducts at a substantially reduced rate. Under multiple-turnover conditions, in which the DNA substrates are in molar excess of the enzymes, the results were strikingly different (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Although AlkD rapidly excised a molar equivalent of each adduct (i.e., the first turnover in which ~10% product is formed), subsequent turnovers occurred several orders of magnitude more slowly. Excision of adducts by YtkR2 was similarly slowed, although to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, the multiple-turnover rates of removal of DSA and CC-1065 lesions by C10R5 were effectively unchanged; only the rate of excision of YTM adducts was substantially reduced. Thus, under single-turnover conditions, all homologs have the capacity for rapid excision of diverse SCPCHD lesions, although this capacity appears to be reduced in C10R5, and inefficient substrate recognition by C10R5 seemingly further slows removal of YTM lesions. For all homologs, there is only weak correlation between rates of single-turnover excision and cellular resistance (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

The high melting temperature of the GC-rich substrate prevented complete denaturation of the DNA duplex, producing a smeared substrate band. The unique sequence specificities of YTM, CC-1065, and DSA for different 2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine nucleotides result in generation of alkali-cleaved products of different lengths.

The substantially faster multiple turnover that we observed with YtkR2 and C10R5 therefore suggests that product affinity is weaker for these homologs. To test this possibility, we performed AP-DNA incision assays using the AP endonuclease EndoIV and either AP-DNA generated from each of the SCPCHD adducts or tetrahydrofuran (THF)-DNA containing an AP analog (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Reaction mixtures with THF-DNA were supplemented with free 3-methyladenine (3mAde) nucleobase to approximate the nucleobase adducts excised from the SCPCHD lesions, while also providing a basis to assess the effects of the excised SCPCHD adducts on product affinity. Relative to AP-DNA produced by AlkD, AP-DNA generated by YtkR2 or C10R5 was incised by EndoIV to a substantially greater extent, regardless of which SCPCHD adduct was excised to produce the abasic site, consistent with relatively weak product binding by YtkR2 and C10R5. For each of the homologs, AP-DNA generated from DSA-DNA was cleaved to the greatest extent, which could be explained by DSA-Ade being bound by each of the homologs with weaker affinity, producing a less stable ternary product complex, and/or by DSA-Ade inhibiting AP-DNA incision by EndoIV to a lesser degree. The former would be consistent with the fewer observed or predicted protein-adduct binding interactions formed with DSA-Ade (described below), whereas the latter would be consistent with the fewer predicted CH-&#x003c0; interactions formed with DSA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). Unlike AP-DNA, the extent to which THF-DNA was incised by EndoIV was independent of which DNA glycosylase homolog was present, and no additional THF-DNA was incised in reactions mixtures in which AlkD, YtkR2, and C10R5 were omitted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), indicating product affinity is greater for abasic DNA in the presence of the excised SCPCHD adducts. Taken together, the base excision and AP-DNA incision data suggest that YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to possess lower product affinities than AlkD for abasic DNA derived from SCPCHD lesions. Moreover, this apparently reduced product affinity correlates with the increased cellular resistance provided by these specialized homologs (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d,e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Diverse SCPCHD adducts are recognized primarily through nonspecific interactions</title><p id="Par12">To understand AlkD&#x02019;s lack of specificity for the three SCPCHD sub-types and comparatively high product affinity, we determined crystal structures of AlkD bound to DNA containing each of the three adducts.

Only three&#x02014;Gln38, Lys156, and Lys194&#x02014;form adduct-specific hydrogen-bonding interactions. Gln38 interacts with the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subunit unique to YTM, while Lys194 interacts with the methoxy substituent of the S<sup>+2</sup> subunit unique to CC-1065. Otherwise, Gln38 and Lys194 function as DNA-binding residues. Lys156 contacts all three adducts but only forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hydroxyl substituent specific to the S<sup>+1</sup> subunit of CC-1065. In YTM and DSA, this position is occupied by a methoxy group, forcing Lys156 to adopt a different rotamer that hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone. All other hydrogen bonds between the adducts and the protein are mediated by water. Additional recognition of the adducts occurs through hydrophobic contacts and CH-&#x003c0; interactions. The majority of these binding interactions involve the S<sup>0</sup> and S<sup>+1</sup> subunits present in all of the SCPCHD adducts. Of seemingly principal importance are Tyr27, Met28, Trp109, Asp110, Leu155, and Trp187. Together, these residues form a shelf below the adducts and provide an alternative network of CH-&#x003c0; interactions, replacing the network of CH-&#x003c0; interactions that is disrupted upon binding of the DNA by AlkD and widening of the minor groove. Thus, AlkD&#x02019;s substrate-binding cleft can accommodate each SCPCHD compound with strikingly few adduct-specific interactions. This lack of specificity is consistent with AlkD&#x02019;s similar rates of excision for the three substrates.</p><p id="Par14">To explain the structural basis for cellular resistance against SCPCHD compounds provided by YtkR2 and C10R5, the AlkD product complexes were used as templates to create homology models of both homologs bound to abasic DNA and each of the nucleobase adducts (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Despite the low sequence identity (19&#x02013;25%) among the three proteins, the only putative structural difference of note is an extended loop between helices &#x003b1;I and &#x003b1;J in both YtkR2 and C10R5. The three homologs appear to share the same three catalytic residues and a high conservation among DNA-binding residues, although YtkR2 and C10R5 possess fewer apparent DNA-binding residues (15 and 14, respectively) than the 18 present in AlkD. Within the substrate-binding cleft, the largest variation predicted by the homology models is in the residues that contact the SCPCHD adducts. However, despite this variation, YtkR2 and C10R5 seemingly form few specific interactions with any of the adducts, including the adduct that each evolved to excise. The only putative hydrogen-bonding interactions between YtkR2 and YTM are formed between Arg42 and the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subunit. Similarly, the only likely hydrogen-bonding interactions between C10R5 and CC-1065 are formed between Lys159, Arg205, and the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S<sup>+1</sup> and S<sup>+2</sup> subunits. Surprisingly, all of the adduct-binding residues in YtkR2 and C10R5 that appear to be specific for YTM and CC-1065 are equivalent to the three DNA-binding residues in AlkD that form similar interactions with YTM-Ade and CC1065-Ade (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). As with AlkD, the remainder of the binding interactions are composed of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and CH-&#x003c0; interactions. This apparent lack of structural specificity, combined with the nearly complete lack of specificity observed in the excision assays, suggests the enhanced cellular resistance provided by YtkR2 and C10R5 does not result from enhanced recognition of a particular SCPCHD adduct. Instead, the additional cellular resistance provided by YtkR2 and C10R5 seems more likely to result from decreased product affinity, which may be explained, at least in part, by the reduced number of predicted DNA-binding residues in these homologs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). It is also possible that other, more subtle, structural factors that are not apparent from the homology models may play a role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>C10R5 poorly accommodates the unique arrangement of subunits in YTM</title><p id="Par15">The only significant indication of substrate specificity by any of the three homologs was C10R5&#x02019;s relatively slow excision of YTM-Ade adducts in vitro and corresponding lack of YTM resistance in cells. Given the structural differences between the SCPCHD natural products, we postulated that unfavorable interactions between C10R5 and the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subunit unique to YTM were likely responsible for this reduced activity. Comparison of the YtkR2 and C10R5 homology models indicated three residues (Phe22, Ser25, and Ala40) in C10R5 that were likely to contact the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subunit and that were not conserved in either YtkR2 or AlkD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a&#x02013;c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). To determine the influence of these residues on substrate specificity, we mutated them to the corresponding residues in YtkR2 and measured YTM-Ade excision under modified single- and multiple-turnover conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,e</xref>, Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Under single-turnover conditions, both the F22T and S25G single mutants exhibited a modest increase in YTM-Ade excision activity relative to wild-type C10R5. This effect was further enhanced in the F22T-S25G double mutant. Moreover, the increased activity of the C10R5 F22T-S25G double mutant toward YTM-Ade was within five-fold of wild-type C10R5&#x02019;s activity toward CC1065-Ade (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In contrast, an A40R single mutant and an F22T-S25G-A40R triple mutant displayed decreased YTM-Ade excision activity relative to the wild-type enzyme and the F22T-S25G double mutant, respectively. Under multiple-turnover conditions, all C10R5 single mutants, including A40R, exhibited increased YTM-Ade excision activity, which was further increased in the F22T-S25G double mutant. As observed under single-turnover conditions, the F22T-S25G-A40R triple mutant displayed reduced YTM-Ade excision activity relative to the double mutant. Despite this reduction, the YTM-Ade excision activity of the triple mutant was comparable to that of YtkR2 under multiple-turnover conditions, whereas the YTM-Ade excision activities of the F22T single mutant and the F22T-S25G double mutant were slightly greater than that of YtkR2 (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These comparatively rapid multiple-turnover rates, however, are likely more indicative of C10R5&#x02019;s apparently low product affinity than vastly improved YTM recognition, as the rates at which these mutants removed YTM-Ade is more than 11-fold slower than the rates at which wild-type C10R5 removed CC1065-Ade and DSA-Ade. Moreover, under single-turnover conditions, the YTM-Ade excision activity of YtkR2 vastly exceeded that of all C10R5 mutants. Thus, although the substitutions (F22T and S25G) that increased the volume of the adduct-binding cleft also increased the rate of YTM-Ade excision, suggesting that C10R5&#x02019;s low activity for YTM-Ade is dictated by a sterically constrained binding cleft at the position of the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subunit, additional unfavorable interactions may also be hindering recognition of YTM lesions (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), preventing more rapid excision of YTM-Ade adducts.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Molecular basis of C10R5 substrate specificity.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Close-up views of YtkR2 (<bold>a</bold>) and C10R5 (<bold>b</bold>) homology models bound to AP-DNA and YTM-Ade.

Both enzymes also conferred substantial resistance against DSA, even though DSA differs from YTM and CC-1065 in the substituents present on the S<sup>+1</sup> subunit. YtkR2 also provided significant resistance against CC-1065, which was somewhat unexpected because of the presence of the unique S<sup>+2</sup> subunit, and suggests that interactions with this subunit do not play an important role in determining substrate specificity. Indeed, the outward face of the S<sup>+2</sup> subunit is largely solvent exposed and has the fewest protein contacts of any subunit. In contrast, the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subunit unique to YTM makes several direct protein contacts, which we show largely account for the weak YTM-Ade excision activity of C10R5. Interestingly, the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> binding surface is formed predominantly from helix &#x003b1;B, which is a critical DNA-binding element within the AlkD family of enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and whose structural variability among HLR glycosylases enables binding to a diverse array of ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Steric accommodation of the S<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subunit is the only determinant of substrate specificity that we were able to identify through our comparative analysis. Within the largely water-filled adduct-binding cleft, most hydrogen bonds are mediated by a network of water molecules, which creates a seemingly malleable hydrogen-bonding interface able to accommodate different substituents on the S<sup>0</sup> and S<sup>+1</sup> subunits. Similarly, most of the protein residues that directly contact the adducts form a network of CH-&#x003c0; interactions that is only selective for aromatic groups, which are present in all of the indole and pyrroloindole subunits in all of the SCPCHD adducts. This mode of substrate recognition seems largely incompatible with a high degree of substrate specificity, which is consistent with our experimental observations.</p><p id="Par18">Despite selective pressure for YtkR2 and C10R5 to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065, neither homolog evolved to remove YTM-Ade or CC1065-Ade adducts at a substantially increased rate, as observed by the strong correlation between multiple-turnover excision and cellular resistance. Instead, selective pressure seemingly induced both enzymes to develop reduced product affinity. We previously showed that AlkD&#x02019;s low level of protection against YTM results from product inhibition in which the enzyme remains bound to the newly formed abasic site in the DNA, slowing multiple-turnover excision, as well as impeding subsequent repair steps in the BER pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Both YtkR2 and C10R5 have evolved to circumvent this inhibition, while also minimizing their impediment to later repair steps. Reduced product inhibition may be explained by the fewer DNA-binding residues predicted in these proteins, which are also the only contacts predicted to form &#x0201c;specific&#x0201d; hydrogen bonds with the adducts. It is interesting to speculate that the evolution of YtkR2 and C10R5 to improve multiple turnover occurred as a means to handle the high concentration of YTM or CC-1065 in the producing strains, whereas the rapid single-turnover activity of AlkD is sufficient to provide resistance to the presumably much lower intracellular quantities of these compounds in <italic>Bacillus</italic> and other non-producing bacteria.</p><p id="Par19">Until recently, all DNA glycosylases were believed to recognize and excise substrates using a base-flipping mechanism in which the target adduct is sequestered from the DNA helix and into a nucleobase-binding pocket on the surface of the enzyme. The AlkD/YtkR2/C10R5 enzymes belong to one of two known bacterial DNA glycosylase superfamilies that have evolved a non-base-flipping mechanism as a means to remove structurally diverse duplex-stabilizing adducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Although their SCPCHD substrates form a covalent bond with only one DNA strand, a network of CH-&#x003c0; interactions non-covalently tethers the two DNA strands together. This greatly stabilizes the duplex, while also hindering the base-flipping activity necessary for recognition and excision by other repair proteins. An unrelated DNA glycosylase, AlkZ, from <italic>Streptomyces sahachiroi</italic> was recently found from its association with the biosynthetic gene cluster for azinomycin B, a highly toxic interstrand crosslinking agent, and shown to provide self-resistance through unhooking of the corresponding DNA crosslinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Enzymes in the AlkZ superfamily have since been shown to remove a variety of alkylated DNA adducts and interstrand crosslinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Despite their different polypeptide folds, AlkZ and AlkD family enzymes adopt a similar C-shaped DNA-binding architecture that enables access to the target <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond while the aberrant nucleotide remains stacked in the DNA. This mode of recognition and excision not only eliminates the problem of flipping a duplex-stabilizing lesion out of the DNA, but also avoids the steric limitations imposed by a nucleobase-binding pocket. Thus, the expanded substrate spectrum of non-base-flipping DNA glycosylases broadens the biological utility of the BER pathway, providing a mechanism for resistance against the genotoxic natural products generated by many bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Protein purification</title><p id="Par20"><italic>B. cereus</italic> AlkD and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp.
