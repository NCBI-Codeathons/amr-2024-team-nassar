Salinosporamide A discovered as a self-resistance product from the marine bacterium <italic>Salinospora tropica</italic>, has been used as a potent proteasome inhibitor (PI). Although PIs have been developed as novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, due to their immunosuppressive effect, whether salinosporamide A inhibits T cell activation remains unknown. The current study finds that salinosporamide A is not cytotoxic, but controls T cell proliferation. Results from our cell cycle arrest analysis revealed that salinosporamide A leads to cell cycle arrest and regulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases. Under activated conditions, salinosporamide A abrogated T cell activation by T cell receptor-mediated stimulation, in which the production of cytokines was inhibited by pretreatment with salinosporamide A. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the regulation of T cell activation by salinosporamide A is mediated by suppressing the MAPK pathway. Therefore, our results suggest that salinosporamide A effectively suppresses T cell activation through regulating T cell proliferation and the cell cycle and provides great insight into the development of novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases or graft-versus-host disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>proteasome inhibitor</kwd><kwd>salinosporamide A</kwd><kwd>marine life-derived</kwd><kwd>T cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-25-05031"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>During the immune response, the proper regulation of T cells is pivotal for maintaining immunological homeostasis, because T cells link humoral immunity to adaptive immunity [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, several events related to T cell activation, including antigenic priming by antigen-presenting cells, activation, and differentiation into effector T cells, should be accurately controlled. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that excessive T cell activity causes a severe immune imbalance or an autoimmune response [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To control the immunological diseases induced by excessive T cell activation, immunosuppressive reagents have been used. Such agents are categorized into two groups: Inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokine production from activated T cells or apoptosis promoters for hazardous T cells.</p><p>T cell proliferation is crucial for elevating the adaptive immune response, which is induced by T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation by co-stimulatory molecules [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. T cell proliferation is initiated by entry into the cell cycle, which is strictly controlled by sequential changes in cyclin expression [<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During the G1 phase, cyclin D is expressed as the first cyclin protein, while cyclin A is expressed at the entry to the S phase [<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previously, it has been found that IL-2, a marker of early T cell activation, acts as the most potent growth factor for T cells [<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Reduced T cell growth rates have been observed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-2, and T cells that are stimulated by antigenic engagement or mitogen activation have also shown proliferation upon treatment with IL-2 [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several immunosuppressive reagents inhibit T cell proliferation in the presence of TCR-mediated stimulation or lead to cell cycle arrest [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although various such reagents have been commercially developed, little is known about whether small molecules derived from natural products regulate T cell activation through proliferation pathways or cell cycle arrest.</p><p>Salinosporamide A, derived from marine bacteria, such as <italic>Salinospora tropica</italic> and <italic>Salinospora arenicola</italic>, is a potent proteasome inhibitor that was first discovered and structurally elucidated in 2003 [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Salinosporamide A has been shown to promote the apoptotic pathway in cancer cells at 35 nM (11 ng/mL) by covalently altering the active site (threonine) of the &#x003b2;&#x02013;subunit of the 20S proteasome [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although various proteasome inhibitors have been found to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, whether salinosporamide A has a regulatory effect on T cell activation has not yet been reported [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study, we first found that treatment of T cells with salinosporamide A efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and promoted cell cycle arrest, in a dose-dependent manner. These inhibitory mechanisms result in the inhibition of T cell activity and the MAPK signaling pathway, following stimulation by anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-25-05031"><title>2.

High Concentrations of Salinosporamide are Cytotoxic to T Cells and Leads to Apoptosis</title><p>Since salinosporamide A has been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity in HCT-116 colon carcinoma at an IC<sub>50</sub> of 11 ng/mL (35 nM), we first confirmed whether salinosporamide A is cytotoxic in Jurkat T cells in the presence of up to 40 nM of salinosporamide A. Treatment with salinosporamide A induced cellular death in a dose-dependent manner (&#x0003c;40 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). To determine whether salinosporamide A promotes apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, AnnexinV and caspase3/7 expression levels were evaluated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C, AnnexinV expression was significantly upregulated, but caspase3/7 expression was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The results from the AnnexinV/propidium iodide apoptotic assay confirmed that high concentrations of salinosporamide A (up to 40 nM) lead to Jurkat T cell apoptosis. These data suggest that treatment with high concentrations of salinosporamide A (20 nM and 40 nM) is cytotoxic and induces apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, and this finding is highly consistent with that of a previous report [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-25-05031"><title>2.2.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, Jurkat T cells incubated with 0.5 to 10 nM salinosporamide A did not exhibit cell death after 24 h. The expression levels of AnnexinV and caspase3/7 in Jurkat T cells treated with up to 10 nM salinosporamide A also demonstrated that salinosporamide A does not cause Jurkat T cell apoptosis at these concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C). To address whether treatment with salinosporamide A affects primary T cells isolated from spleen and lymph nodes, MTT assay was performed after treatment with 2, 5, 10 nM salinosporamide A of mouse T cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f003">Figure 3</xref>D revealed that treatment with salinosporamide A was not cytotoxic to primary T cells up to 10 nM salinosporamide A.

These data indicate that treatment with up to 10 nM salinosporamide A does not promote cell death and apoptosis in Jurkat T cells and mouse T cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-25-05031"><title>2.3. Treatment with 10 nM Salinosporamide A Reduces T Cell Proliferation</title><p>To elucidate whether treatment with 10 nM salinosporamide A affects T cell proliferation, a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) proliferation assay was performed with Jurkat T cells incubated with 10 nM salinosporamide A, by flow cytometry and IncuCyte imaging system. The suppressive effect of salinosporamide A on Jurkat T cell proliferation was determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f004">Figure 4</xref>A), and suppression of CFSE-positive Jurkat T cells treated with salinosporamide A after 24 h was significantly downregulated, in a dose-dependent manner. Obtained microscopic images by IncuCyte imaging system also confirmed that treatment with salinosporamide A of Jurkat T cells reduced the attenuation of CFSE intensity after 24 h incubation compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Furthermore, the growth rate of Jurkat T cells were observed in the presence of salinosporamide A within 72 h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f004">Figure 4</xref>C revealed that treatment with 10 nM salinosporamide A dramatically inhibits the growth rate of Jurkat T cells.

The result obtained from the cell cycle assay showed that the entry into G2/M phase in the cell cycle was significantly blocked by treatment with salinosporamide A. To confirm whether treatment with salinosporamide A affects the cyclin proteins, the expression levels of cyclinA, cyclinD1, and cyclinE were detected by western blotting. The expression of cyclinA and cyclinD1 was significantly downregulated by treatment with salinosporamide A, but comparable cyclinE expression was observed in the presence of salinosporamide A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05031-f005">Figure 5</xref>B).

Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that salinosporamide A derived from marine life suppresses T cell activation by regulating T cell proliferation and entry into the cell cycle. First, it was clearly confirmed that salinosporamide A was not cytotoxic at concentrations below 10 nM in Jurkat T cells and mouse T cells. Furthermore, it has been reported that treatment with salinosporamide A leads to apoptosis at a higher concentration of 35 nM. Treatment with 10 nM salinosporamide A regulated the ability of Jurkat T cells to proliferate and enter into the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The abrogated proliferation and cell cycle entry that were observed upon treatment with salinosporamide A were associated with a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3;, by T cells in the presence of TCR-mediated stimulation of the NF&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways.</p><p>T cells proliferation and entry into the cell cycle are pivotal processes that occur after antigenic engagement with antigen-presenting cells in the early phase of inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Upon TCR-mediated stimulation, T cell proliferation and cell cycle entry are tightly controlled by several regulatory proteins that undergo proteasomal degradation [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A recent report has demonstrated that the activity of the proteasome is highly involved in the differentiation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into effector and memory T cells [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Due to the influence of proteasome inhibitors in regulating various T cell processes, finding the &#x02018;optimal concentration&#x02019; that is effective without showing cytotoxicity is important in the pharmacological approach. In the current study, we first validated whether salinosporamide A leads to cytotoxicity in T cells, in a dose-dependent manner, and evaluated its pharmacological effects on T cell proliferation and entry into the cell cycle at a concentration of 10 nM. Although we observed that 40 nM of salinosporamide A induces cellular apoptosis by performing an apoptosis assay [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we also found that 10 nM of salinosporamide A inhibits T cell activation by abrogating proliferation and entry into the cell cycle. Further studies should be conducted to determine whether 10 nM salinosporamide A or less regulates the functions of T cells, such as differentiation into effector T cells or supervision of immune cells without cytotoxicity.</p><p>Several proteasome inhibitors have been developed as immunosuppressive reagents, due to their regulatory roles in antigen processing and presentation and in signaling cascades that regulate cellular functions and survival [<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The biological functions of proteasome inhibitors have been recently identified in immune and cancer cells, and most proteasome inhibitors have been found to attenuate NF&#x003ba;B signaling [<xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A previous study has also evaluated a promising proteasome inhibitor as an immunosuppressive reagent in animal and clinical experiments and investigated transplant rejection using specific blocking antibodies and graft versus host disease [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another trial investigated whether bortezomib attenuates autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome [<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, bortezomib has been shown to downregulate activated T cell proliferation and IL-2 production, similar to the findings of salinosporamide A in the current study [<xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05031" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We found that pretreatment with salinosporamide A inhibited T cell activation by repressing T cell proliferation and cell cycle entry.

Membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in 3% skim milk in TBS-T overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. The next day, excess primary antibodies were removed with TBS-T, and then membranes were incubated with 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (against rabbit or mouse) for 1 h. After three washes with TBS-T, bands were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with an ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Representative images from three independent experiments are shown in figures, and all detected bands were normalized to &#x003b2;&#x02013;actin for whole lysate or cytosol extracts and PARP for nucleus extracts.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot8-molecules-25-05031"><title>4.8.

PCR conditions were as follows: Forty cycles of denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 60 &#x000b0;C for 20 s, and extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 40 s; followed by denaturation at 72 &#x000b0;C for 7 min. For quantitative real-time PCR analysis, DNA Engine Opticon 1 continuous fluorescence detection system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA) with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan) was used. The total reaction volume was 10 &#x003bc;L. It contained 1 &#x003bc;L of cDNA/control and gene-specific primers. Each PCR reaction was performed using the following conditions: 94 &#x000b0;C 30 s, 60 &#x000b0;C 30 s, 72 &#x000b0;C 30 s, and the plate read (detection of fluorescent product) for 40 cycles followed by 7 min of extension at 72 &#x000b0;C. Melting curve analysis was performed to characterize the dsDNA product by slowly increasing the temperature (0.2 &#x000b0;C/s) from 65 &#x000b0;C to 95 &#x000b0;C with fluorescence data collected at 0.2 &#x000b0;C intervals. mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines normalized to <italic>gapdh</italic> were expressed as fold changes relative to those of untreated controls. The fold change in gene expression was calculated using the following equation: Fold change = 2 &#x02212; &#x00394;&#x00394;CT, where &#x00394;&#x00394;CT = (CT Target &#x02013; CT <italic>gapdh</italic>) at time x &#x02013; (CT Target &#x02013; CT <italic>gapdh</italic>) at time 0 h.
