Also, the susceptibilities of OtrC-overexpressing cells to several structurally unrelated drugs were compared with those of OtrC-non-expressing cells by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays, indicating that OtrC functions as a drug exporter with a broad range of drug specificities.

In the past decade, numerous resistance proteins have identified, including the ubiquitous ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of multidrug transporters
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These integral membrane proteins mediate the active extrusion of antibiotics and toxic compounds from cells. Recent crystal structure analyses revealed that some ABC-type multidrug proteins, such as MsbA from <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholera,</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and BtuCD from <italic>E. coli</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], also mediate the import of substrates by altering the conformation of the transmembrane helices (TMs) from an &#x02018;outward-facing&#x02019; state to an &#x02018;inward-facing&#x02019; state
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The ABC transporters represent 2% of gene products in bacteria and play a critical role in their adaptation to the environment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Some are involved in resistance to chemotherapy and, therefore, applied research has increasingly focused on the elucidation of the transportation mechanism of these proteins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the self-protection afforded by the antibiotic producers is dependent on its endogenous drug resistance proteins. Therefore, these resistance proteins may also represent targets for antibiotic production improvement strategies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p><italic>Streptomyces rimosus</italic>, well known as an oxytetracycline (OTC) producer, has been investigated at the genetic level over many years, although only two antibiotic pump genes have been discovered to date: the OTC resistance gene, <italic>otrB</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and a putative ABC transporter gene, <italic>otrC</italic>, which has been isolated, sequenced and deposited in GenBank (AY509111.1). The two open read frames (orf) of the <italic>otrC</italic> gene encode a putative ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit and a putative transmembrane subunit. OtrC was considered to be a putative ABC transporter with an OTC resistance function based on its amino acid sequences, although no evidence in support of this has been reported to date. Generally, the location of resistance genes in the chromosome is close to the corresponding antibiotic biosynthesis clusters. In the case of OTC, the OTC cluster in <italic>S. rimosus</italic> is flanked by the resistance genes, <italic>otrA</italic> and <italic>otrB</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], while <italic>otrC</italic> is distant from the OTC cluster (data not published). We hypothesize that <italic>otrC</italic> plays a role as the MDR transporter in OTC resistance. Here, we present evidence that <italic>otrC</italic> encodes a protein with ATPase and multidrug efflux activities and therefore may represent a manipulation target for strategies to improve of OTC production in <italic>S. rimosus</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Conserved motifs analysis and model prediction of <italic>otrC</italic></title><p>The <italic>otrC</italic> gene contains two open reading frames (ORFs), which encode a putative ATP-binding subunit (OtrC-ORF1) of 38&#x02009;kDa and a putative transmembrane subunit (OtrC-ORF2) of 30&#x02009;kDa. A NCBI BLAST search of the amino acid sequence of the OtrC protein identified a number of similar proteins, the majority of which were ABC components of doxorubicin or MDR ABC transporters from various phyla.</p><p>The ATP-binding subunit usually contains conserved sequence motifs that play important roles in protein function. Therefore, an alignment of OtrC-ORF1 with DrrA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and Msr-ORF1 from <italic>Streptomyces</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] was performed for the identification of conserved motifs (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The results showed that OtrC-ORF1 exhibits 41% amino acid identity with the doxorubicin resistance protein DrrA from <italic>S. peucetius</italic> and 43% identity with the multidrug ABC transporter ATP -binding subunit Msr-ORF1 from <italic>S. rochei</italic> F20. The N-terminal of OtrC-ORF1 contains the well-described conserved Walker A and B motifs and the ABC signature sequence. These motifs are intimately involved in ATP hydrolysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which indicates that OtrC belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily. The alignment also showed the conserved LDEADQLA and LDEVFL motifs in the C-terminal region of OtrC-ORF1. These motifs exhibit 58.6% and 80% identity with those of DrrA and Msr-ORF1, respectively. However, the CREEM motif was absent from OtrC-ORF1 and Msr-ORF1. The LDEVFL motif is known to be involved in the doxorubicin-stimulated nucleotide-binding function and also exists in the MDR protein
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it was speculated that the ATPase activity of OtrC-ORF1 is stimulated by doxorubicin and other drugs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the OtrC-ORF1 region with DrrA and Msr-ORF1.</bold> The dark gray regions show residues that are highly conserved, whereas the residues in light gray are less well conserved.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6750-12-52-1"/></fig><p>In contrast, the transmembrane subunit has more sequence diversity and varies in the total number of transmembrane helices. OtrC-ORF2 was then aligned with other ABC transporters (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The conserved EAA motif (E<sub>1</sub>AA<sub>3</sub>RALG<sub>7</sub>) that is present in MalG was believed to be present only in the importers of the ABC family, while the G<sub>&#x02212;2</sub>E<sub>&#x02212;1</sub>&#x02026;A<sub>3</sub>R/K<sub>4</sub>&#x02026;G<sub>7</sub> motif present in BtuC, which has similarity with EAA motif, has been identified in both the import and export functions of ABC transporters
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The alignment analysis revealed the present of a G<sub>&#x02212;2</sub>&#x02026;.R<sub>4</sub> motif that was present in all ABC transporter proteins with an exporter function, including EpeA, DrrB, MsbA and BtuC. The G<sub>&#x02212;2</sub> residue has been identified to correspond with drug sensitivity by site-directed mutagenesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We therefore assumed that the G<sub>&#x02212;2</sub>&#x02026;.R<sub>4</sub> motif was involved in the drug export function of the ABC transporter and OtrC functions as a drug exporter.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of the amino acid sequence of predicted conserved motifs of the transmembrane subunit, OtrC-ORF2, MsbA, DrrB, BtuC and MalG.</bold> The dark gray regions show residues that are highly conserved, whereas the residues in light gray are less well conserved.

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.predictprotein.org">http://www.predictprotein.org</ext-link>) indicated the presence of a N-terminal hydrophobic domain with six putative &#x003b1;-helical transmembrane segments and cytoplasmic facing N and C termini. The reported canonical ABC systems display a modular architecture composed of two nucleotide-binding domains/subunits and two transmembrane domains/subunits. Therefore, it can be concluded that the OtrC system is a tetrameric complex composed of two homodimeric constituents, similar to that of many other bacterial ABC transporters

However, the drug resistance function and mechanism of OtrC have not been studied previously. In this study, the alignment of the amino acid sequence of OtrC suggested that it could belong to an ABC superfamily and could act as an ATP-binding drug exporter, which was further identified by ATPase activity determination and EB efflux assays in this study. The results of the drug susceptibility tests showed that OtrC confers a functional resistance toward a broad range of structurally unrelated drugs. Hence, OtrC is a multidrug resistance protein based on an ATP hydrolysis-dependent active efflux mechanism. It is the first reported multidrug resistance ABC transporter in <italic>S. rimosus</italic>.</p><p>The further investigation of mutations of conserved amino acid residues that inhibit the OtrC pump could be valuable for controlling drug resistance in clinically important pathogens.
