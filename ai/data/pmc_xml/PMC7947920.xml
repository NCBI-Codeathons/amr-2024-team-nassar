Approximately 3&#x02013;30% of the selected isolates were identified as <italic>Pedobacter</italic>, whereas isolation without antibiotics did not yield any isolates of this genus. Next generation sequencing data showed <italic>Pedobacter</italic> to be on 69th place among the bacterial genera (0.32% of bacterial sequences). The <italic>Pedobacter</italic> isolates produced a wide array of novel compounds when screened by UHPLC-MS/MSMS, and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in several distinct clusters of compounds produced by specific isolates of <italic>Pedobacter</italic>, and most of these compounds were found to be peptides. The <italic>Pedobacter</italic> strain UP508 produced isopedopeptins, whereas another set of strains produced pedopeptins, which both are known cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by <italic>Pedobacter</italic> sp. Other <italic>Pedobacter</italic> strains produced analogous peptides with a sequence variation. Further strains of <italic>Pedobacter</italic> produced additional novel antibacterial cyclic lipopeptides (ca 800 or 1400 Da in size) and/or linear lipopeptides (ca 700&#x02013;960 Da in size). A 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree for the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> isolates revealed several distinct clades and subclades of isolates. One of the subclades comprised isolates producing isopedopeptin analogs, but the isopedopeptin producing isolate UP508 was clearly placed on a separate branch. We suggest that the non-ribosomal peptide synthases producing pedopeptins, isopedopeptins, and the analogous peptides, may derive from a common ancestral non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene cluster, which may have been subjected to a mutation leading to changed specificity in one of the modules and then to a modular rearrangement leading to the changed sequence found in the isopedopeptins produced by isolate UP508.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Pedobacter</italic></kwd><kwd>self-resistance</kwd><kwd>selective isolation</kwd><kwd>multidrug-resistant bacteria</kwd><kwd>environmental bacteria</kwd><kwd>antibacterial cyclic peptides</kwd><kwd>Gram-negative antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The discovery and use of antibiotics in human medicine have saved millions of lives, helped to increase our life expectancy and made possible many of the medical practices that are now standard in modern medicine. Most of all clinically relevant antibiotics originate from natural products made by microorganisms, and mainly soil bacteria (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Demain, 2014</xref>). These natural products stem from the ancient struggle for existence during which an intricate web of antibiotic production and factors for defense or self-protection have evolved. Accordingly, it is quite common for soil bacteria to both carry genes coding for antibiotics as well as the corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Omura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bentley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Costa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and Duffy, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The use and overuse of antibiotics exert a strong selection pressure on affected microorganisms and as a result, many clinically essential antibacterial drugs against important pathogens are becoming less useful. The current situation with increasing antimicrobial resistance against antibiotics and an accelerated spread of antibiotic resistance genes is indeed of critical concern. To make bad even worse, the antibacterial pipeline has been insufficient for many years to keep resistant pathogenic bacteria and especially the Gram-negatives at bay (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Theuretzbacher et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, in order to tackle the most critical clinical needs more novel antibiotic leads must urgently be fed into the pipeline (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2019a</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).</p><p>However, there are numerous obstacles to overcome when searching for novel antibiotics among natural products. The major part of the microorganisms known to be present in soils and other natural environments, as detected by metagenome studies, will not grow easily in the laboratory, which makes these potentially useful microbes difficult to access. On the other hand, many cultivable microorganisms often produce already known compounds that in turn prompts the need for efficient de-replication. Consequently, it can be difficult to isolate producers of novel and promising antibiotics. In order to challenge these obstacles, some researchers have pursued <italic>in situ</italic> isolation methods to expand the cultivable part of the soil microbiota and successfully found novel and promising antibiotic lead molecules (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2015</xref>). Others have focused on the inherent need for antibiotics producing bacteria to be self-resistant and thus used selected single antibiotics during the isolation of bacteria, with the aim to increase the proportion of bacterial isolates that can produce compounds similar to the supplemented antibiotic (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Thaker et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>For clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria, the definition of antibiotic resistance is based on their clinical breakpoint values, but for environmental bacteria the definition is less straightforward. A couple of studies on soil microorganisms have simply used the definition of antibiotic resistant bacteria as those that can grow in the presence of 20 mg/L of the tested antibiotic (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Costa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and Duffy, 2013</xref>). Examples of environmental antibiotic resistant bacteria are members of the Gram-negative genus <italic>Pedobacter</italic>, that have been found to be resistant against numerous antibiotics from several classes (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Viana et al., 2018</xref>). These included the facultative psychrophilic bacterium <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>, which was first described after being isolated from the dark windblown debris called cryoconite on a glacier in Austria (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Margesin et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Pedobacter lusitanus</italic>, which is a close relative to <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>, first isolated from the sludge of a deactivated uranium mine in Portugal (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Covas et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>Pedobacter steynii</italic> that was first obtained from the creek Westerh&#x000f6;fer Bach in Germany (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Muurholm et al., 2007</xref>). Further, in a recent study the antibiotic resistance of <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>, <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> and a few more closely related <italic>Pedobacter</italic> species, were investigated in more detail (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Viana et al., 2018</xref>). Several of the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> species in this study were found resistant to antibiotics belonging to three or more different classes of antibiotics, which categorized them as multidrug-resistant (MDR) environmental superbugs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Magiorakos et al., 2012</xref>). The antibiotic resistance of the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> members has been shown to depend on chromosomal genes and not genes on mobile genetic elements and approximately 6&#x02013;8% of their protein coding genes have been estimated to be involved in providing antibiotic resistance (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Viana et al., 2018</xref>). The genus <italic>Pedobacter</italic> has been rapidly expanding since the description of the first four species some 20 years ago (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Steyn et al., 1998</xref>) and currently includes 87 species.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup></p><p>We have recently adapted and extended the antibiotic resistance approach by <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Thaker et al. (2013</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014)</xref> with the goal to find bacterial isolates talented in production of antibiotic compounds. We have reasoned that MDR environmental bacteria may have the corresponding capacity to produce more than one type of antibacterial compound. Thus, when isolating soil bacteria for subsequent screening for new antibiotic compounds, we have combined several antibiotics in order to specifically select for MDR bacteria. The use of this approach resulted in the isolation of <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> UP508, which was found to produce isopedopeptins, which are cyclic lipodepsipeptides with potent activity against WHO top-priority bacterial pathogens (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Nord et al., 2020</xref>). In the present paper, we describe the application of this methodology to isolate several MDR strains of <italic>Pedobacter</italic>, along with UHPLC-MS based hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the metabolites produced by the isolates. Based on UHPLC-MSMS, we also characterize a number of peptides, of which only a few are previously known whereas the large majority are new chemical entities. Additionally, most of these novel peptides were indicated to have activity against important human Gram-negative and/or Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Soil Sample Preparation</title><p>Twelve soil samples (&#x02265;10 g) were collected from several different locations in Sweden (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

UP1437 and <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> NL19 were also found to produce pedopeptin A, which is the OHVal analog of pedopeptin B, and in addition also pedopeptin C, which has a 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid residue instead of a methyl branched hydroxyfatty acid.

Just as the cyclic lipodepsipeptides in clusters 1, 2, and 4, these did not produce easily interpretable sequence ions in MSMS, but they did not ring-open with NaOMe treatment, which suggested them to be ring-closed by a peptide bond and not via an ester bond.

In MSMS, these peptides did not produce ions enabling facile determination of the full amino acid sequence, and they did not add methanol when treated with NaOMe, suggesting them to be ring-closed by peptide bonds. MSMS resulted in a few Y-type ions suggesting N-terminal fatty acyl groups for the peptides &#x02013; C<sub>10</sub><sub>&#x02013;</sub><sub>11</sub> hydroxy fatty acids for clusters 9 and 11, and C<sub>8</sub><sub>&#x02013;</sub><sub>9</sub> fatty acids with and without hydroxyl groups for the cluster 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Judging from Y-type ions, the fatty acyl groups of the clusters 9 and 12 peptides were linked to two consecutive DAPA residues, whereas in the cluster 11 peptides the linkage was to DAPA &#x02013; Leu/Ile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). For neither of the peptides, no further Y-type ions were observed, suggesting these fatty acyl dipeptide moieties to be sidechains on cyclic peptide cores. The observed immonium ions formed by the peptides in MSMS showed the clusters 9 and 12 peptides to contain Phe, whereas the cluster 11 peptides instead contained Leu/Ile. Additionally, the clusters 9 and 12 peptides produced both 2+ and 3+ ions, whereas the cluster 11 peptides only produced 2+ ions, suggesting the presence of one additional basic amino acid, such as DAPA, in the clusters 9 and 12 peptides compared to the cluster 11 peptides. The presumed peptide core of the cluster 11 peptides gave a fragment at <italic>m/z</italic> 470.271 (1+), whereas the corresponding fragment for the clusters 9 and 12 peptides gave an ion at <italic>m/z</italic> 504.256 (1+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). As mentioned above, the cluster 11 peptides did not contain Phe, but instead Leu/Ile. By replacing the mass of a Leu/Ile residue in core of the cluster 11 peptides, with the mass of a Phe residue, identical masses are obtained for the core part of the structures. This strongly suggests that the cluster 11 peptides are analogs to the clusters 9 and 12 peptides with a central Phe replaced with a Leu/Ile and one DAPA in the sidechain replaced with another Leu/Ile. The only reasonable molecular formula within &#x000b1;2 mDa for the fragment ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 470.271 (1+) and 504.256 (1+) is C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>36</sub>N<sub>7</sub>O<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> and C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>34</sub>N<sub>7</sub>O<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup>, respectively, which may correspond to peptide cores composed of 2 &#x000d7; DAPA, Thr, Leu/Ile, ABA, and 2 &#x000d7; DAPA, Thr, Phe, ABA, respectively, or various homologous combinations of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). To account for the observation of 2+ and 3+ ions for the clusters 9 and 12 peptides, and 2+ ions for the cluster 11 peptides, the sidechain should be linked to one of the two DAPA residues (or homologs) in the central peptide core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p>Top: MSMS spectra for representative peptides of clusters 9, 12, and 11.

Interestingly, similar <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> isolates were obtained from soils sampled at different locations along a 1200 km line from south to north, i.e., Gotland County (sample 12 &#x021d2; UP1436) to Norrbotten County (soil sample 11 &#x021d2; UP1189), with Uppsala County (soil sample 3 &#x021d2; UP621 and UP640), and G&#x000e4;vleborg County (soil sample 8 &#x021d2; UP1478 and UP1479) situated in-between. These isolates all clustered in the same subclade (B1) of the 16S rRNA derived phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and in the metabolite derived phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This indicates that bacteria of the genus <italic>Pedobacter</italic> are rather widespread at levels where enrichment culturing is not needed for their detection although the actual numbers are quite low. The NGS data for soil sample 10 (0.32% <italic>Pedobacter</italic>) suggests it can be reasonable to expect to isolate roughly three <italic>Pedobacter</italic> for every thousand colonies investigated if there is no enrichment bias for antibiotic resistant <italic>Pedobacter</italic>. This is in sharp contrast to the eleven <italic>Pedobacter</italic> strains out of the 30 investigated isolates in isolation round three in this study (&#x0003e;30%), obtained by using certain combinations of antibiotics to increase selection pressure.</p><p><italic>Pedobacter cryoconitis</italic> UP508, isolated from soil sample 1, was found to be resistant and able to grow in the presence of antibiotics from a broad range of chemical classes, and should thus be regarded as MDR. The resistance of <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> A37 was earlier reported to cover most of the tested antibiotics/classes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Margesin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Covas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Viana et al., 2018</xref>). However, the resistance for <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> A37 against CIP and ERY was only reported to be 4 mg/L, not 20 mg/L. Further, resistance against polymyxins was reported previously for some other species of <italic>Pedobacter</italic> but not for <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Muurholm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Viana et al., 2018</xref>), and likewise, the resistance against LIN and NAL was not shown earlier for <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>. The remainder of the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> sp. isolates were not tested separately for antibiotic resistance. However, just as UP508, these strains were isolated using combinations of antibiotics for selection (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and 24 of the isolates were obtained using three or more antibiotic drugs of different classes in combination and should be regarded as MDR, whereas four isolates were isolated using only two antibiotics in combination.</p><p>The rationale behind the antibiotic resistance-based isolation of <italic>Pedobacter</italic> strains in this study, was to find bacterial isolates producing novel antibiotic compounds, and specifically antibiotic metabolites similar to the antibiotics that these isolates are resistant to. Another resistance-based antibacterial discovery platform that harness the self-protection mechanism of antibiotic producers, but using only a single antibiotic at a time for screening, was previously described as a tool to increase the discovery rate of Actinomycetes producing novel antibiotics (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Thaker et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the resistance against lipopeptides observed for <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> UP508, it is not surprising that many of the isolated <italic>Pedobacter</italic> strains were found to produce lipopeptides. The isolate UP508 was recently described to produce isopedopeptins (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Nord et al., 2020</xref>) and several other strains produced the pedopeptins (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hirota-Takahata et al., 2014</xref>), here identified by MSMS. However, a number of isolates also produced unknown compounds, including the isopedopeptin analogs present in clusters 2 and 3, here only characterized by MSMS, and linear lipopeptides (clusters 5, 6, 13, and 14), characterized by MSMS and partly by NMR (two peptides of cluster 5). The isopedopeptins, the pedopeptins and the cluster 2 peptides share some structural features with the last-resort antibiotics polymyxin B and E (colistin), i.e., they are cyclic peptides of similar size (ca 1100&#x02013;1150 Da), they are cationic due to the presence of several basic amino acids, and they have a fatty acid tail. One major difference is the nature of the cyclic structure. The polymyxins have a 23-membered ring, involving seven of the ten amino acids, ring-closed via an amide bond to the &#x003b3;-amino group of a 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid residue (DABA), compared to a 31-membered lactone, involving all nine amino acids and the 3-hydroxyfatty acid, for the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> peptides. Another difference is the presence of six DABA residues in the polymyxins, compared to one DABA and two 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid residues in the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> peptides, which makes the polymyxins more cationic than the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> peptides. With respect to antibacterial activity and mechanism of action, there are both similarities and differences between polymyxins and the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> peptides. Both pedopeptins and isopedopeptins have potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kozuma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Nord et al., 2020</xref>) just as the polymyxins, which are used to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections, but the isopedopeptins have activity also against colistin resistant strains (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Nord et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding the mechanism of action, the isopedopeptins were recently described to cause leakage of bacterial membranes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Nord et al., 2020</xref>), as the polymyxins and many other cationic peptides (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Straus and Hancock, 2006</xref>). Additionally, the pedopeptins, as well as polymyxin B, have been described to selectively inhibit the binding of bacterial lipopolysaccharides to cellular receptors at nanomolar concentrations (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kozuma et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The cluster 5 peptides were shown by NMR to contain the amino acid residue DHV, which previously has been found in many non-ribosomal peptides (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Sido&#x00142;ak, 2015</xref>). The presence of DHV in two peptides made it likely that also the other similar peptides contained DHV and not the isobaric Pro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Further novel lipopeptides were the cyclic peptides of clusters 7, 9&#x02013;13, of which there were two different types: one larger with molecular mass 1253&#x02013;1440 and one smaller with mass 785&#x02013;860. These peptides were only partly characterized by MSMS and attempts to study their structures by NMR (data not shown) were not successful due to the broad NMR signals obtained from these compounds. Examples of these types of new lipopeptides were present in semi-pure antibacterial fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting them to possess antibiotic properties. The discovery of several new and putative antibiotic lipopeptides from <italic>Pedobacter</italic> strains, isolated using combinations of several antibiotic drugs for selection, strengthens the hypothesis that this approach is a very powerful tool to obtain bacterial isolates that produce antibiotic compounds.</p><p>When comparing how the different <italic>Pedobacter</italic> isolates cluster in the 16S rRNA-derived phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) with the metabolite-derived HCA of the heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), it is clear that the results from two different methods for systematization/comparison differ from each other. This is not surprising since one method is based on the calculations of genetic distance according to similarities in the evolutionary conserved 16S rRNA gene sequence and the other method is based on UHPLC-MS based snapshots of the phenotypic expression of the different isolates. There are several apparent similarities indicating that genetically related isolates often seem to share much of their phenotypic traits as well, but also striking differences.</p><p>Studying the phylogenetic positioning of the 22 isolated strains identified as closest to <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>, gives that only six of these group in the same subclade (B1) as <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> A37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These isolates, UP621, UP640, UP1189, UP1436, UP1478, UP1479, and <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> A37 (LMG 21415), also cluster phenotypically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). MSMS suggests these isolates to produce cyclic lipodepsipeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, cluster 2) similar to the isopedopeptins, but differing by having Phe<sub>2</sub> and Leu<sub>7</sub> in their structures instead of Leu<sub>2</sub> and Phe<sub>7</sub> as in the isopedopeptins. The only isolate producing isopedopeptins, UP508 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, cluster 1), is on a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In the 16S rRNA based phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>P. hartonius</italic> WB3.3-3 is placed in the same subclade (B1) as the clusters 2 and 3 peptide producing isolates, but it is more distant in the metabolite derived clustering of the heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Perhaps, the lipodepsipeptide biosynthetic gene complex (BGC) is present in <italic>P. hartonius</italic> WB3.3-3 as well, but is not active under the cultivation conditions of the study. Further, when closely inspecting this subclade (B1), the isolates UP621 and UP640 originate from the same soil sample and are indistinguishable from each other on the level of 16S rRNA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), but there are still some differences when comparing their metabolite profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). If these differences are based on an actual strain variation of two very closely related but distinct bacterial strains or just fluctuations in the metabolite expression levels from two genetically identical clones isolated from the same soil sample is difficult to establish without closer examination of these isolates.</p><p>The isolates UP1427, UP1428, UP1429, and UP1431 (all closest to <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>), which form another subclade (B2) in the 16S rRNA derived phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), cluster also in the metabolite derived tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

Further, UP696 group with the reference isolates <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> NL19 and <italic>P. himalayensis</italic> HHS22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, subclade B4) but exhibit very different metabolite profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). These differences can depend on the presence or absence of certain gene complexes and/or by the expression of such genes under the specific culturing conditions.</p><p>Phylogenetic positioning of the remaining isolates identified as <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> and <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> follows, in general but not completely, their metabolic clustering. For example, the producers of clusters 11 and 14 peptides, i.e., UP742, UP1184, UP1400, and UP742 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), cluster with UP509 in the 16S rRNA derived tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), albeit with rather low bootstrap support. However, UP509 appears to have a very different production of metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Other examples are the clusters 12 and 13 peptide producers UP751, UP1634, UP1637, and UP1642 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), of which the three latter cluster separated from UP751 in the 16S rRNA tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and the cluster 9 peptide producers UP696, UP1435, and UP1439, of which UP696 cluster separated from the other isolates in the subclade B4 of the16S rRNA tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Another discrepancy between phylogenetic and metabolic clustering is the positioning of the isolates UP696, UP1437, and UP1637 identified as closest to <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in comparison to the reference isolate <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> NL19. UP1437 and <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> NL19 produce very similar patterns of metabolites and cluster together in the metabolite based phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, UP696 and UP1637 produce two different sets of compounds and cluster separated from each other and far from UP1437 and <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> NL19. UP696 clusters with UP1435 and UP1439 (both closest to <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>) and UP1637 with UP1634 and UP1642 (both closest to <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>). In the 16S rRNA derived tree, UP696 clusters with the reference strain <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> NL19 (subclade B4), whereas UP1437 is in subclade B3 together with UP1729 (closest to <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>) and UP1637 is clustering (lower bootstrap support) with the metabolically similar UP1634 and UP1642 (both closest to <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic>). Sequencing of the whole genome of all <italic>Pedobacter</italic> isolates, combined with additional biochemical analysis as well as including more <italic>Pedobacter</italic> reference isolates, may be necessary to resolve some of the taxonomic ambiguities noted above.</p><p>The phylogenetic tree based on sequence comparisons of one gene only, here the 16S rRNA gene, is obviously a much blunter instrument than an examination of the expressed part of the whole genome. For example, isolates UP579, UP1426, and UP1440, identified as closest to <italic>P. steynii</italic>, taxonomically are all placed in the well-defined clade A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), but phenotypically cluster close to the reference isolates of <italic>P. hartonius</italic> WB 3.3-3, <italic>P. westerhofensis</italic> WB 3.3-22, and <italic>P. himalayensis</italic> HHS22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) that all belong to the major phylogenetic clade B. A feature shared by all these isolates is the rather low production of metabolites under the conditions applied in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which is probably why these taxonomically distant species cluster together in the metabolite derived phylogenetic tree.</p><p>Bacterial peptides partly composed of non-proteinogenic amino acids, such as the isopedopeptins and pedopeptins, and the similar peptides of clusters 2 and 3, are likely to be products from multi-modular non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), coded for by a BGC. Based on the phylogenetic tree, it is possible that a strain carrying an ancestral <italic>Pedobacter</italic> BGC was subjected to a mutation causing a change in specificity for one adenylation domain of the NRPS from Leu<sub>5</sub> to Thr<sub>5</sub> (or reversed), leading to the division of strains into the pedopeptin-type producers and the cluster 2 type peptide producers. Subsequently, it appears as if one strain of the cluster 2 type producers was subjected to a BGC module rearrangement leading to the production of peptides with Leu/Phe positional exchange, leading to isopedopeptins as observed in strain UP508 (cluster 1). The strain UP1189 produces cyclic lipodepsipeptides as the rest of the cluster 2 isolates, but also linear versions of the same peptides. UP1189 is on a separate branch of the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree compared to most of the cluster 2 peptide producers. The BGC of UP1189 may have been subjected to a mutation in the thioesterase (TE) domain of the NRPS, leading to a less efficient cyclization accompanied by release of the peptides from the NRPS. Hypothetically, the TE of the UP1189 NRPS may allow water to a greater extent compete with the hydroxyl function of the 3-hydroxyfatty acid, for performing the nucleophilic addition to the NRPS linked carbonyl of the growing peptide, resulting in the release of linear peptides from the NRPS.</p><p>The pedopeptin B and D producing strains (UP1427, UP1428, UP1429, and UP1431) cluster (subclade B2) separated from the pedopeptin A&#x02013;D producing UP1437 (subclade B3) and <italic>P. lusitanus</italic> NL19 (subclade B4). Pedopeptin B and D contain a Val<sub>8</sub> residue which is replaced by OHVal<sub>8</sub> in pedopeptin A and C, and the OHVal is likely to be formed by oxidation of Val after incorporation into the growing peptide chain in the NRPS. The observed clustering suggests there was an ancestral strain with the original pedopeptin producing BGC, which suffered mutations in a monooxygenase in this BGC. This resulted in strains incapable of oxidation of Val to OHVal and thus only producing pedopeptin B and D, in parallel to strains with the ability to produce pedopeptin A&#x02013;D.</p><p>There is an apparent risk of isolating the same bacterial clone more than once from the same soil sample. Possible examples here are the isolates UP1427, UP1428, UP1429, and UP1431, which were isolated from the same soil sample (sample 10), and are very similar to each other both genetically and metabolically. To the contrary, there are also many isolates originating from the same soil sample that instead cluster with other isolates. For example, both UP508 and UP509 were derived from soil sample 1, but cluster far away from each other, and the same is true for UP742 and UP751 that originated from sample 9. Considering all the isolates coming from the same soil samples and that are noticeably similar to each other, both phylogenetically and metabolically, then a rough estimate is that around 25% of the isolates in this study may (or may not) be due to duplicate isolation events. This uncertainty may be settled by sequencing the whole genome of each isolate or by developing multi-locus sequence typing tools for this genus, but since this was not within the scope of our study we have thus chosen to include all of our isolates in the study of metabolite profiles of the <italic>Pedobacter</italic> isolates. However, what appears to be a general observation is that isolates show more variation in their metabolite profiles if they originate from distinct soil samples.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The research described here shows the great potential of using an antibiotic selection approach for finding novel and interesting bacterial isolates, in extremely complex sample matrices full of non-interesting or previously known microorganisms, with the goal to find new antibiotic compounds. Many aspects of the here tentatively described <italic>Pedobacter</italic> peptides are awaiting deeper studies, but our study clearly shows that the members of this genus might be accessed from different environmental samples and that they are of high value in screening attempts for new antimicrobials originating from nature. As of yet, we have focused on the peptides of cluster 1, produced by <italic>P. cryoconitis</italic> UP508 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Nord et al., 2020</xref>), and these peptides are the basis for a recently granted Swedish Patent (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;berg et al., 2020</xref>) dealing with peptide antibiotics of medical interest. Furthermore, the similar but still different peptides found to be produced by different <italic>Pedobacter</italic> strains, make this genus a promising system for studying the evolution of antibacterial peptides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
