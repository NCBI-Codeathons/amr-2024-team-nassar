The immunoreactive protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF -MS). Forty spots from 2DE gels were detected and 17 different proteins were identified as immunogenic in humans. Function annotation revealed that most of these proteins were metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. One of the proteins, thioredoxin reductase GliT (TR), which showed the best immunoactivity, was analyzed further for secretory signals, protein localization, and homology. The results indicated that TR is a secretory protein with a signal sequence exhibiting a high probability for secretion. Furthermore, TR did not match any human proteins, and had low homology with most other fungi. The recombinant TR was recognized by the sera of all proven IA patients with different underlying diseases in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The immunoreactive proteins identified in this study may be helpful for the diagnosis of IA in critically ill patients.

However, several reports have recently described a rising incidence of IA in critically ill patients, even in the absence of an apparent predisposing immunodeficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The incidence of IA in critically ill patients ranges from 0.3% to 5.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and carries an overall mortality rate &#x0003e; 80%, with an attributable mortality of approximately 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Critically ill patients are prone to develop immunologic derangement, which renders them more vulnerable for <italic>Aspergillus </italic>infections. The risk factors for IA include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], prolonged use of steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], advanced liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], chronic renal replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], near-drowning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The diagnosis of such IA is difficult because signs and symptoms are non-specific. The conventional diagnostic methods, such as tissue examination and microbial cultivation, may lack sensitivity in the first stages of infection in critically ill patients. As a result, the diagnosis of IA is often established after a long delay or following autopsy. Currently, the best-characterized circulating marker used in the diagnosis of IA is galactomannan (GM), which is present in the cell walls of most <italic>Aspergillus </italic>species. The commercial Platelia <italic>Aspergillus </italic>assay (BioRad&#x02122;, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) has been included in the EORTC/MSG criteria for probable IA. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that GM testing is more useful in patients with prolonged neutropenia (sensitivity, 72%-82%) than in non-neutropenic, critically ill patients (sensitivity, 40%-55%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further studies suggested that the host immune status may influence GM release. It appears that GM production is proportional to the fungal load in tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although neutropenic patients and non-neutropenic, critically ill patients are susceptible to IA, the pathology of the disease is quite different in these two groups of patients. In neutropenic patients and animal models, IA is characterized by thrombosis and hemorrhage from rapid and extensive hyphal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, in non-neutropenic, critically ill patients and animal models, IA is characterized by limited angioinvasion, tissue necrosis, and excessive inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The limited angioinvasion and low fungal load result in a low level of GM released by the fungus. The use of the GM assay for the diagnosis of IA in non-neutropenic patients is very limited. Therefore, more prompt and accurate disease markers for early diagnosis are needed, which requires a thorough knowledge of fungal antigens detected in the serum or other body fluids of infected patients.</p><p><italic>A. fumigatus </italic>is the most common opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening IA in human beings. The ability of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>to acquire and process growth substrates from its host is dependent on factors released from the fungi. The extracellular proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, which are released during the germination of conidia and growth of hyphae, consist of secreted enzymes, toxins, and other secondary metabolites which are pathogenic and responsible for invasion of the structural barrier of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Studies on the extracellular proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and their immunogenic potential are therefore important for further understanding the pathogenesis of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and targets for the immunodiagnosis of the diseases. It is not surprising that some of the proteins may be major elicitors of specific immune responses, which could be brought into play to establish prognosis and develop new diagnostic procedures for IA.</p><p>We have recently observed that high levels of antibody against extracellular proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>are often present in the sera of critically ill patients with proven IA. This finding prompted us to discover the potential novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of IA in such patients. The investigation of specific antigens is strongly supported by the combination of immunoproteomics and bioinformatics. The completion of the genomes of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and other <italic>Aspergillus </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] makes it possible to identify the antigens of <italic>Aspergillus </italic>species on a global scale. In this study we searched for the immunodominant antigens from the crude culture filtrate using an immunoproteomic approach. As a result, a total of 17 immunodominant antigens were identified. One of the antigens, thioredoxin reductase GliT (TR), which showed the best immunoactivity, was cloned and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Our results indicate that this protein could be useful for the early diagnosis of IA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of the patients</title><p>Six patients with proven IA, and different underlying diseases and expressing high levels of anti-<italic>Aspergillus </italic>antibodies were selected for the immunoproteomic analysis.

The extracellular proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, which functions in enabling the fungi to adhere to host tissues and take up nutrients from the hosts, play an important role in the interaction between fungi and hosts. The extracellular location of these proteins enables the proteins to interact easily with the host immune system. Accordingly, studies on the immunogenic nature of these extracellular proteins are of particular importance to understand the pathogenesis of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. The immunogenic proteins may represent candidate markers for the diagnosis of IA. In fact, preparations of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>extracellular proteins have been used to detect antibodies in the sera of human patients or experimentally infected animals, and culture filtrates have also been used to raise polyclonal antibodies to detect <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>antigens in the sera or urine of patients or experimentally infected rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our group has previously observed that high titers of antibodies against extracellular proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>are often present in the sera of critically ill IA patients (unpublished data). However, knowledge of the extracellular proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and the corresponding antibodies is limited. To investigate the immunodominant antigens, the extracellular proteins at different intervals were extracted from 4 media (<italic>Aspergillus </italic>minimal medium, YEPG, Czapek-Dox medium, and RPMI-1640), then probed with sera of IA patients. The results indicated that the protein yield reached a maximum at 14 days, and the YEPG culture supernatant contained the maximum number of proteins reacting with the sera in comparison to other media (unpublished data). Thus, the 14-day YEPG filtrate proteins were used in a subsequent study.</p><p>In the present study, the immunodominant proteins from the culture filtrate of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>were detected using an immunoproteomic approach. The immunoreactive protein spots showing a significantly different pattern of recognition in sera from IA patients when compared with specimens from controls were characterized by MS. Of 17 identified proteins, 7 have been reported as antigens of <italic>Aspergillus </italic>and/or other fungi. For example, DppV, TR, FAD-dependant oxygenase, pectate lyase A, aspartyl aminopeptidase, and NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase are already known as antigens or allergens of <italic>Aspergillus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase was identified as an immunogen in patients with systemic candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, diverse groups have reported that some metabolic enzymes interact specifically with human extracellar matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, laminin, and integrin-like vitronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and are involved in adhesion and pathogenesis.</p><p>The immunodominant nature of these proteins is valuable for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. DppV, a member of the dipeptidyl-peptidase family in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, is identical to one of the principal antigens used in the diagnosis of IA. Moreover, DppV can generate protection responses, and improve the survival rate of <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. DppV can also bind with collagen or other human proteins and degrade them, which can damage the host. Recombinant DppV has shown a great potential in the serodiagnosis of IA in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in glycometabolism that catalyze the reversible conversion between malate and oxaloacetate, was reported recently as an allergen of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and <italic>A. versicolor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Malate dehydrogenase was also shown to be a <italic>Paracoccidioides brasileinsis </italic>immunogenic protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] as well as a <italic>Candida albicans </italic>immunogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Aspartyl aminopeptidase, an enzyme that specifically degrades only amino-terminal acidic amino acids from peptides, was recently reported as an antigen of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]
.</p><p>TR of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>has been described as an extracellular antigenic protein by two recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In one former study, the secreted fraction of two geographically different strains (190/96 and DAYA) of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>were used to identify new immunogenic molecules reacting with pooled ABPA patient sera (IgG and IgE). TR was only detected on 2DE immunoblots of the secreted proteome of the DAYA strain probed with the IgE antibody fraction from pooled ABPA patients sera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This result suggested that TR might not be a good biomarker for ABPA. In another study, the immunosecretome of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>was detected using pooled patient sera (total n = 22 patients [ABPA, n = 11; aspergilloma, n = 5; IA, n = 6]). The immunoreactive intensity of TR was lower than most other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A possible explanation is that the anti-TR antibody titers were not high in pooled sera because most cases included in the study were not IA.</p><p>Although investigators in other laboratories recently noted the antigenic nature of TR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], no study has found shown diagnostic value for TR in non-neutropenic patients with IA. We showed that TR (spot no. 2A-2 M) had the strongest immunoreactivity with patient sera. TR, a component of the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster, provides self protection to <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>against gliotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This protein has been described as an extracellular protein of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>by Singh and Kumar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, Schrettl et al. showed that GliT is preferentially localized in the cytoplasm and nuclei by a GFP-GliT construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To predict whether or not GliT is actively secreted into the culture supernatant, we used two bioinformatic tools (SignalP and WoLF PSORT) to analyze its localization. Our results support the findings of Singh and Kumar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Homology analysis indicated that TR had no match with human proteins, as Kumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] reported. Muro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] also reported that the fungal TR has only 19% sequence similarity to human TR. Furthermore, sequence homology analysis showed that TR of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>has low homology with most other <italic>Aspergillus </italic>species as well as most other fungi. Therefore, TR could be considered as a specific antigen of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and as a potential biomarker for the serological diagnosis of IA. In order to study its diagnostic potential, we cloned the TR gene and purified the recombinant protein. Immunoblots showed that recombinant protein could be recognized by the sera from all six IA patients. These results suggested that the TR of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>could be developed as a biomarker for the diagnosis of IA, especially in critically ill patients.</p><p>One of the strengths of our study was that all patients included had histopathologic evidence and positive cultures. This enabled us to discriminate between invasive disease and colonization. However, we do realize that the study design has limitations. We did not further investigate the reactivity of individual patient serum with the extracellular fraction of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, thus we cannot provide data whether or not these proteins consistently react with individual IA patient serum. Moreover, the cases used in this study were limited in number, therefore the diagnostic value of the antigen identified should be validated in further prospective studies using large-scale serum specimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>Aspergillus fumigatus </italic>is known to be the most common opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening IA in humans. The ability of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>to acquire and process growth substrates from its host is dependent on the factors the fungus releases. Studies on the extracellular proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and their immunogenic potential are therefore important for further understanding the pathogenesis of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and targets for the immunodiagnosis of the diseases. Our study has highlighted the immunodominant antigens of extracellular proteins. A total of 17 proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>were identified as antigens in humans. Some of the proteins have been reported as antigens of <italic>Aspergillus </italic>and/or other fungi.

All serum samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis. Two-to-four samples were obtained sequentially per patient. Sera from 20 ICU patients without clinical or microbiological evidence of IA, including 8 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 6 patients with chronic renal disease, 3 patients with renal transplantation, and 3 patients with acute pancreatitis (age range, 33-75 years), were used as negative controls. Two samples were obtained per control patient (one during early admission and one before leaving the hospital). <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-specific IgG antibodies in the sera of all patients were determined by an indirect ELISA using filtrate proteins of <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>(1 &#x003bc;g/ml) as the coating antigen (sera diluted 1:1000). All sera were stored at -70&#x000b0;C. Sera of IA patients and controls were pooled separately for immunoproteomics analysis. According to EORTC-MSG criteria, proven IA refers to histopathologic evidence of tissue invasion by septated, acutely-branching filamentous fungi, together with a positive culture (sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

The conidia were collected and incubated in yeast-extract-peptone-glucose (YEPG) broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) in a 500-ml flask on a shaker at 37&#x000b0;C for 14 days. Then, the culture supernatant was collected by filtration. The proteins were recovered by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Finally, the precipitates were resuspended in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE; 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% [w/v] CHAPS, 1% [w/v] DTT, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail [v/v], and 2% [v/v] IPG buffer [pH 3-10]) lysis buffer, and stored at -70&#x000b0;C.
