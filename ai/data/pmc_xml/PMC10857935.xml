<italic toggle="yes">Solanum</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">habrochaites</italic> (SH), a wild species closely related to &#x02018;Ailsa Craig&#x02019; (AC), is an important germplasm resource for modern tomato breeding. Trichomes, developed from epidermal cells, have a role in defense against insect attack, and their secretions are of non-negligible value. Here, we found that the glandular heads of type VI trichomes were clearly distinguishable between AC and SH under cryo-scanning electron microscopy, the difference indicating that SH could secrete more anti-insect metabolites than AC. Pest preference experiments showed that aphids and mites preferred to feed near AC compared with SH. Integration analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data revealed that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was an important secondary metabolic pathway in plants, and SH secreted larger amounts of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids than AC by upregulating the expression of relevant genes in this pathway, and this may contribute to the greater resistance of SH to phytophagous insects. Notably, virus-induced silencing of <italic toggle="yes">Sl4CLL6</italic> not only decreased the expression of genes downstream of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway (<italic toggle="yes">SlHCT</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SlCAD</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">SlCHI</italic>), but also reduced resistance to mites in tomato. These findings provided new genetic resources for the synthesis of phenylpropanoid compounds and anti-insect breeding in <italic toggle="yes">S. habrochaites</italic> and a new theoretical basis for the improvement of important traits in cultivated tomato.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source>

However, pest occurrence in tomato cultivation significantly reduces yield and quality [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tomatoes are damaged by spider mites (<italic toggle="yes">Tetranychus urticae</italic>) from the seedling stage to the fruiting stage, and in severe cases the whole leaf dries up and the inflorescence buds and fruits abscise, resulting in early senescence of plants [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Aphids are important pests on virtually all crops, mainly concentrating on the back of leaves and tender stems to suck plant sap, resulting in yellow and curly leaves; Sustained feeding by aphids often increases the reproductive rate of the aphids, induce sooty blotch, and reduce the commerciality of fruits [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To date, pesticides play a critical role in controlling pests and increasing crop yields worldwide. With the extensive use of pesticides, the drug resistance of pests has gradually increased, which makes the prevention and control of pests more difficult, and even leads to food safety problems in agricultural products [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings indicate that the research and development of novel, safe, and highly potent pesticides and the use of tomato self-resistance are effective ways to resist phytophagous insects such as aphids and mites.</p><p>Unlike animals or humans, plants cannot avoid the impact of environmental pressure by moving when facing a complex and changing living environment. Therefore, in the long-term evolutionary process, plants have gradually evolved a sophisticated defense approach to feeding by various insects [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Constitutive defenses are physical or chemical factors that are inherent in the plant and are used to impede pest feeding; they are closely related to the plant genotype and serve to protect the plant throughout its life history [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tomato trichomes are vectors whereby physical and chemical defenses play a common role. Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are synthesized and released by glandular trichomes, and include acyl sugars, terpenes, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, and flavonoids, which can be used to directly induce or regulate defense signaling pathways to safeguard plants against phytophagous insects <?TeX {\hypertarget{myrefsref13}{}}?>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Non-glandular trichomes can hinder insect movement and decrease feeding by phytophagous insects, and significantly elevating the density and changing the type of leaf trichomes can delay the development and oviposition of insects [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to study the influence of constitutive defense mechanisms, such as the morphological characteristics and secondary metabolic components of tomato trichomes, on phytophagous insects.</p><p>Phenylpropanoid metabolism is one of the most important secondary metabolic pathways, yielding &#x0003e;8000 metabolites to date [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Among them, lignin is not only one of the main components of the vascular plant cell wall, but is also a natural phenolic polymer. It can combine with cellulose and hemicellulose to enhance the mechanical properties of plant cells and tissues, while forming a natural barrier against pest and disease invasion and enhancing plant resilience [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. <sc>l</sc>-Phenylalanineis formed in the shikimate pathway, and transforms into &#x003c1;-coumaroyl-CoA under the action of <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">4CL</italic>, forming the general phyenypropanoid pathway. Subsequently, &#x003c1;-coumaroyl-CoA, as the initial substrate, is transformed into lignin, flavonoids, and products of other biosynthetic pathways [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids are regulated by MYB, bHLH and WD40 transcription factors [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cell walls are outposts in response to microbial and insect infestation [<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Therefore, on the one hand the plant can promote lignification, callose accumulation, and secondary cell wall thickening, which provides a physical barrier against insect invasion; and on the other hand downstream secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, toxic phenols, and phytoalexins, can also activate the antioxidant system and inhibit insect development and oviposition to a certain extent [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, only a few phenylpropanoid and flavonoid components of tomato leaves have been identified to date; in particular, most insect-resistance secondary metabolisms in tomatoes are still unknown.</p><p>Compared with a single omics tool, the rapid development of multi-omics is playing a fundamental role in the deep understanding of plant coloration and quality, responses to stress, growth, and development as well as food preservation and processing from a new biological perspective [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Previous studies of plant defense against pest infestations have shown that the expression of <italic toggle="yes">AevPAL1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AevTDC1</italic> together positively regulate cereal cyst nematode resistance and interact with each other; <italic toggle="yes">AevPAL1</italic> is an important regulator of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and plays a key role in resistance to cereal cyst nematode [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast, the effects of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids secreted by glandular trichomes in tomato in response to phytophagous insect infestation are poorly understood. <italic toggle="yes">Solanum habrochaites</italic> (SH) is a wild relative of the cultivated tomato, and has a variety of excellent disease and stress resistance traits [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The characteristics of SH are commonly used for the improvement of pest and disease resistance traits and the creation of germplasm materials in tomatoes [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, when SH is used as the male parent, it can only be hybridized with cultivated tomatoes and the seed-setting rate of the resulting seeds is low [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is time to adopt a multi-omics analysis strategy to explore the signaling pathways and metabolic regulatory networks of SH to lay a solid foundation for the genetic improvement of the cultivated tomato. Compared with transgenic, knockout, and antisense inhibition technology, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has the advantages of a short processing cycle, low cost, and high throughput, and is therefore often used as a method to study the biological function of plant genes [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, &#x02018;Ailsa Craig&#x02019; and SH were systematically analyzed using the metabolome combined with the transcriptome to clarify the main components and contents of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, and to determine the biological functions of the key insect resistance genes by VIGS with a view to providing some theoretical guidance for tomato pest control and plant&#x02013;insect interaction research.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec5"><title>Analysis of resistance of &#x02018;Ailsa Craig&#x02019; and <italic toggle="yes">Solanum habrochaites</italic> to aphids and mites</title><p>Among the eight trichome types in tomato, type VI glandular trichomes are the most abundant type on the leaves and contribute significantly to insect resistance, especially in wild species [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) results showed that there were abundant trichomes of types I, II, III, IV, V, and VI in AC, among which non-glandular trichomes of types II, III, and V were the most abundant. In contrast, there were types IV, V, and VI in SH. The shorter type IV and VI trichomes were the most numerous and were only found exclusively in the wild tomato, SH. Type VI trichomes in the two types of tomato had a significantly different appearance, the glandular head being smooth and round in SH and shaped like a four-leaf clover in AC; this was associated with the presence of cellular cavities in SH type VI glandular trichomes, which can accumulate large amounts of metabolites. Using fluorescence microscopy, Bergau <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] demonstrated that type VI glandular trichomes also had four glandular heads in SH and that there was a significantly enlarged cellular cavity between the heads, which was an important storage site for metabolites secreted by glandular cells. In contrast, type VI trichomes of AC either had no cellular interstices or very small intercellular spaces that could barely store metabolites. Such a difference in type VI glandular trichomes can clearly explain why SH can accumulate more secondary metabolites than AC, thus contributing to the increased resistance of SH to phytophagous insects (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig.<?TeX {\nobreak}?> 1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of insect resistance of tomato varieties AC and SH. <bold>A</bold> Cryo-SEM scans of AC and SH leaves. <bold>B</bold>&#x02013;<bold>E</bold> Aphid and mite preference tests for AC and SH tomato plants.

Ten adult aphids or mites were carefully transferred into a circle of 1&#x000a0;cm diameter in a Petri dish. One hour after the start of the experiment, we counted the number of aphids and mites moving to the leaves of AC or SH and those that did not make a choice (NC). The results showed that only a few pests did not make a selection, suggesting that aphids or mites had a significant preference for AC. The number of aphids or mites that preferred the leaves of SH was lower than the number preferring AC. In addition, SH had more obvious characteristics of resisting aphids than of resisting mites. Taken together, the above evidence suggested that, compared with SH leaves, with higher trichome density, phytophagous insects preferred to feed on AC leaves with lower trichome densities. However, Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] reported that plants can secrete or synthesize volatile metabolites to attract predators or respond to infestation by phytophagous insects. We further speculated that when plants are subjected to sustained phytophagous insect feeding and damage, volatiles such as lignin, cellulose, alkali, callose, and phenolic aldehydes are released to repel phytophagous insects, attract predators, or promote communication between leaves or plants. Therefore, it is of great significance to make a profound study of the role played by trichomes in the process of insect resistance, and a novel insect resistance strategy is proposed to provide a theoretical basis for actual production practice (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig.<?TeX {\nobreak}?> 1B&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Overall transcriptome analysis and DEG analysis of both varieties. <bold>A</bold> PCA score plot for six samples. <bold>B</bold> Heat map analysis of correlation of gene expression levels among the six samples. <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold> Venn diagrams of unigenes expressed in AC (<bold>C</bold>) and SH (<bold>G</bold>). <bold>E</bold> MA (Minus-versus-Add) plots of AC and SH.

At this time, the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Sl4CL</italic> in CK and silenced plants was 2.135 and 0.511, respectively, and the average mite numbers were 25 and 35. The above results suggested that, compared with CK plants, the silenced plants had mites with improved adaptation and faster reproduction, as significantly demonstrated by a total number of 35 live mites on the silenced plants after 7&#x000a0;days of feeding. Thus, both the altered plant phenotype and mite behavior after silencing of <italic toggle="yes">Sl4CLL6</italic> suggested that <italic toggle="yes">SL4CLL6</italic> was a key insect resistance gene in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig.<?TeX {\nobreak}?> 8D<?TeX {\nobreak}?> and<?TeX {\nobreak}?> E</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we also examined the effect of <italic toggle="yes">Sl4CLL6</italic> gene silencing on the expression of genes downstream of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway.

SH, a wild species closely related to AC, is named for the high density, large quantity, and abundant types of trichomes per unit area; compared with AC, it has many excellent agronomic traits, such as disease and pest resistance, cold tolerance and resistance to many other stresses, and is an important germplasm resource for modern tomato breeding [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The trichomes of tomato are multicellular structures, the most studied being types I, IV, and VI. Types I and IV are the main sources of acyl sugars. Type VI glandular trichomes can produce large amounts of volatile monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids, which are plant volatile organic compounds that attract carnivorous predatory plant insects such as parasitic wasps and thus serve as an indirect defense against insects [<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Cryo-SEM results showed that the different morphology and number of glandular cells in the rods and heads of the glandular trichomes and the different chemical substances secreted were the underlying reasons for the accumulation of a wider variety and quantity of secondary metabolites in SH than in AC, and were consistent with the results of the later metabolomic assay.</p><p>The results of the preference experiment showed that there was a significant difference in the resistance of AC and SH to aphids or mites after feeding for 1&#x000a0;h. Specifically, only a few aphids approached SH leaves and stayed briefly before moving towards AC leaves, and some aphids stayed around SH leaves for a long time before leaving. Furthermore, compared with aphids, mites were smaller, less susceptible to the external environment, and showed weak adaptability; after being placed in the center of the Petri dish, they made choices slowly, but also showed a tendency to prefer AC leaves.</p><p>Based on the above results, we speculated that when the plant is continuously fed or invaded by phytophagous insects, it may acquire resistance through secondary metabolites synthesized by trichomes. PSMs are the result of the interaction between plants and biological and abiotic factors in the environment during long-term evolution, and they can attract insects to help plants pollinate, or play an important role in plant defense against phytophagous insects as feeding and spawning inhibitors, and toxic substances. Identifying the key components and molecular regulatory mechanisms of insect resistance traits in SH and AC leaves has been the basis for insect resistance breeding and there is an urgent need to compensate for the small number of studies on this subject. Therefore, we determined the main components and content changes of trichome metabolism in AC and SH for the first time, and identified candidate differentially expressed metabolic pathways and key regulatory genes that regulate tomato resistance to insect invasion, in order to provide new strategies for enhancing tomato resistance.</p><p>With the development of sequencing technology, RNA-seq, as a routine experimental method for novel gene discovery, the study of quantitative gene expression, and transcript identification, provided the basis for identifying candidate genes for insect resistance and developing molecular markers [<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In this study, annotation of all DEGs in the GO scheme identified the two terms with the most significant enrichment in biological process terms: defense response (GO:0006952) and response to adversity (GO:0006950). KEGG analysis indicated that the phenylalanine metabolism (ko00360) and monoterpene biosynthesis (ko00902) pathways were highly significantly enriched. It is worth noting that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in plants starts from phenylalanine metabolism, and its products include lignin, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds, which play an extraordinary role in the secondary metabolic pathway of plants [<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It can interact with other secondary metabolic pathways and work together with them to provide resistance to factors such as diseases, pests, cold, drought, UV, and nutrient stress during plant growth, at the same time, and it can also play an important role as a signal molecule and plant antitoxin in the interaction between plants and the external environment and microorganisms [<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

The use of metabolomics to analyze tomato fruit development, nutrient composition, and disease mechanisms is a current research hotspot, but the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of insect attack on tomato have been poorly studied. In this study, non-targeted metabolomics was used to detect 24 kinds of metabolites in positive ion mode, of which benzene and its derivatives accounted for 15%, and the proportion of benzene compounds in SH was higher than that in AC. Therefore, we speculated that SH may have strong phenylpropanoid metabolic activity, and the KEGG enrichment results were consistent with the results of transcriptome analysis.</p><p>Therefore, combining transcriptome and metabolome data, we determined that DEGs and DAMs were significantly enriched in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940) and flavone biosynthesis (ko00941) pathways. More specifically, &#x003c1;-coumaryl acid (&#x003c1;-CA) can be catalyzed by <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">4CL</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CAD</italic> to synthesize &#x003c1;-coumaryl alcohol (C02646), thus providing precursors for different downstream branches of the metabolic pathway. <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">4CL</italic> were co-expressed with <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic> to complete the second and third steps of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. Surprisingly, <italic toggle="yes">4CL</italic>, as a key branchpoint enzyme, connected the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway and downstream metabolic pathways, while two <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic>s and four <italic toggle="yes">4CL</italic>s were only identified in SH tomato and all were upregulated, which indicated that <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">4CL</italic> were likely to be key regulatory genes for SH to resist insect invasion.</p><p>Compared with AC tomato, in SH the genes encoding <italic toggle="yes">HCT</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CAD</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">POD</italic> enzymes were more higher expressed, which could thicken the secondary wall of SH leaves and promote the accumulation of 4-hydroxycinnamyl alcohol 4-<sc>d</sc>-glucoside (H-lignin), providing a good research basis for effective resistance to insect pest attack [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Caffeoyl quinic acid (C00852), an important precursor of coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, can be catalyzed by <italic toggle="yes">COMT</italic> to transform the above two metabolites, thereby promoting the accumulation of G- and S-lignin. Therefore, S-, G- and H-lignin were derived from three core lignin substrates: coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and &#x003c1;-coumaryl alcohol, respectively. Gesteiro <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] found that the interdependence between &#x003c1;-coumaryl alcohol and lignin S monomers promoted resistance to stem-borer in maize cell-wall phenylpropanoids, which was consistent with the results of the present study. &#x003c1;-Coumaroyl CoA generated naringenin under the catalysis of <italic toggle="yes">CHS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CHI</italic> enzymes.

In this study we observed infection symptoms and counted the number of mites on leaves of CK and silenced plants under the same conditions. Their propagation results showed that within 7&#x000a0;dpi of mite inoculation, mite populations increased on both CK and silenced plants, as evidenced by the fact that there was no significant difference in the number of mites on CK and silenced plants at 0 and 1&#x000a0;dpi, whereas the number of mites on silenced plants increased dramatically at 4 and 7 dpi, when it was 1.173- and 1.4-fold higher than that of CK, respectively, suggesting that the silencing of <italic toggle="yes">Sl4CLL6</italic> reduced resistance to mites in AC, leaving the leaves almost covered with mites.

Fold change (FC) between samples was determined using DESeq2 [<xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="ref98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].
