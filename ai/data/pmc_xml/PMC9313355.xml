Our results show that BCP remarkably protected against cell death and apoptosis induced by OGD/R, and decreased neurologic injury, infarct volume, and the injury of neurons in CA1 region on MCAO/R mice. In addition, BCP accelerated mitophagy by regulating expression of mitochondrial autophagy marker molecules and the mt-Atp6/Rpl13 ratio (reflecting the relative number of mitochondria), and promoting autophagosome formation compared with OGD/R and MCAO/R groups both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this study revealed that BCP pre-treatment could activate the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway, also with mitophagy activation. To explore the mechanisms, mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) was used to investigate the role of BCP in CIR injury. We found that Mdivi-1 not only decreased BCP-induced facilitation of mitophagy, but also significantly weakened BCP-induced protection against OGD/R and MCAO/R models, which was consistent with levels of Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that facilitating mitophagy via Pink1/Parkin2 signaling is essential for the neuroprotective effect of BCP against CIR injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mitophagy</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2;-caryophyllene</kwd><kwd>cerebral ischemia-reperfusion</kwd><kwd>Pink1/Parkin2 pathway</kwd><kwd>neuronal injury</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Chongqing Yuzhong District Science Technology Commission of China</funding-source><award-id>20210121</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>College of Pharmacology of Chongqing Medical University</funding-source><award-id>YXY2021BSH02</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Chongqing Yuzhong District Science Technology Commission of China, grant number 20210121 and the Outstanding Researcher Fund of the College of Pharmacology of Chongqing Medical University, grant number YXY2021BSH02.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-brainsci-12-00868"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Stroke, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, is a major affliction threatening human health that has become the second most common disease in the world [<xref rid="B1-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Ischemic stroke accounts for more than 80% of stroke occurrences and is a leading cause of mortality and disability [<xref rid="B2-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, the most effective treatment is timely thrombolysis for ischemic stroke [<xref rid="B3-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, at most around 8% of stroke patients eligible for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator intravenous thrombolysis receive it owing to its limited time window for treatment [<xref rid="B4-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The reperfusion stage after cerebral ischemia is prone to cause further damage by mechanisms including free radical production, oxidative stress, excitatory amino acid toxicity, and intracellular calcium overload, which promote the release of a large number of neurotransmitters, ultimately leading to neuron damage and death [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, compared with thrombolytic therapy, enhancing the self-resistance and protection of neurons for ischemic stroke has broader application prospects because it has no treatment-time limitation.</p><p>Mitochondria are known as the &#x0201c;power plants&#x0201d; of cells because they play a key role in maintaining cell energy homeostasis and, thus, are certainly involved in neuronal death following ischemic stroke [<xref rid="B6-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recent studies showed that CIR induced prominent mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, the damage of mitochondrial morphological, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mitochondrial swelling to initiate neuronal death [<xref rid="B7-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction is closely related to many biological processes in the cell, such as apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the occurrence and development of CIR. Furthermore, the accumulation of damaged mitochondria induces further brain damage, thus forming a vicious cycle [<xref rid="B8-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, strict control of mitochondrial quality and quantity is crucial to avoid the pathological effects of dysfunctional mitochondria on neurons [<xref rid="B9-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Failure to remove damaged mitochondria will lead to cell death, so an efficient clearance of damaged mitochondria is critical to mitigate CIR-induced nerve damage.</p><p>Mitochondrial autophagy, also known as mitophagy, is a biological process by which select mitochondrial cargos are wrapped by mitochondria-derived vesicles and delivered to lysosomes for degradation, an essential process for maintaining mitochondrial contents and metabolic homeostasis [<xref rid="B10-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mitophagy is essential for the renewal and redistribution of mitochondria, regulating the homeostasis and biogenesis of mitochondrial, controlling the number and quality mitochondrial [<xref rid="B11-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Increasing numbers of reports have demonstrated that mitophagy is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury [<xref rid="B12-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Elimination of damaged mitochondria efficiently by activated mitophagy seems to be critical for neuronal survival following CIR injury [<xref rid="B13-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Cannabinoid receptor type 1(CB1R) and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) all are cannabinoid receptors. CB2R agonists have shown against CIR by its neuroprotective effects [<xref rid="B18-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (BCP), a natural sesquiterpene compound found in the essential oil of plants, is reportedly a CB2R-selective agonist [<xref rid="B19-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous research revealed that BCP can protect neurons against CIR injury in mice by promoting polarization of microglia toward an M2 phenotype [<xref rid="B20-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. BCP can also alleviate CIR injury by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [<xref rid="B21-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, BCP elicited a neuroprotective effect against CIR injury by regulating neuronal death and inflammation both in vivo and in vitro [<xref rid="B22-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, whether the protective effects of BCP on CIR injury are mediated by regulation of mitophagy to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and biogenesis is still largely unknown.</p><p>The PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1)-Parkin (E3 ubiquitin ligase) signaling pathway is the classical regulatory mechanism for mitophagy. Pink1 is kept at a low level depending on rapid degradation by mitochondrial proteases. In the context of mitochondrial damage, Pink1 is on the outer membrane of mitochondria and recruits Parkin from cytosolic to the outer membrane of mitochondria too. Parkin mediates engulfment and subsequent destruction of mitochondria through autophagosomes when it transferred to the mitochondrial surface. Subsequently, Parkin is recognized by p62 and bound this adaptor protein. p62 recruits ubiquitinated substances into autophagosomes by binding to LC3, ultimately leading mitochondria being degraded by lysosomes. Additionally, recent evidence shows that upregulation of Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy can alleviate CIR injury [<xref rid="B17-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, whether the Pink1/Parkin pathway is crucial for the protective effects of BCP on CIR injury is still largely unknown. Thus, our study aimed to determine whether BCP attenuates CIR-induced neuronal injury by facilitating mitophagy via the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-brainsci-12-00868"><title>2.

BCP Alleviated OGD/R Injury-Induced Decreases of Cell Viability and Apoptosis</title><p>To examine the exact role of BCP on OGD/R injury, we first determined biologically safe doses of BCP for HT-22 cells under normoxic conditions using an MTT assay. The results showed that BCP concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mM exerted no significant toxic effects on cell viability under normoxic conditions (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Subsequently, OGD/R-treated HT-22 cells were exposed to biologically safe concentrations of BCP (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 50 mM). We found that BCP obviously rescued cell viability following OGD/R injury in a dose-dependent manner, especially 10 mM BCP, which could significantly improve the decrease in cell viability caused by OGD/R injury relative to the control group (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).

GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed these mitophagy regulators interrelated to biological processes such as pathways of neurogeneration, regulation of apoptotic process and growth which are closely connected with CIR-mediated neuroinjury (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;D). Additionally, these essential mitophagy regulators interacted with multiple genes in PPI network (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E,F). We can found from <xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F that the PINK1-PARK pathway is close to the process of mitophagy. TOMMs and VDACs are the representative molecule of mitochondrion.BECN1, SQSTM1, ATG5, ATG12 and ULK1 are the representative molecule of autophagy. Therefore, we supposed that mitophagy may be the mechanism for BCP-mediated protection against CIR injury.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-brainsci-12-00868"><title>3.3. BCP Enhanced Mitophagy in OGD/R-Injured HT-22 Cells</title><p>To address the role of BCP in regulating mitophagy of OGD/R cells, the level of mitophagy was detected. First, we found that the OGD/R cells exhibited moderate decreases in protein expression of mitochondrial markers TOM20 and p62, and a moderate increase about the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio compared with the control cells. Notably, BCP treatment prominently decreased the expression of TOM20 and p62, and remarkably increased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio compared with the OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;D). Furthermore, accumulation of autophagosomes was observed in OGD/R cells compared with the control cells. However, numbers of autophagosomes in cells treated with BCP were significantly increased, and autophagic vacuoles wrapping around damaged mitochondria and organelles could be seen that were absent in the OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E,F). In addition, double-immunofluorescence staining of LC3 and the VDAC1 (a mitochondrial marker) was investigate to colocalization of mitophagy. We observed less fluorescence of LC3 in the control group. After the OGD/R operation, increased LC3 expression suggested a higher level of autophagy. Moreover, the expression of LC3B/VDAC1 were higher in the OGD/R cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that mitophagy was activated. Significantly higher expression of LC3B/VDAC1 were observed in the BCP treatment cells compared with the OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G,H). Quantitative analysis also suggested increased the expression of LC3B/VDAC1 in the BCP treatment cells compared with the other cells. Finally, qRT-PCR revealed a moderate decrease of mtDNA copy numbers in the OGD/R cells compared with the control cells, and mtDNA copy numbers were sharply diminished in the BCP treatment cells compared with the OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>I). These results illustrated that BCP pre-treatment was important for facilitating mitophagy to clear damaged mitochondria in OGD/R cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-brainsci-12-00868"><title>3.4. BCP Activates the Pink1/Parkin2 Pathway in OGD/R-Injured HT-22 Cells</title><p>To examine the mechanism by which BCP mediated mitophagy in OGD/R cells, effects of BCP on the Pink1/Parkin2 pathway were observed. Our results show that the OGD/R group exhibited moderate increases in Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels compared with the control group, while BCP treatment significantly increased Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels compared with OGD/R and control groups (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;C).</p><p>Parkin2 is recruited to mitochondria, where is remains localized during mitophagy. Double-immunofluorescence staining results shown that Parkin2 was expressed at low levels during mitochondrial translocation in the control group, while moderate increases the expression of Parkin2/VDAC1 were observed in the OGD/R cells. Additionally, significant increases the expression of Parkin2/VDAC1 were observed in the BCP-treated OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D,E).

Facilitating Mitophagy via the Pink1/Parkin2 Pathway Plays an Important Role in BCP Protection against OGD/R Injury of HT-22 Cells</title><p>To clarify the involvement of activated mitophagy in BCP-mediated protection against OGD/R injury of HT-22 cells, mitophagy was blocked with the mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1. MTT assay results showed that BCP treatment markedly promoted the growth and survival of OGD/R cells, whereas Mdivi-1 obviously blocked BCP-induced growth and survival of OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Moreover, BCP treatment alleviated the number and morphology of OGD/R cells, whereas Mdivi-1 blocked the protective role of BCP against these changes in OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Furthermore, BCP treatment reduced apoptosis of OGD/R cells, a feature that was also blocked by Mdivi-1 (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C,D).</p><p>Additionally, we evaluated mitophagy levels after exposure to Mdivi-1. We found that Mdivi-1 reversed the BCP-mediated decreases in expression of TOM20 and p62, and increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio in OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;D). Consistently, Mdivi-1 blocked the BCP-induced increase of autophagic vacuoles wrapping around damaged mitochondria in OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E,F). Furthermore, Mdivi-1 blocked the significant BCP-induced increase of Parkin2/VDAC1-positive cells following OGD/R injury (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>G,H). In addition, Mdivi-1 reversed the BCP-mediated decrease in mtDNA copy numbers in OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>I). Finally, Mdivi-1 reversed BCP-mediated increases in Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels in OGD/R cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A&#x02013;C). In accordance with mitochondrial translocation assay results, Mdivi-1 blocked BCP-mediated increases of Parkin2/VDAC1-positive cells (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D,E). Therefore, BCP mediated protection against OGD/R-mediated injury in HT-22 cells mainly by facilitating mitophagy via the Pink1/Parkin2 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-brainsci-12-00868"><title>3.6. BCP Protected against Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Facilitating Mitophagy in C57BL/6 Mice</title><p>To determine whether BCP contributes to protection against CIR in a manner dependent on mitophagy in vivo, as shown in <xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A, C57BL/6 mice were divided into groups treated with 36 mg/kg, 72 mg/kg, or 144 mg/kg BCP (low-, middle-, and high-dose groups) before undergoing a transient MCAO procedure. Mdivi-1 was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion (3 mg/kg). Mice were sacrificed 24 h after reperfusion. Severe neurological deficits were present in the MCAO/R group compared with sham and BCP-treated sham groups, and BCP treatment reduced neurological scores in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B). MCAO/R group mice exhibited reduced times in rotarod testing compared with respective sham and BCP-treated sham groups. Treatment with BCP increased times spent on the rotarod after MCAO/R in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>C), especially 72 mg/kg BCP, which prominently protected against MCAO/R-mediated nerve injury. However, Mdivi-1 abolished these neuroprotective effects, as indicated by increased neurologic scores and reduced times on the rotarod (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B,C). Infarct volumes were assessed by TTC. Compared with outcomes in the MCAO/R group, BCP treatment markedly decreased infarct volumes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that BCP improved functional outcomes after MCAO/R injury (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>D,E). In addition, H&#x00026;E stained sections were analyzed the necrotic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. As shown in <xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>F, neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were arranged in nomal rows, shown intact cell structures, and had clear nuclear outlines in sham and BCP-treated sham groups (black arrows). After 24 h of reperfusion, neurons were necrotic and shrank, cellular edema, and nuclear condensation (red arrows). However, BCP significantly prevented neuron damage and improved the pathology associated with MCAO/R in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, Mdivi-1 blocked this neuroprotection in MCAO/R mice, as indicated by increased infarct volumes and CA1 neuronal injury (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>D&#x02013;F). These results suggest that BCP protected against MCAO/R injury in vivo in an autophagy-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-brainsci-12-00868"><title>3.7. BCP Facilitated Mitophagy after Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in C57BL/6 Mice</title><p>Western blot results showed moderate decreases in protein expression of mitochondria markers TOM20 and p62, as well a moderate increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio in the MCAO/R group compared with the sham group. Compared with the MCAO/R group, BCP pretreatment significantly increased the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio and TOM20 expression, and decreased p62 expression. However, changes in expression of these proteins were reversed by treatment with a mitophagy inhibitor (Mdivi-1) (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A&#x02013;D). In addition, electron microscopy results showed that healthy mitochondria were present in the sham group. Neurons in the MCAO/R group displayed mitochondrial swelling, loss of matrix density, autophagic vacuoles, partially degraded mitochondria, small numbers of autophagic vacuoles, and double-membraned autophagosomes containing damaged mitochondria. In contrast, mitochondria with some slight swelling and nearly normal matrix densities were observed in the BCP group. Additionally, typical autophagosomes were frequently observed in the BCP group, and were more abundant compared with the MCAO/R group. In contrast, only a small number of autophagosomes were found in the BCP + Mdivi-1 group and no typical autophagosomes were observed in the Mdivi-1 group (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>E,F).</p><p>We further detected expression of the mitochondrial membrane protein VDAC1 and LC3 by immunofluorescence co-staining. As reflected in <xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>G,H, there was little increase in LC3/VDAC1-positive cells in the control group, while BCP pretreatment significantly increased the percentage of LC3/VDAC1-positive cells compared with the MCAO/R group. In contrast, the percentage of LC3/VDAC1-positive cells was clearly decreased in the BCP + Mdivi-1 group. Finally, we examined relative amounts of mitochondria in different groups by qPCR. mt-Atp6/Rpl13 ratios were significantly decreased in the BCP group compared with the MCAO/R group, confirming that the loss of mitochondria was due to autophagy. Employment of the mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 significantly increased the mt-Atp6/Rpl13 ratio (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>I). Collectively, these results revealed that BCP can clear MCAO/R-induced damaged mitochondria by accelerating mitophagy.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8-brainsci-12-00868"><title>3.8. Pink1/Parkin2 Pathway-Dependent Mitophagy Is Implicated in BCP-Induced Protection against CIR Injury</title><p>We detected expression of Pink1 and Parkin2 proteins by Western blot. The results suggested an increase in Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels in the MCAO/R group compared with the sham group. The BCP treatment group exhibited significantly upregulated expression of Pink1 and Parkin2 compared with the MCAO/R group (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>A&#x02013;C). However, administration of Mdivi-1 inhibited BCP-induced upregulation of Pink1 and Parkin2 expression levels. In addition, we examined the recruitment of Parkin2 to mitochondria. Parkin2 and VDAC1 localization were detected by immunofluorescence staining in ischemic hippocampi of MCAO/R mice. We found that translocation of Parkin2 to mitochondria was increased in the BCP group compared with the MCAO/R group (significant increase of Parkin2/VDAC1-positive cells). In the BCP + Mdivi-1 group, translocation of Parkin2 to mitochondria was decreased compared with findings from the BCP group (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>D,E). Therefore, these results indicated that the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway is required for BCP-induced mitophagy activation in BCP-induced protection against CIR injury.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-brainsci-12-00868"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>CIR injury is an extremely complex pathophysiological process comprising a rapid cascade of intracellular calcium overload, lipid peroxidation, oxygen free radical damage, apoptotic gene activation, excitotoxicity (excitatory amino acids-induced neurotoxicity), and inflammatory cytokine damage [<xref rid="B25-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The involved mechanisms, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory injury, and cell damage, play different roles in the process of CIR injury. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial damage and dysfunction during CIR are important causes of neuronal cell death [<xref rid="B27-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Current studies suggest that a large amount of cytochrome C is released from mitochondria into cells by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in CIR injury, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref rid="B28-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further oxidative damage of mitochondria is induced by ATP synthesis deficiency and new reactive oxygen species in CIR injury [<xref rid="B30-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, timely clearance of damaged mitochondria is essential to mitigate CIR-induced brain damage. Mitophagy is a type of selective autophagy that can maintain homeostasis of the intracellular environment by specifically recognizing and removing abnormal mitochondria [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although many studies have investigated the effect of mitochondrial autophagy in CIR injury, the exact role mitochondrial autophagy plays in this process is unknown. It remains controversial whether mitophagy can play a protective role in ischemic preconditioning and/or exert different effects on how reperfusion injury occurs [<xref rid="B24-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B31-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A recent study suggests that carnosine can improve mitochondrial function and reduce CIR injury by downregulating mitophagy [<xref rid="B32-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Another study showed that upregulating mitophagy can protect against CIR injury by promptly removing damaged mitochondria [<xref rid="B33-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Accumulating research indicates that mitophagy are activated in a stress-induced pathway to clear damaged mitochondria in CIR injury. Furthermore, mitophagy aggravates brain injury during the ischemia phase, but alleviates brain injury in the reperfusion phase. In addition, the protective role of mitophagy during reperfusion may be attributable to mitochondrial clearance and inhibition of downstream apoptosis. Accordingly, insufficient clearance of damaged mitochondria causes cell death [<xref rid="B34-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, we found that the CB2R agonist BCP, a natural sesquiterpene compound, protected against CIR injury both in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with activation of mitophagy after CIR injury, BCP treatment significantly upregulated CIR-induced mitophagy, yielding a neuroprotective effect after CIR injury. In addition, the mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 successfully blocked BCP-induced protection against CIR injury in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models. Therefore, mitophagy may be an important target for the treatment of CIR injury.</p><p>LC3-I is converted to lipidated LC3-II, a classic hallmark of autophagy [<xref rid="B35-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. p62, a selective substrate protein degraded by autophagy, binds to Atg8/LC3 on autophagy membranes to target autophagosomes for degradation during autophagy. Therefore, ubiquitin-p62-LC3 can perform autophagic degradation on damaged phagocytes and eliminate defective membranous organelles and proteins [<xref rid="B36-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. TOM20 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein and subunit of the important TOM complex receptor. The level of TOM20 reflects the relative number of mitochondria. Hence, relative expression of TOM20 and p62, as well as the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I proteins, are used to evaluate levels of mitophagy [<xref rid="B35-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, when BCP treatment was given, the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio sharply increased while expression of p62 and TOM20 were significantly decreased in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models of CIR injury. These results indicate that mitochondrial autophagy levels were further increased. The process of autophagy/mitophagy occurs sequentially as follows: phagophore formation, fusion of the blind ends of phagophores, autophagosome formation, fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, and transformation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes; during the final step of autophagy, residual bodies can be detected [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. During this process, various damaged proteins or organelles, including mitochondria, are wrapped by double-layered membrane autophagy vesicles that are then sent to lysosomes (animals) or vacuoles (yeast and plants), which are eventually degraded and recycled [<xref rid="B38-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Autophagosomes are characterized by a double-layer or multilayer membrane-like vacuole structure that contains cytoplasmic components, such as mitochondria, and can be observed by electron microscopy [<xref rid="B39-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this study, TEM results revealed the presence of autophagosomes with a typical bilayer membrane structure in the BCP treatment group in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models of CIR injury.</p><p>Pink1-Parkin2-mediated mitophagy is a classic pathway to clear damaged mitochondria [<xref rid="B40-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Release of Pink1 from the mitochondrial outer membrane to the inner membrane is blocked by mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, meaning Pink1 cannot be degraded and instead accumulates on the outer membrane of mitochondria. When Pink1 aggregates on the mitochondrial outer membrane, various proteins including Parkin, ubiquitin, and TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) are recruited and activated. Ample studies have investigated the effect of Pink1/Parkin2-mediated mitophagy in CIR injury. Previous reports suggest that mitophagy is activated in CIR-induced brain damage via the PINK1/PARK2/p62 signaling pathway [<xref rid="B41-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Another study showed that electroacupuncture ameliorates neuronal injury by Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy clearance in CIR [<xref rid="B17-brainsci-12-00868" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present experiment, we demonstrated that BCP pretreatment can significantly increase expression of Pink1 and Parkin2, suggesting that BCP-induced mitochondrial autophagy is dependent on the Pink1/Parkin2 pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that BCP reduced CIR injury in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models by upregulating CIR-induced mitophagy through effects on the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-brainsci-12-00868"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our study indicates that mitophagy was activated following CIR injury and BCP pretreatment could further activate CIR-induced mitophagy to clear damaged mitochondria to reduce brain damage. This protective mechanism against CIR injury (<xref rid="brainsci-12-00868-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>) occurs through recruitment of Pink1 and Parkin2 on the outer membrane of mitochondria, which increased the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio and decreased expression of p62. Subsequently, formation of phagophores containing damaged mitochondria occurs, which fuse with lysosomes and transform into autolysosomes. By this mechanism, damaged mitochondria can be degraded to produce amino acids and other nutrients for neurons.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-brainsci-12-00868"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following supporting information can be downloaded at: <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/brainsci12070868/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/brainsci12070868/s1</uri>, Table S1: Summary of 36 recognized mitophagy-associated genes.</p><supplementary-material id="brainsci-12-00868-s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="brainsci-12-00868-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, J.R. and Y.W.; methodology, J.R.; software, Y.W.; validation, X.F., S.Y. and L.J.; formal analysis, J.R.; investigation, Y.W.; resources, Y.W.; data curation, J.R.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, J.R.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, S.C.; visualization, Z.D.; supervision, S.C.; project administration, Z.D.; funding acquisition, Z.D. and S.C.
