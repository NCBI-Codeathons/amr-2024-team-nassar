The molecular mechanisms underlying the primary and secondary metabolic effects of rust spots on the leaves of <italic>Malus</italic> apple cultivars are poorly understood. Using HPLC, we found that the contents of flavonoid compounds, especially anthocyanin and catechin, were significantly increased in rust-infected symptomatic tissue (RIT). The expression levels of structural genes and MYB transcription factors related to flavonoid biosynthesis were one- to seven-fold higher in the RIT. Among these genes, <italic>CHS, DFR, ANS, FLS</italic> and <italic>MYB10</italic> showed more than a 10-fold increase, suggesting that these genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in the RIT. Hormone concentration assays showed that the levels of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), jasmonate (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) were higher in the RIT and were consistent with the expression levels of <italic>McNCED, McACS, McLOX</italic> and <italic>McNPR1</italic>, respectively. Our study explored the complicated crosstalk of the signal transduction pathways of ABA, ETH, JA and SA; the primary metabolism of glucose, sucrose, fructose and sorbitol; and the secondary metabolism of flavonoids involved in the rust resistance of <italic>Malus</italic> crabapple leaves.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>ethylene</kwd><kwd>jasmonate</kwd><kwd>salicylic acid</kwd><kwd>flavonoid biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>MYB transcription factor superfamily</kwd><kwd>rust</kwd><kwd><italic>Malus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="43"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Gymnosporangium yamadai</italic> Miyabe, which is known as Cedar-apple rust, causes serious diseases and significant economic losses to apple cultivars (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). As the disease progresses, infected leaves exhibit expanding leaf spot lesions, which lead to complete leaf collapse (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Sekiyama et al., 2017</xref>). The resistance responses of plants under stress include a series of complex morphological, physiological and molecular process changes, such as osmotic adjustments, hormone regulation and resistant component formation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Vorwerk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">de Torres Zabala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tauzin and Giardina, 2014</xref>). Flavonoids are the most important plant pigments, and they are involved in UV filtration and symbiotic nitrogen fixation and can also act as chemical messengers, physiological regulators, and inhibitors against organisms that cause plant diseases, e.g., <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Anthocyanins are an important subgroup of flavonoids and have been shown to act as a &#x02018;sunscreen&#x02019; and protect cells from high-light damage by absorbing blue-green and ultraviolet light in photosynthetic tissues, thereby protecting the tissues from photoinhibition or high stress. This protective effect has been shown to occur in red juvenile leaves, autumn leaves, and broad-leaf evergreen leaves that turn red during winter (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Jaakola, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Oglesby et al., 2016</xref>). Flavonols and proanthocyanidins have been suggested to play a role in suppressing the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria and greatly reducing the ability of these bacteria to initiate an infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Shang et al., 2017</xref>). In tissues, these substances may act as antioxidants and significantly contribute to the scavenging of free radicals produced via metabolic processes in plants, whereas at the organ surface, visible coloring phenotypes may be displayed because of the accumulation of flavonoids during exposure to pathogen infection or environmental stress. Visible coloring caused by flavonoids could represent a potential indicator of stress in plants for use in early diagnosis and prevention strategies; however, the coloring pattern of different species of plants is diverse and the underlying mechanisms are complex (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Mierziak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Peixoto et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Flavonoid biosynthesis is an important branch of phenylalanine metabolism, and these compounds are regulated by the transcription profiles of <italic>CHS, F3H, F3&#x02032;H, DFR, ANS, UFGT</italic> and <italic>LAR</italic> genes and manipulated by MYB transcription factors (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Shi and Xie, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). This network in plants regulates the accumulation of flavonoid components, such as flavone, flavonol, flavanols, procyanidins and anthocyanins. When confronted with abiotic stress, the flavonoid composition in plant tissues and organs changes in response to possible cell damage, which induces changes in the coloring of visible parts (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Cant&#x000ed;n et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). For example, plants often produce pigments around wounds, pathogen infection sites, insect piercing and feeding sites, and physical injuries, with various color responses observed among different plant varieties and even in different tissues (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Petre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dubovskiy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fogelman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role of these different color phenotypes caused by infection as well as the function of flavonoid composition changes and the mechanisms underlying the regulation of related gene transcription and their relationship to the metabolic pathways are not clear.</p><p>Osmotic regulation is a common physiological reaction in plants under stress. Carbohydrates are important components in the adjustment process, and many studies have shown that when plants experience drought, low temperature, high temperature and certain biological stresses, their tissues will accumulate substantial levels of fructose and sorbitol to maintain cell turgor (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Couee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the accumulation of carbohydrates in stressed plants may be associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, and previous reports have demonstrated that high C/N promotes the accumulation of flavanols and anthocyanins in plants via the upregulated expression of structure genes and MYB10, MYB4 and MYB7 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). We suggest that carbohydrates, which are a component of osmotic regulation during pathogen infection, may contribute to the accumulation of flavonoids as a defense against infection and disease expansion because of their antioxidant properties. The plant hormones ABA, ETH, JA and SA have multiple effects on secondary metabolism, including the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Di et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the study on grape berries demonstrated that ETH induced via the upregulated expression of the ACS gene regulated the accumulation of flavanols and anthocyanins by upregulating MYB transcription activities (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>). Recent study indicated that the accumulation of JA was stimulated by nematode infection together with LOX upregulation, which resulted in the accumulation of other second metabolites including flavonoids (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Concha et al., 2013</xref>). ABA application in stressed plants have been shown to regulate many secondary metabolism pathways; thus, ABA may play an important role in regulating the expression of upstream genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis network (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Cant&#x000ed;n et al., 2007</xref>). SA is induced during biotic interactions and interact with JA and ETH-induced pathways, and play key roles in plant defense following pathogen attack (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Robert-Seilaniantz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Di et al., 2017</xref>). However, the relationship of plant hormones and carbohydrates to the flavonoid biosynthesis network requires further exploration.</p><p>Under field conditions, we found that in the pathogen infection process of the ever-red-leaf cultivar &#x02018;Royalty,&#x02019; obvious dark red spots appeared in infected tissues, and they corresponded with increased anthocyanin content. However, in the ever-green-leaf cultivar &#x02018;Flame,&#x02019; yellow spots with unclear edges appeared because of obvious flavone and flavonol accumulation in the infected tissues. Therefore, the accumulation of flavonoids in two cultivars displayed obviously different coloration patterns when their leaves were infected by the rust pathogen, and even the uninfected and infected tissues of each cultivar presented differences in flavonoid metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesized that the flavonoid accumulation-based defense systems were different between the two cultivars.</p><p>To explore the differences in resistance between the two varieties and different leaf tissues, we measured the accumulation of flavonoids and the expression of key genes and transcription factors in the infected and uninfected tissues. We also investigated the expression of several key genes related to hormone metabolism and carbohydrate changes. Our aim was to explain the role of flavonoid biosynthesis in flavonoid-based defense mechanisms in the leaves of different varieties infected by rust fungus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and Treatment</title><p>Eight-year adult trees of the purple-red cultivar &#x02018;Royalty&#x02019; and green cultivar &#x02018;Flame&#x02019; were used as experimental materials. Plants were obtained from the ornamental crabapple germplasm nursery of the Beijing University of Agriculture, which is located in the Changping District of Beijing, and they were managed under the same environmental conditions and infected by rust fungi under natural conditions (without artificial infection).</p><p>In the natural environment after the occurrence of rust, rust-infected leaves and normal leaves at the S1 (the early stage of rust infection with the scab obviously appeared in the leaf), S2 (the stage of aecidium appeared in the abaxial of the rust infected leaf), and S3 (the stage of aeciospore scattered in the rust infected leaf) rust developmental stages from 15 trees for each cultivar were sampled as one replicate for further tests. At least three replicates were performed for leaf collection. These samples were divided into 50 mL centrifuge tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Flavonoid Content</title><p>Freeze-dried crabapple fruit samples were coarsely ground, and the powdered peel or flesh (0.8 g) from each sample was mixed with 10 mL of extract solution [methanol:water:formic acid:trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) = 70: 27: 2: 1] at 4&#x000b0;C in the dark for 72 h and shaken every 3 h. The liquid was then separated from the solid matrix via filtration through sheets of qualitative filter paper. The filtrate was further passed through 0.22 &#x003bc;m reinforced nylon membrane filters, and the filtrate was evaporated at 30&#x000b0;C and the residue was dissolved in 5 mL of water and purified by solid-phase extraction cartridge (500 mg, 3 ml) using C18 Supelclean ENVI-18 cartridge (Pretech Instruments, Sollentuna, Sweden). The cartridge was rinsed with water and methanol successively. Mobile phase A [TFA: formic acid: water (0.1: 2: 97.9)] and mobile phase B [TFA: formic acid: acetonitrile: water (0.1: 2: 48: 49.9)] were used to separate the anthocyanins from the flavonols via using an HPLC1100-DAD system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The gradients were as follows: 0 min, 30% B; 10 min, 40% B; 50 min, 55% B; 70 min, 60% B; and 80 min, 30% B. Anthocyanin detection was performed at 520 nm, and flavonol detection was performed at 350 nm. All samples were analyzed using three replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Soluble Sugar Content</title><p>Fresh samples (1 g DW) were extensively extracted three times in 5 mL 80% (v/v) ethanol at 80&#x000b0;C for 1 h. After extraction, the extracted liquid was mixed and evaporated to dryness in an evaporating dish over an 80&#x000b0;C water bath. The residues were re-dissolved in 1 mL ultrapure water and passed through 0.45 &#x003bc;M filters. Then, a 20 &#x003bc;L sample was injected into a HPLC system (Waters 600E) equipped with a carbohydrate column and an Alltech 2000ES evaporative light detector. A mixture of 80% ethanol and 20% ultrapure water (v/v) was used as the mobile phase, and the flow rate was set at 0.4 mL min<sup>-1</sup>. Fructose, glucose, sucrose and sorbital were identified and quantified from the retention times and peak heights of sugar standards purchased from Sigma. Each measurement was repeated three times.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and qPCR Assay</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the samples using the RNAiso reagent according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (TIANGEN). Highly pure RNA samples (5 &#x003bc;g) with a ratio of 260/280 nm &#x0003e; 1.9 were DNase treated (TaKaRa) and reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The synthesized cDNAs were then diluted to 4 ng/&#x003bc;L for the qPCR analysis.

The samples were first extracted with ethanol (70%, final concentration) and then were dissolved in phosphate buffer (0.02 M, Sigma, United States) and the ELISA assays for ABA, JA, ETH and SA were performed on a 96-well microtitration plate. After adding the hormone standards (1 mg/mL, Sigma, United States), sample extracts and antibodies (1 mg/mL, Sigma, United States), the coated plates were incubated for 40 min at 37&#x000b0;C. After rinsing four times, 100 &#x003bc;L peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was added to each well, and then the plate was incubated for 40 min at 37&#x000b0;C. A colorimetric substrate (phenylenediamine) was added to each well, and the reaction was halted by the addition of 3 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Absorbance at 490 nm was detected using an ELISA spectrophotometer and used to calculate the ABA and JA content.

Rust spot areas on the infected leaves were obviously different among the pre-observed cultivars; therefore, we selected two typical cultivars, one with red spots and the other with yellow spots, to investigate the mechanisms underlying the different coloring of the rust spots and the differences between cultivars. We found that in the infected leaf tissues of the cultivar &#x02018;Royalty,&#x02019; red patches with clear edges appeared at the front of the blade and hypha and red patches covered the back of the leaf, whereas in the infected leaf tissues of &#x02018;Flame,&#x02019; yellow patches without a clear edge appeared on the front of the blade and hypha and yellow patches covered the back of the leaf (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>). The expansion size and expansion ratio of the spots during infection differed between the two tested cultivars and developmental stages. The patches in &#x02018;Royalty&#x02019; were 0.22, 0.31, and 0.43 cm at S1, S2 (with an expansion ratio 40.91%), and S3 (with an expansion ratio 38.71%), respectively, whereas the patches in &#x02018;Flame&#x02019; were 0.24, 0.39, and 0.47 cm at S1, S2 (with an expansion ratio 62.5%) and S3 (with an expansion ratio 20.51%), respectively (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). Because of the coloration around the rust-infected area, we speculated that the two cultivars may have distinct resistance responses to rust infection based on flavonoid accumulation.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Expansion of rust spots in the leaf tissues of <italic>Malus</italic> crabapple cultivars infected by rust diseases. <bold>(A)</bold> Phenotypes of leaf tissues in <italic>M.</italic> cv.

For example, leaf parts infected by pathogens undergo the programmed death of cells and tissues, which leads to partial dehydration, blocks bacterial cells from organizing, and controls the spread of disease spots. Additionally, the piercing of plants parts by insects produces local changes, such as the corneous layer thickening, pastel encryption, etc., and these changes are known as direct defense responses of plants to insects and pathogens (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Vorwerk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kawamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mellway et al., 2009</xref>). In the complex response to biotic stress, spotted coloring in plants is an important symptom that indicates a visible direct defense to infection and possible defense and avoidance metabolism in plant tissues, and it also provides clues for control and management (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dubovskiy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fogelman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kawahigashi et al., 2016</xref>). Our results indicated that two cultivars of <italic>Malus</italic> crabapple exhibited pigment-related flavonoid accumulation in rust spots and the adjacent tissues, with &#x02018;Royalty&#x02019; displaying red spots and &#x02018;Flame&#x02019; displaying yellow spots because of an increase in anthocyanin and flavonol content, respectively. These increased contents were synchronized with spot expansion, and differences were observed between cultivars. These obvious coloring symptoms represent indicators of potential defense mechanisms, provide a signal for the degree and progress of pathogen infection, and generate comparative differences in stress resistance among cultivars.</p></sec><sec><title>Different Coloring Patterns of the Two Cultivars Predicted Distinct Mechanisms of Pigment Accumulation under Biotic Stress</title><p>The accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonols is derived from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway regulated by MYB transcription factors in plants, and this transcription network includes branches representing the metabolic pathways of dihydrogen chalcone, flavonols, flavanols and anthocyanins, which result in the variations in essential coloring diversity in the plant kingdom (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Plants can initiate the whole network or parts of the network for defense, and different patterns of activation are observed when plants encounter biotic and environmental stress (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fogelman et al. (2015)</xref> reported that in the wound periderms of potato, the expression level of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and regulators was downregulated, which resulted in a color change in the wounded periderm. The results of our flavonoid composition analysis indicated that different resistance patterns to rust disease occurred via pigment accumulation during the expansion of rust spots, In this stage, &#x02018;Royalty&#x02019; may adopt strategies related to the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and &#x02018;Flame&#x02019; may adopt strategies related to flavonol and flavanol accumulation to resist the expansion of rust disease. In the infected leaves of &#x02018;Royalty,&#x02019; the transcription level of the genes in the flavonoid pathway exhibited an initial activation followed by a late increase, which increased the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, and in the infected leaves of &#x02018;Flame,&#x02019; the transcription level displayed a linear upward trend for flavonol and flavanol biosynthesis. MYBs such as <italic>McMYB10, McMYB4</italic> and <italic>McMYB7</italic> showed a positive regulation effect, and whereas <italic>McMYB16</italic> displayed a negative effect, thereby activating different key genes in the same biosynthesis pathway of the infected leaves of the two cultivars. For example, the upregulation of <italic>McCHS, McF3&#x02032;H, McANS</italic> and <italic>McUFGT</italic> in the infected spots of &#x02018;Royalty&#x02019; and the upregulation of <italic>McF3H, McFLS, McDFR</italic> and <italic>McLAR</italic> in the infected spots of &#x02018;Flame&#x02019; reflect the patterns of anthocyanin accumulation and flavonol accumulation, respectively (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Carbohydrates and Hormones Are Involved in the Defense Response and Flavonoid Accumulation during Rust Spot Expansion</title><p>Carbohydrate accumulation plays an important role in the osmotic adjustment process of plants that are confronted with biotic and environmental stress. Many studies have shown that stressed plant cells accumulate pemoline, carbohydrates, polyamine, betaines, etc. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Couee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Our results indicated that the infected leaves in two both cultivars displayed a significant accumulation of carbohydrates, especially sucrose and sorbitol, which were associated with the accumulation of anthocyanins or flavonols and the expression of structure genes positively regulated by <italic>McMYB4, McMYB7</italic> and <italic>McMYB10</italic> and negatively regulated by <italic>McMYB16</italic> in the infected and adjacent tissues. Previous studies have demonstrated that high C/N promotes the accumulation of flavanols and anthocyanins in crabapple plants because of the high expression of structural genes and <italic>McMYB10</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2016</xref>). The addition of sucrose had a positive effect on anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, carbohydrates, which represent an osmotic regulatory factor under pathogen infection, could contribute to the accumulation of flavonoids as a defense against spot expansion because of their antioxidant properties.</p><p>The plant hormones ABA, ETH and JA have been shown to demonstrate complex activity with regard to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>). Apple leaves infected with Alternaria activated flavonoid biosynthesis and the genes involved in phytohormone signaling pathways (ABA, JA, ETH) were upregulated (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Sugars and hormones can modulate anthocyanin biosynthesis via the coordinated regulation of the R2R3-MYB/bHLH/WD40(MBW) complex (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>All of these findings indicate that under rust infection, complicated regulatory cross-talk of the primary and second metabolites may occur in <italic>Malus</italic> cv. &#x02018;Royalty&#x02019; and &#x02018;Flame&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation Network for Rust Resistance in Crabapple Leaves</title><p>In our work to determine the resistance mechanisms of plants infected by rust disease, flavonoid biosynthesis structural genes and certain MYB transcript factors were activated, and this activation was accompanied by the accumulation of flavonoid contents. In addition, the accumulation of total carbohydrates and the four major carbohydrate components was higher in the rust-infected leaves, and the trends of the hormone biosynthesis genes and concentrations varied. Based on these data, we hypothesize that with rust infection, the primary metabolites were activated and then the secondary metabolites (flavonoid biosynthesis) were activated, and hormones were involved in this process by modulating the primary and secondary metabolites (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p>Hypothesis model of the regulation mechanism in leaves with rust infection.
