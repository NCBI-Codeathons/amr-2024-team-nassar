These hypothetical intermediates would exist freely in solution or bound to enzymes in the case of assembly line processes, and eventually all flux through the pathway would end and only the final product would exist. In reality no pathways proceed in this manner as the situation is complicated by varying rates of reaction for the different steps, meaning that some intermediates accumulate, while the inherent reactivity of other intermediates, or their ability to act as substrates for housekeeping enzymes not dedicated to the pathway, means that shunt metabolites often arise. Matters are further complicated by the fact that pathways are often convergent, with multiple units made in parallel before assembly into the final product, for example in the biosynthetic pathways to macrolide or aminoglycoside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> antibiotics. In addition, some pathways are not linear, and the final product is accessed via several routes due to the inherent substrate plasticity of the biosynthetic enzymes; well-studied examples include the rapamycin and erythromycin pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, in practice, any biosynthetic pathway will lead to the accumulation of a mixture comprising the final product plus varying concentrations of pathway intermediates and shunt metabolites. The composition of such a mixture will vary further when alternate growth conditions are used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Sometimes the final product of the pathway cannot be clearly discerned.</p><p id="Par4">Such mixtures of compounds are said to comprise a series of biosynthetic congeners, and their identification can provide valuable information about a biosynthetic pathway and may sometimes lead to new biosynthetic understanding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We recently reported the formicamycins, aromatic polyketides produced by <italic>Streptomyces formicae</italic> KY5 isolated from the fungus-growing plant-ant <italic>Tetroponera penzigi</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In total, sixteen congeners were isolated including three more fasamycins, a group of compounds previously reported from the heterologous expression of a clone derived from environmental DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These congeners are the product of a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) operating in conjunction with post-PKS modifications that include <italic>O</italic>-methylation and halogenation, plus oxidative and reductive modifications. Intrigued by these compounds, which exhibit potent antibacterial activity, we employed targeted metabolomics to identify further congeners that may have been missed during manual analysis of culture extracts. This led us to identify the formicapyridines (<bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>9</bold>), pyridine containing polyketide alkaloids which represent additional products of the formicamycin (<italic>for</italic>) biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Products of type II PKS systems which contain a pyridine moiety are rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of metabolites isolated from <italic>Streptomyces formicae</italic>.

In contrast, the formicapyridines are minor shunt metabolites that arise due to derailment of the formicamycin biosynthetic pathway. We show here that reprogramming the <italic>for</italic> BGC, by deleting the <italic>forS</italic> gene encoding an ABM family protein, leads to significantly increased production of formicapyridines with concomitant reduction of the combined titre of fasamycins and formicamycins. These and other mutational data lead us to the hypothesis that ForS is not a cyclase but forms part of a multienzyme complex where it acts as a chaperone-like protein to aid in maintaining pathway fidelity and performance. The discovery and engineering of formicapyridine biosynthesis raises intriguing questions regarding the evolution of type II PKS biosynthetic pathways and the origins of natural product chemical diversity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Metabolomics led identification of the formicapyridines</title><p id="Par6">The aromatic, polycyclic nature of these molecules limited fragmentation and the effectiveness of molecular networking via the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking web platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

This process dramatically reduced the dataset complexity, leaving &#x0003c;200 unique ions from an original set of &#x0223c;3000. Manual curation showed that most of the remaining ions corresponded to halogenated molecules (based on isotope patterns), leaving twelve previously identified fasamycin and formicamycin congeners, two additional fasamycin/formicamycin congeners that remain uncharacterized due to trace levels, and the known isoflavone 6-chlorogenistein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>) along with a regioisomer.

Limited <sup>1</sup>H&#x02013;<sup>1</sup>H COSY correlations meant we were reliant upon HMBC-based atomic connections, and through-space NOESY correlations, which led to two potential substructures consisting of 26 carbon atoms, leaving one carbonyl, one phenol and one quaternary carbon unassigned (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This left some uncertainty, but given the relationship with the fasamycins, we predicted the structure to be that shown for <bold>2</bold>. We thus plotted the <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts for <bold>2</bold> against those for fasamycin C (<bold>10</bold>), the closest structural congener. The data were in excellent agreement with the main differences at C7, C22 and C23, consistent with the adjacent nitrogen atom (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

We also used NOESY and HSQC correlations to distinguish C14 and C16 once one was chlorinated: given the NOESY correlations to the <italic>gem</italic>-dimethyl groups of C26 and C27 with H16, and the disappearance of a HSQC linkage for C14, we concluded that C14 was chlorinated (e.g. <bold>4</bold>&#x02013;<bold>6</bold>).

On this basis, we suggest a biosynthetic pathway as described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Assembly of the poly-&#x003b2;-ketone tridecaketide intermediate should proceed as previously proposed on route to the fasamycins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This would be followed by a series of cyclization and aromatisation steps, presumably in a sequential manner, with the final cyclization event probably involving formation of the B-ring. However, premature hydrolysis of the acylcarrier protein from putative intermediate <bold>27</bold>, prior to the action of a final cyclase, would liberate the enzyme-free, &#x003b2;-ketoacid species <bold>28</bold> that would be highly facile to spontaneous decarboxylation yielding the methylketone <bold>29</bold>. The action of an endogenous aminotransferase could then generate either of the species <bold>30</bold> or <bold>31</bold>, which could undergo cyclization, dehydration and oxidation to yield <bold>1</bold>.

Remarkably, these compounds are derived from the fasamycin/formicamycin biosynthetic machinery meaning that the <italic>for</italic> BGC is responsible for the production of three structurally differentiated pentacyclic scaffolds. Inspired by evolutionary considerations we introduced a gene deletion into the BGC, which significantly altered the relative levels of these metabolites: the titre of formicapyridines was significantly increased (&#x0223c;25-fold) in contrast to the fasamycin/formicamycins, which were decreased to approximately one-third of the WT titre. These results raise a series of questions about the cyclization events associated with the fasamycin/formicamycin biosynthetic pathway, and with the maintenance of pathway fidelity.</p><p id="Par21">Our data suggest that formation of ring-B of the fasamycin scaffold is the final biosynthetic step, followed by thioester hydrolysis to liberate the ACP and subsequent decarboxylation to remove the carboxyl group attached to C24 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Consistent with this, deletion of <italic>forS</italic> led to the isolation of shunt metabolite <bold>13</bold> with a C24-carboxyl group that was not observed from the WT. However, while ForS is implicated in ring-B cyclization it is not required for this role, nor, apparently, for the biosynthesis of any congeners. Rather, ForS seems to decrease the production of aberrant congeners from the pathway, e.g. formicapyridines, while increasing overall productivity. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that another of the <italic>for</italic> BGC gene products is the actual catalyst for ring-B formation, and that ForS acts as a chaperone, which modulates or stabilises the assembly, or arrangement, of a multienzyme complex to optimise production of the fasamycins, and therefore ultimately the formicamycins. This has the consequence of minimising the production of shunt metabolites (formicapyridines). Thus, while deletion of <italic>forS</italic> leads to the phenotype desired from our thought experiment, the mechanism by which this occurs is not what was anticipated. Interpretation of the <italic>for</italic> BGC bioinformatic analysis suggests the most likely candidate for a ring-B (final) cyclase is ForL due to its close relationship with TcmI, which catalyses a similar final cyclization step during tetracenomycin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The apparent lack of any intermediates or shunt metabolites being accumulated by the remaining mutants is somewhat surprising and suggests an absolute requirement for the formation of a PKS-cyclase complex before biosynthesis can be initiated.</p><p id="Par22">These observations are reminiscent of studies regarding the biosynthesis of pradimicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Pradimicins are pentangular polyketides similar to the benastatins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and the BGC for their production contains three PKS cyclases equivalent to ForD (PdmD), ForL (PdmK) and ForR (PdmL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It also contains two ABM domain proteins (PdmH and PdmI; c.f. ForS and ForU) which were assigned monooxygenase roles. Through heterologous expression of PKS gene cassettes it was deduced that for the biosynthetic pathway to function correctly, and yield a pentangular backbone, all three cyclase genes (PdmDKL) plus the ABM domain monooxygenase PdmH must be co-expressed. In this pathway one oxidation reaction to form the quinone structure is required. These results led the authors to propose a model in which the two cyclases PdmKL and the monooxygenase PdmH form a multienzyme complex that engulfs the entire polyketide molecule during its assembly and work synergistically to ensure the correct reaction pathway occurs thereby minimising the production of shunt metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, formation of the unusual discoid metabolite resistomycin involves an extremely rare S-shaped folding pattern and requires the coordinated function, likely as a multienzyme complex, of core PKS proteins in addition to three distinct cyclase enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, heterologous reconstruction of the resistomycin pathway gave no products when the minimal PKS plus first cyclase were assembled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, a rare observation that is in keeping with our data showing the requirement of all the putative cyclases ForDLRU to produce any pathway derived metabolites, including shunts.</p><p id="Par23">Biosynthesis of the <italic>for</italic> BGC polyketide backbones does not require a monooxygenase. Consistent with this, deletion of <italic>forS</italic> does not abolish polyketide production, but instead affects pathway productivity and fidelity. Thus, based on our mutational data and the observations discussed above, we hypothesise that ABM family enzymes can act as monooxygenases and/or as ancillary proteins to tune, in some way, the PKS enzyme complex function, and therefore the biosynthetic pathway, during aromatic polyketide biosynthesis. Genes encoding these proteins occur commonly in PKS BGCs, and multiple paralogues are often present even when monooxygenase reactions are not required. It is noteworthy that several PKS cyclases occur as fusion proteins with an ABM domain, which can be located at either terminus. We speculate that these may represent examples of mature pathways where the chaperone-like function of the ABM family protein has become essential, leading to selective pressure for the encoding gene to become transcriptionally fused with other cyclase encoding genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Chemistry methods and materials</title><p id="Par24">Unless stated otherwise all chemicals were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific.
