The enzyme provides a branch from the standard electron transport chain by transferring electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen. In standard laboratory strains, <italic>aod-1</italic> is transcribed at very low levels under normal growth conditions. However, if the standard electron transport chain is disrupted, a<italic>od-1</italic> mRNA expression is induced and the AOD1 protein is produced. We previously identified a strain of <italic>N. crassa</italic>, that produces high levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript under non-inducing conditions. Here we have crossed this strain to a standard lab strain and determined the genomic sequences of the parents and several progeny. Analysis of the sequence data and the levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA in uninduced cultures revealed that a frameshift mutation in the <italic>flbA</italic> gene results in the high uninduced expression of <italic>aod-1</italic>. The <italic>flbA</italic> gene encodes a regulator of G protein signaling that decreases the activity of the G&#x003b1; subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Our data suggest that strains with a functional <italic>flbA</italic> gene prevent uninduced expression of <italic>aod-1</italic> by inactivating a G protein signaling pathway, and that this pathway is activated in cells grown under conditions that induce <italic>aod-1</italic>. Induced cells with a deletion of the gene encoding the G&#x003b1; protein still have a partial increase in <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA levels, suggesting a second pathway for inducing transcription of the gene in <italic>N. crassa</italic>.

To achieve proper mitochondrial biogenesis, communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is required to coordinate the expression of genes found in the two organelles. Since the vast majority of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are found in the nucleus, changes in the functional status of mitochondria must be communicated to the nucleus to modulate the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins according to specific conditions. Communication from the mitochondria to the nucleus has been termed retrograde regulation and has been shown to occur in many organisms (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Butow 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Jazwinski 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">da Cunha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cardamone <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guaragnella <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Isaac <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>).</p><p>The alternative oxidase (AOX) is a mitochondrial enzyme that is encoded in the nucleus. AOX transfers electrons from ubiquinol directly to molecular oxygen, thus bypassing complexes III and IV of the standard electron transport chain (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Vanlerberghe and McIntosh 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Joseph-Horne <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">McDonald 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Nargang and Kennell 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Vanlerberghe 2013</xref>). It is an interfacial membrane protein that localizes to the inner leaflet of the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Shiba <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">May <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). AOX is present in a wide range of species although it has not been identified in any higher animal (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">McDonald and Vanlerberghe 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">McDonald 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">McDonald 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Neimanis <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). In many organisms a variety of factors that affect mitochondrial function can induce transcription of the gene to high levels (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Vanlerberghe and McIntosh 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Joseph-Horne <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">McDonald 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Nargang and Kennell 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Vanlerberghe 2013</xref>). Thus, AOX serves as an excellent system for the study of retrograde regulation since disruption of mitochondrial function results in increased expression of the nuclear gene encoding AOX.</p><p>We have studied the regulation of AOX production in the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>. The organism contains two genes encoding AOX called <italic>aod-1</italic> and <italic>aod-3</italic>, although no conditions have been found that result in expression of <italic>aod-3</italic> (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Tanton <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). In standard laboratory strains the <italic>aod-1</italic> gene is transcribed at very low levels when the organism is grown in normal growth media. However, induction of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcription and translation of the mRNA occurs when cells are grown in the presence of inhibitors that affect the function of the standard mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as antimycin A or cyanide (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lambowitz and Slayman 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Henry and Nyns 1975</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bertrand <italic>et al.</italic> 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lambowitz <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Tanton <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). The expression of <italic>aod-1</italic> and production of the AOD1 protein are also increased in strains carrying mutations that affect standard electron transport chain function (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Tissieres <italic>et al.</italic> 1953</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lambowitz <italic>et al.</italic> 1972</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bertrand <italic>et al.</italic> 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). Growth in the presence of chloramphenicol (Cm) also increases <italic>aod-1</italic> expression since it indirectly affects the standard electron transport chain by inhibiting mitochondrial (but not cytosolic) protein synthesis, thus reducing the levels of standard electron transport chain complexes that contain mitochondrial-encoded subunits (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lambowitz and Slayman 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Nargang and Kennell 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>N. crassa</italic>, several genes required for <italic>aod-1</italic> expression have been identified (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bertrand <italic>et al.</italic> 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Nargang <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). The best studied of these are called <italic>aod-2</italic> and <italic>aod-5</italic>. Gene rescue experiments, sequencing, and bioinformatics revealed that <italic>aod-2</italic> and <italic>aod-5</italic> encode zinc cluster transcription factors (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chae <italic>et al.</italic> 2007b</xref>). These factors bind constitutively as a heterodimer to an alternative oxidase induction motif (AIM) that exists in the promoter region of the <italic>aod-1</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chae <italic>et al.</italic> 2007a</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Transcription of <italic>aod-1</italic> is induced in response to an unknown signal(s) generated when the standard electron transport chain is disrupted. In the absence of either <italic>aod-2</italic> or <italic>aod-5</italic>, the induction of <italic>aod-1</italic> is essentially eliminated (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Tanton <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chae <italic>et al.</italic> 2007a</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chae <italic>et al.</italic> 2007b</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chae and Nargang 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Orthologs of the AOD2 and AOD5 proteins exist in other fungi and have been shown to be required for AOX induction in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) and <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bovier <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Thus, the AOD2 and AOD5 proteins are directly involved in control of <italic>aod-1</italic> expression.</p><p>However, there is evidence that additional factors play a role in <italic>aod-1</italic> expression. Several other genes were identified as being required for full <italic>aod-1</italic> expression during an examination of the <italic>N. crassa</italic> single gene deletion library (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Colot <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Nargang <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) and in a genetic screen for regulatory mutants unable to induce the enzyme (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Furthermore, during the development of a reporter strain for use in the screen for regulatory mutants, we serendipitously identified a <italic>N. crassa</italic> strain (called T1P11) carrying a mutant tyrosinase gene that consistently had high levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA in non-inducing conditions, though no AOD1 protein was produced (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Although the tyrosinase gene is required for the synthesis of melanin (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kupper <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>) it was conceivable that loss of the gene might affect <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript levels. To determine if the tyrosinase mutation was responsible for the upregulation, a cross between T1P11 and a wild-type strain with low levels of uninduced transcript (NCN233) was performed. Analysis of the progeny revealed that the tyrosinase mutation and the high levels of uninduced <italic>aod-1</italic> transcripts segregated independently (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In the present work we have confirmed this result and have shown that other genes known to affect <italic>aod-1</italic> expression are not altered in T1P11. To identify the gene(s) causing the effect, we determined the genomic sequence of T1P11, NCN233, and progeny from a cross between these two strains. Our analysis revealed that a frameshift mutation in a the <italic>flbA</italic> gene, which encodes a Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS protein), is responsible for the increased expression of <italic>aod-1</italic> in non-inducing conditions.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Handling and growth of N. crassa strains</title><p><xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists the strains used in this study.

Briefly, conidia for growing liquid cultures were produced by inoculating conidia in the center of 250 ml or 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 or 25 ml, respectively, of Vogel&#x02019;s salts, 1.5% sucrose, trace elements, and biotin (VSuTB). Medium was solidified with 1.5% agar. Any additional supplements were added as required. The most commonly used supplement was pantothenic acid at a final concentration of 10 mg/liter. Flasks were incubated for two to three days at 30&#x000b0; and then placed at room temperature to allow conidiation to occur in a well-lit room for four to five days. Conidia were used up to 10 days after their formation. Stocks were maintained on agar slants containing VSuTB, plus any required supplements, and kept frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Strains used in this study</title></caption><table frame="void" rules="groups"><col width="19.71%" span="1"/><col width="36.36%" span="1"/><col width="21.21%" span="1"/><col width="22.72%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th valign="top" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Origin</th><th valign="top" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype</th><th valign="top" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Uninduced <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>NCN233</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nargang lab</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>pan-1</italic>, <italic>A</italic></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">low</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>T1P11</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S.

The mixture was transferred to a tube for the Sorvall SA-600 rotor (Sorvall, Mandel Scientific, Guelph) for later use in centrifugation. The mixture was then brought to 10 ml with New Isolation buffer, and covered with parafilm. The tubes were shaken vigorously, inverted slowly for approximately 1 min, then incubated in a 70&#x000b0; water bath for 1 hr. Tubes were then placed on ice for 10 min, after which 0.64 ml of 8 M potassium acetate pH 6.0, was added to each tube. The samples were left on ice for 1 hr.

The tubes were shaken vigorously for 1 min and centrifuged for 1 min at maximum speed in a Sorvall Biofuge pico centrifuge (Sorvall, Mandel Scientific, Guelph). The top layer was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and the phenol/chloroform extraction procedure was repeated once more. To precipitate final genomic DNA, one tenth volume of 3M sodium acetate, as well as three volumes of 95% ethanol were added to the Eppendorf tube and mixed.

The vcf file was also exported to Microsoft Excel using the delimited column data format with &#x0201c;tab&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;space&#x0201d; as the delimiters. This resulted in an Excel table where changes present in each strain, relative to the reference sequence, were in separate columns. Other columns listed the supercontig, and numbered the position of each change (according to the reference sequence) and the actual sequence change. The sites of mutations occurring in any strain were listed in columns corresponding to each strain. In these columns, each cell contained a binary system where, at a specific position in the genome, a &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; indicated a match to the reference sequence in a given strain while a &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; indicated a change relative to the reference sequence for that strain.</p><p>In the Excel sheet, conditional formatting criteria was applied to columns corresponding to each strain to allow for filtering of the data. Conditional formatting involved the creation of a &#x0201c;New Rule&#x0201d; in the &#x0201c;Classic&#x0201d; style from the drop-down menu. Columns for all strains were formatted so that cells that began with &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; were designated a color, for example, pink. Cells that began with &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;, indicating positions that match the reference sequence, were kept white. This allowed a choice between seeing positions that matched the reference sequence (white) or positions that were different from the reference sequence (pink). Columns corresponding to the low <italic>aod-1</italic> expression strains (NCN233, 3, 4, and 6) were first filtered for white, indicating no change from the reference sequence at a certain position. Following this, high-expressing <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript strains (T1P11, 19, 23, 26) were analyzed on an individual basis. Each column corresponding to a high-expressing <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript strain was filtered for the color pink so as to select only variants. Variants fit the criteria of beginning with &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; and were designated a color. The positions of the variants were copied, and then pasted into another spreadsheet with a VBA (Visual Basics for Application) FindData code (explained below). Before moving onto a different high-expressing <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript strain, the variant color filter for the previous high-expressing strain was cleared. This was done so as to not select for variants that are present in different high expressing strains, allowing a full list of variants to be generated independently of other variants in other high-expressing strains. A filter for low-expressing strains remained at &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; for the entire filtering analysis in Excel to ensure that no changes present in high-expressing strains would also be present in low-expressing strains.</p><p>To analyze the positions of variants in each strain, a VBA code, which we named &#x0201c;FindData&#x0201d;, was written in a different Excel spreadsheet (Figure S1) and took the position of the change in question and searched through the list of known coding regions in the <italic>N. crassa</italic> genome in the supercontigs transcript annotation file (assembly 10) from the BROAD Institute. The filtering process described above resulted in a list of positions with changes in only high-expressing strains throughout the genome, including non-coding regions, coding regions, and UTRs. If the position was in the coding region of a protein coding gene, the program would list the NCU number of the gene. One chromosome was examined at a time to meet Excel&#x02019;s RAM restrictions. A list of NCU numbers with changes in coding regions was generated for each strain expressing high levels of uninduced <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript (T1P11, 19, 23, and 26).

We previously reported (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) that a tyrosinase gene (gene symbol <italic>T</italic>, mutant allele <italic>T</italic><sup>-</sup>, wild type allele <italic>T<sup>+</sup></italic>) mutant strain named T1P11 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fuentes <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>) and a derivative reporter strain (T11-76), made by transformation of T1P11 with a reporter construct, had high levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript following growth in non-inducing conditions compared to standard wild-type lab strains. Despite the presence of this mRNA, no AOD1 protein was detected in the mitochondria of T11-76 under non-inducing conditions. These observations raised two questions. Why were relatively high levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA produced in the absence of inducing conditions in this strain and; why was no AOD1 protein observed in the strain as a result of the high levels of mRNA?</p><p>Previously, analysis of a cross between T1P11 and a strain (NCN233) with a wild type tyrosinase gene, and the typically low levels of uninduced <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA, showed that the high uninduced <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript levels in T1P11 did not segregate with the mutant allele of the tyrosinase gene (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). However, following this previous analysis, the progeny of this original cross were lost. To verify the previous data, and to generate strains for further analysis, we repeated the cross and analyzed 11 progeny strains. The presence of the <italic>T</italic><sup>-</sup> or <italic>T<sup>+</sup></italic> allele was evaluated in the progeny by PCR amplification and sequencing of the region of the <italic>T</italic> gene known to contain mutations induced by repeat induced point mutation (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Selker 1990</xref>) in the <italic>T</italic><sup>-</sup> allele (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Progeny strains (referred to by their isolation numbers) 3, 4, 19, 34, and 36 were wild-type (<italic>T<sup>+</sup></italic>) for the tyrosinase gene, while strains 6, 9, 16, 23, 26, and 33 carried the mutated (<italic>T</italic><sup>-</sup>) allele of the tyrosinase gene (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We then determined the levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA present in the parental and progeny strains by qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the control strain contained roughly ten-fold the amount of <italic>aod</italic>-1 mRNA when grown in inducing conditions (+Cm) relative to non-inducing (-Cm) conditions. However, uninduced cultures of strain T1P11 contained levels of mRNA approaching the induced level in control cells. Furthermore, induced T1P11 cultures had about three times more <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA than induced control cells. Examination of AOD1 protein levels in the parental strains confirmed that no AOD1 protein could be detected in uninduced T1P11, despite the high levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also showed that the increased level of mRNA seen in induced T1P11 cells gave rise to more AOD1 protein than found in induced control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For the progeny strains there was a range of uninduced mRNA expression levels. We arbitrarily defined progeny that had greater than 3.5 times the level of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA present in uninduced control cells as having &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; expression (progeny strains 9, 16, 19, 23 and 26), while progeny with below 3.5 times the level of uninduced control cell mRNA were designated as having &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; expression (progeny strains 3, 4, 6, 33, 34, 36). With respect to the traits of tyrosinase (<italic>T<sup>+</sup></italic>or <italic>T</italic><sup>-</sup>) and <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA levels (high or low), the cross yielded four parental, high <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA, <italic>T</italic><sup>-</sup> progeny (9, 16, 23 and 26) and four parental, low <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA <italic>T<sup>+</sup></italic> progeny (3, 4, 34, and 36). However, recombinant types were also recovered. Strain 19, which is <italic>T<sup>+</sup></italic>, had elevated levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript, while strains 6 and 33, which are <italic>T</italic><sup>-</sup>, had low levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data agree with the previous conclusion that the state of the tyrosinase gene is not responsible for the uninduced high level of expression of <italic>aod-1</italic> that is observed in some strains (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In addition, although the number of progeny analyzed was low, the finding that six progeny had low levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcripts, while five had high levels, suggested that the expression level phenotype is determined by a single gene. However, given the arbitrary designation of high and low expression, and the low number of progeny examined, we cannot exclude the possibility that more than one gene may contribute to uninduced <italic>aod-1</italic> expression.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>aod-1</italic> transcript levels in the standard laboratory strain NCN233 as a control (ct), T1P11, and progeny from a cross of the two strains indicated by the strain isolation number (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Since the transcription factors are considered to be constitutively bound to the promoter of the genes they regulate (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) a change in the amino acid sequence of AOD2 or AOD5 could be responsible for the production of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA seen in T1P11.

The change occurs at position -815 relative to the A of the ATG start codon taken as position +1. It seems very unlikely that a change in the 5&#x02032;UTR of <italic>aod-5</italic> could cause the protein to become constitutively active.

Three of these were single nucleotide G to A changes in the 3&#x02032;UTR. The fourth was also a G to A transition that occurred in the coding region of exon 3 or 4, depending on the splice variant considered. The latter transition would result in an amino acid change from aspartic acid to asparagine at residue 740 of the 743 residue protein, or 906 of the 909 residue protein, depending on the splice variant.

FlbA is an RGS protein that interacts with the G&#x003b1; protein of heterotrimeric G proteins. G protein signaling is known to play a role in a number of cellular processes in a large number of organisms (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Neves <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Syrovatkina <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Vijayakumar 2018</xref>). Briefly, the typical signaling cascade consists of a heterotrimeric G protein complex that contains G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>, G<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>, and G<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> subunits, which exists in an inactive state associated with a GPCR (G protein coupled receptor) that is localized to the cell membrane. In this inactive state, GDP is bound to the G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> subunit. Upon interaction of the GPCR with an extracellular ligand, GDP is exchanged for GTP on the G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> subunit. This results in the dissociation of the heterotrimer from the GPCR and the further dissociation of G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> from G<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>G<sub>&#x003b3;</sub>. In their dissociated forms, both G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> and G<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>G<sub>&#x003b3;</sub>, are able to regulate downstream effectors. Eventually, a GTPase activity carried on the G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> subunit converts the bound GTP to GDP and restores G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> to its inactive form, which also enables rebinding and inactivation of G<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>G<sub>&#x003b3;</sub>. RGS proteins interact with the G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> subunit and accelerate its native GTPase activity, thus reducing the time that G protein signaling would be active. Both the <italic>N. crassa</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic> FLBA proteins contain an RGS domain as well as two DEP (disheveled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domains (Figure S3) (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). The RGS domain is required for interaction with G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> proteins (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Ross and Wilkie 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Siderovski and Willard 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Soundararajan <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kosloff <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). DEP domains have been shown to promote association of proteins with the cell membrane, but may also promote association with specific GPCRs so that a given RGS protein might be localized to sites that contain its substrate G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> protein (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ballon <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Hamm 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Consonni <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>The change in common to the four overexpressing strains in the <italic>flbA</italic> gene was a single C-G base pair deletion in exon 2 (codon 320) or exon 3 (codon 336), depending on the splice variant of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). None of the strains expressing low levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript contained the mutation. The deletion would result in a frameshift in the coding sequence leading to the creation of a stop codon and truncation of the encoded protein from 766 amino acids to 375 amino acids for splice variant 1, or 750 amino acids to 359 amino acids for variant 2. This mutation would have a drastic effect on the function of the protein given that both the RGS and DEP domains would be lost (Figure S3). Since the normal function of RGS proteins is to accelerate the GTPase activity found in the G&#x003b1; subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, inactivation of the RGS protein would result in prolonged activity of the active GTP bound form of G&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Data supporting the effect of the flbA mutation on aod-1 transcript levels</title><p>The Neurospora genome project (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Colot <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) has reported an abnormal morphology at the edge of the mycelium of <italic>flbA</italic> deletion strains growing on plates at 37&#x000b0; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fungidb.org/fungidb/">http://fungidb.org/fungidb/</ext-link>).

Directly relevant to our study is a result from a microarray analysis on an <italic>A. niger &#x00394;flbA</italic> strain which found that one of the top 50 upregulated genes in the <italic>&#x00394;flbA</italic> background was the <italic>A. niger</italic> AOX-encoding gene, <italic>aox1</italic> (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Krijgsheld and W&#x000f6;sten 2013</xref>). This observation supports the hypothesis that the frameshift mutation found in the <italic>flbA</italic> gene in the high <italic>aod-1</italic> expressing strains of <italic>N. crassa</italic> is responsible for the upregulation. To further test this hypothesis, we examined strains lacking the <italic>flbA</italic> gene from the <italic>N. crassa</italic> single gene deletion library (FGSC strains 12372 and 12373, <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) for levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript in non-inducing conditions and found elevated <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript levels as observed in T1P11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that loss of function of the <italic>flbA</italic> gene is responsible for the high uninduced levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA in strain T1P11 and other high expressing strains.</p><p>The results described above suggested that loss of the RGS protein encoded by the <italic>flbA</italic> gene resulted in a G&#x003b1; protein that is active for a longer time, which would further lead to an increase in <italic>aod-1</italic> transcripts. Thus, it would be predicted that loss of the G&#x003b1; protein controlled by the FLBA protein should lead to a reduction of <italic>aod-1</italic> expression.

Deletion <italic>flbA</italic> strains were found to have uncontrolled growth, inability to form conidiophores, and to accumulate undifferentiated aerial hyphae that are subject to autolysis (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Adams 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Wieser <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). Changes in the production of secondary metabolites (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hicks <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aerts <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>) and in the secretome (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krijgsheld <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) have also been described. The transcriptome study that revealed the up regulation of AOX transcripts in the <italic>flbA</italic> mutant also identified twofold or greater changes in expression of 1152 different genes, including 38 that were predicted to encode transcription factors (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Krijgsheld and W&#x000f6;sten 2013</xref>). However, the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> orthologs of AOD2 and AOD5 were not among the transcription factors with altered expression.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>flbA</italic> in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> has been found to have effects on a number of processes, including increased expression of the GliT protein (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Yu 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Shin <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), which is required for both synthesis and self resistance to gliotoxin (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Schrettl <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). In addition, an increase in expression of catalase and an increase in intracellular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were noted. These proteins play a role in coping with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, an <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> strain expressing a constitutively active GpaA (the ortholog of the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> G&#x003b1; protein FadA), also had higher expression of the catalase encoding genes <italic>cat1</italic> and <italic>cat2</italic> (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Yu 2013</xref>), supporting the notion that the effects seen in the <italic>flbA</italic> deletion strain are mediated via the G protein signaling system. These observations led to the proposal that the FlbA protein and a G protein regulatory circuit are involved in signaling that affects the cell&#x02019;s response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Yu 2013</xref>). Interestingly, AOX has also been shown to have a role in responding to ROS in many fungi, especially in pathogenic species where ROS are generated as a defense mechanism by the host (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Yukioka <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akhter <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Magnani <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">C&#x000e1;rdenas-Monroy <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Conceivably, AOX may be another factor in an overall G protein regulatory circuit that responds to ROS in such fungi. However, it seems unlikely that ROS are involved in activating a similar system in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, since strains expressing constitutively active GNA1 protein have increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Borkovich 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our findings that the knockout of <italic>gna-1</italic> has decreased levels of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA in inducing conditions, while the <italic>flbA</italic> mutation gives rise to increased expression in non-inducing conditions, argues that a classic G protein signaling pathway plays a role in <italic>aod-1</italic> expression in <italic>N. crassa</italic>. This further implies that an extracellular signal may be influencing <italic>aod-1</italic> expression, since the signaling pathway should be induced by an extracellular ligand binding to a GPCR. We do not know the nature of this signal, nor do we know the downstream effector that is influenced by the active GNA1 G&#x003b1; protein. The most likely possibilities for the latter may be cascades involving either cAMP or mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Won <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>One gene identified in an <italic>A. fumigatus flbA</italic> deletion study suggests a link to the expression of AOX encoding genes in various fungi. The <italic>acuF</italic> gene, which encodes phophoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a key gluconeogenic enzyme, was found to be upregulated in the <italic>flbA</italic> deletion strain (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Shin <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, expression of <italic>acuF</italic> is known to require the transcription factors AcuK and AcuM, which are also required for transcription of the AOX encoding gene (<italic>aodA</italic>) (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). AcuK and AcuM are the orthologs of <italic>N. crassa</italic> AOD2 and AOD5, which are required for transcription of both <italic>aod-1</italic> and the gene encoding PEPCK (<italic>acu-6</italic>) in <italic>N. crassa</italic> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chae <italic>et al.</italic> 2007b</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Similarly, expression of the genes encoding PEPCK and AOX in <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> requires the orthologs of AOD2 and AOD5 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bovier <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that one of the effects mediated by the active G&#x003b1; protein results is the activation of the AOD2 and AOD5 transcription factors (or their orthologs).</p><p>Is the G protein signaling system entirely responsible for the upregulation of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcription in inducing conditions? Although our measurements of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript levels, especially in highly expressing strains, were subject to variation, we generally observed less <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA in uninduced <italic>flbA</italic> mutant strains than in induced wild type strains. In addition, more <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript was present when we examined <italic>flbA</italic> mutants grown under inducing conditions compared to the same strain in non-inducing condtions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). These observations could be interpreted as a second signaling system playing an additive role under inducing conditions, but could also reflect a fuller activation of the G protein system in inducing conditions. However, the observation that the <italic>&#x00394;gna-1</italic> strain, grown under inducing conditions, still contains significantly more <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript than uninduced wild type strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), argues for a second system of transcriptional control in addition to that using the G&#x003b1; protein GNA1.</p><p>As stated above, we have noted variation in <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript levels in high expressing strains as shown by the range of values and larger error bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). One possible explanation for this observation relates to the spatial transcriptome study in the <italic>&#x00394;flbA</italic> mutant strain of <italic>A. niger</italic> (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Krijgsheld and W&#x000f6;sten 2013</xref>). Transcript levels were measured in three different concentric zones of colony growth on agar plates: zone 1 was the oldest, central-most zone, zone 3 was the intermediate zone, and zone 5 was the youngest, most peripheral zone. The level of upregulation of <italic>aox1</italic> varied between zones. In the central zone, the expression of <italic>aox1</italic> was increased about sixfold over wild-type, in the intermediate zone expression was almost ninefold higher and at the periphery of growth about 19 fold higher than wild type. The cultures from which RNA was extracted for our qPCR analysis of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript levels, were liquid cultures. Typically, the total culture amounted to about 8 g wet weight when harvested, but only 100 mg from these cultures was used for RNA extraction. The larger culture would consist of both young hyphal regions at growing tips as well as older regions where growth had initiated. There was no distinction between such regions used for RNA extraction. If a pattern of expression relating to age of the mycelium exists in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, as it does in <italic>A. niger</italic>, then simple random sampling may have played a role in generating the variability due to different ages of the mycelia that were taken.</p><p>We previously noted that the higher level of <italic>aod-1</italic> transcripts in uninduced cultures of strain T1P11 do not give rise to detectable AOD1 protein (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Descheneau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Here we have shown that this is usually the case, but such cultures may occasionally contain low levels of AOD1 protein. However, even in such cases, the levels of protein detected were much lower than the amount predicted based on transcript levels when compared to induced wild type cells. This argues for the existence of a post-transcriptional control mechanism that responds to inducing conditions to allow translation of the message. Since the G protein signal resulting in increased transcription of <italic>aod-1</italic> under non-inducing conditions in <italic>flbA</italic> mutants does not give rise to efficient translation of the message, this implies that an additional signal, produced under inducing conditions, is required for translation.</p><p>In summary, our results support the view that there are at least three systems of control for production of the AOD1 AOX protein in <italic>N. crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Two systems appear to activate <italic>aod-1</italic> transcription. One is a G protein regulatory circuit that responds to an unknown signal produced when the function of the standard electron transport chain in mitochondria is compromised. Since the <italic>gna-1</italic> deletion strain grown under inducing conditions contains more <italic>aod-1</italic> transcript than uninduced wild type strains, this implies the existence of a second transcriptional regulatory system that also responds to a signal produced when the standard electron transport chain is compromised. Finally, since the excess <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA produced under non-inducing conditions in mutant <italic>flbA</italic> strains is not efficiently translated, it appears there is a system for activation of translation of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA, which is also generated when the standard electron transport chain is compromised. Further investigation will be aimed at the nature of the signaling molecules and the interplay between the different systems of control.</p><fig id="fig7" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Summary of control of AOX production in <italic>N. crassa</italic>. The heterotrimeric G&#x003b1;G&#x003b2;G&#x003b3; protein is shown bound to the membrane spanning GPCR. GDP (yellow) is bound to the G&#x003b1; subunit. Upon binding an unknown ligand, which could be formed in the growth medium or secreted from inside the cell during inducing conditions, GDP is exchanged for GTP (green) and G&#x003b1; dissociates from the membrane and from G&#x003b2;G&#x003b3;. In this active state G&#x003b1; acts on a downstream effector, possibly giving rise to increased cAMP levels or MAPK activity. Either of these might serve to activate the AOD2/AOD5 transcription factors. In normal cells grown under non-inducing conditions, the activity of G&#x003b1; would be short lived, as the RGS protein FLBA (blue) would stimulate the GTPase activity of G&#x003b1; and restore it to the inactive GDP bound state. However, in the <italic>flbA</italic> mutant strains, G&#x003b1; activity would persist for much longer times. A separate signal(s) arising from poorly functioning mitochondria may also directly or indirectly activate transcription via AOD/AOD5. Similarly, a signal(s) produced under inducing conditions results in the translation of <italic>aod-1</italic> mRNA into the AOX AOD1 protein, which is then translocated into mitochondria.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3453f7"/></fig></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the Kirst King-Jones lab for instructions and use of the StepOnePlus RT-PCR system and to John Locke for supplying the cell phone photography adaptor.
