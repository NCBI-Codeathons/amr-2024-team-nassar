that, upon reduction by bioreductants such as glutathione, induces
an intramolecular hetero-Michael addition at C-9 (Figure 1B).7−9 The resulting fused enediyne core ring strain invokes
a spontaneous cycloaromatization reaction which proceeds via a highly
reactive diradical intermediate that is rapidly quenched by any suitable
hydrogen source.7,10 Calicheamicin’s high affinity
for the minor groove of DNA, by virtue of its aryltetrasaccharide,
insures that the diradical species is quenched via hydrogen abstraction
from the backbone of opposing strands of dsDNA to form DNA radicals
that, in the presence of oxygen, result in facile double-strand scission.11−13 The study of calicheamicin’s many fascinating architectural
and functional facets have led to numerous discoveries/advances in
