To interpret the role of the three resistance proteins encoded in the lincomycin BGC, we first evaluated the contribution of the individual proteins to the resistance. Specifically, we knocked out lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC singly or in pairs in the lincomycin-producing S. lincolnensis wild-type (WT) strain (Fig. 1b) and, in addition, we complemented the genes under the control of a constitutive or natural promoter acting in trans (see Fig. S1). Furthermore, we constitutively expressed the genes in a lincosamide-sensitive Streptomyces coelicolor M1154 strain (26) (Fig. 1c). Then, we evaluated the resistance phenotype of the WT, knockout, and complemented strains by determining the MICs of lincomycin and its derivative, clindamycin. We revealed that all strains bearing lmrA, including the strains with lmrA only (Fig. 1b, S. lincolnensis strains WT, ΔC, ΔB, and ΔBC; Fig. 1c, S. coelicolor strains ACC and AC), were highly or extremely resistant to lincomycin, while the resistance to lincomycin significantly decreased when lmrA was absent regardless of other two resistance genes were present. Interestingly, the resistance to clindamycin, generally a more efficient semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, is different in this respect. Specifically, the majority of the tested strains were moderately resistant to clindamycin with no or little contribution of LmrA to the resistance (Fig. 1b, compares the strains differing in lmrA only: ΔB versus ΔAB, WT versus ΔA, and ΔC versus ΔAC, and Fig. 1c, AC versus M1154+pIJ10257). Therefore, we assume that LmrA, a transporter of the major facilitator family, is highly specific to lincomycin but not clindamycin, and it ensures sufficient self-resistance to the produced lincomycin on its own. In contrast to the LmrA transporter, the LmrB 23S rRNA monomethyltransferase confers high resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin when overexpressed in S. coelicolor (Fig. 1c, BCC and BC). However, when naturally expressed in S. lincolnensis, it confers a significant level of resistance to clindamycin alone (Fig. 1b, compares strains differing only in lmrB: WT versus ΔB, ΔC versus ΔBC, and ΔA versus ΔAB). The last resistance protein, LmrC, confers moderate resistance to both lincomycin and clindamycin when overexpressed in S. coelicolor (Fig. 1c, strain CC). However, its contribution to the overall resistance in S. lincolnensis is not considerable relative to either LmrB (Fig. 1b, compares strains ΔA versus ΔAC) or LmrA (Fig. 1b, compares strains ΔB versus ΔBC). The ΔC knockout strain without lmrC showed a slightly increased lincosamide resistance compared to that of the WT (Fig. 1b). It is worth noting that the complementation of the knockout strains under the control of the putative natural promoter restored the resistance phenotype of the WT except for lmrB (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). In this case, complementation had to be performed under the control of a constitutive promoter because lmrB is cotranscribed with three upstream genes, as evidenced below. Interestingly, constitutive lmrB expression resulted in higher resistance values than those of lmrB expression in its original genomic context (see Fig. S1). Furthermore, the resistance of S. lincolnensis WT and knockout strains was determined from spore suspension, which does necessarily reflect the resistance of the mycelium during lincomycin production. Therefore, we determined the MICs of S. lincolnensis deletion strains using spores and mycelia from two different time points of the seed or production cultures (see Fig. S1). Overall, the data for mycelia comply with the data obtained for spores and show that resistance of the mycelium during production increased compared to the mycelium from the seed culture. Apart from investigating the resistance phenotypes, we determined the amount of lincomycin produced by S. lincolnensis WT and single-knockout strains in the culture broth (Fig. 1b). The results support our conclusions drawn from the resistance of the strains. Specifically, the strains with high or extreme resistance to lincomycin were able to produce considerable levels of lincomycin, i.e., the strains bearing both lmrA and lmrB (which had the largest amount of lincomycin produced) and the strain bearing lmrA and not lmrB (which had up to 50% of the largest amount of lincomycin produced). On the other hand, strains without lmrA, which were the least resistant to lincomycin, produced only traces of lincomycin or nothing. The dispensability of LmrC for the overall resistance documented above complies with the comparable lincomycin production of ΔC versus WT strains. In addition, the production of lincomycin significantly fluctuated (Fig. 1b). This observation could be explained by a more complex regulation-resistance system (LmbU, LmrA, LmrB, and LmrC) encoded within the lincomycin BGC compared to the highly similar BGC of another lincosamide, celesticetin (12), which contains only one nonbiosynthetic gene, the ccr1, coding for Ccr1 23S rRNA monomethyltransferase, as a self-protecting resistance protein homologous to LmrB (Fig. 1a) (for a review, see reference 27). Indeed, the fluctuation of celesticetin produced by S. caelestis in parallel cultures is not as pronounced as that of the lincomycin produced by S. lincolnensis. Moreover, S. caelestis never failed to produce celesticetin (Fig. 1d), while S. lincolnensis failed to produce lincomycin in several parallel WT cultures (Fig. 1b). Expression of lmrA, lmrB, lmrC, and lmbU is induced by clindamycin. Given our hypothesis of the complex regulation-resistance system of lincomycin production, we wondered whether the expression of any of the lmbU, lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC genes could be affected by the produced antibiotic. Therefore, we cultured S. lincolnensis WT and divided the culture before the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis into two parallel cultures, one of which was supplemented with clindamycin at a subinhibitory concentration (Fig. 2a). At several time points, we semiquantitatively monitored the expression of the respective genes by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Supplementation with clindamycin allowed us to distinguish between the lincosamide used to study its effect on the gene expression and the lincosamide produced by the strain, which we determined by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography. FIG 2Clindamycin induces the expression of all lincomycin BGC-encoded resistance genes as well as lmbU encoding a transcriptional regulator and accelerates lincomycin production. (a) Representative results of RT-PCR and lincomycin LC-MS analyses (n = 6) show earlier transcription of lmrA, lmrB, lmrC, and lmbU genes and accelerated lincomycin production in S. lincolnensis WT after clindamycin supplementation at the eighth hour of culture (0.5 mg liter−1).

RT-PCR analysis of the lmrC-lmbU intergenic region shows that lmrC is transcribed independently of lmbUXY-lmrB operon. (a) RT-PCR mapping of the lmrC 3′ end transcript showed the presence of a transcription terminator immediately downstream of the lmrC STOP codon. (b) RT-PCR mapping of the lmbU start showed that in lmrC knockout (ΔC), lmbU is cotranscribed with the apramycin resistance gene. RT-PCR analyses were performed for total RNA isolated from WT and ΔC cultures induced or uninduced by clindamycin (0.5 mg liter−1; Fig. S6C). Download FIG S3, TIF file, 0.3 MB. The results in Fig. 2a show that supplementation with clindamycin induced the expression of all the studied genes—lmbU, lmrB, lmrA, and lmrC—in the earlier stages of growth (9 to 16 h) compared to that of the untreated cultures (44 to 104 h), while no effect of clindamycin was observed on the rpoD control. In agreement with this observation, the onset of lincomycin production also shifted toward an earlier time of cultivation (44 h) in the cultures supplemented with clindamycin and reached higher values at the end of production culture (Fig. 2b; see also Fig. S2). The transcription of lmrA was induced more readily and was detectable over a longer period, while the relative amount of lmrC, lmbU, and lmrB transcripts decreased over time. Similar profiles of lmrC, lmbU, and lmrB transcripts indicate that these genes might be in the same operon. Amplification of lmbU from the 1st DNA strand synthesized using a primer specific to lmrB demonstrated that the expression of lmrB is directly coupled with that of lmbU and the two biosynthetic genes lmbX and lmbY (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, an analogous mapping of the start of lmbU transcript (Fig. 2d) and the end of lmrC transcript (see Fig. S3a) showed that the lmrC gene is transcribed independently of the lmbUXY-lmrB operon. LmrC is essential for the antibiotic-induced onset of lincomycin production. Given the newly defined function of ABCF proteins as modulators of ribosomal PTC, the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics might be regulated by LmrC. To uncover the role of LmrC, we performed comparative mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of the mycelia of S. lincolnensis WT, WT+Cc, and ΔC strains grown in the absence or presence of clindamycin. As shown in Fig. 3a, clindamycin supplementation increased the abundance of lincomycin BGC proteins in both the WT (namely, proteins of the lmbUXYB operon) and WT+Cc (the whole BGC), while in the ΔC strain, lincomycin BGC proteins were more abundant in cultures without clindamycin. The induction by clindamycin was also observable at the lincomycin production level at 40 h in the WT+Cc strain but not in the ΔC knockout strain, where higher production levels were independent of clindamycin treatment (Fig. 3a). No lincomycin was detected in clindamycin supplemented WT cultures, which contradicts the experiment in Fig. 2a, where high levels of lincomycin were detected at the end of seed culture supplemented with clindamycin. Slight differences in cultivation conditions might be responsible for the shifted onset of lincomycin production between the two experiments (see Fig. S7b). Nevertheless, these results suggest that LmrC is required for the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis triggered by clindamycin. To confirm that LmrC is essential for the transduction of antibiotic signal to the expression of lincomycin BGC, we quantified the transcripts of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN genes in S. lincolnensis WT and ΔC cultured with or without clindamycin at a time point before lincomycin BGC expression. As shown in Fig. 3b, the clindamycin induced transcription of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN, which was not under the direct control of lmbU, in the WT strain but not in the lmrC-deficient ΔC knockout strain. Notably, the observed low-level constitutive transcription of lmbU in the ΔC strain can be explained by the insertion of apramycin cassette (see Fig. S3b), causing a polar effect. This phenomenon explains the increased production of proteins in ΔC (Fig. 3a). However, it is important for our reasoning that neither protein production nor lmbU transcription in the ΔC strain is affected by clindamycin. ABCF family proteins generally exhibit ATPase activity, which is required for protein function (22). Therefore, we wondered whether LmrC is a functional protein capable of ATPase activity that induces gene expression. Hence, we complemented the ΔC knockout strain with lmrC or lmrCEQ12 expressed from a theophylline-inducible plasmid (Ci). The overproduction of functional LmrC resulted in the expression of lmbU and lmbN, while the overproduction of ATPase-deficient LmrCEQ12 mutant did not have this effect (Fig. 3c). Notably, the expression of lmbU and lmbN mediated by the overproduction of LmrC was achieved without supplementation with clindamycin, and a similar phenomenon was observed at the protein level when LmrC was produced constitutively in the WT (the comparison of WT and WT+CC without clindamycin treatment is shown in Fig. 3a). Altogether, these results demonstrate that clindamycin induces the production of LmrC, which in turn induces the production of LmbU, which is a known activator of lincomycin biosynthesis (24). FIG 3Only ATPase-active LmrC is required for the induction of lmbU transcription by clindamycin. (a) Proteomic analysis showing the effect of LmrC and clindamycin on lincomycin biosynthesis and ABCF protein abundance. Ten independent cultures of each S. lincolnensis WT, WT constitutively expressing lmrC (WT+Cc), and lmrC knockout (ΔC) strain were cultured for 40 h in seed medium with or without clindamycin (CLI) and for another 120 h in production medium without clindamycin. Lincomycin production was quantified after 40 h and at the end of production culture (160 h).

Download Table S1, PDF file, 1.1 MB. The antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade is independent of other S. lincolnensis regulatory elements. Several recent studies described regulators of lincomycin biosynthesis encoded outside the BGC in the S. lincolnensis genome (28–31). Some of these conserved global regulators might be involved in the antibiotic-induced onset of lincomycin production in addition to LmrC. To rule out this hypothesis, we cloned the lincomycin BGC region starting upstream of lmrC and ending with lmbU translationally fused with the mCherry reporter (C-U-mCh) and introduced it into S. coelicolor M145. Truncated versions of the construct without the 5′-half lmrC (U-mCh) and lmbU-mCherry expressed from the constitutive ermEp promoter (UC-mCh) were used as controls (Fig. 3d). As expected, the induced production of the mCherry reporter in response to clindamycin was detected only in the strain with the full-length C-U-mCh construct, while in the strain with the truncated lmrC gene (U-mCh), the level of mCherry expression did not change after clindamycin induction. From these data, we concluded that lmbU expression, and thus the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics, is mainly triggered by lmrC. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that S. coelicolor homologs of global regulators that contribute to lincomycin biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis, such as AdpA and BldD (32, 33), also affect the expression of lmrC and lmbU in S. coelicolor. LmrC production is induced by the LSAP group of antibiotics and dampened by LmrA and LmrB. We have shown that the LmrC-induced transcription of lmbU is largely dependent on how LmrC production is regulated in response to antibiotics. To gain more insight into the regulation of LmrC production, we first tested whether the inducing antibiotics were limited only to clindamycin. For this purpose, we treated S. lincolnensis WT cells with a range of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and a cell wall-targeting carbenicillin, and we detected LmrC protein levels using an LmrC-specific antibody. In addition to clindamycin, only lincomycin (lincosamide group), pristinamycin IIA (streptogramin A group), and tiamulin (pleuromutilin group), with lower efficiency, induced LmrC production (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the activity of these lincosamide-streptogramin A-pleuromutilin (LSAP) antibiotics with overlapping binding sites on the ribosome (Fig. 4a) is compromised by antibiotic resistance ABCF proteins as exemplified by Vga(A)LC in staphylococci (18, 34, 35). This suggests that the regulation of LmrC production is coupled to its resistance function, which is the dislocation of the antibiotic from its specific overlapping binding sites within the PTC. Next, we investigated whether the lincomycin BGC-encoded resistance proteins LmrA and LmrB can affect the whole cascade by dampening lmrC expression. First, we evaluated LmrC protein levels in S. lincolnensis ΔB+B with constitutive overproduction of the LmrB methyltransferase. As shown in Fig. 4b, LmrC production no longer responded to lincomycin and clindamycin, which do not bind to ribosomes methylated by LmrB, but instead remained responsive to the treatment with pristinamycin IIA (streptogramin A group), which can bind to methylated ribosomes (36). Since the lmrB gene is in the lmbUXY-lmrB operon encoding biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 2c and d), LmrB is an ideal candidate to provide a feedback loop of the cascade. Indeed, pronounced induction of lincomycin production was apparent in strain ΔB compared to the WT, whereas in the ΔB+B strain, constitutive lmrB expression dampened the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis (Fig. 4c). FIG 4LmrC production and lincomycin biosynthesis are induced by LSAP antibiotics and dampened by LmrA and LmrB.

Download FIG S5, TIF file, 1.3 MB. Next, we evaluated the effect of LmrA on LmrC protein levels. Since LmrA confers high-level resistance only to lincomycin (Fig. 1b; see also Fig. S1), there was a considerably higher level of LmrC in the WT induced by clindamycin than in the WT induced by lincomycin (Fig. 4a and b), which may reflect the fact that only lincomycin is exported by the LmrA transporter; thus, the low intracellular levels are maintained (37). Indeed, deletion of lmrA (ΔA) resulted in comparable levels of LmrC expression induced by either lincomycin or clindamycin (Fig. 4d). LmrA thus specifically dampens the LmrC production induced by lincomycin by reducing its intracellular concentration. Since both LmrB and LmrA reduce lmrC expression in response to antibiotics, we propose that alongside their resistance function, they also serve as a negative feedback loop to the antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade of lincomycin biosynthesis. LmrC production is regulated by ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation. Substantially reduced production of LmrC in the lmrB-overexpression strain (Fig. 4b) after antibiotic induction showed that the binding of the antibiotic to the ribosome is a prerequisite for the induction of LmrC production. LmrC could thus be regulated by a ribosome-mediated attenuation mechanism as described previously for other antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins (38–40): in the absence of antibiotics, either the formation of a premature terminator in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) or the inaccessibility of ribosome binding site (RBS) prevent gene expression. In the presence of antibiotics, inhibited ribosomes stall during translation of the upstream regulatory open reading frame (uORF), which promotes the alteration of the 5′UTR secondary structure and thereby releases gene expression (41). Indeed, an in silico analysis of the lmrC upstream region revealed two putative promoters and two premature terminators with the ability to form alternative antiterminator conformations and several short uORFs (Fig. 5a). To examine whether the attenuation mechanism is involved in the control of lmrC expression, we first used RT-PCR to map from which of the two predicted promoters lmrC is transcribed and the position of the premature terminator (Fig. 5a). The analysis of RNA from the 16-h time point, where lmrC is induced by clindamycin, and from the 104-h time point, where lmrC transcription starts naturally without clindamycin supplementation (Fig. 2a), showed that in both cases, the lmrC transcript starts from promoter P1 (Fig. 5b). As shown in Fig. 5c, the position of the premature terminator was mapped to the region between primers RT 4 and 5, which corresponds to the position of the predicted terminator 1 (Fig. 5a). Next, we prepared a reporter system in which the lmrC upstream region, including its promoter, and full-length lmrC were translationally fused to mCherry (C-mCh). We introduced the construct into S. lincolnensis WT and S. coelicolor M145 strains and determined mCherry levels with or without clindamycin (see Fig. S5d). The mCherry-specific signal was detected only in the presence of clindamycin in both strains, so further experiments were performed in S. coelicolor M145. A series of G-to-C and C-to-G point mutations (see Fig. S6a) in the terminator hairpin led to the disruption and restoration of clindamycin-induced C-mCh production, confirming the terminator prediction (Fig. 5d). To localize the uORF, we mutated the start codons of four upstream ORFs (ATG to ATC or ATG to AAG; Fig. S6a). Surprisingly, only the disruption of uORF2, which partially overlaps with the terminator, led to strong constitutive expression of C-mCh, whereas mutations in other ORFs did not affect C-mCh production (Fig. 5d). This observation suggests an unusual attenuation mechanism in which uORF2 translation is required to form a terminator structure. In summary, the antibiotic-mediated control of lmrC expression occurs via the formation of a premature terminator structure, which prevents lmrC expression in the absence of an antibiotic. LSAP antibiotics, if bound to PTC, trigger the shift from the terminator to the antiterminator conformation, enabling lmrC transcription (see Fig. S6a). The lmrC transcript, specifically its attenuator, is thus the primary sensor of the antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade for lincomycin biosynthesis. FIG 5LmrC production is regulated by a ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation mechanism. (a) An in silico analysis of the lmrC 5′UTR indicates the presence of two promoters predicted by NNPP (74) and G4PromFinder (75) with NNPP probability scores of 0.83 and 0.89 for P1 and P2, respectively, two transcriptional terminators predicted by PASIFIC (Prediction of Alternative Structures for Identification of Cis-regulation) (41) with PASIFIC scores of 0.71 and 0.44 for terminators 1 and 2, respectively, and four putative regulatory uORFs. The RT-PCR mapping strategy used to validate promoter and terminator predictions is shown. (b to d) The results of RT-PCR mapping (n = 3) show that lmrC is transcribed from the P1 promoter both after the addition of clindamycin (16 h, CLI) (b) and at the natural start of lmrC transcription (104 h, –no ATB) (c), lmrC transcript is prematurely terminated in the absence of clindamycin in the region between RT primers 4 and 5, thus validating the terminator 1 prediction. (d) Mutational analysis of the 5′UTR of lmrC validates the proposed ribosome-mediated attenuation mechanism. Western blot analysis of the LmrC-mCherry (C-mCh) reporter with unmutated (WT) or mutated lmrC 5′UTR was performed. Mutations within the predicted terminator disrupted (C»G and G»C) and reconstituted (G»C and C»G) the CLI-inducible production of C-mCh, while the mutagenesis of start codons of the predicted uORFs (ATG»AAG) identified uORF2 to be important for antibiotic-induced lmrC expression. The ensemble diversity of the shown secondary structures indicates the average base-pair distance in each mutated terminator loop. The positions of the individual mutations are depicted in attenuator models (see Fig. S6a). Summary data of the Western blot analysis of independent experiments are shown in Fig. S6b.

Mutational analysis of lmrC RNA cis-regulatory element. (a) Two mutually exclusive structures of putative attenuator 1 were predicted by the PASIFIC algorithm with a score of 0.71. Key regulatory regions include the anti-terminator in orange, terminator in green/blue, and a short uORF of 16 amino acids (yellow) encoded in a region that encompasses the terminator region. The positions of triple G-to-C and C-to-G mutations that were created to disrupt the terminator stem are marked by red and blue arrows, respectively. The positions of point mutations in start codons of putative uORFs are marked by gray and yellow arrows. Mutations in the terminator stem changed the amino acid sequence of uORF2 as indicated. (b) Summary of Western blot analyses (at least three observations for each strain) shows the effect of mutations depicted in Fig. S6a on the clindamycin inducibility of the LmrC-mCherry reporter (C-mCh). The graph shows the log10 values of the relative protein abundance (RPA) of each mutated strain with or without clindamycin induction. Download FIG S6, TIF file, 1.2 MB. LmrC is coproduced with seven other ABCFs, two of which are responsive to a lincosamide. The LmrC ABCF protein has a regulatory function, which transduces an antibiotic signal to activate lincomycin biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis. Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis classified 30 subfamilies of bacterial ABCF proteins (22). Four subfamilies (Uup, Etta, YdiF, and YbiT) have a broad distribution, while others, including subfamilies with the resistance function (ARE1-7), are taxon specific. Actinobacteria is a phylum with the highest number of ABCFs, including seven subfamilies specific to this taxon (AAF1-6, ARE4-5). In addition to LmrC, which belongs to the ARE5 subfamily, the genome of S. lincolnensis encodes eight ABCF proteins, three of which have putative resistance activity (ARE5 encoded by SLINC_7152 and two AAF4 encoded by SLINC_1109 and SLINC_6197). We speculated whether some of these resistance proteins are induced by clindamycin and thus could have an antibiotic-responsive regulatory function. We used the same mass spectrometry proteomics data set as used for the comparative analysis of lincomycin biosynthetic proteins to analyze the abundance of ABCF proteins in S. lincolnensis WT, WT+Cc, and ΔC strains grown in the absence or presence of clindamycin. As shown in Fig. 3a, all but one ABCF protein was present in all samples, but only two (ARE5 and AAF4) out of three putative antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins were substantially upregulated by clindamycin or produced lincomycin. The third putative resistance ABCF protein was not detected in any of the samples. Considering that the putative resistance function of these clindamycin-responsive ABCF proteins is redundant, they may have a regulatory function similar to LmrC."
1,PMC10269722,"Determination of the lexQSABC operon. The organization of the lexABC cluster and the gene lexR were described in our previous study (17). There are two other genes located closely upstream of lexABC; here, we have named them lexQ and lexS, respectively. The lexS gene overlaps lexA by 4 bp and is 8 bp immediately downstream of lexQ (Fig. 1A). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized using RNA from L. antibioticus OH13 to assess the coexpression of lexQ, lexS, lexA, lexB, and lexC genes. Fragments 1, 2, 3, and 4 from the two adjacent genes were amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) but not from RNA or the negative control (Fig. 1B). Thus, the genes from lexQ to lexA formed an operon, designated lexQSABC. FIG 1Determination of the lexQSABC operon. (A) Linear map of lexQ, lexS, lexA, lexB, and lexC genes with the genomic DNA of L. antibioticus OH13.

Fragment 1, 204 bp; fragment 2, 168 bp; fragment 3, 408 bp; fragment 4, 280 bp. LexR directly activates lexABC expression. Deletion of lexR increased sensitivity to myxin, decreased myxin production, and significantly downregulated lexABC (17). Hence, we hypothesized that LexR directly regulates these genes. A putative promoter region found by the online promoter prediction tools BPROM may drive this coexpression (Fig. 2A; see also the supplemental material). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to determine if LexR directly activates lexABC expression by binding to the promoter upstream of lexQ. A 165-bp DNA probe (lex probe) was amplified with primers labeled with biotin at the 5′ end. LexR with a His tag was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified using affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed a single protein band with a molecular mass of ~53.1 kDa, indicating that LexR was successfully expressed and purified for subsequent EMSA (Fig. 2B). EMSA results indicated that purified LexR bound to the biotin-labeled lex probe, which reduced its mobility (Fig. 2C). Moreover, DNA-protein-binding bands were enhanced with increasing concentrations of LexR. This phenomenon was greatly inhibited by unlabeled promoter (Fig. 2C). We used a 158-bp promoter region (control probe) from another RND efflux pump operon to perform the control experiment. The result showed that LexR did not bind a probe of similar length from an unrelated promoter region (Fig. S1). Thus, the regulator LexR specifically binds to the promoter region of the lexQSABC operon. FIG 2LexR directly regulates LexABC expression. (A) The predicted promoter region of the lexQSABC operon. The putative −35 and −10 sequences are shaded. The putative binding site is shown in red. (B) SDS-PAGE results for the His-tagged, purified LexR (53.1 kDa).

Lane1, 5 fmol labeled probe; lanes 2 to 5, 5 fmol labeled probe with different concentrations of LexR; lanes 6 and 7, 5 fmol labeled probe and different concentrations of unlabeled probe with LexR. The online prediction revealed a putative LexR binding site in the lexQSABC promoter region (Fig. 2A). Thus, we used 58-bp (probe 1) and 50-bp (probe 2) biotin-labeled probes with and without this site, respectively, to examine the need of this site for LexR binding. Subsequently, EMSA was carried out with purified LexR and probes 1 and 2, which showed that LexR bound to probe 1 but not to probe 2 (Fig. 3). To further confirm that the predicted binding sequence for LexR is necessary or sufficient, we performed another experiment. Probe 3 (58 bp from the control probe in Fig. S1) and probe 4 (which replaced the predicted binding sequence to probe 3) were synthesized and then incubated with LexR in an EMSA (Fig. S2). The result showed that addition of the putative binding sequence to probe 3 could not sufficiently induce its binding to LexR (Fig. S2). Thus, the 8-bp putative binding sequence is necessary but not sufficient for LexR binding to the promoter region. FIG 3Confirmation of the necessary sequence in the promoter region of lexQSABC for LexR binding. (A) EMSA results, indicating an 8-bp sequence necessary in the lexQSABC promoter for LexR binding.

The red bases are those necessary for LexR binding. Myxin enhances LexR binding to the lexABC promoter. We determined that myxin could efficiently increase the expression of lexABC genes in our previous study (17). So, we next examined whether lexABC transcriptional activation by myxin via enhancing LexR-DNA binding. An EMSA in the presence of myxin, LexR protein, and lex probe was performed. The result showed increased intensity in the LexR-DNA binding complex with myxin compared to LexR and probe alone but not affecting LexR-DNA migration in the gel. Increasing the myxin concentration resulted in more LexR-DNA complex formation, indicating that myxin enhanced LexR-DNA binding in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Control assays were conducted with various concentrations of myxin added to the probes without LexR, which suggested that myxin did not damage the DNA probe under this condition (Fig. 4). FIG 4Myxin enhanced the binding of LexR to the lexQSABC promoter region. The reactions were performed with 5 fmol lex probe. The concentrations of LexR and myxin are shown. Myxin was incubated with DNA probe as a control. Myxin enhanced the binding of LexR to the lexQSABC promoter region. The reactions were performed with 5 fmol lex probe. The concentrations of LexR and myxin are shown. Myxin was incubated with DNA probe as a control. LexR displays a binding site for myxin. The three-dimensional structure of LexR predicted by AlphaFold was downloaded from UniProt. Domain prediction and molecular docking showed that the valine residue at position 146 (V146) and lysine at 195 (K195) were likely myxin binding sites (Fig. 5A and B). This docking agrees with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Myxin was immobilized on the chip surface, and different LexR concentrations were run over the chip surface. LexR bound myxin with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.28 × 10−9 M, indicating efficient binding (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, we obtained residue mutants LexR-V146A, LexR-K195A, and LexR-V146A-K195A, to which myxin bound weakly, with KD values of 8.04 × 10−6, 3.01 × 10−3, and 8.1 × 10−3 M, respectively (Fig. 6B to D). Amino acid residues V146 and K195 are therefore essential for LexR binding by myxin, and K195 was more important for strong interaction. To further quantify the different effect of LexR and LexR-myxin complex on lexABC transcription, we constructed LexR site-directed mutants of V146A and K195A in vivo and detected the expression level of lexA in the mutants via quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene complementation of lexR partially restored lexA transcription compared to the lexR mutant, and V146A mutant acted identically to the complemented strain, whereas the K195A mutant showed a lower lexA expression level than the lexR complemented strain (Fig. 7). The results indicated that the LexR-myxin complex contributes to lexABC transcription. FIG 5Predicted binding sites of LexR to myxin. (A) Domain structure of LexR.

2,PMC10100954,"Comparison of the lasalocid BGCs from Streptomyces. In our previous study, we identified a 76,167-bp putative lasalocid gene cluster (lod [GenBank accession number KT591188]) from the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (26). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the cluster contains 22 open reading frames (ORFs), designated lodA–lodT. In this study, to unravel the regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species, we first compared lod with the other two lasalocid gene clusters (las and lsd from S. lasalocidi strains). The results showed that all three BGCs share highly conserved biosynthetic genes and two regulatory genes (lodR2 and lodR3) that encode MarR and LuxR family regulators, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Intriguingly, lod contains four exclusive ORFs: lodR1, encoding a TetR family regulator; lodA, encoding a protein with domains of unknown functions; lodB, encoding a monooxygenase; and lodC, encoding a 3-oxoacyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) synthase that is much longer than its putative homologs encoded by orf09 in las and lsd3 in lsd (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This result illustrates the diversity of lasalocid BGCs in Streptomyces, notably the diversity of their regulatory elements.

All three regulatory genes in lod function in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. Three genes of the lod cluster are proposed to play a regulatory role in lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, including a variable gene (lodR1) and two conserved ones (lodR2 and lodR3). To verify the functions of these genes, we constructed their mutants by disruptive in-frame deletions in the Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 wild type (FXJ1.172-WT) and designated them ΔlodR1, ΔlodR2, and ΔlodR3, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the culture extracts from these mutants revealed a substantial loss of lasalocid production in the ΔlodR1 mutant and a complete loss in the ΔlodR3 mutant but a moderate increase in the ΔlodR2 mutant (Fig. 2). Complementation with lodR1, lodR2, and lodR3 (inserted into pSET152 and driven by PkasO*) in the corresponding mutants partially or completely restored lasalocid production (Fig. 2). These results indicate that lodR1 and lodR3 positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, while lodR2 plays a negative regulatory role.

AU, arbitrary units. LodR1 positively regulates lasalocid biosynthesis by repressing the expression of adjacent lodA–lodC, and this variable system of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 seems to act similarly when introduced into S. lasalocidi. The variable gene lodR1 encodes a transcriptional regulator belonging to the TetR family, members of which are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and the export of secondary metabolites (27, 28). To unveil the regulatory mechanism of LodR1, we performed transcriptional analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and DNase I footprinting experiments. Cotranscriptional analysis of lod by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed the existence of at least five transcriptional units (lodAB, lodED, lodR2–F, lodH–P, and lodST) and four individually transcribed genes (lodR1, lodC, lodG, and lodQ) (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that lodR2 was cotranscribed with lodR3 and lodF in one operon. Next, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted to investigate the effect of lodR1 disruption on lasalocid biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. Total RNAs of FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodR1 mutant were isolated at days 3 to 5. These time points were selected because lasalocid was initially detected in FXJ1.172-WT on the third day of fermentation, followed by a substantial increase in production over the next 2 days (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Compared to that in FXJ1.172-WT, the transcription of lodA–lodC was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig. 3B), implying that LodR1 negatively regulates lodA–lodC. In contrast, the transcript levels of the structural genes (lodF, lodG, lodH–P, and lodST) were decreased in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig. 3B). To determine the target genes of LodR1, EMSAs were performed with all potential interoperonic promoters indicated in Fig. 3A and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 (a possible intraoperonic promoter may exist in this region of over 500 bp in length). Recombinant protein LodR1-His6 was purified from Escherichia coli C41(DE3) containing expression plasmid pET23b::lodR1. The result showed that LodR1 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR1–lodA (PR1–A) rather than to the other promoter regions in lod or the promoter region of hrdB (Fig. 4A and Fig. S2). LodR1 comprises an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain and shows high identity to SCO6121 from Streptomyces coelicolor and SVEN_3912 from Streptomyces venezuelae (both with 88% identity). To investigate the potential substrate of the ligand-binding domain in LodR1, EMSAs were performed with PR1–A in the presence of different antibiotics (including lasalocid as the most probable ligand and other antibiotics with structural diversity, such as ampicillin, apramycin, and chloromycetin). Yet no perturbation of the DNA-binding activity of LodR1 was observed (data not shown), indicating that these antibiotics are not ligands of LodR1. To further elucidate the exact DNA-binding sites of LodR1, DNase I footprinting was carried out with probe PR1–A. The results showed that LodR1 protected a region from nucleotide (nt) −52 to nt +38 relative to the lodA transcription start point (TSP) (Fig. 4B). Analysis of this region identified a conserved recognition sequence (5′-CTAGCGTTGC-3′) forming a palindromic structure near the lodA TSP (Fig. 4C). Together, these data suggest that LodR1 directly represses the expression of lodAB. As lodC was not cotranscribed with lodAB and its intergenic region with lodB could not be recognized by LodR1, the increase in the lodC transcript level in the ΔlodR1 mutant is likely due to the indirect repression of lodC by LodR1.

(D) HPLC analysis of lasalocid A production in the Streptomyces lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT) and its derivatives 31180-KABC and 31180-R1ABC after fermentation for 240 h. 31180-KABC contains plasmid pSET152 with locus lodA–C driven by PkasO*, and 31180-R1ABC contains plasmid pSET152 with locus lodR1–C. Although the lodR1–lodC locus was found only in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, we speculate that it might also function in heterologous lasalocid producers. To test this speculation, the lodA–lodC and lodR1–lodC loci were heterologously expressed in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T to generate strains 31180-KABC and 31180-R1ABC, respectively. As expected, the constitutive expression of lodA–lodC resulted in a dramatic decrease in lasalocid production in 31180-KABC (Fig. 4D). In contrast, lasalocid production in 31180-R1ABC was comparable to that in the WT strain, which might be attributed to the inhibition of lodA–lodC expression by LodR1. These findings suggest that the variable genes lodR1 and lodA–lodC seem to function conservatively in lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species. LodR2 and LodE constitute a conserved repressor-activator system that senses changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinates its biosynthesis. The regulatory protein encoded by lodR2 contains DNA-binding domains with a characteristic winged helix-turn-helix fold that is conserved in the MarR family of transcriptional regulators (29). As a common feature of MarR members, these regulators can interact with specific ligands to modulate the DNA-binding affinity, thus regulating the transcription of their cognate genes (30). LodR2 exhibits extremely high identity (93%) to its homologs Las3 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd6–7 (which should be an intact ORF but was likely interrupted and split into two truncated ORFs by misannotation) from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table 1), suggesting a conserved role of this MarR regulator in lasalocid biosynthesis. To functionally characterize the regulatory role of LodR2, experiments similar to those described above for LodR1 were carried out. RT-qPCR results showed that the transcript levels of lodR3 and all of the structural genes were significantly increased in the ΔlodR2 mutant compared to those in FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 3B). This finding indicates that LodR3 may activate the expression of structural genes. Meanwhile, the transcription of lodED was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR2 mutant, indicating that LodR2 negatively regulates lodED. EMSAs of LodR2-His6 with all potential interoperonic promoters and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 also proved that LodR2 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR2–lodE (Fig. 5A and Fig. S2). Footprinting showed that LodR2 protected a region from nt −65 to nt +88 relative to the lodE TSP (Fig. 5B). There is a conserved sequence, 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G), in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region, forming a palindromic structure near the TSP of lodR2 (Fig. 5C). MarR family regulators, especially the cluster-situated ones, commonly have ligand-binding domains. To test whether the DNA-binding activity of LodR2 is modulated by lasalocid, EMSAs in the presence of different antibiotics were performed. The addition of lasalocid led to the dissociation of LodR2 from PR2–E, while the addition of the other antibiotics tested showed no effect on LodR2 (Fig. 5D), indicating that lasalocid interacts specifically with LodR2 and abolishes its DNA-binding activity. FIG 5Functional characterization of the regulator LodR2 in lasalocid biosynthesis. (A) EMSA of LodR2 binding to the intergenic region of lodE–lodR2.

Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ns, not significant. As the ΔlodR2 mutant exhibited enhanced lasalocid production and LodR2 directly repressed the transcription of lodED (Fig. 2 and 3 and Fig. 5A to C), it was suggested that the proteins encoded by lodED could activate lasalocid biosynthesis. Based on the proposed functions of lodE and lodD (Table 1), we speculate that lodE (encoding a putative resistance protein) is vital for lasalocid biosynthesis. To test our assumption, a lodE mutant (ΔlodE) was constructed by disruptive in-frame deletion. Compared to FXJ1.172-WT, the ΔlodE mutant produced much less lasalocid (Fig. 5E), which was consistent with the significantly decreased transcription of the structural genes lodF–lodS in this mutant (Fig. 3B). Sequence alignment indicated that LodE belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters with relatively high protein similarity to MonT (53% identity), a putative efflux protein responsible for self-resistance to monensin in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (31). To ascertain whether LodE acts as a transporter of lasalocid, we compared the intracellular and extracellular distributions of lasalocid in FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant. As expected, the ratio of intracellular/extracellular lasalocid concentrations of the ΔlodE mutant was significantly higher than that of FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 5F), confirming that LodE is a transporter of lasalocid. Moreover, FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant had comparable growth rates and biomasses (Fig. S3), excluding the possible effect of the growth perturbation of the mutant on lasalocid production. LodR3 positively regulates the expression of key structural genes in lod. The third regulatory gene, lodR3, encodes a prototypical LuxR family transcriptional regulator containing an N-terminal ATPase domain and a putative C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The ATPase-associated LuxR regulators are usually involved in antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces (32). LodR3 shows strong sequence identity (80%) to both Las4 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd8 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table 1). RT-qPCR analysis supported the above-mentioned result that LodR3 could positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis. Very few transcripts of the structural genes were detected in the ΔlodR3 mutant compared to FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 3B), indicating that LodR3 is essential for initiating the transcription of the key structural genes. Unfortunately, all efforts to express soluble LodR3-His6 were unsuccessful. Thus, gusA transcriptional fusion assays were performed to determine the potential target genes of LodR3 as previously described (33). According to the results of the cotranscriptional analysis mentioned above (Fig. 3A), the putative promoters of lodC, lodG, lodH, lodQ, lodS, and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 were tested using Streptomyces coelicolor M1146 as a host (Fig. 6A). As a result, blue color was detected in S. coelicolor M1146 derivatives containing lodR3 driven by PkasO* and gusA driven by the above-mentioned promoters except for the lodC promoter (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that lodR3 may have its own promoter in the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 in addition to cotranscription with lodR2. It also suggests that the promoters of lodR3, lodG, lodH, lodQ, and lodS are the targets of LodR3 and that LodR3 can therefore directly activate the transcription of lodR3–F, lodG, lodH–P, lodQ, and lodST. FIG 6Determination of the potential target genes of LodR3 by gusA transcriptional fusion assays. (A) Schematic diagram of gusA transcriptional fusions. Plasmid pSET152::PkasO*-lodR3 was used to overexpress lodR3, and the pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmid contains a reporter gene, gusA, driven by the promoter (Px) of lodC, lodR3, lodG, lodH, lodQ, or lodS. Both pSET152::PkasO*-lodR3 and pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmids were introduced into S. coelicolor M1146 to determine the target genes of LodR3.

Comparative and parallel functional analyses confirmed the conserved roles of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 homologs in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi. S. lasalocidi strains are used as industrially valuable lasalocid producers, and thus, the regulatory mechanism of their lasalocid biosynthesis is worth dissecting for the construction of high-yield strains. As las and lsd are very similar clusters from the same species, we then selected las (which is from the publicly available S. lasalocidi type strain) to compare the functions of its regulatory genes with those in lod. Homologs of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 were identified in las, which have been designated las2, las3, and las4, respectively (22). To verify the role of these genes in lasalocid biosynthesis, the corresponding disruption mutants (Δlas2, Δlas3, and Δlas4) were constructed from the S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT). Compared to that of 31180-WT, the lasalocid yield of the Δlas2 mutant was greatly reduced (from 33.8 to 4.7 mg/L), and that of the Δlas3 mutant was increased (from 33.8 to 112.5 mg/L), while lasalocid was no longer detected in the Δlas4 mutant (Fig. 7A). Complementation with the genes in the disruption mutants restored the yields (Fig. 7A). To verify the functional conservation of las4 and its homolog lodR3, cross-complementation of the two genes was conducted. As a result, both the ΔlodR3 mutant cross-complemented with las4 and the Δlas4 mutant cross-complemented with lodR3 could restore lasalocid production to the level of the WT strains (Fig. 7B). Cotranscriptional analysis of las revealed the existence of at least four transcriptional units (las1–2, las3–5, lasAI–lasAVII, and lasCB) and two individual transcriptional genes (las6 and las7) (Fig. S4). Similar to their homologs in lod, las3–5 form a single operon. Likewise, RT-qPCR analysis of las genes in 31180-WT and the disruption mutants displayed transcriptional patterns similar to those observed for lod genes in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (Fig. 7C). Moreover, soluble Las3-His6 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the expression plasmid pET28a::las3. Next, EMSAs and footprinting assays were performed to determine its target genes and binding sequences. As expected, Las3-His6 formed complexes with the intergenic region of las2–las3 and protected a region from nt −44 to nt +11 relative to the las2 TSP (Fig. 7D). Analysis of the binding sites revealed an 8-bp palindromic sequence near the las2 TSP (consensus, 5′-CATTMRTT-3′ [where M is C or A and R is A or G]) (Fig. 7D), which is similar to the 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G) sequence found in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. All of these results are consistent with those for Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in the two species. Based on the above-described regulatory studies, high-yield lasalocid-producing strains were constructed by overexpressing las4 in the Δlas3 mutant via a multicopy vector, pKC1139::PkasO*las4, or a single-site integrative vector, pSET152::PkasO*las4. The resultant mutants, Δlas3-1139-las4OE and Δlas3-152-las4OE, enhanced their lasalocid yields by 5.1 and 6.8 times, respectively, compared to 31180-WT (Fig. 7A). Overall, by the simultaneous disruption of the negative regulatory gene las3 and the overexpression of the positive regulatory gene las4, we obtained high-yield strains with lasalocid production of up to 230 mg/L.

The genes cosI (DF19_23560), cosJ (DF19_23565), cosP (DF19_23570), and cosU (DF19_23575) were identified as four candidate genes that might play a role concerning self-resistance. The products of cosI and cosJ are part of a superfamily of transport proteins (ABC transporters) that is one of the largest groups of proteins in nature (18). In detail, cosI codes for a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The amino acid sequence encoded by cosI shows the same features found in the prototypal anthracycline resistance protein DrrA from S. peucetius, such as the Walker A motif, Q loop, signature motif, Walker B motif, switch region, GATE (glycine loop and transducer element) domain, and DEF motif (19). This component is associated with transmembrane proteins that are responsible for the formation of pores through which substances are transported, known as transmembrane domains (TMDs) (20). The analysis of the product of cosJ shows a typical conformation of the TMD, composed of alpha helices organized as homodimers (21). Both proteins form part of the ABC transporter complex, which has 95.14% identity to the ABC transporter of Streptomyces purpurascens (accession numbers WP_189725841.1 and WP_189725842.1, respectively) (Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). For CosJ, six transmembrane helices, forming a transmembrane domain, can be predicted using Phyre and TMHMM (Fig. S1). In close proximity to cosI and cosJ, cosP could be identified as another plausible resistance determinant. It encodes an enzyme (accession number KDN80073.1) that shows 88.34% identity on the amino acid level with the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) from S. purpurascens (accession number GHA30648.1). Although proteins of this kind are commonly annotated as glutathione peroxidases, those in actinobacteria in fact represent mycothiol peroxidases, as enzymatically demonstrated in the protein with accession number ASW14906.1 from Corynebacterium glutamicum (17). Besides the gene encoding KDN80073.1, there is a second gene annotated with this function in the genome, with locus tag DF19_33265, which is found in contig 4 (JJOH00000004.1) and encodes the protein with accession number KDN79115.1. When we compared both proteins with the MPx of C. glutamicum (accession number ASW14906.1), KDN79115.1 showed a higher identity level (53.21%) than CosP (KDN80073.1) (43.4%), which resulted in higher values for the BLAST score and E value, which were, respectively, 175 and 2e−57 for KDN79115.1 and 139 and 3e−43 for KDN80073.1. When KDN80073.1 and KDN79115.1 were compared, they shared 55.1% identity. Searching selected Streptomyces reference genomes for annotated GPx or MPx genes, we found in general only one ortholog per genome, such as those that encode the proteins with accession numbers CAB88451.1 in S. coelicolor strain A3(2), WP_010985209.1 in S. avermitilis, WP_100106014.1 in S. peucetius subsp. caesius strain ATCC 27952, and EFL32854.1 in Streptomyces viridochromogenes strain DSM 40736 (Fig. S3). To understand how both annotated peroxidases of S. olindensis correlate with these proteins and with the remaining members of the GPx family in Pfam (accession number PF00255), similarity sequence networks (SSNs) were constructed. Since KDN80073.1 was not in the UniProt database, first a small SSN with 100 proteins, denominated “seed,” was generated with the Enzyme Similarity Tool (22) and the FASTA sequence of KDN80073.1 (Fig. S5), with the aim of identifying close relatives of KDN80073.1 within the GPx family in Pfam. Since an identity level of 60% or higher was assumed to be sufficient to identify isofunctional protein clusters (22), we chose a level of 70% identity as the threshold in the seed SSN, where cluster 2 contained KDN80073.1 and a further 12 members, listed in Table S2. A first SSN of Pfam family PF00255 was obtained using a threshold of about 55% similarity (Fig. S6); a large main cluster of 39,799 peroxidases included almost all actinobacterial proteins, together with those from other phyla, including known prokaryotic (e.g., BtuE of Escherichia coli [accession number P06610]) and eukaryotic (e.g., GPx1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [accession number P36014]) GPx proteins. When the threshold was increased to a similarity level of about 61% in a second PF00255 SSN, the actinobacterial proteins grouped in different clusters. Cluster 2 comprised 3,261 proteins and included the proteins with accession numbers CAB88451.1, WP_010985209.1, WP_100106014.1, and EFL32854.1; however, cluster 99 had almost the same composition as seed SSN cluster 2, excluding only KDN80073.1 (Fig. S7 and Table S2), which is not in the PF00255 database. Subsequently, a genome neighborhood network (GNN) was generated from that SSN (Fig. S8). The analysis of cluster 99 revealed that all members were in non-previously described cosmomycin clusters of different Streptomyces species. These findings could suggest that KDN80073.1 has an increased specificity for some peroxides generated by cosmomycin action. The third putative resistance mechanism is encoded by cosU, whose product shows 96.71% similarity to the excinuclease ABC subunit UvrA of Streptomyces janthinus (accession number WP_193483046) (Fig. S4), which is a member of a group of proteins associated with DNA repair (10, 23). The prototype of this group is DrrC from S. peucetius, which could bind to daunorubicin intercalated to DNA and displace anthracycline, thereby preventing nucleic acid damage and allowing the drug to be expelled by the DrrA/-B system (23). Self-resistance mechanisms are essential for S. olindensis when challenged with DOX and COSD. To understand the toxicity of COSD compared with that of pure DOX, COSD was isolated from S. olindensis using analytical fractionation. The fraction of interest showed a red-purple color. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) measurements revealed a candidate compound with protonated molecular masses of m/z 1,189.5901 ([M + H]+, calculated 1,189.590149, Δ = −0.04 ppm) and m/z 595.2991 ([M + 2H]2+, calculated 595.298713, Δ = +0.65 ppm), which were consistent with the molecular formula of COSD (C60H88N2O22) (Fig. 1). A complementary tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of COSD, executed on its [M + 2H]2+ ion, produced fragment ions that were in full agreement with the expected structure (Fig. S9 and Table S1). FIG 1(A) Chemical structures of doxorubicin (DOX) and cosmomycin D (COSD). (B) HPLC profiles of COSD and DOX. (A) Chemical structures of doxorubicin (DOX) and cosmomycin D (COSD). (B) HPLC profiles of COSD and DOX. The hypothetical self-resistance genes cosI, cosJ, cosP, and cosU were cloned into the expression plasmid pUWL_Apra_oriT, generating the recombinant constructs pRCWL04 (cosI cosJ), pRCWL05 (cosP), and pRCWL06 (cosU). Exconjugants of S. lividans strain TK24 carrying the corresponding constructs, as well as the empty vector, were used to determine the MICs (Table 1) in a 96-well-plate assay format against COSD and doxorubicin (DOX) (Fig. 2). As controls, S. olindensis and S. peucetius were used. FIG 2MICs of COSD and DOX for selected Streptomyces species by 96-well-plate assay. S. peucetius DSM 40754, S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622, S. lividans TK24/pRCWL04 (cosI cosJ), S. lividans TK24/pRCWL05 (cosP), S. lividans TK24/pRCWL06 (cosU), and S. lividans TK24/pUWL (empty vector) were challenged with DOX (A) or COSD (B). Final concentrations of DOX and COSD were 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 μg/mL for both antibiotics (apramycin was added at 50 μg/mL when needed).

Final concentrations of DOX and COSD were 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 μg/mL for both antibiotics (apramycin was added at 50 μg/mL when needed).

The endogenous resistance to COSD of S. lividans TK24 was 2 μg/mL; nevertheless, when it harbored the cosI and cosJ genes or the cosU gene, the resistance to COSD increased to the same level as that of S. olindensis (8 μg/mL). The recombinant containing the mycothiol peroxidase (cosP) did not reach this concentration, but it hit the concentration achieved by S. peucetius strain DSM 40754 (4 μg/mL). In a similar pattern, the cosI and cosJ genes or the cosU gene conferred higher resistance to DOX (16 μg/mL) than did cosP (8 μg/mL). S. olindensis had a resistance to DOX similar to that of S. peucetius; however, for COSD, S. olindensis was more resistant (8 μg/mL versus 4 μg/mL). On the other hand, S. lividans TK24 containing the empty pUWL vector did not show survival when exposed to COSD and DOX concentrations higher than 1 μg/mL. Self-resistance genes are mostly expressed during the production of COSD. We hypothesized that the S. olindensis wild-type (WT) strain overexpresses its self-resistance genes during production of the antibiotic. Thus, the expression levels of these genes were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) both during COSD production at 72 h and when COSD production was not detectable, at 24 h of cultivation (6). The endogenous gene hrdB (24) served as the reference (Fig. S10). For all genes, it was possible to confirm overexpression during the time when cosmomycin was produced compared with their expression levels during the cultivation stage when COSD was not yet detected (Fig. 3). FIG 3qPCR of cosI, cosJ, cosP, and cosU, with hrdB as the reference, during production (P) (72 h of cultivation) and nonproduction (N) (24 h of cultivation) of COSD by S. olindensis.

The mycothiol peroxidase (MPx) from S. olindensis consists of 163 amino acids, three of which are Cys residues (C38, C66, and C84). Additionally, we purified a C38S mutant enzyme of MPx (bearing a mutation of Cys to Ser at position 38), obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. S11). We evaluated the peroxidase activity of both enzymes by ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX) assay to quantify H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) reduction within a time frame of 180 s. The WT MPx consumed the majority of H2O2 within 15 s, whereas the C38S mutant enzyme remained catalytically inactive, demonstrated by a constant amount of H2O2 remaining in the assay over the time used. The FOX assay performed with tBOOH showed a significant decrease in the concentration of tBOOH, although the consumption rate was slower than in the case of H2O2, as only half of the tBOOH was reduced after 180s (Fig. 4).

We also evaluated the MICs of H2O2 against S. olindensis, S. peucetius, and S. lividans (1 to 512 mM). For the concentrations tested, both of the anthracycline producers S. olindensis and S. peucetius survived 128 mM H2O2, thereby confirming a good response against H2O2. S. lividans was very sensitive to H2O2 (MIC of 8 mM) (Table 2), but its resistance to H2O2 improved notably when it contained a vector expressing cosP, showing a MIC of 32 mM (Fig. 5 and Table 2). This result indicates that MPx relieves this stress on S. olindensis, allowing it to survive persistent oxidative conditions.

To understand the role of CosP in S. olindensis H2O2 consumption, we evaluated the capacity of COSD producer S. olindensis and nonproducer S. lividans to reduce H2O2 over time, under conditions that favor COSD production. For this, we measured the rates of H2O2 consumption of total protein extracts at 24, 48, and 72 h of growth (Fig. 6). While both S. olindensis and S. lividans improved their H2O2 consumption rates at later growth stages, it was obvious that the cosP producer S. olindensis reduced H2O2 faster (Fig. 6).

4,PMC8476164,"Genomic Structure of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels We used targeted sequence capture to characterize Nav sequences from the genomes of five salamander species (order Urodela), including three TTX-bearing newts (family Salamandridae, subfamily Pleurodelinae, tribe Molgini), Notophthalmus viridescens, Taricha torosa, and Taricha granulosa (n = 3 diploid individuals of each species), and two salamanders that do not possess TTX, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis (Crypotobranchidae) and Plethodon cinereus (Plethodontidae, n = 2 each). We also identified Nav sequences within two publicly available salamander genome sequences: Ambystoma mexicanum (Ambystomatidae; Smith et al. 2019; AmexG.v6 assembly) and Pleurodeles waltl (Salamandridae; Elewa et al. 2017) and a full-body transcriptome from the fire salamander Salamandra salamandra (Salamandridae; Goedbloed et al. 2017; BioProject accession number PRJNA607429), all three of which appear to lack TTX (Hanifin 2010). The split between Cryptobranchus (suborder Cryptobranchoidea) and all the other salamanders in our study (members of suborder Salamandroidea) represents the most ancient division in the phylogeny of extant salamanders (∼160 Ma; Hime et al. 2021). We identified six Nav genes in the genomes of all salamander species, which is consistent with observations in other amphibians (Zakon et al. 2011). Hereafter, we use the exon delineation introduced in Widmark et al. (2011), where domain I (DI) is encoded by exons 2-9, domain II (DII) is encoded by exons 13-16, domain III (DIII) is encoded by exons 18-23, and domain IV (DIV) is encoded by exons 25-26. We obtained near full-length assemblies for all paralogs (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online); however, a few exons containing TTX-binding sites, including exon 15 (encoding the DII P-loop) of Nav1.2 from N. viridescens and exon 22 (encoding part of the DIII P-loop) of Nav1.2 for several newt species, were missing from our assemblies. Polymorphism was rare in our assemblies and we observed few nonsynonymous mutations within the newt genomes, but we found slightly elevated polymorphism in N. viridescens relative to other species (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). No heterozygosity or nonsynonymous polymorphisms were observed in any of the known TTX-binding P-loop regions within any of the species sequenced for this study. Synteny of Nav genes in A. mexicanum is conserved relative to other tetrapods (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), which allowed us to use the A. mexicanum sequences as a baseline to confidently identify Nav paralogs in all species. Three of the paralogs, Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 are arrayed in tandem on A. mexicanum chromosome 9, with Nav1.2 inverted relative to its neighboring paralogs (table 2 and supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). The additional three paralogs, Nav1.4, Nav1.5, and Nav1.6, are each located on separate chromosomes (table 2). In the gene family tree built from amino acid sequences, all salamander Nav proteins formed a monophyletic clade (bootstrap support >98%) with the corresponding orthologs from the genomes of the frogs Xenopus tropicalis and Nanorana parkeri, which we included as outgroups (fig. 1). The gene family tree constructed from the nucleotide-coding sequences of these genes yielded a similar topology, with each salamander Nav ortholog forming a monophyletic clade. However, in the nucleotide gene family tree, the three X. tropicalis nerve channels Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 formed a monophyletic clade that is distinct from the salamander sequences (bootstrap support 86%; supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). The same tree topology was resolved when partitioning for the third codon position (see Supplementary Material online on Dryad).

Partial Duplication of Nav1.4 and Evolution of TTX Resistance in Duplicated Domains Our search of the A. mexicanum genome revealed a partial tandem duplication of the 3′ end of the Nav1.4 gene, including the full coding region of exon 26, located ∼180,000 base pairs downstream of the full-length Nav1.4 gene on the same DNA strand (table 2). Both exon 26 copies are similar in length to each other and to exon 26 of other paralogs, encoding open reading frames of approximately 390 amino acids without introduced stop codons. Exon 26 is the 3′-terminal exon of the Nav1.4 gene and encodes the TTX-binding P-loop region of DIV. Hereafter, we refer to the duplicate exons as 26a (more proximal to exon 25) and 26b (more distal to exon 25) and duplicate P-loop regions as DIVa (more proximal to exon 25) and DIVb (more distal to exon 25). We also found this duplicated exon in Nav1.4 orthologs within the genomes of salamanders P. cinereus, Ple. waltl, N. viridescens, T. torosa, and T. granulosa and in published transcriptomes of Tylototriton wenxianensis and Bolitoglossa vallecula, but not in the transcriptome of Hynobius retardatus or in the genomes of C. alleganiensis or the frogs X. tropicalis or Nan. parkeri. This pattern suggests that the duplication event likely took place after the split of Cryptobranchoidea and Salamandroidea (fig. 2). Within the S. salamandra transcriptome, we found four unique RNA sequences transcribed from the Nav1.4 locus, with alternative splicing of exon 17 and alternative encoding of either exon 26a or 26b. Genome-mapped reads of multitissue transcriptomes of A. mexicanum (Bryant et al. 2017; Caballero-Pérez et al. 2018; Nowoshilow et al. 2018) indicate that these alternative transcripts have similar expression profiles across various tissues. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that the duplication of exon 26 led to the creation of functional splice variants in these salamanders.

Maximum likelihood tree constructed from 1,050 bp nucleotide alignment of Nav1.4 exon 26 identified in salamander genomes and transcriptomes. “Exon 26a” and “exon 26b” in tip labels refer to the exon copy more proximal and more distal to exon 25, respectively. Black circles indicate node bootstrap support >95%. “R” at tips indicates the presence of substitutions conferring extreme (orange) and moderate (blue) TTX resistance. The same tree topology was resolved using an alignment of amino acids translations of these sequences. Ancestral duplication and convergent evolution of TTX resistance in Nav1.4 terminal exon 26.

Black circles indicate node bootstrap support >95%. “R” at tips indicates the presence of substitutions conferring extreme (orange) and moderate (blue) TTX resistance. The same tree topology was resolved using an alignment of amino acids translations of these sequences. Although numerous nonsynonymous substitutions differentiated the duplicated Nav1.4 exon 26 sequences relative to the original sequences within each genome, we found that identical substitutions conferring extreme TTX-resistance to toxic newts (Hanifin and Gilly 2015) were present in both exons from the genomes of all three TTX-bearing newts but not in other, less toxic salamander species (fig. 2). Also consistent with the results of Hanifin and Gilly (2015), we found resistant substitutions conferring moderate TTX resistance in exon 26a of Ple. waltl, Tyl. wenxianensis, and S. salamandra; however, we observed no resistant substitutions in exon 26b outside of the toxic newt clade. Evolution of TTX Resistance in Salamanders We characterized levels of TTX resistance in each Nav paralog as extreme, moderate, and TTX-sensitive based on previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments in which substitutions were introduced to TTX-sensitive Nav channels and cross-membrane Na+ current was measured in vitro in the presence and absence of TTX (table 3). Our results confirm that T. granulosa has six paralogs with extreme TTX resistance (table 3 and fig. 3). Our findings are consistent with those reported by Vaelli et al. (2020) with one exception: we associate DIV (encoded by exon 26) substitutions A1529G, G1533V, and G1533A with Nav1.1 and Q1524E, G1533R, and G1533Q with Nav1.2 based on synteny mapping (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), gene trees (fig. 1 and supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online), and a phylogeny created from a coding sequence alignment of exon 26 (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online), whereas the previous study reversed these assignments. We also show that substitutions with extreme TTX resistance are present in all six Nav paralogs in two other species of highly toxic newt, T. torosa and N. viridescens, indicating that the common ancestor of these three species possessed extreme TTX resistance. Many of the substitutions in toxic newts parallel those found in TTX-bearing fish and in snakes that consume tetrodotoxic amphibians (table 3).

Nav1.5  ∼7.7× Moderate Du et al. (2009). Nav1.4 Nav1.5 Amino acid sites are in reference to rat Nav1.4 (accession number AAA41682). Parallel substitutions in Nav channels of TTX-bearing pufferfish and in snakes that consume TTX-bearing prey. Resistance category determined from action potentials recorded from salamander muscle fibers. No salamander species outside the clade of highly toxic newts possessed a full complement of TTX-resistant Nav paralogs, indicating that the evolution of full physiological resistance coincided with the origin of extreme toxicity. However, we found at least three paralogs with moderate or extreme TTX resistance in all salamander species we examined, indicating that the evolution of TTX resistance in newts built upon more ancient changes that first appeared in their nonnewt relatives. Substitutions conferring moderate or extreme resistance were observed within the heart channel Nav1.5 and brain/nerve channels Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 of all salamander species, with additional resistance-conferring substitutions evolving within TTX-bearing newts. As first shown by Hanifin and Gilly (2015), moderate resistance was present in the skeletal muscle channel Nav1.4 of S. salamandra and Ple. waltl, but not in the three other salamander species we examined. Although our outgroup, the frog X. tropicalis, also contained a highly resistant substitution in Nav1.2, we found no evidence for resistance in this paralog in any salamanders outside of tetrodotoxic newts. Based on our ancestral sequence reconstructions, the most recent common ancestor of all salamanders had three TTX-resistant sodium channels: Nav1.1 (brain, moderately resistant), Nav1.5 (heart, highly resistant), and Nav1.6 (brain/peripheral nerves, moderately resistant; fig. 3 and supplementary figs. S4–S9, Supplementary Material online). Moderate resistance in the muscle channel Nav1.4 appeared between 75 and 130 Ma, after the divergence of Ambystomatidae and Salamandridae (the family consisting of true salamanders and newts; Hanifin and Gilly 2015). This gain in muscle resistance coincided with the appearance of two highly resistant substitutions in DI of Nav1.5, which are present in all Salamandridae. Extreme TTX resistance across all Nav paralogs evolved more recently, occurring approximately 30 Ma, after the split between primitive newts, which include Pleurodeles, and modern newts (Hime et al. 2021), which include all TTX-bearing species. Over this time period, TTX resistance evolved in Nav1.2 and Nav1.3, and multiple additional resistant mutations appeared and became fixed in Nav1.1, Nav1.4, and Nav1.6. Selective Regimes and Evolutionary Rates In order to characterize the selective regimes acting on Nav genes, we used the codeml program in PAML (Yang 2007) to fit models of selection to Nav codon alignments and compared nested models using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). We tested for site-specific positive selection within all amphibians by comparing two sets of nested models: one set using a discrete distribution of ω values either with or without positive selection (M1a vs. M2a; Yang et al. 2005); and another set fitting a continuous distribution of ω values under purifying selection only, or adding categories of unconstrained evolution and positive selection (M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs. M8; Yang et al. 2000). Parameter estimates and LRT results for site models are summarized in supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online. To test for selection within toxic newts, we fit branch (Yang 1998) and branch-site models (Zhang et al. 2005) to our data sets, which allowed ω to vary both among codon sites and between toxic newts and other amphibians (summarized in supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). All models estimated relatively low ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution (dN/dS, or ω ratios) for all Nav paralogs (average ω ratios from branch models ranged from 0.05 to 0.23), indicating pervasive purifying selection. Based on LRTs comparing one ω-value models (which allow only for one ω value across the entire phylogeny) to branch models (allowing for a different ω ratio in the toxic newt clade relative to other amphibians), we found that ω ratios were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in toxic newts for Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.4 and nonsignificant (P > 0.01) for Nav1.2, Nav1.5, and Nav1.6 (fig. 4A and supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). The largest difference in ω ratios in the branch test was observed for the muscle channel Nav1.4 (newt ω = 0.23; all salamanders ω = 0.10), which appears to be due to both an increase in the proportion of unconstrained sites as well as a larger number of estimated sites undergoing positive selection (fig. 4B). However, the posterior probability support for positive selection at many of these sites was low, and LRTs from branch-site models indicated significant evidence for a shift in positive selection only in paralog Nav1.3 (supplementary tables S4 and S5, Supplementary Material online).

(B) PAML site and branch-site model estimates of proportions of sites under purifying selection (0 < ω < 0.05 in both lineages), unconstrained evolution (ω = 1 in both lineages), and positive selection or relaxed purifying selection (0 < ω < 0.05 in salamanders and ω ≥ 1 in TTX-bearing newts). Significant differences based on likelihood ratio tests are indicated with * (P < 0.05) and ** (P < 0.01). Although likelihood-ratio tests were nonsignificant for NaV1.1 and NaV1.4 (supplementary tables S3 and S4, Supplementary Material online), PAML identified a large proportion of amino acid coding sites within these paralogs with elevated dN/dS ratios in toxic newts.

Significant differences based on likelihood ratio tests are indicated with * (P < 0.05) and ** (P < 0.01). Although likelihood-ratio tests were nonsignificant for NaV1.1 and NaV1.4 (supplementary tables S3 and S4, Supplementary Material online), PAML identified a large proportion of amino acid coding sites within these paralogs with elevated dN/dS ratios in toxic newts. Our site and branch-site models identified a number of TTX-binding sites with elevated ω ratios (table 4 and supplementary tables S5 and S6, Supplementary Material online). Because of the small number of species in our study, we had low power to detect statistically significant positive selection (Yang et al. 2000; Anisimova et al. 2001; Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005), and the posterior probabilities provided low-to-moderate support for positive selection at most sites. We also note that the false positive rates of site selection models can be inflated due to gene conversion events (Casola and Hahn 2009), among-site variation in dS (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005), and multinucleotide mutations (Venkat et al. 2018). However, results were consistent between the M2a and M8 models, and the codons that were identified suggest that positive selection may have been important for observed substitutions in TTX-binding regions.

Nonconservative amino acid substitutions associated with TTX resistance in toxic newts. Sites identified with branch-site models using empirical Bayes method (posterior probability >0.50). Empirical Bayes posterior probability >0.95. Within the brain channels Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6, putative positive selection was detected by site models at site 401 within the DI P-loop, indicating selection acting across all salamanders rather than specifically within toxic newts (table 4). Replacement of the aromatic amino acid at site 401 with a nonaromatic amino acid can substantially impact TTX-binding capacity (Leffler et al. 2005; Venkatesh et al. 2005; Vaelli et al. 2020), and we observed nonaromatic substitutions at this site within all brain channels of highly toxic newts (fig. 3 and table 3). The codon sequence for site 401 was variable across many salamanders lacking TTX; however, almost all of the nonsynonymous changes observed outside of TTX-bearing newts were biochemically conservative (both phenylalanine and tyrosine are aromatic and do not affect TTX binding; Sunami et al. 2000), with the exception of the 401A observed in P. cinereus Nav1.1. This conservative variation likely contributes to the signal of diversifying selection acting on this codon in less toxic salamander lineages. Site models also suggested positive selection acting on site 1533 in DIV of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 (table 4). Although the substitutions present at site 1533 in these newt paralogs have not been tested experimentally for their effects on TTX binding, Maruta et al. (2008) showed that a G1533T substitution at this site led to a moderate (∼2- to 3-fold) decrease in TTX-binding affinity, and substitutions at this site are common in TTX-resistant channels (Geffeney et al. 2005; Jost et al. 2008; Feldman et al. 2012; McGlothlin et al. 2016), suggesting that these nonsynonymous changes likely also reduce TTX-binding affinity in newts. Within the toxic newt lineage, we identified putative positive selection acting on three known TTX-binding sites: 1240 and 1532 in DIII and DIV of muscle channel Nav1.4 and 1529 in DIV of brain channel Nav1.1 (table 4). In Nav1.4, sites 1240 and 1532 contain resistance-conferring substitutions exclusively within toxic newts and these substitutions have been associated with extreme TTX resistance in Taricha muscle fibers (Hanifin and Gilly 2015). In Nav1.1, site 1529 encodes part of the Na+ selectivity filter (comprised interacting amino acids DEKA—sites 400, 755, 1237, and 1529), which is highly conserved across Nav paralogs. An A1529G substitution (resulting in a DEKG filter) is present in Nav1.1 of A. mexicanum and all members of the toxic newt clade. Although this substitution does not appear to affect Na+ selectivity or to be sufficient in preventing TTX from binding (Jost et al. 2008), it may alter channel firing properties, as this A1529G substitution resulted in substantially higher Na+ currents relative to the wild-type when introduced into a mammalian Nav1.4 channel (Jost et al. 2008). The same alanine to glycine substitution has been observed in Nav channels of TTX-bearing flatworms (Jeziorski et al. 1997) and pufferfish (Jost et al. 2008), which suggests that it may play a role in TTX resistance in these organisms. Outside of TTX-binding regions, we found evidence for putative positive selection in similar regions across multiple Nav paralogs (supplementary tables S5 and S6, Supplementary Material online). For Nav1.4, the majority of sites under positive selection reside in terminal exon 26a that encodes the DIVa P-loop (exon 26b was excluded from this analysis due to its absence in some species). For most other paralogs, the largest clusters of sites with elevated dN/dS ratios were within the DI L5 turret (the extracellular loop upstream of the DI P-loop, encoded by exons 6 and 7) and the DIII L5 turret upstream of the DIII P-loop encoded by exon 21. These sites may facilitate interaction with other proteins, or alternatively, some of these sites identified by the branch-site model may be selected to compensate for biochemical changes produced by TTX-resistant mutations. Gene Conversion Events We also tested for evidence of nonallelic gene conversion as a mechanism of sequence evolution contributing to adaptive evolution in Nav genes using the program GENECONV. Nonallelic or ectopic gene conversion results from an interlocus exchange of DNA that can occur between closely related sequences during double-stranded break repair (Hansen et al. 2000). GENECONV uses the information in a multiple sequence alignment to identify regions of similarity shared between two sequences that is higher than expected by chance based on comparisons to permuted alignments (Sawyer 1989). We selected this program to detect gene conversion because of its low false positive rates and robustness to shifts in selective pressure (Posada and Crandall 2001; Bay and Bielawski 2011). Because nonallelic gene conversion is more likely to occur between paralogs residing on the same chromosome (Semple and Wolfe 1999; Drouin 2002; Benovoy and Drouin 2009), we limited our search to events between the tandem duplicates Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 and between exons 26a and 26b of Nav1.4 within each salamander genome. Although few gene conversion events were detected within each species by GENECONV, all of the regions that were detected within Taricha newts contain TTX-binding sites with substitutions associated with TTX resistance, including the DIVa and DIVb P-loops of Nav1.4 (fig. 5 and table 5). We observed three TTX-resistant amino acids (I1525S, D1532S, G1533D) within the DIVa and DIVb P-loops of Nav1.4 in toxic newt genomes. In contrast, Ple. waltl, a closely related but nontetrodotoxic newt, contains one moderately TTX-resistant amino acid (I1525S) in the DIVa P-loop and no resistant amino acids in the DIVb P-loop (fig. 5A). These differences involve four identical nucleotide changes at homologous sites in both exon duplicates. Our short reads from the genomes of N. viridescens and Taricha newts mapped onto each of these exon assemblies across putative recombination break points with high (>50-fold) coverage, lending support for sequence convergence rather than an assembly error. We did not detect gene conversion between these exons within the genomes of T. granulosa or N. viridescens; however, this may be due to the low power of GENECONV to detect conversion (Bay and Bielawski 2011), particularly in the presence of low sequence diversity and when the conversion tract is shorter than ∼100 bp (Posada and Crandall 2001; McGrath et al. 2009). Together, these results suggest that the three resistant amino acids accumulated together in one exon copy followed by conversion of the other exon ∼30 Ma in a toxic newt ancestor. Fig. 5.Gene conversion within TTX-binding regions. (A) Gene conversion was detected between DIVa and DIVb P-loops within duplicate exons 26a and 26b of Nav1.4 in Taricha torosa. Substitutions conferring TTX resistance are highlighted in yellow and blue.

We also detected gene conversion between the DI P-loops of paralogs Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 within the genomes of both Taricha species (fig. 5B and table 5). TTX-resistant substitutions are identical in the DI P-loops of Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 in both Taricha species (401A, encoded by a GCT codon), whereas Nav1.1 of N. viridescens contains a different codon at this position (TGC, encoding 401C), consistent with gene conversion occurring at this locus in Taricha. Both Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 of nontetrodotoxic Ple. waltl newts encode a TTX-sensitive tyrosine at this locus. It is unclear whether putative gene conversion event(s) occurred before or after resistance evolved in both paralogs. Gene conversion may have converted a nonresistant channel to a resistant channel in an ancestral Taricha, whereas N. viridescens independently acquired a Y401A substitution, or it may have homogenized substitutions within two channels that had previously evolved resistance in an ancestor of all toxic newts. In Taricha newts, the transition from either tyrosine or cysteine to alanine required multiple nucleotide substitutions in both paralogs, making gene conversion a likely explanation for the observed substitution patterns. We detected additional gene conversion events that may have involved a nonresistant paralog acting as a donor to a resistant paralog, leading to the loss of TTX resistance in A. mexicanum and C. alleganiensis paralogs. A resistant substitution is present in the DIII P-loop of Nav1.1 in most salamanders but is absent in Nav1.1 of A. mexicanum (fig. 3), and we detected gene conversion in an adjacent region between Nav1.1 and the nonresistant Nav1.2 paralog within the A. mexicanum genome (table 5 and supplementary fig. S10A, Supplementary Material online). Similarly, C. alleganiensis Nav1.2 contains a nonresistant 1533G within DIV of all six paralogs, whereas Nav1.2 of X. tropicalis frogs encodes a putatively TTX-resistant 1533L, and gene conversion between paralogs Nav1.2 and Nav1.3 may have facilitated the loss of this substitution in salamanders (supplementary fig. S10B, Supplementary Material online)."
5,PMC10419868,"2.1. The Resistance-Gene Database Table 1 shows the number of resistance genes collected from four major data repositories. Among these four databases, the resistance genes collected from CARD have detailed annotation information. Therefore, they are directly used in our database without the need for further modification or additional annotation. MIBiG records valuable BGC data, including well-characterized product information [26]. The mechanisms of most resistance genes were determined manually from annotations in the database and subsequently validated by comparison with the CARD database. A total of 629 hidden Markov model profiles of resistance genes were collected from NCBIAMR, and each of them was manually annotated with their involved resistance mechanism and compound. The functional annotation of the resistance genes found in the Uniprot database is less than that given by the other three databases. Except in the case of the efflux pump, most of the annotation is completed by comparing these genes with resistance genes recorded in the other three libraries by transferring the annotation obtained on the linkage to the query Uniprot genes. Table 1 also provides statistics on the annotated resistance mechanisms in the database, showing that product inactivation is the most frequent among the five resistance mechanisms, followed by the efflux pump, while the target modification mechanism is the least frequent. Supplementary Table S1 lists all 7297 entries of resistance gene sequences and 629 HMM models of resistance gene profiles in the database. As a demonstration of the application of the RGDB database, it is interesting to study the distribution of resistance genes inside the recently disclosed marine bacterial genomes and, in particular, to analyze their relationship with the natural products that may be synthesized by the gene clusters of these bacteria. 2.2. The BGCs in the Bacterial Genomes of MarRef The marine microbial genome is considered one of the richest resources for natural products due to the diverse environmental conditions in which marine microorganisms live; the genome has proven extremely valuable in discovering new natural products with different structures and biological activities. An important reason for the diversity of marine natural products may be that microbial populations compete to win by synthesizing complex, biologically active, and diverse compounds to inhibit the growth of other similar populations in survival competition. We applied the RGDB to analyze a recently published marine microbial genome dataset, i.e., the MarRef dataset. A total of 1403 genomic sequences were downloaded from GenBank [42] for the MarRef dataset, 13 of which could not be processed with antiSMASH 6.0 due to formatting errors, resulting in a total of 1390 genomes being analyzed in this study. The detailed species taxonomy of the selected organism is listed in Supplementary Table S2, which is summarized in Figure 1A. Parsing these genomes with antiSMASH yielded 7432 BGCs, ranging from 5 to 670 kb. Figure 1B shows the distribution of the broad classes of BGC products detected, with the most abundant being RiPPs (22%), followed by terpenoids (14%) and NRPS (12%). Note that antiSMASH could not even determine, for the remaining 40% of the BGC products, which class of compounds they belonged to, let alone their specific compound structures and activities. Statistical analysis by species origin of BGCs showed that the three major bacterial producers of secondary metabolites are Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, which together contributed more than 80% of the BGCs, and the archaeal producer Euryarchaeota, which contributed 2% of the BGCs (Figure S1). BGCs from other clades contribute much less and are therefore not shown. As previously observed, the number of BGCs per genome varies considerably among bacteria. 2.3. Preliminary Product Annotation of BGCs by Organizing Gene Clusters into Gene Cluster Families Identifying BGCs with known metabolites is essential to genome mining, allowing researchers to prioritize known and unknown biosynthetic pathways for new natural product discovery [43]. Gene cluster family (GCF) analysis enables the large-scale annotation of query BGCs based on their similarity to the reference BGCs in MIBiG with well-characterized product and derivative information. After GCF analysis, these marine BGCs were first grouped into families using BiG-SCAPE, yielding the gene cluster families (GCFs). BiG-SCAPE [39] analysis showed that the studied BGCs were mainly clustered together within orders, resulting in a set of 5803 GCFs (of which, only 518 families had more than three members) organized into a network based on their genetic components and arraignment within the reference BGCs (Figure 2). The analysis resulted in 5803 GCFs, of which, only 208 GCFs, i.e., 3.6% of the total, had a corresponding 327 reference BGCs in their family. The product information of these GCFs was then predicted based on that of the reference BGCs, resulting in 23 RiPPs, 10 terpenes, 94 NRPS, 102 PKS, 31 PKS-NRPS, and 67 other products. Note that hybrid BGCs, such as those of PKS-NRPS, might be presented in more than one family; a similar scenario was found in previous GCF analyses [38]. 2.4. Identifying Resistance Genes in MarRef BGCs Using RGDB The identification of resistance genes in MarRef BGCs is straightforward using the newly constructed RGDB, which gives 7079 putative resistance genes distributed in 3878 BGCs (see Table S3 for details; also see http://www.mingbioinfo.online/rga/marrefdata (accessed on 23 February 2023)). These identified resistance genes were classified according to their resistance mechanisms, the most common being efflux pumps, with a total of 4183. Most efflux pumps are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. Some efflux pumps have narrow substrate specificity, such as tetracycline efflux, while others are relatively broad. As the most typical mechanisms of product inactivation, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, and glyoxylate/bleomycin resistance proteins repeatedly appear in these MarRef BGCs. Vancomycin resistance genes were found to be the most frequently occurring genes for target-related mechanisms. It is worth mentioning that the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase used for fatty acid biosynthesis is present in many BGCs. Previous studies have found that copy number can be increased by self-replication and mutation, thus providing resistance to the host [44,45]. The analysis of these putative resistance genes showed that 118 of these 3878 BGCs detected to have resistance genes did carry multiple resistance genes of different types and mechanisms, without considering the efflux pump mechanism (see the two cases in Table 2). Thus, resistance mechanisms may not be unique for each bacterium, and multiple resistance mechanisms may evolve depending on the compound, which supports previous findings. 2.5. The Self-Resistance Gene-Directed Natural-Product Discovery As an application of the RGDB database, self-resistance gene-directed screening may lead to the identification of BGCs from a vast number of microbial genomes, whose encoded natural products might have potentially higher biological activity due to the resistance. In the Marref genome database, BGCs containing self-resistant genes were first collected through RGDB screening and then analyzed via the GCF [34] method to determine the type of products encoded. Specifically, if a GCF containing a MarRef BGC also includes known BGCs from the MIBiG database, then the known compounds encoded by MIBiG BGCs can be used to predict the types of the natural product encoded by the MarRef BGC, including the chemical scaffolds and their possible interactions with the involved self-resistance genes. The annotation of the resistance mechanisms provides insights into the biological activities of the encoded natural products. Supplementary Table S4 records 51 GCFs that were screened using this method, including 164 MarRef BGCs and encoded natural product frameworks. Table 3 lists three typical examples from the self-resistance gene-directed natural-product discoveries. As the first example, the MarRef BGC was detected with a resistance gene tetB(P), which encodes a tetracycline ribosome protection protein. This gene cluster was assigned to the GCF_01148 family and listed along with the known MIBiG BGC0000853, identified to synthesize the compound ectoine. Therefore, based on the GCF evolutionary relationship, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the product of CP018047.1.region026 may have a chemical scaffold similar to ectoine, which is a potential inhibitor to protein synthesis, thereby exhibiting antibacterial bioactivity. The second example involves five MarRef gene clusters, all containing the ABC-F resistance gene and belonging to the GCF_05426 family. Through the MIBiG gene cluster BGC0001502 in this GCF, it is inferred that these BGCs synthesize an NRP-type compound called amonabactin P 750. The evolutionary analysis thus suggests that these MarRef BGCs can produce similar amonabactin P 750, which should have inhibitory effects on ribosomal protein synthesis. In the final example, the MarRef BGC was assigned to the GCF_07814 family that contains the typical resistance gene aac(3), which encodes an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. The evolutionary analysis indicates that the product scaffold of CP043317.1.region037 is similar to lobophorin A/B, a macrocyclic lactone with antibacterial bioactivity. The bacterium can acquire resistance to this natural product by modifying the transferred aminoglycoside acetyl group. 2.6. Analysis of Resistance Genes in Terpene-Producing BGCs As a diverse class of natural products with a wide range of biological activities produced by microorganisms, it is of great interest to study the coding of terpenoids in marine microbial BGCs and the role they may play in self-resistance. Of the 3878 BGCs screened that contained putative resistance genes, 553 were terpene-producing BGCs. Table 4 shows the selected 4 typical terpenoid BGCs for which resistance genes and products were identified, and details of the 553 BGCs are also listed in Table S3. Figure 3 shows the location of the resistance genes in the gene cluster for these four BGCs, indicating that the location of the resistance genes could occur anywhere in the BGC map. Figure 4 compares the structure of resistance gene proteins with their corresponding reference resistance gene proteins. The RMSD values calculated based on structural comparison ranged from 0.1 to 2 Å, indicating that their structural similarity is very high, verifying that the queried resistance protein may be functionally identical to the reference protein, and the functional annotation of the corresponding resistance gene should also be reliable."
6,PMC4530439,"PIS mass spectrometry to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates PHTs were detected in the cultural supernatants of wild type strain P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A by High resolution mass spectrometry (HR MS) and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The 31P chemical shift of PHTs was 10.94 ppm (Figure S1). Tandem mass spectra (MS2) indicated that species with m/z ratio at 452, 374 and 189 are the characteristic daughter ions of PHTs (m/z ratio at 532) (Fig. 1B). Daughter ions with m/z ratio at 374 and 189 were also observed in the MS3 spectra when desulfonated PHTs (m/z ratio at 452) were further fragmented (Fig. 1C). PHTs characteristic daughter ions with m/z ratio at 374 and 189 were used as queries to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates by PIS mass spectrometry. Novel ion with m/z ratio at 417 was detected and tandem mass spectra were further recorded on HR-FT-MS instrument (Fig. 1D,E). Ions with m/z ratio at 417, desulfonated PHTs and PHTs shared two identical daughter ions, m/z ratio at 374 and 189 (Fig. 1F), which are corresponding to the exact mass of tripeptides Orn-Ala-hArg and hArg residues respectively. It indicated that the novel ion with m/z ratio at 417 is a derivate of PHT peptide scaffold Orn-Ala-hArg. Based on exact mass of 417.2568 (Fig. 1E), the side functional group was deduced to be carbamoyl. Carbamylation of Orn-Ala-hArg produced Cit-Ala-hArg, which was a deduced chemical structure of the newly detected ions with m/z ratio at 417. Tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg were by-products of PHT biosynthetic pathway To determine the biosynthetic relationship between tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg and PHTs, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A genes phtU, phtQ and phtL were in-frame deleted (Figure S2). Neither Cit-Ala-hArg nor PHT was detected from the culture supernatants of phtU- mutant CL001 strain. Gene phtU complementation strain CL004 regained the ability to produce PHTs (Figure S3). Authentic L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg standards feeding restored phtU- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs at 18 °C, which is the temperature permissive for PHTs synthesis in wild type producers (Fig. 2B). Simultaneously, feeding of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Ala- L-hArg restored phtU- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs as well (Figure S3). To the phtQ in-frame deletion, neither Cit-Ala-hArg nor PHT was detected from the culture supernatants of phtQ- mutant strain CL002. Surprisingly, PSOrn was detected from the culture supernatants of phtQ- mutants. HR tandem MS spectra of PSOrn were shown in Fig. 3. None of the authentic oligopeptides described here restored phtQ- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs (Fig. 2C). Meanwhile, gene phtQ complementation strain CL005 regained the ability to produce PHTs (Figure S3). Gene phtL knockout did not abolish phtL- mutant strain CL003 the ability to produce tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg at 18 °C (Fig. 2D). PhtL is necessary for PHTs biosynthesis since phtL- mutants did not produce any PHT. The accumulated amounts of Cit-Ala-hArg were increased when PHT biosynthesis pathway was blocked in P. syringae pv. phaseolicola phtL- mutants (Fig. 2D). Gene deletion and feeding experiments results described here showed that tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg were by-products accumulated during PHTs biosynthetic process. Dipeptide L-Ala- L-hArg was a joint precursor for the synthesis of both PHT and Cit-Ala-hArg (Fig. 4). Nonspecific aminopeptidase catalyzed hydrolysis of L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg would release L-Ala- L-hArg. Incorporation of L-Ala- L-hArg into PHT biosynthetic pathway restored phtU- mutants with PHTs producing ability (Fig. 4). Detection of precursor PSOrn from the culture supernatant of phtQ- showed that PhtQ involved in the biosynthesis of PHTs with PSOrn and L-Ala- L-hArg as substrates. Accumulation of by-products Orn-Ala-hArg and Cit-Ala-hArg from the culture supernatants of wild type strains and certain gene in frame deletion mutants might be attributed to the substrate tolerance of PhtQ. We can not rule out the possibility that there are certain uncharacterized peptide ligases participated in the formation of Orn-Ala-hArg and/or Cit-Ala-hArg. PhtL might be involved in the biosynthetic steps of PSOrn with L-Orn as a close precursor. Based on the fact that there is a phtL gene homologous (agnD1 and agnD2) in the biosynthetic gene cluster of another phosphoramidate natural product Agrocin 84282930, we assume that phtL is related to the N-P bonds formation of PHTs. ArgK catalyzed the formation of Tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg To extend our understanding about why such a great amount of by-products were accumulated, it is necessary to address the question concerning formation of tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg. Two possible mechanisms could be involved to account for this phenomenon. First, PhtQ enzyme is a substrate tolerant peptide ligase and capable of catalyzing the synthesis of Cit-Ala-hArg with Citrulline and dipeptide Ala-hArg as substrates. Second, a potential transcarbamylase catalyzes the carbamylation of Orn-Ala-hArg to form Cit-Ala-hArg. To the PHTs producing Pseudomonas cells, it suffers from Citrulline shortage since the Citrulline formation reaction kcat catalyzed by ArgK reduced to between 1% and 2% of that catalyzed by typical OTCase, such as ArgF31. It is not an economical strategy to produce a great amount of by-product Cit-Ala-hArg by consuming limited Citrulline source. In addition, by-products Cit-Ala-hArg were detected from the cultural supernatants of phtU- as well as phtQ- mutants when Orn-Ala-hArg was added as substrate respectively (Figure S4). Therefore, the OTCase ArgK was suspected to be a main contributor for the formation of by-product Cit-Ala-hArg in vivo. Enzyme assay showed that purified ArgK catalyzed the formation of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg with L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and carbamyl phosphates as substrates at 28 °C in vitro (Fig. 5). The tripeptides L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg production was positively correlated with reaction time, while no detectable amount was observed from the negative control reaction in which ArgK was absent (Fig. 5B). On the contrary, ArgK did not catalyze the reverse reaction in which the system was set up with L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg and orthophosphate as substrate. It indicated that ArgK played dual roles for PHT producers’ self-defense, which the first one was providing alternative Arginine source by acting as functional replacement of ArgF as documented previously131415, and the second one was reducing PHTs production by modifying L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg to produce by-products L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg. Exogenous L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg with a concentration range from 1 to 10 mM did not affect the growth of PHTs producer P. syringae 1448A (Fig. 6). Tripeptides L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg were partially consumed by P. syringae cells in the tested conditions. Besides anabolic OTCase ArgF, another catabolic OTCase ArcB has been detected from P. aeruginosa3233. ArcB is involved in the Arginine deiminase pathway and catalyzes the phosphorolysis of Citrulline to produce Ornithine and carbamyl phosphate3435. It is exactly the reverse reaction of that one involved in the Arginine biosynthesis pathway catalyzed by ArgF. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArgK is more closely related to ArcB of P. aeruginosa PA01 than ArgF of P. syringae (Fig. 7). Comparing with typical anabolic OTCases, amino acid residue substitutions of ArgK were observed in the conserved sites around ornithine binding “SMG” loop31. The newly identified ArgK function announced here accords well with the alteration of substrate binding pocket. PHT resistant and substrate tolerant characters of OTCase ArgK challenge the current paradigm for OTCase."
7,PMC3610138,"Heterologous expression of VanYn in Streptomyces spp vanYn encoding gene (CAD91202) was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA template from Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727
[12] and cloned in the multicopy vector pIJ86, under the control of the heterologous constitutive promoter ermE*[14]. The gene was cloned in frame with a sequence encoding for a histidine hexamer added at the C-terminus (C-His6-vanYn) or at the N-terminus (N-His6-vanYn) of the protein product. pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn, and the empty pIJ86 used as a control, were introduced in three different Streptomyces spp. by intergeneric conjugation from E. coli. Streptomyces lividans TK24 was selected as one of the hosts since it is used for heterologous protein production due to its proven excellence in secretion capacity and low extracellular protease activity
[15]. Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10595 is a fast growing streptomyces naturally susceptible to glycopeptides
[12]. Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) represents the model system
[3] and possesses a complete set of vanRSHAX genes conferring high resistance to vancomycin: consequently a glycopeptide susceptible mutant deleted in the two component regulatory system ΔvanRS was used in our experiments
[16]. Growth curves at shake flask-scale of the ex-conjugants S. coelicolor ΔvanRS, S. lividans and S. venezuelae carrying pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn or pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn were compared with control strains containing the empty vector in two different cultivation conditions, i.e. by using the limpid YEME medium or the rich and complex BTSB medium (Figure 
1 and Table 
1). Figure 
1A and
1B show the growth curves of S. venezuelae recombinant strains, which produced abundant biomass in both the media. Introduction of vanYn slightly affected biomass productivity. Growth kinetics was similar among S. venezuelae carrying either C-His6-vanYn or N-His6-vanYn constructs and the control strain. Maximum biomass production (≥ 30 g/L dry weight) was achieved after 72 hours from the inoculum in both YEME and BTSB media. Glucose was consumed with different kinetics between the two media, but it was anyhow completely depleted within 72 hours of growth. Observation at the optical microscope showed that mycelium in recombinant strains was more fragmented than in the control one (Figure 
1C).

Streptomyces spp. recombinant strains carrying different constructs (C-His6-vanYn or N-His6-vanYn) were grown in YEME or BTSB for 72 hours. VanYn was quantified by immunoblotting on crude extracts as reported in the Methods. Data in Table 
1 shows that S. coelicolor ΔvanRS recombinant strains grew better in BTSB than in YEME, whereas recombinant S. lividans strains did not grow in YEME medium. Different effects of medium composition on growth rate and morphology of suspension cultures (i.e. size of mycelium pellets) among diverse streptomyces hosts have been previously observed
[14]. Production of His6-VanYn was evaluated by Western blot analysis after 72 hours of growth in S. venezuelae, S. coelicolor ΔvanRS and S. lividans recombinant strains. In BTSB medium, recombinant VanYn volumetric and specific productivities ranged between 18 to more than 30 mg per liter of culture and from 0.8 to more than 1 mg per gram of cells, within the different recombinant strains. In YEME medium, the highest values of volumetric (about 30 mg of VanYn per liter of culture) and specific (slightly less than 1 mg of enzyme per gram of cells) productivities were achieved only for S. venezuelae recombinant strains. Considering that BTSB medium contains complex components which may later on interfere with protein purification, YEME medium was preferred for large-scale protein preparation. Accordingly, S. venezuelae was selected as the preferable host for protein production scaling-up and purification. Cellular localization of His6-VanYn was analyzed after 72 hours of growth in S. venezuelae, S. coelicolor ΔvanRS and S. lividans recombinant strains by Western blot analysis on different fractions (prepared as described in the Methods section). Figure 
2A shows a ~ 25 kDa band corresponding to His6-VanYn (predicted molecular mass of native VanYn is 22.1 kDa) in the insoluble and soluble cell-free fractions and in the cell wall fractions from S. venezuelae recombinant strains grown in YEME medium. Recombinant VanYn was never found in the concentrated broths (extracellular fractions, lanes 1 and 5 of Figure 
2A). Densitometric analysis demonstrated that His6-VanYn preferentially accumulated (90%, lanes 4 and 8 of Figure 
2B) in the cell wall fractions obtained by the step of spheroplast preparation, independently on the localization of the His6-tag (at the C-terminus or at the N-terminus of the protein). Only 6% and 4% of recombinant protein was detected in insoluble and soluble cell-free fractions following spheroplast burst, respectively. For all recombinant strains grown in BTSB or YEME (Table 
1), the heterologous protein distribution was exactly as for S. venezuelae, with most of VanYn recovered from the cell wall fraction (data not shown).

Figures 
3A, B and C show the time course of growth and VanYn production of S. venezuelae carrying pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn. Exponential growth was actually completed within 48 hours and gave a maximum biomass yield of 40 g/L dry weight. This growth phase was accompanied by a complete depletion of glucose from the medium and by a transient reduction of dissolved oxygen (pO2). Medium pH slightly decreased during the exponential growth phase and then tended to increase during the stationary growth phase. An estimated maximum of production of ~ 30 mg VanYn/L in the crude extract was determined at the peak of biomass production, i.e. at 48 hours from inoculum. An overlapping profile of growth curve and VanYn production was similarly obtained for S. venezuelae carrying pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn (not shown).

2: Figure S2. VanYn purification from S. venezuelae Purification of both the recombinant forms of His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae cells grown in YEME medium, was attempted by means of metal-chelating chromatography on HiTrap chelating column of crude extracts obtained by whole cell sonication, as described in the Methods section. N-His6-VanYn was eluted following standard procedures. In the same conditions, C-His6-VanYn did not bind to the column, suggesting that the six histidines at C-terminus were masked. Accordingly, a denaturing agent such as urea was added to both the loading and equilibration buffers. The partially denatured C-His6-VanYn protein interacted with the matrix and was subsequently re-folded directly on the column by a linear gradient of decreasing urea concentration. SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 
4) confirmed that both the tagged forms of His6-VanYn migrated as a single band of 25 kDa and were > 90% pure. Final purification yield was comparable between the two forms: approximately 12 mg of C- or N-His6-VanYn protein from one liter of culture were recovered. Figure 4Purification of recombinant VanYn.

Enzymatic activity of pure recombinant VanYn Activities of purified C-His6-VanYn and N-His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae recombinant strains were assayed on commercially available surrogates of peptidoglycan precursors, in parallel with the previously characterized C-His6-VanYn produced by recombinant E. coli[17]. These results were obtained by the d-amino acid oxidase/peroxidase colorimetric coupled reaction
[18,19], and confirmed by a fluorimetric assay
[20]. As shown in Table 
2, C-His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae cleaved the last d-Ala from the tripeptide Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, this activity being only slightly affected by the acetylation grade of the Lys. The activity was halved if the substrate was the d-Ala-d-Ala. Thus, C-His6-VanYn showed a higher d,d-carboxypeptidase activity (VanY-like) than a d,d-peptidase activity (VanX-like). Surprisingly, N-His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae did not show any activity on the three substrates (Table 
2), suggesting that the tag position dramatically influenced enzyme competence. Substrate specificity of His6-VanYn recombinant forms produced by different hosts S. venezuelae E. coli.

CD spectrum of C-His6-VanYn produced in S. venezuelae overlapped with that of the protein produced in E. coli (Figure

Resistance phenotype in S. venezuelae recombinant strains Role of different constructs of vanYn, when over-expressed in a glycopeptide-susceptible heterologous host such as S. venezuelae, was investigated in vivo by determining the d,d-peptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase activity of alkaline cell extracts and the glycopeptide resistance phenotype of recombinant strains. As shown in Table 
3, d,d-peptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase activity was detectable only in S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn and S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩvanYn (a strain with vanYn cloned without any tag, see
[12]), but not in S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn neither in S. venezualae wild-type or in S. venezualae containing the empty vector. Table

Accordingly to the expression of the d,d-peptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase activity, S. venezuelae expressing C-His6-VanYn and S. venezuelae producing VanYn without any tag showed an increased resistance level against both glycopeptides.

[17]. Results are the average of three independent experiments. These data confirm the role of VanYn in conferring glycopeptide resistance to a susceptible host and indicate that C-terminal His6-VanYn behaved in vivo as the native VanYn, whereas the addition of His6 at the N-terminus of the protein abolished its biological activity."
8,PMC9779433,"The main goals of this work were to test if Tei3 acts as a non-inducible phosphorylase and to investigate which ligand could be sensed by Tei3. Considering A. teichomyceticus a challenging microorganism for gene-engineering manipulations, a series of genetic experiments were designed and performed in heterologous hosts such as S. coelicolor M512 [38] and S. coelicolor J3200 [31]. As anticipated in the introduction, S. coelicolor has a full set of van genes conferring vancomycin resistance, although it does not produce any GPAs [39]. S. coelicolor M512 does not produce the pigmented antibiotics actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin [38], permitting the use of a β-glucuronidase (GusA)-based reporter assay, as described below. The second strain—J3200—is the ΔvanSSc mutant, in which the host vanS gene was knocked out [31]. Thus, the experimental steps described below aimed: (1) to test if the heterologous Tei3 can cross-phosphorylate the host VanRSc; (2) to build a gusA-based reporter S. coelicolor strain, able to convert X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide) to 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dichloro-indigo following GPA induction; (3) to utilize the created reporter strain to show if Tei3 needs the presence of GPAs or not; (4) to replace the SD of the host VanSSc with its counterpart from Tei3 and test which GPAs may act as ligands for Tei3 SD. 2.1. Heterologous Expression of Tei3 SHK Leads to Teicoplanin and A40926 Resistance in S. coelicolor M512 VanRS-like two-component regulatory pairs are conserved enough among actinobacteria to show a certain degree of cross-talking [33,40]. For example, it was shown that VanRSc (coming from S. coelicolor) could be phosphorylated in vivo by VanSSt (from A47934 producer S. toyocaensis), but not vice versa, implying that VanRSc is accessible for non-cognate SHKs [33]. In this case, SHKs and RRs both came from Streptomyces spp. Instead, it was necessary to check if Tei3 SHK from A. teichomyceticus (order Micromonosporales) could phosphorylate VanRSc. Overall, Tei2 and Tei3 share a high percentage of aa sequence identity with VanRSc and VanSSc: 91% and 67%, respectively. Tei3 and VanSSc are collinear, sharing highly similar transmembrane helix (TMHs) regions and conserved putative autophosphorylation sites (Figure 1a). The most divergent region between Tei3 and VanSSc is the extracytoplasmic sensory loop (ESL), implying that quite different ligands should be recognized by the two proteins (Figure 1a). At the same time, Tei2 and VanRSc were almost identical (Figure 1b). Thus, it seems plausible that Tei3 would be able to phosphorylate VanRSc in vivo. To test if Tei3 can phosphorylate the non-cognate RR—VanRSc, tei3 was cloned into the pSET152A vector, giving pGP101, and then transferred into S. coelicolor M512. The obtained recombinant strain—S. coelicolor M101—gained teicoplanin and A40926 resistance, in addition to the endogenous vancomycin resistance (Figure 2). Consequently, it could be concluded that Tei3 phosphorylates VanRSc in vivo. However, this experiment did not clarify whether Tei3 acts as a constitutive phosphorylase, considering that teicoplanin and A40926 added to the plates could serve as its activators. 2.2. Tei3 Acts as a Non-Inducible Phosphorylase Expression of tei2-3-4 and tei7-6-5 operons remains stable throughout the life cycle of A. teichomyceticus, independently from the teicoplanin concentration [35,37], pathway-specific regulation [36], and growth phase [37]. Previous papers speculated about the need of a strong constitutive promoter driving tei2-3-4 expression [37] or of the presence of specific mutations in Tei3 that might explain its function as a constitutive phosphorylase, working independently from the presence of any extracellular GPA [35]. Protein sequence comparison indicated that Tei3 carries single aa substitutions in two sites where analogous mutations transform the vancomycin-inducible VanSSc into a constitutive phosphorylase [35]. Specifically, these are L216P and G271V substitutions [31]. Homologous sites in Tei3 are N215 and R270 (Figure 1a). However, there are multiple other sites within the putative ATPase domain (ATPaseD) of Tei3, which significantly diverged from VanSSc (see Figure 1a). To experimentally verify the GPA inducibility of Tei3, a bioassay responding to the inducers of van genes was first developed in S. coelicolor. Other authors previously described a reporter S. coelicolor strain, where the endogenous vanJ promoter (vanJp) was cloned into a multicopy plasmid, fused with the kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene—neo—in a way that induction of vanJp by vancomycin conferred resistance to both neomycin and kanamycin [39]. Using this experience, either vanJp or the other endogenous vancomycin-responsive S. coelicolor vanHAX promoter (vanHp) was fused with the gusA gene, coding for a β-glucuronidase in the pGUS chassis [44]. vanJp or vanHp activation by GPAs in the reporter strain should activate the chromogenic conversion of the X-Gluc substrate into the green-colored 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dichloro-indigo [44]. Thus, plasmids pGHp (carrying vanHp-gusA) and pGJp (carrying vanJp-gusA) were transferred to S. coelicolor M512 by means of intergeneric conjugation with Escherichia coli ET12567 pUZ8002+. The inducibility of the two generated reporter strains S. coelicolor pGHp+ and pGJp+ was first tested in liquid medium and then in solid plates. When vancomycin was added at 10 µg/mL to 50 h old cultures in TSB liquid medium, the basal glucuronidase activity of the mycelia was increased by, ca., twenty- and forty-fold, in S. coelicolor pGHp+ and pGJp+, respectively (Figure S1), indicating that vanJp seems more responsive to vancomycin than vanHp. In solid media containing 25 µg/mL of X-Gluc, the presence of vancomycin induced vanJp-mediated glucuronidase activity in recombinant strains, yielding green halos around the Whatman discs soaked in antibiotic solution (Figure 3 and Figure S2). S. coelicolor pGJp+ acted very well as a reporter, giving a detectable chromogenic conversion in response to very low concentrations of vancomycin (250 ng, Figure S2), whereas S. coelicolor pGHp+ resulted as much less responsive to vancomycin (data not shown) and, thus, it was not further used. The next step was transferring Tei3 into S. coelicolor pGJp+ to test if its activity is inducible by GPAs. As either pGJp or pGP101 is a distant derivative of pSET152 [45], both plasmids use the φC31 attB site for integration and are not compatible. To solve this issue, the pRT801 plasmid [46] was used to create a φBT1-based derivative of pGP101, named pGP111. The M512 derivative carrying pGP111 (carrying tei3) was named M111, while the strain carrying both pGP111 and pGJp was named M1J. It was expected that if Tei3 functions as a constitutive phosphorylase, M1J would express a constitutive glucuronidase activity in the presence of X-Gluc, not depending on the presence or absence of GPAs. This assumption was correct as M1J converted X-Gluc independently from the presence of any GPA (Figure 3), confirming in vivo that Tei3 functions as a constitutive phosphorylase. As a control, it was shown that no induction was observed in those strains not carrying vanJp-gusA (M512 and M111), whereas the GPA induction was observed in S. coelicolor pGJp+ due to the action of the endogenous VanSSc. 2.3. Loss of Extracytoplasmic Sensory Loop and Transmembrane Helices Renders Tei3 and VanSSc Nonfunctional Considering the non-inducible properties of Tei3, we were wondering whether TMHs and ESL are still necessary for its function, or whether ATPaseD would be the only required domain. To answer this question, a series of plasmids was created carrying truncated versions of tei3 or of vanSSc lacking (i) TMH1 and ESL (tei3′, vanSSc′); (ii) TMH1, ESL, and TMH2 (tei3″, vanSSc″) (Figure S3). These plasmids were named pGP104 (tei3′), pGP105 (vanSSc′), pGP106 (tei3″), and pGP107 (vanSSc″). Plasmids were transferred into S. coelicolor M512 (resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin and A40926) and S. coelicolor J3200 (this last one—ΔvanSSc—is constitutively resistant to all GPAs), generating M104-107 and J104-107 strains. It was expected that if ATPaseD of Tei3 would be able to function alone, the expression of tei3′ and tei3″ might lead to constitutive GPA resistance in M512. On the contrary, the absence of the SD in VanSSc might render J3200 constitutively sensitive to GPAs. However, the obtained results indicated that ATPaseDs of neither Tei3 nor VanSSc can function alone: the phenotypes of M104-107 and J104-107 strains in the presence of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and A40926 were the same as the parental M512 and J3200 strains, respectively (Figure 4). 2.4. Tei3 Sensor Domain Is Sensitive to A40926 but Not to Teicoplanin and Vancomycin Logically, teicoplanin should be the original ligand for Tei3. However, direct experimental verification of this assumption is impossible due to the non-inducible properties of Tei3. It is possible that maybe Tei3 became a constitutive phosphorylase in the course of the evolution, but clues for Tei3 sensitivity might have remained “fossilized” within its SD. To answer this question, a hybrid gene coding for a chimeric SHK combining the SD of Tei3 with the ATPaseD of VanSSc was created. vanSSc and tei3 (Figure S4) were collinear, facilitating such an exchange. Luckily, a unique PaeI recognition site was found only 4 bp after the vanSSc region coding for SD. This allowed us to use this site for replacing the vanSSc region coding for the SD with the corresponding one from tei3 (see Section 4 for details). The obtained hybrid gene—tei3-vanSSc (Figure S4)—was cloned into the pSET152A plasmid generating pGP103. Next, pGP103 was transferred into M512 and J3200 generating the recombinant strains M103 and J103, respectively. In the first case, a merodiploid strain was generated, carrying the native vanSSc together with the hybrid tei3-vanSSc allele, while in J3200, the knockout of vanSSc was complemented by the added tei3-vanSSc. GPA resistance phenotypes of these recombinants showed that both M103 and J103 became sensitive to vancomycin, implying that this GPA is not an inducer for the Tei3 SD (Figure 5). Surprisingly, M103 and J103 were also sensitive to teicoplanin, excluding its possible role as a ligand for the Tei3 SD. Adding a final detail to these puzzling results, both M103 and J103 were resistant to A40926, implying that the Tei3 SD recognizes A40926 as a ligand. 2.5. Establishing a Link between the Evolution of Glycosylation Pattern of Teicoplanin and Properties of Tei3 SD Teicoplanin and A40926 are chemically similar GPAs that likely emerged in the course of convergent evolution (Figure S5) [47,48,49]. Differences lie in the chlorination and methylation pattern; notably, A40926 also lacks a N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety attached to the aglycone of teicoplanin at the aa position 6 (AA6) (Figure S5). The glycosylation pattern might be important for binding VanS, in accordance with previous results reporting that VanS from S. toyocaensis was unable to recognize vancomycin, sensing only the non-glycosylated A47934 [33]. Hence, it could be speculated that the responsiveness of Tei3 to a GPA lacking a GlcNAc residue might be an ancient property from the times when the ancestral teicoplanin BGC did not carry a gene for the attachment of the GlcNAc moiety at aglycone AA6. To understand this better, the phylogeny of glycosyl transferases (GTFs) coming from experimentally studied GPA BGCs was reconstructed (Figure 6). Five clades (A–D) might be delineated on the obtained tree (Figure 6) and they seem to correspond to the regiospecificity of GTFs well. The regiospecificity of clades (A–C) GTFs could be predicted with high confidence as, for many members of these clades, experimental evidence exists. Thus, clade (A) comprehended GTFs attaching either d-glucose or GlcNAc to AA4 of the GPA aglycone (see [50] for the review of such GTFs); clade (B) GTFs are responsible for the attachment of l-aminosugars to AA4 d-glucose [50]; clade (C) included GTFs from ristocetin BGCs likely attaching d-arabinose to AA4 d-mannosyl-d-glucose [51] (Figure 6). The substrate- and regiospecificity of GTFs from clades (D) and (E) were dubious: clade (D) GTFs probably attach l-rhamnose to the AA4 d-glucose, while clade (E) GTFs may attach l-aminosugars to aglycone AA6. To our surprise, Tei1—known to attach the GlcNAc moiety at the teicoplanin aglycone AA6 [52]—was found deep in clade (A), being a sister branch to Tei10* (known to attach GlcNAc at AA4). One other GPA—GP1416 from Amycolatopsis sp. WAC01416 [53]—is known to closely resemble the teicoplanin structure, bearing the GlcNAc moiety at AA6. However, the GTF that is likely responsible for this did not belong to any of the clades and was located far from either Tei1 or Tei10* (Figure 6). The presence of the GlcNAc moiety at AA6 of teicoplanin and GP1416 could, thus, be considered an example of the convergent evolution of GPAs. Considering all mentioned above, one could reasonably assume that Tei1 is a recent product of the Tei10* duplication/divergence event. In the course of evolution, it is likely that Tei1 changed its regiospecificity but retained the substrate specificity. A direct ancestor of teicoplanin BGC likely coded the biosynthesis of des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin, which structurally resembles A40926 and was recognized by the Tei3 SD (see Figure 7 and the discussion below for a possible reconstruction of co-evolution of GTFs encoded in teicoplanin BGC and Tei3)."
9,PMC8626424,"SCPCHD adducts stabilize the DNA duplex through a network of CH-π interactions The five known SCPCHD natural products can be divided into three sub-types based on the number and arrangement of the indole and pyrroloindole subunits (Fig. 1a). To better understand how these differences affect toxicity and repair, we selected one compound from eac`h group for biochemical and biophysical characterization (Fig. 2). We previously demonstrated that a single YTM adduct in a short oligonucleotide retains a B-DNA conformation and dramatically increases the stability of the duplex, providing an explanation for why these lesions are poorly repaired by the NER pathway18,46. Similarly, earlier work showed that multiple CC-1065 adducts greatly increase the melting temperature of genomic DNA19. To directly compare the effects of the different SCPCHD sub-types on DNA stability and structure, we introduced a single YTM, DSA, or CC-1065 adduct onto a central adenine within the same GC-rich DNA dodecamer. The circular dichroism spectra of each construct showed negative and positive bands at ~240 and 270 nm, respectively, indicative of B-form DNA47 (Fig. 2a). Additional features in the spectra likely result from either minor structural perturbation of the DNA or dichroism of the SCPCHD adducts themselves, which produce broad peaks above 300 nm in the absorbance spectra (Fig. 2b). To assess the effect of each compound on duplex stability, thermal denaturation was monitored by an increase in absorbance at 260 nm (Fig. 2c). Relative to unmodified DNA, the presence of a single DSA, YTM, or CC-1065 adduct increased the melting temperature by 23, 36, or ≥41 °C, respectively. The increase in duplex stability correlated with the stability of the adduct. After 28 days at 30 °C, only 16%, 11%, and 8%, respectively, of DSA, YTM, and CC-1065 adducts had spontaneously depurinated (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1). For comparison, the half-life of 3-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine in genomic DNA is <4 days under similar conditions (interpolated from previously published rates at 22 °C and 39 °C)48.Fig. 2Characterization of DNA adducts produced by YTM, DSA, and CC-1065.a, b Circular dichroism (a) and absorbance (b) spectra of unmodified and alkylated DNA collected at 15 °C. c Thermal melting profiles of unmodified and alkylated DNA.

Nucleotide half-lives are presented as the mean ± SD from three replicate experiments. Source data for a–d and f are provided as a Source Data file. To elucidate the structural and chemical origins of these trends, we modeled each of the constructs by manually docking ideal B-form DNA and SCPCHD adducts taken from crystallographic AlkD product complexes (described below) (Fig. 2e). Despite being maintained as rigid bodies, all adducts fit in the minor groove without steric clashes. In these hypothetical models, the hydrophilic edges of the subunits are exposed to solvent, whereas the hydrophobic faces are sandwiched between the backbones of the two DNA strands. As we previously described with YTM adducts18, this arrangement creates an extended network of CH-π interactions. Although these interactions are individually often weak (~1 kcal/mol)49, the combined strength of many such interactions generates a strong energy barrier to duplex denaturation and lesion depurination. Indeed, DNA stability and lesion half-life correlate with the number of nucleotides that form CH-π interactions (Fig. 2f). Thus, this network of weak interactions explains the trends in duplex stability and nucleotide half-life that we observe with each adduct. Importantly, our models and conclusions are consistent with a previously published NMR structure of DSA-DNA (PDB accession 1DSA)50. (Supplementary Fig. 2), which further highlights the importance of CH-π interactions on the stability of SCPCHD-modified DNA duplexes. Relative to ideal B-form DNA, the DSA adduct in the experimental structure induces a slight narrowing of the minor groove and twisting of the DNA backbone, which maximizes the number and strength of the CH-π interactions formed between the adduct and the DNA. Thus, through a network of CH-π interactions, SCPCHD adducts create an induced fit in the minor groove that tethers the opposing DNA strands and prevents gross deformation to the B-DNA conformation, explaining how these adducts pose a significant challenge to repair by the UvrABC NER excinuclease18. YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065 Historically, bulky DNA lesions, such as SCPCHD adducts, have been regarded as substrates for the NER pathway51–54. However, we previously showed that NER provides Bacillus anthracis with only limited resistance against YTM, while AlkD-mediated BER provides a modest degree of additional resistance18. At the time, we speculated the AlkD homologs that evolved in antibiotic-producing bacteria would provide greater resistance against their SCPCHD natural products. To test this theory, we transformed Escherichia coli with either an empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding AlkD, YtkR2, or C10R5, and incubated the cultures with various concentrations of YTM, DSA, or CC-1065 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Sensitivity to the compounds was scored as the lag time, or delay prior to exponential cell growth55,56 (Fig. 3). In the absence of any drug, cell growth was unchanged regardless of the protein being expressed. Conversely, cells transformed with only an empty vector showed different degrees of resistance against the three SCPCHD compounds. As previously observed with eukaryotic cells13, YTM was the most toxic, inhibiting growth at the lowest drug concentration, followed by CC-1065 and then DSA. In cultures containing YTM, only YtkR2 provided clear and significant resistance, shortening the lag phase before exponential growth. Similarly, in cultures containing CC-1065, C10R5 provided the greatest resistance, although YtkR2, and to a much lesser extent AlkD, also provided additional resistance. The same trend was observed in cultures containing DSA; C10R5 provided the greatest resistance, followed by YtkR2 and then AlkD. These data are consistent with the notion that YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065, respectively. However, both proteins also confer substantial resistance against DSA, and YtkR2 provides moderate resistance against CC-1065. This lack of specificity suggests that the features of YtkR2 and C10R5 responsible for drug resistance are largely independent of the differences between the SCPCHD compounds. The only exception to this generalization appears to be the lack of resistance against YTM provided by C10R5.Fig. 3Determination of drug resistance.E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with either an empty plasmid (blank) or a plasmid encoding AlkD, YtkR2, or C10R5 were grown in the presence of various concentrations of YTM, DSA, or CC-1065.

Product affinity inversely correlates with cellular resistance To understand how YtkR2 and C10R5 confer greater resistance than AlkD to SCPCHD natural products, we measured in vitro excision activity using purified proteins and defined oligonucleotide substrates (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 4). Under single-turnover conditions, in which the enzymes are in molar excess of the DNA substrates, both AlkD and YtkR2 rapidly excised all three adducts, approaching the endpoints of the reactions within 15 s (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 5, and Supplementary Table 1). C10R5 rapidly excised DSA and CC-1065 lesions, albeit more slowly than AlkD and YtkR2, but removed YTM adducts at a substantially reduced rate. Under multiple-turnover conditions, in which the DNA substrates are in molar excess of the enzymes, the results were strikingly different (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 6, and Supplementary Table 1). Although AlkD rapidly excised a molar equivalent of each adduct (i.e., the first turnover in which ~10% product is formed), subsequent turnovers occurred several orders of magnitude more slowly. Excision of adducts by YtkR2 was similarly slowed, although to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, the multiple-turnover rates of removal of DSA and CC-1065 lesions by C10R5 were effectively unchanged; only the rate of excision of YTM adducts was substantially reduced. Thus, under single-turnover conditions, all homologs have the capacity for rapid excision of diverse SCPCHD lesions, although this capacity appears to be reduced in C10R5, and inefficient substrate recognition by C10R5 seemingly further slows removal of YTM lesions. For all homologs, there is only weak correlation between rates of single-turnover excision and cellular resistance (Figs. 3 and 4c, and Supplementary Table 1). Conversely, the multiple-turnover rates of the three enzymes are strongly correlated with their cellular resistance against each SCPCHD compound (Figs. 3 and 4d, and Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 4Measurement of adduct excision activity.a Sequence specificity of SCPCHD natural products.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. We previously demonstrated that slow multiple turnover by AlkD was correlated with inhibition of AP endonuclease activity in vitro, which we attributed to tight binding of the AP product generated upon base excision18,57. The substantially faster multiple turnover that we observed with YtkR2 and C10R5 therefore suggests that product affinity is weaker for these homologs. To test this possibility, we performed AP-DNA incision assays using the AP endonuclease EndoIV and either AP-DNA generated from each of the SCPCHD adducts or tetrahydrofuran (THF)-DNA containing an AP analog (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 7). Reaction mixtures with THF-DNA were supplemented with free 3-methyladenine (3mAde) nucleobase to approximate the nucleobase adducts excised from the SCPCHD lesions, while also providing a basis to assess the effects of the excised SCPCHD adducts on product affinity. Relative to AP-DNA produced by AlkD, AP-DNA generated by YtkR2 or C10R5 was incised by EndoIV to a substantially greater extent, regardless of which SCPCHD adduct was excised to produce the abasic site, consistent with relatively weak product binding by YtkR2 and C10R5. For each of the homologs, AP-DNA generated from DSA-DNA was cleaved to the greatest extent, which could be explained by DSA-Ade being bound by each of the homologs with weaker affinity, producing a less stable ternary product complex, and/or by DSA-Ade inhibiting AP-DNA incision by EndoIV to a lesser degree. The former would be consistent with the fewer observed or predicted protein-adduct binding interactions formed with DSA-Ade (described below), whereas the latter would be consistent with the fewer predicted CH-π interactions formed with DSA (Fig. 2e, f). Unlike AP-DNA, the extent to which THF-DNA was incised by EndoIV was independent of which DNA glycosylase homolog was present, and no additional THF-DNA was incised in reactions mixtures in which AlkD, YtkR2, and C10R5 were omitted (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating product affinity is greater for abasic DNA in the presence of the excised SCPCHD adducts. Taken together, the base excision and AP-DNA incision data suggest that YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to possess lower product affinities than AlkD for abasic DNA derived from SCPCHD lesions. Moreover, this apparently reduced product affinity correlates with the increased cellular resistance provided by these specialized homologs (Figs. 3 and 4d,e). Diverse SCPCHD adducts are recognized primarily through nonspecific interactions To understand AlkD’s lack of specificity for the three SCPCHD sub-types and comparatively high product affinity, we determined crystal structures of AlkD bound to DNA containing each of the three adducts. We previously reported the structure of AlkD bound to AP-DNA and YTM-Ade (PDB accession 5UUG)18 and now report structures of AlkD bound to AP-DNA and either DSA-Ade or CC1065-Ade (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 2). Product complexes were generated by incubating AlkD with the corresponding DNA substrates, allowing for enzymatic hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond and formation of an AP site and a free nucleobase adduct (Fig. 5a). The conformations of AlkD and the abasic DNA are effectively identical in the three structures (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 8). Relative to the substrate models (Fig. 2e), binding by AlkD bends the B-DNA helix by ~30° and widens the minor groove by 4–5 Å, disrupting the CH-π interactions between the adducts and the modified strand, and enabling the three catalytic residues—Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187—to contact the modified nucleotide18,43,58. Despite this remodeling, the excised nucleobases remain stacked in the DNA duplex, with the bulky SCPCHD adducts bound within an extended cleft between the concave surface of the protein and the minor groove of the DNA.Fig. 5Comparison of AlkD product complexes.a Excised SCPCHD adducts from the crystallographic AlkD product complexes.

Hydrogen-bonding interactions are indicated with dashed lines. The structure of AlkD bound to AP-DNA and YTM-Ade (PDB accession 5UUG) was previously described by Mullins et al.18. Within the SCPCHD binding cleft, 14 protein residues contact one or more of the adducts (Fig. 5c). Only three—Gln38, Lys156, and Lys194—form adduct-specific hydrogen-bonding interactions. Gln38 interacts with the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S−1 subunit unique to YTM, while Lys194 interacts with the methoxy substituent of the S+2 subunit unique to CC-1065. Otherwise, Gln38 and Lys194 function as DNA-binding residues. Lys156 contacts all three adducts but only forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hydroxyl substituent specific to the S+1 subunit of CC-1065. In YTM and DSA, this position is occupied by a methoxy group, forcing Lys156 to adopt a different rotamer that hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone. All other hydrogen bonds between the adducts and the protein are mediated by water. Additional recognition of the adducts occurs through hydrophobic contacts and CH-π interactions. The majority of these binding interactions involve the S0 and S+1 subunits present in all of the SCPCHD adducts. Of seemingly principal importance are Tyr27, Met28, Trp109, Asp110, Leu155, and Trp187. Together, these residues form a shelf below the adducts and provide an alternative network of CH-π interactions, replacing the network of CH-π interactions that is disrupted upon binding of the DNA by AlkD and widening of the minor groove. Thus, AlkD’s substrate-binding cleft can accommodate each SCPCHD compound with strikingly few adduct-specific interactions. This lack of specificity is consistent with AlkD’s similar rates of excision for the three substrates. To explain the structural basis for cellular resistance against SCPCHD compounds provided by YtkR2 and C10R5, the AlkD product complexes were used as templates to create homology models of both homologs bound to abasic DNA and each of the nucleobase adducts (Supplementary Fig. 9). Despite the low sequence identity (19–25%) among the three proteins, the only putative structural difference of note is an extended loop between helices αI and αJ in both YtkR2 and C10R5. The three homologs appear to share the same three catalytic residues and a high conservation among DNA-binding residues, although YtkR2 and C10R5 possess fewer apparent DNA-binding residues (15 and 14, respectively) than the 18 present in AlkD. Within the substrate-binding cleft, the largest variation predicted by the homology models is in the residues that contact the SCPCHD adducts. However, despite this variation, YtkR2 and C10R5 seemingly form few specific interactions with any of the adducts, including the adduct that each evolved to excise. The only putative hydrogen-bonding interactions between YtkR2 and YTM are formed between Arg42 and the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S−1 subunit. Similarly, the only likely hydrogen-bonding interactions between C10R5 and CC-1065 are formed between Lys159, Arg205, and the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S+1 and S+2 subunits. Surprisingly, all of the adduct-binding residues in YtkR2 and C10R5 that appear to be specific for YTM and CC-1065 are equivalent to the three DNA-binding residues in AlkD that form similar interactions with YTM-Ade and CC1065-Ade (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 9). As with AlkD, the remainder of the binding interactions are composed of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and CH-π interactions. This apparent lack of structural specificity, combined with the nearly complete lack of specificity observed in the excision assays, suggests the enhanced cellular resistance provided by YtkR2 and C10R5 does not result from enhanced recognition of a particular SCPCHD adduct. Instead, the additional cellular resistance provided by YtkR2 and C10R5 seems more likely to result from decreased product affinity, which may be explained, at least in part, by the reduced number of predicted DNA-binding residues in these homologs (Supplementary Fig. 9). It is also possible that other, more subtle, structural factors that are not apparent from the homology models may play a role. C10R5 poorly accommodates the unique arrangement of subunits in YTM The only significant indication of substrate specificity by any of the three homologs was C10R5’s relatively slow excision of YTM-Ade adducts in vitro and corresponding lack of YTM resistance in cells. Given the structural differences between the SCPCHD natural products, we postulated that unfavorable interactions between C10R5 and the S−1 subunit unique to YTM were likely responsible for this reduced activity. Comparison of the YtkR2 and C10R5 homology models indicated three residues (Phe22, Ser25, and Ala40) in C10R5 that were likely to contact the S−1 subunit and that were not conserved in either YtkR2 or AlkD (Fig. 6a–c and Supplementary Fig. 9). To determine the influence of these residues on substrate specificity, we mutated them to the corresponding residues in YtkR2 and measured YTM-Ade excision under modified single- and multiple-turnover conditions (Fig. 6d,e, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11, and Supplementary Table 3). Under single-turnover conditions, both the F22T and S25G single mutants exhibited a modest increase in YTM-Ade excision activity relative to wild-type C10R5. This effect was further enhanced in the F22T-S25G double mutant. Moreover, the increased activity of the C10R5 F22T-S25G double mutant toward YTM-Ade was within five-fold of wild-type C10R5’s activity toward CC1065-Ade (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3). In contrast, an A40R single mutant and an F22T-S25G-A40R triple mutant displayed decreased YTM-Ade excision activity relative to the wild-type enzyme and the F22T-S25G double mutant, respectively. Under multiple-turnover conditions, all C10R5 single mutants, including A40R, exhibited increased YTM-Ade excision activity, which was further increased in the F22T-S25G double mutant. As observed under single-turnover conditions, the F22T-S25G-A40R triple mutant displayed reduced YTM-Ade excision activity relative to the double mutant. Despite this reduction, the YTM-Ade excision activity of the triple mutant was comparable to that of YtkR2 under multiple-turnover conditions, whereas the YTM-Ade excision activities of the F22T single mutant and the F22T-S25G double mutant were slightly greater than that of YtkR2 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3). These comparatively rapid multiple-turnover rates, however, are likely more indicative of C10R5’s apparently low product affinity than vastly improved YTM recognition, as the rates at which these mutants removed YTM-Ade is more than 11-fold slower than the rates at which wild-type C10R5 removed CC1065-Ade and DSA-Ade. Moreover, under single-turnover conditions, the YTM-Ade excision activity of YtkR2 vastly exceeded that of all C10R5 mutants. Thus, although the substitutions (F22T and S25G) that increased the volume of the adduct-binding cleft also increased the rate of YTM-Ade excision, suggesting that C10R5’s low activity for YTM-Ade is dictated by a sterically constrained binding cleft at the position of the S−1 subunit, additional unfavorable interactions may also be hindering recognition of YTM lesions (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9), preventing more rapid excision of YTM-Ade adducts.Fig. 6Molecular basis of C10R5 substrate specificity.a, b Close-up views of YtkR2 (a) and C10R5 (b) homology models bound to AP-DNA and YTM-Ade.

To determine the biological relevance of the gain-of-activity mutations, we transformed E. coli with either an empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding YtkR2, C10R5, C10R5 F22T S25G, or C10R5 F22T S25G A40R, and incubated cells on solid medium containing various concentrations of YTM (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 12). In the absence of YTM, cell growth was unaffected by the protein construct being expressed. In the presence of YTM, YtkR2 provided the greatest resistance, whereas cells containing an empty plasmid were the most sensitive. As in our growth experiments in liquid medium (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3), wild-type C10R5 provided little to no resistance to YTM (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 12). The C10R5 double mutant, however, provided clear resistance, albeit less than YtkR2. Consistent with our YTM-Ade excision assays (Fig. 6d, e), the C10R5 triple mutant provided less resistance than the double mutant, and only arguably provided more resistance than wild-type C10R5 (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 12). These relatively modest increases in YTM resistance may be limited by a number of factors, including potentially reduced expression and/or solubility of the mutant proteins. Regardless, these cellular results validate our structural and biochemical conclusions, showing homology-based mutations that likely only eliminate steric clashes between C10R5 and YTM—without introducing specific adduct-binding interactions—are able to increase the YTM resistance conferred by C10R5."
10,PMC9290621,"Genome mining of strain Tü 2108 leads to the identification of a berninamycin BGC and provides information on berninamycin derivative biosynthesis In a previous study, we established a bioreporter assay panel, suitable for MoA profiling of antibacterial agents, which are secreted into the agar by producer strains. This procedure was used to screen strains from the Tübingen actinomycetes strain collection for novel natural compounds (5). Here, we used the bioreporter strain B. subtilis PbmrC-lacZ that specifically responds to protein synthesis inhibition, or more precisely to ribosomal stalling, as a metabolic stress signal (5). Antibiotic activity was indicated by a zone of growth inhibition in the bioreporter lawn, while the inhibitory effect on protein synthesis was signaled by a blue halo around the inhibition zone as a result of brmC promoter activation that drives β-galactosidase reporter gene expression and associated color change (5). Strain Tü 2108 emerged in this MoA-informed screening process as one of the strains, which yielded a large inhibition zone and a clear blue halo (Figure 1). The implicated PSI produced by the strain was identified as berninamycin C by HPLC-MS analysis (5). For the characterization of the Tü 2108 producer organism, the genomic DNA was sequenced and the full-length genome sequence was analyzed bioinformatically for phylogenetic classification and identification of BGCs. Genome-sequence-based phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Type (Strain) Genome Server v. 1.0 (TYGS) (https://tygs.dsmz.de) (35). TYGS analysis with the genome sequence of Tü 2108 revealed that the strain is most closely related to the type strain Streptomyces atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T (Figure 2). The dDDH value (formula d4) between Tü 2108 and S. atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T was 84.6%, which is above the threshold of 70% commonly used for species delineation. Thus, Tü 2108 belongs to the same species as S. atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T, which has already been described as a berninamycin producer strain (41). To investigate if the berninamycin BGC is present in Tü 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH v. 6.0 (15), which led to the identification of 38 BGCs, whereby the predicted BGC located on region 6_3 (BGC 6_3) showed ∼100% similarity to the berninamycin A BGC of the berninamycin producer strain Streptomyces bernensis (Supplementary Figure S1, Figure 3). Manual sequence analysis revealed that the antiSMASH database contained an incomplete berninamycin A BGC as a reference (MIBiG accession BGC0001472), lacking the gene berH from the berninamycin A BGC (berA-J) as initially described by Malcolmson et al. (42).This was found after BLAST analysis of each individual gene of BGC 6_3 from Tü 2108 and comparisons with the respective BGC genes from S. bernensis (Table 2). Thus, all genes essential for berninamycin biosynthesis are present in Tü 2108.

Bioinformatic analyses disclose that the berninamycin BGC is surrounded by potential self-resistance genes Berninamycin belongs to the class of pyridine-containing thiopeptides and targets the 50S ribosomal subunit in a similar manner as described for thiostrepton (42). Several berninamycin producer strains are known, whereby the production of berninamycin derivatives differs in the various producer strains (Supplemental material Figure S3). A comparison between the known berninamycin BGC from S. bernensis and the BGC from Tü 2108 revealed that the predicted gene products show high amino acid sequence homologies (90–100%) amongst each other (Table 2). To identify potential self-resistance genes for strain Tü 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatics software tool ARTS v. 2.0. As mentioned above, ARTS detects potential self-resistance genes based on the following individual three criteria: (i) duplicated core genes, (ii) core genes localized within a BGC and (iii) core genes with incongruent phylogeny (16). For Tü 2108, the suggested self-resistance genes were sorted with regard to genes associated with protein synthesis as a metabolic function. Concerning protein synthesis associated genes, ARTS employs a reference set of 100 core genes related to protein synthesis (16). For Tü 2108 it was found that 15 protein synthesis-associated genes met the above mentioned criteria for resistance patterns: In total, nine duplicated core genes, 13 core genes located in a BGC, and six phylogenetically distinct core genes were predicted (Table 3). The majority of the detected core genes present in a BGC, mapped to the berninamycin cluster BGC 6_3 (Table 2). Here, the core genes are organized at the left and right borders of the berninamycin BGC 6_3 (Figure 3) and code for potential ribosomal proteins (L4, S12, S10, uS7), as well as elongation factors G and TU (Table 2). For instance, ORF 01243 encoding the putative elongation factor TU (EF-TU) was duplicated and phylogenetically distinct from another putative EF-TU encoding gene (TIGR00485) present in the Tü 2108 genome. A similar genetic organization was found for the berninamycin A BGC (berA-J) in S. bernensis (Figure 3). Notably, also a berJ homologous gene is present within BGC 6_3 of Tü 2108, which codes for a potential 23S rRNA methyltransferase, an enzyme well-known for conferring resistance to ribosome-targeting drugs (43). However, this gene, which most likely represents the actual berninamycin self-resistance gene, was not detected with ARTS, which is due to the fact that it was not included in the list of core genes. The predominant occurrence of these protein synthesis-associated core genes in the proximity of the berninamycin BGC indicates a potential linkage to self-resistance mechanisms. This finding supports the hypothesis that resistance genes can provide an indication of the mode of action of a BGC-encoded secondary metabolite. Protein synthesis core genes of Tü 2108 identified with ARTS. Following criteria are listed: gene duplication, phylogenetic gene difference, occurrence of core genes in a biosynthetic gene cluster (BCG). +: criterion fulfilled, –: criterion not fulfilled.

Development of a genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains Based on the knowledge gained above, an in silico screening approach was developed, capitalizing on the occurrence of protein synthesis associated self-resistance genes to evaluate the genetic potential of bacterial strains to produce a PSI. To validate the approach, genome sequences of 47 known PSI producers were analyzed with ARTS. Here, it was found that several known PSI producers showed high numbers (>20) of protein synthesis core genes, fulfilling at least one of the three criteria mentioned for the prediction of self-resistance genes, defined as ‘hit genes’. For example, the anisomycin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenus displayed 42 hit genes and the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea 51 hit genes (Table 4). The majority of the identified hit genes of the PSI producers were characterized as phylogenetic incongruencies (76%) and only a minor part represented core gene duplications (46%) or gene localization within a BGC (26%) (Supplementary Table S3). Among the hit genes, seven core genes appeared regularly, which were rpsE, rpsL, rplC, rplD, rplK, rplQ and rplV encoding for the putative ribosomal proteins S5, S12, L3, L4, L11, L17 and L22, respectively (Table 4). For all these genes, it was shown in previous work that they play an essential role in conferring resistance against PSIs. For example, mutations in rpsE, rpsL, and rplC resulted in altered S5, S12 and L3 proteins that conferred resistance against spectinomycin, streptomycin, and linezolid/tiamulin, respectively, in E. coli (44–46). Mutations in rplD and rplV were shown to result in altered L4 and L22 proteins, respectively, conferring resistance to erythromycin in E. coli (47,48). Mutations in rplK resulted in an altered L11 protein conferring resistance to thiostrepton in Thermus thermophilus (49) and mutations in rplQ resulted in an altered L17 protein conferring resistance to erythromycin in B. subtilis (50). According to these observations, the seven ribosomal genes were regarded as PSI 'resistance indicator genes’ (RI genes). The RI genes were found to be mainly present in PSI producer strains with a high number of PSI hit genes, e.g. S. roseochromogenus and S. erythraea with six and five RI genes, respectively (Table 4). However, some of the RI genes were also found in PSI producers with a lower number of hit genes, such as Streptomyces pristinaespiralis PR11 and Streptomyces pactum, with only one RI gene each. Furthermore, there were also examples of known PSI producers that showed neither a high abundance of hit genes nor any RI gene (Table 4). To examine whether the accumulation of hit and RI genes is a specific phenomenon for PSI producers, we additionally analyzed numerous genome sequences of antibiotic producers, which are known not to produce PSIs as a comparison. Thereby, it was found that the non-PSI producers had generally low numbers of protein synthesis-related hit genes (<20) and none of the strains contained any of the seven RI genes (Table 5). Thus, we concluded that if a bacterial strain has (i) a large number of PSI hit genes (>20) and in addition (ii) two or more RI gene(s) it is likely to be a PSI producer strain.

Based on these findings, we devised a genome sequence-based in silico screening strategy for the identification of potential PSI producers, which was designated as protein synthesis inhibitor (‘psi’) target gene footprinting = Ψ-footprinting approach. The strategy involves the process of screening bacterial genome sequences with ARTS for the presence of a high number (≥20) of PSI hit genes and the abundance of RI genes (at least two), which allows for the identification of potential PSI producer strains. For dereplication purposes, the genome sequence of the identified strain is additionally analyzed with antiSMASH to sort out strains, which harbor BGCs encoding already known PSIs, allowing for the prioritization of strains likely to produce novel PSIs (Figure 4). Figure 4.Graphic illustration of the genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains, designated Ψ-footprinting. Graphic illustration of the genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains, designated Ψ-footprinting. Verification of the Ψ-footprinting method by analyzing PSI producer strains of the Tübingen strain collection To apply the Ψ-footprinting method to the previously discovered PSI producers of the Tübingen strain collection (5), the genomic DNA of the strains Tü 2108, Tü 2975, Tü 3180, Tü 6430, KNN 49.3e and A 4/2 was sequenced and analyzed as described above. A 4/2 was not further evaluated as it produced the eukaryotic PSI cycloheximide. Among the five strains, three (KNN 49.3e, Tü 3180 and Tü 6430) showed large numbers of hit genes, with abundances of 88, 50 and 45, respectively (Table 6). All strains harbored at least one RI gene, whereby for KNN 49.3e all seven RI genes were detected (Table 6). This showcase demonstrates that the Ψ-footprinting method enabled a genome sequence-based identification of three out of five PSI producer strains from the Tübingen strain collection.

Ψ-footprinting method allows to prioritize potential PSI producers from the DSMZ strain collection To apply the Ψ-footprinting approach to so far uncharacterized strains, the method was challenged with numerous genome-sequenced strains from the DSMZ strain collection. Here, the focus was on the analysis of genome sequences from rare actinomycetes in order to increase the probability of finding new substances. 406 actinomycetal genome sequences were examined. 118 genomes (30%) showed a high number of PSI hit genes (>20) (data not shown) and 141 (35%) strains had at least one RI gene (Supplementary Table S4). 110 (27%) of the strains met the two criteria for possible PSI production (≥20 PSI hit genes and at least two RI genes) and thus were candidate strains for PSI production. Genome sequences, which met these criteria, were analyzed with antiSMASH to exclude strains containing an already known PSI BGC. In total, 15 strains were prioritized for further analysis, which harbored up to 71 hit genes and five RI genes, as for example strain Jiangella alkaliphila DSM 45079 (Table 7).

To investigate whether the selected 15 strains produce PSIs, the strains were cultivated in three different cultivation media (NL800, MS and R5) shown to be suitable production media in previous studies (5). Culture samples were harvested at different time points (4, 7 and 10 days), extracted with ethyl acetate in a ratio of 1:1, concentrated 20-fold in vacuo and then redissolved in methanol. To investigate if the extracts contained substances with protein synthesis inhibiting activity, samples were analyzed using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay (31). This cell-free assay uses the E. coli translational machinery to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a plasmid (pET28a-eGFP), reporting transcription/translation activity by fluorescence emission analysis. First, the assay was validated for the analysis of culture extracts and it was found to tolerate 30 μl of the concentrated culture extracts in a total assay volume of 100 μl without significant interference. Changes in GFP expression were monitored by measuring the fluorescence at 485/520 nm excitation/emission with a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro device and analyzing the data with the i-control™ Microplate Reader Software 1.11. To determine the maximum fluorescence value (GFP fluorescence = 100%), the assay was performed without the addition of antibiotics. As positive controls for effective protein synthesis inhibition, pure tetracycline and apramycin were used, respectively. As negative control, media extracts of the respective culture media (NL800, MS and R5) were tested to exclude that the observed inhibitory effects were caused by media components. Furthermore, extract samples from the strain S. coelicolor M1146 (M1146) were analyzed as a negative control. M1146 is a genetically engineered strain with deleted BGCs and thus lacking any antibiotic production (51). M1146 extracts were analyzed to exclude that the observed inhibitory effects were caused by components from the cell metabolism of actinomycetes. IvTT conducted with the media extract samples as negative controls yielded 70% - 85% maximal GFP fluorescence values and thus had only a minor inhibiting effect on the assay (Figure 5). The same was observed for the culture extracts of M1146, for which the fluorescence values varied between 70% and 90% (Figure 5). The addition of 5 μl tetracycline (15 mg/ml) (tet15) and 5 μl of apramycin (50 mg/ml) (apra50) resulted in very low GFP fluorescence values of 13% and 12%, respectively, indicating a strong inhibition of the ivTT assay (Figure 5). Based on these control measurements, an internal threshold was set, according to which fluorescence values between 0% and 40% were considered to represent specific inhibition of the ivTT assay and values of 0–20% indicate strong inhibition of the assay. Figure 5.

Measurements have been performed in triplicate using the same preparation of S12 extract. IvTT assays with extract samples of strains DSM 44555, DSM 44498 and DSM 44908 showed no significant inhibition of GFP expression and thus the samples obviously did not contain protein synthesis inhibiting substances or at least they were not produced by the strains under the applied cultivation conditions (Supplementary Figure S4). IvTT assays with extract samples from the other twelve strains (DSM 44944, DSM 45888, DSM 45258, DSM 43821, DSM 44073, DSM 45079, DSM 45657, DSM 43813, DSM 43919, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771) yielded significantly low fluorescence values ranging from 6% - 40% relative fluorescence (Supplementary Figure S5) and thus specific inhibition of the assay. This was observed for samples obtained from all tested media, whereby data are shown for the respective best production medium (Figure 6), while the complete dataset can be found in the supplemental material (Supplementary Figure S5). ivTT assays were additionally carried out with eleven culture extract sample from random strains of the Tübingen strain collection, of which none led to a specific inhibition (<40% fluorescence) of the assay, demonstrating that none of the strains produced a substance with PSI activity (Supplementary Figure S6).

Displayed are the extracts of each DSM strain that resulted in the most decrease of GFP production of the ivTT assay. Measurements have been performed in triplicate using the same preparation of S12 extract. IvTT assays with culture extracts of DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 grown in R5 resulted in the lowest fluorescence values (<20% maximal fluorescence), which indicated strong inhibition of the GFP expression, representatively shown for sample DSM 43813 (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S5). Samples of strains DSM 43813 and DSM 45079 from sampling time points at days 7 and 10, respectively, reduced fluorescence to values of 17% and 12%, respectively (Figure 6). Samples of strains DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 showed the strongest inhibiting effect for sampling time points at days 4, 7 and 10 with residual fluorescence values of 3%, 6% and 7%, respectively (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S5). Since culture extracts of these five strains specifically inhibited the ivTT assay, it could be concluded that they interfere with protein expression and may contain a PSI. Thus, using the Ψ-footprinting-based prioritization of actinomycetes strains, potential PSI production was detected by ivTT assays for twelve out of the 15 (80%) selected DSM strains. Identification of PSI substances from Ψ-footprinting-prioritized strains of the DSMZ strain collection In order to identify the PSIs produced by the selected and analyzed DSM strains, the culture extracts were purified by semi-preparative HPLC followed by HPLC-MS analysis of the pre-purified substances. For these analyses, we focused on samples that showed the strongest inhibition of the ivTT assays, which included DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771. Methanolic culture extracts were prepared from samples harvested at the optimal production time point as reported above and protein synthesis inhibiting activity was verified in ivTT assays. For compound purification, semi-preparative HPLC was performed with the culture extracts. The fractions were collected in time-based mode every minute for 25 min and were analyzed for PSI activity via ivTT. Assay analysis revealed that individual purified fractions from all five DSM strain samples (DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771) showed significant inhibition of the ivTT assay (Figure 7, Supplementary Figures S7-S10). Interestingly, for all five extracts, fraction 8 (F8) showed the strongest inhibition, with fluorescence values of 9%, 30%, 4%, 33% and 7%, respectively (Figure 7, Supplementary Figures S7-S10), which suggested that F8 contained a protein synthesis inhibiting substance. HPLC-MS analysis of all extract samples and F8 fractions was performed to identify the respective PSI. The HPLC chromatograms of the extract samples of F8 of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218, and DSM 44771 of F8 showed a prominent peak at a retention time (RT) 7.2 min, as representatively shown for the sample DSM 25218 (Figure 8A). HPLC-MS analysis of the F8 samples of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 revealed one distinct peak in positive and negative mode at RT 7.2 min (Figure 8B and C). This peak showed a characteristic UV–Vis spectrum with three λmax at 206 , 248 and 314 nm, respectively (Figure 8D). The peak was detected in positive mode at m/z = 424.2 [M + H]+ and in negative mode at m/z = 422.1 [M–H]– (Figure 8B and C). The mass of m/z = 423 is consistent with the mass of amicoumacin A (molecular weight 423.5; molecular formula C20H29N3O7) (52). The peak at RT 7.4 shows a prominent shoulder (Figure 8A). This often results due to the presence of two similar substances, which were not separated chromatographically. The shoulder showed a UV–Vis spectrum similar to that of amicoumacin A (Fig. 8G versus D). The UV–Vis spectrum of the peak was compared with an internal database, matching the entry of amicoumacin B (Figure 8G). This peak was detected in positive mode at m/z = 425.1 [M + H]+ and in negative mode at m/z = 423.1 [M–H]– (Figure 8E and F). The mass of m/z = 424 is consistent with the mass of amicoumacin B (molecular weight 424.4; molecular formula C20H28N2O8) (52). Amicoumacin A and B production have further been confirmed by high-resolution MS/MS (HRMS) analysis with F8 sample of DSM 45408, representatively (Supplementary Figure S11). The data obtained in this study (UV–Vis spectrum in combination with RT and mass of the peaks) showed that F8 of the samples DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 contained the PSIs amicoumacin A and B. Regarding F8 of strain DSM 45079, the mass of amicoumacin was not detected in this sample, and no mass or UV–Vis spectra of known PSIs could be assigned. It cannot be ruled out that amicoumacin was present in this sample in a very low concentration, which would fit to the lower inhibitory effect in the ivTT assay. On the other hand, this result could also indicate that the strain produces a novel PSI, but further cultivation and purification steps are necessary to allow accurate conclusions. Figure 7.

The background was subtracted due to the overexposed masses of amicoumacin A for B/C and E/F (from main peak). Amicoumacins are known PSIs, belonging to a class of isocoumarin antibiotics with antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities (53). They also show potent antibacterial activities against clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (54,55). Amicoumacin affects bacterial growth by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, specifically at the E-site codon of the mRNA, and thereby inhibits the translation process. This position is a rather unusual target site and implies a unique way of translation inhibition for amicoumacin (56). Amicoumacin has been reported as a natural product from different microbial producers, involving Gram-positive bacteria, such as certain representatives of Bacillus and Nocardia (54,57,58) but also the Gram-negative producer Xenorhabdus bovienii (53). In addition, our data revealed that amicoumacin is produced by various types of actinomycetes, namely Saccharopolyspora flava DSM 44771, Micromonospora aurantiaca DSM 43813, Nocardioides albertanoniae DSM 25218, and Geodermatophilus nigrescens DSM 45408, which belong to different orders of the phylum Actinobacteria, such as Pseudonocardiales, Micromonosporales, Propionobacteriales, and Geodermatophilales, respectively (Supplementary Figure S12). Thus, the ability to produce amicoumacin seems to be quite conserved across different groups of bacterial organisms, hinting at a so far unknown general biological function. The reason why we have not been able to dereplicate the substance based on BGC predictions is that the respective amicoumacin BGCs could not be identified by antiSMASH analysis. The amicoumacin BGC was described as nonribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid BGC for the producer strain Xenorhabdus bovieni (53). However, the BGC is not part of the MIBiG repository and thus is not accessible as a reference in the antiSMASH database, which is why the BGCs were not identified by antiSMASH analysis for the amicoumacin producers of the DSMZ strain collection. Remarkably, also detailed manual sequence analyses did not lead to the identification of the amicoumacin BGCs. We therefore assume that the actinobacterial amicoumacin biosynthesis (high GC content bacteria) proceeds differently and is encoded by a strikingly different type of BGC than in the known producers of Xenorhabdus and Bacillus (low GC content bacteria). If so, this would speak for a convergent evolution of the amicoumacin BGCs in the phylogenetically distantly related producer strains. The fact that we have detected amicoumacin as PSI in our samples underscores the feasibility and reliability of the Ψ-footprinting strategy. The advantage of this method is that it is purely in silico-based. Conventional antibiotic screening approaches are generally much more labor-intensive since they involve screening a large number of strains, followed by extensive compound purifications and chemical analytics with the risk that the identified bioactive substance is already known. The Ψ-footprinting strategy is a fast and efficient method to specifically prioritize potential producers of PSIs based on genome-sequence information and thereby speeds up the lead discovery process. Until now, it was not possible to transfer this method to antibiotics with a different mode of action. The derived in silico strategy is so far only applicable for the prioritization of potential PSI producer strains, due to the number of core genes used as a reference set in the ARTS analysis. For the metabolic function of protein synthesis ∼100 core genes are defined in the reference set, which are significantly lower core gene numbers for other metabolic functions, such as DNA metabolism- or cell envelope-associated functions (16). Certainly, not all PSI producers can be detected with the Ψ-footprinting approach, as for example shown for Streptomyces griseus, a known producer of the PSI streptomycin (Table 4). Another limitation of the approach might be that it employs known RI genes as indicator genes, which could prevent the discovery of really novel PSIs with different MoAs. In this context, however, it would be possible to adopt a less stringent Ψ-footprinting run and exclude RI genes as a selection criterion, which would allow for a more explorative screening attempt. However, following the defined criteria for Ψ-footprinting, which are (i) a high number (≥20) of PSI hit genes and (ii) the additional abundance of RI genes, allows a reliable pre-selection of potential PSI producers. This was proven by the identification of twelve PSI producer strains from the 15 Ψ-selected strains in the current study, which inhibited protein synthesis in ivTT assays. In addition, the responsible PSI substances (amicoumacin A and B) were identified for four of these strains. Prioritized strains for which protein synthesis inhibiting activities were observed but no PSI identified yet are subject to ongoing work."
11,PMC11209526,"2.1. Sphinganine-Analog Producing Fungal Species Are More Resistant to Fumonisin B1 Than Non-Producers To investigate whether the production of fumonisins or the related AAL toxin is associated with increased toxin resistance, we compared the growth of various fungal strains (see Table 1) in the presence of FB1. First, we compared the growth of a well-studied F. verticillioides strain (FGSC 7600), which had been previously utilized for elucidation of the FUM cluster and for determination of the first genome sequence [32], with the growth of the likewise relevant fumonisin-nonproducer F. graminearum (strain PH-1, [33]) at different temperatures and different levels of fumonisins added to minimal medium. Since very high concentrations were needed for full inhibition, a crude concentrated extract containing fumonisins B1, B2, and B3 was used as previously described [34], which contained 3.18 g/L FB1. Without added toxin at 20 °C, F. graminearum (red pigmented, on the right half of the plates shown in Figure 1) grew more vigorously and covered a larger portion of the medium than F. verticillioides. At 30 °C, F. verticillioides grew better, and after two weeks, both strains covered about half of the plate. When increasing amounts of fumonisin were added to the medium, F. graminearum was increasingly inhibited, while F. verticillioides continued to grow. At the highest concentration tested (176 µM FB1), growth of F. graminearum was completely inhibited, while F. verticillioides showed only marginally reduced radial growth after 7 days at 30 °C (Figure 1). We conclude that the fumonisin-producing F. verticillioides has clearly higher resistance to fumonisin than F. graminearum. Next, we compared various Alternaria strains (Figure 2A) producing or not producing sphinganine-analog toxins. The A. alternata f.sp. lycopersici strain AS27-12 is a well-known producer of AAL toxin and related derivatives [35]. Its resistance level was compared to two A. alternata isolates from our local university collection (Austrian Center for Biological Resources (https://acbr-database.boku.ac.at/, accessed on 21 May 2024)). The strain MA 304 was originally isolated from apple in the USA, whereas MA 308 caused leaf spot in Solanum tuberosum. Both strains do not produce AAL toxin. Already, at the low concentration of 10 µM (about 7.2 mg/L), the growth of both nonproducing strains was strongly reduced to about 20% of the diameter, while the AAL-producing strain had 78% of its diameter on the no-toxin control. At 50 µM FB1, the AAL strain had an about 50% reduced diameter, while the two nonproducer strains were almost completely inhibited. We also tested (Figure 2B) whether an Aspergillus niger wild-type strain, for which fumonisin production had been demonstrated (ATCC 11414, [36], see Table S1 therein), is more resistant than a wild-type A. nidulans strain (FGSC A4, [37]). F. verticillioides was added on top of the plates as a control (Figure 2B). At 10 µM FB1, the A. nidulans strains were already fully inhibited, while A. niger was only slightly inhibited (compared to no toxin 86% diameter at 10 µM and 66% at 50 µM). Seemingly, a mechanism of protection exists in sphinganine-analog toxin producers. We set out to test whether target insensitivity is involved. 2.2. Generation and Characterization of a fum17-18 Deletion Strain in a fum1 Background To be able to study the effects of added toxin undisturbed by endogenously synthesized fumonisin, we generated a fum17-fum18 double mutant in the background of a fum1::hygB mutant. The previously described fum1 mutant strain GfA2364, which is derived from the wild-type strain FGSC 7600 [20,38] by insertion of the hygB resistance gene into the FUM1 PKS, was transformed with a construct that allows for simultaneous deletion of both genes using a nptII (G418) resistance cassette (see Section 4). Two transformants, designated KTFD1 and KTFD4, were obtained and used in the fumonisin resistance tests: their growth was compared to the growth of the parental fum1 mutant strain GfA2364. As evident from Figure 3—even on the highest concentration tested—both, the wild-type and the knockout strains were still able to grow. For unknown reasons, stronger and earlier pigmentation occurred in the wild type. We conclude that the cluster-encoded ceramide synthase genes FUM17 and FUM18 are not necessary for high-level resistance to fumonisin B1. 2.3. Testing Fumonisin Resistance of Ceramide Synthase Genes by Heterologous Expression in Yeast The finding that the FUM17 and FUM18 genes are not necessary for self-resistance against FB1 indicates possible redundancy. F. verticillioides has three additional predicted ceramide synthase genes, CER1, CER2, and CER3 [31], encoded outside the FUM cluster. We have recently reported the construction of a fumonisin-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain [34]. We transformed this strain with the plasmids described by Janevska et al. [31] for the expression of the F. verticillioides ceramide synthase cDNAs behind the constitutive TEF1 promoter. As controls, the yeast ceramide synthases LAG1 (“longevity assurance gene”, [39]) and its paralog (“longevity assurance cognate”) LAC1 [40] were also overexpressed. Yeast transformants were spotted onto SC-URA plates supplemented with increasing amounts of FB1. Overexpression of LAC1, but not of LAG1, conferred low-level resistance at concentrations that were inhibitory for the empty vector controls. At higher concentrations, the yeast genes did not confer resistance, in contrast to F. verticillioides FUM18, CER1, CER2, and CER3. As shown in Figure 4, the yeast host (containing functional endogenous LAG1 and LAC1 genes) transformed with the empty vector was already sensitive to 2.5 µM FB1. Overexpression of LAC1 but not LAG1 in the 2 µ multicopy plasmid behind the strong TEF1 promoter conferred a low level of increased resistance. On the other hand, high-level resistance (highest concentration tested 150 µM) was conferred by the expression of FUM18 but not FUM17, and equally well by all three F. verticillioides ceramide synthases, CER1, CER2, and CER3."
12,PMC3533786,"The T6SS gene cluster harbours self-resistance determinants and candidate secreted effectors The T6SS gene cluster of S. marcescens Db10, SMA2244–2281, contains 38 genes, including many with no known function (Murdoch et al., 2011). We speculated that encoded within this cluster might be T6-secreted effectors and/or self-resistance determinants, the latter preventing the T6SS-expressing cell from harming itself or being harmed by its isogenic (sibling) neighbours. In order to determine whether the cluster did indeed contain self-resistance determinants (such as specific immunity proteins analogous to the Tsi proteins), we generated a mutant lacking the entire T6SS gene cluster (ΔT6SS) and examined whether it was fully resistant to the T6SS of the wild type strain. Co-culture of two target strains, wild type Db10 and the ΔT6SS mutant, each with a wild type and a ΔclpV attacker, showed that the ΔT6SS mutant had lost resistance to T6SS-mediated inhibition or killing by the wild type strain (Fig. 1A, left). Recovery of ΔT6SS was decreased 100-fold when it was co-cultured with the wild type strain, compared with when the wild type strain was co-cultured with itself. This effect was dependent on a functional T6SS in the attacker as there was no loss of ΔT6SS when it was co-cultured with a ΔclpV mutant. The ATPase ClpV is one of the core, structural components of the T6SS and we have shown previously that it is essential for Hcp secretion and T6-mediated antibacterial killing activity of S. marcescens Db10 (Murdoch et al., 2011). To simplify the analysis of multiple mutants, we defined the ‘resistance index’ of a strain as the difference between recovery when co-cultured with the wild type strain and recovery when co-cultured with the ΔclpV mutant, specifically log2[recovery vs. wild type/recovery vs. ΔclpV]. The wild type or other resistant strain will show no difference and have a resistance index of 0. A target strain with reduced ability to resist harm caused by the T6SS will have a negative resistance index, exemplified by the ΔT6SS mutant with a resistance index of −7.6 (Fig. 1A, right). Self-resistance did not depend on an active T6SS, as a ΔclpV mutant had a resistance index of 0. Similarly, mutants in other essential core T6SS components, Δlip, ΔicmH and ΔtssK (Murdoch et al., 2011) also showed no loss of self-resistance (data not shown). Therefore, genes other than those encoding the core conserved T6SS components were implicated in self-resistance. Our attention was particularly caught by a locus in the middle of the gene cluster, where six non-conserved genes, SMA2260–2262, SMA2264–2266, are flanked by conserved T6SS components. A mutant lacking all of these genes (but maintaining intact SMA2263, encoding Hcp1) was also tested and found to have a negative resistance index (Fig. 1A). Hence, one or more of these genes contributes to self-resistance and may encode immunity protein(s).

Closer examination of the proteins encoded by SMA2260–2262 and SMA2264–2266 revealed two classes of small proteins (Fig. 1B). SMA2261 and SMA2264 were basic proteins with detectable sequence similarity between them, no discernable cellular localization signals and no predicted function. We hypothesized that they might be secreted substrates, and, given subsequent results, named them Ssp1 and Ssp2 (Secreted small protein). SMA2260, SMA2262, SMA2265 and SMA2266 were proteins with classical Sec-dependent N-terminal signal peptides, identified using SignalP (Petersen et al., 2011), and thus predicted to be periplasmic. They also had no predicted function but shared detectable sequence similarity with each other. We hypothesized that they would represent specific immunity proteins or other self-resistance determinants, and named them Rap1a, Rap1b, Rap2a and Rap2b (Resistance associated protein). The genes encoding all these small proteins fall into two sets, either side of hcp1 and within genes encoding T6SS structural proteins, vipB and fha (Fig. 1B). Homologues of the Ssp and Rap proteins are encoded within T6SS gene clusters in many other bacterial species (and in at least one case apart from the T6SS) and appear to always co-occur (see representative examples in Fig. 1C). We speculated that the S. marcescens Ssp and Rap proteins represented previously unknown combinations of T6-secreted effectors and cognate immunity proteins. Importantly, mutants lacking one, some or all of the small proteins exhibited wild type levels of Hcp secretion (Figs 1D and S1). Thus, none of the Ssp or Rap proteins is required for Hcp secretion, i.e. they play no structural role in the T6SS. Ssp1 and Ssp2 are Type VI-secreted effectors Ssp1 and Ssp2 were shown to be secreted substrates of the T6SS by immunoblotting secreted fractions from the wild type strain, two T6SS mutants, ΔclpV and ΔtssE, and the corresponding complemented strains, using specific anti-Ssp1 and anti-Ssp2 antibodies. Both proteins were detected in the culture supernatant, entirely dependent on a functional T6SS (Fig. 2A). Neither protein was detectable in the cellular fraction, implying they were rapidly turned over if not secreted (data not shown). Secretion of Ssp2 was also independent of Ssp1, and vice versa, again confirming they have no structural or accessory role in the secretion machinery (Fig. 2A). In order to establish if the Ssp proteins were antibacterial toxins contributing to the killing or inhibition of the susceptible ΔT6SS mutant by the wild type strain, the recovery of ΔT6SS in the presence of different mutants was determined. Recovery of the ΔT6SS target was increased fivefold with the Δssp2 mutant, or any multiple mutant lacking ssp2, as attacker, compared with the wild type attacker (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in this assay, loss of Ssp1 did not cause a statistically significant impairment in killing of ΔT6SS. None of the Rap proteins was required for targeting of ΔT6SS (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2Proteins Ssp1 and Ssp2 are secreted by the Type VI secretion system and self-harm is mediated by Ssp2.A.

Self-resistance against the Ssp1 and Ssp2 toxins is mediated by their cognate Rap partners In order to assess the contribution of each of the rap (and ssp) genes to self-resistance, single mutants were constructed. It rapidly became apparent that single mutants in rap1a and rap2a had severe fitness defects on solid media, both on rich (Fig. 3A) and minimal media (Fig. S2), and particularly Δrap2a. Culture spots and single colonies of each mutant were ‘thinner’, smaller (in the case of Δrap2a), and with altered surface morphology. Examination of single cells showed that the Δrap1a cells appeared bigger and less uniformly shaped than wild type cells and the Δrap2a cells had striking phenotypes, being either markedly distended or highly elongated (Figs 3A and S2). These phenotypes could be complemented by expression of the corresponding gene in trans (indeed, the additional stress of the selective antibiotic made the phenotypes of Δrap1a and Δrap2a mutants carrying vector control plasmids even more pronounced; Fig. 3A). In contrast, when Δrap1a was constructed in combination with Δssp1, or Δrap2a in combination with Δssp2, the double mutants were readily made and were of normal appearance and fitness on solid media (Figs 3A and S2). These observations are entirely consistent with Rap2a serving as the immunity protein against the Ssp2 toxin and Rap1a being the cognate immunity protein alleviating toxicity mediated by Ssp1. Similarly, when Δrap1a or Δrap2a mutants were constructed in combination with the ΔclpV mutation, the double mutants were again apparently healthy on solid media (Figs 3A and S2). Hence, self-toxicity depended on a functional T6SS, implying it was caused by T6SS-mediated injection of the toxin into a susceptible cell by its neighbours (further supported by the observation that Δrap1a and Δrap2a did not display comparable growth defects in liquid culture, where contact-dependent targeting is unlikely to occur efficiently; Fig. S2).

In (B) and (C), bars show mean ± SEM (n ≥ 4); *** indicates a significant difference compared with the wild type strain (P < 0.001). An immunity function for Rap2a was directly demonstrated in co-culture (antibacterial competition assay): target strains containing a Δrap2a mutation all showed a negative resistance index (Fig. 3B; the single Δrap2a mutant was not tested because of its severe sickness). Strains containing a Δrap1a mutation did not have a negative resistance index, consistent with the lack of significant contribution of Ssp1 to self-killing under the conditions of these assays (Fig. 2B). To confirm that Ssp2 was directly and entirely responsible for the inhibitory effect of a wild type attacker strain on Δrap2a, we showed that a Δrap2a target strain is completely resistant to attack by a Δssp2 mutant, with recovery of Δrap2a in the presence of a Δssp2 attacker being the same as its recovery in the presence of a ΔclpV attacker (Fig. 3C). Additionally, inhibition of Δrap2a target was restored to wild type levels when the Δssp2 mutant attacker was complemented by expression of Ssp2 in trans. The susceptibility of Δrap2a to killing by the wild type strain could also be fully complemented (Fig. S2). Hence, Ssp2 and Rap2a represent a specific, cognate toxin and immunity protein pair. Biochemical studies confirm a strong interaction between cognate secreted toxins and immunity proteins Each of the Ssp and Rap proteins was overproduced and purified (in the case of the Rap proteins, without their N-terminal signal peptides). Complex formation was demonstrated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. All Rap proteins were dimeric in solution, whereas Ssp1 and Ssp2 were monomeric (Fig. 4A and B). When equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a were mixed, all of the protein was detected in a higher molecular weight complex (Fig. 4A) and the same was also observed on mixing Ssp2 and Rap2a (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no complex formation between Ssp1 and Rap1b or between Ssp2 and Rap2b, no additional three-way complexes and no ‘cross’ interactions between Ssp2 and Rap1a or between Ssp1 and Rap2a were observed (Figs 4B and S3). As mixing equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a resulted in detection of only the complexed species, with no unbound form of either protein detectable, this implied a 1:1 molar complex. The 1:1 molar stoichiometry of the Rap1a–Ssp1 complex was confirmed by quantitative analysis of the composition of the higher molecular weight peak using in-gel SYPRO Orange staining (Rickman et al., 2004) (Fig. 4C). Given the dimeric nature of Rap1a and an apparent complex mass by SEC of around 55 kDa [predicted Mw of 1:1 molar complexes are 34.6 kDa (1:1), 69.2 kDa (2:2), 104 kDa (3:3) or 138 kDa (4:4)], this is most consistent with a heterotetrameric Rap1a2–Ssp12 complex. Similar logic supported a Rap2a2–Ssp22 complex (Fig. 4A and C). The SEC analyses suggested stable complexes were formed between the cognate Ssp and Rap proteins. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis of complex formation between Ssp1 and the Rap1a dimer and between Ssp2 and the Rap2a dimer (Fig. 4D) showed that, in both cases, binding was clearly exothermic and tight, at least in the low nanomolar Kd range. Although apparent Kd values of 4–8 nM were obtained, this is approaching the limit of accuracy for conventional ITC (Wiseman et al., 1989). Finally, we took advantage of the tight Rap–Ssp interactions to utilize immobilized Rap2a and Rap1a to affinity-purify secreted Ssp2 or Ssp1, respectively, from culture supernatant (Figs 4E and S3). Mass spectrometry not only confirmed the identity of Ssp1 and Ssp2 but also showed that Ssp2 is not processed on secretion, as almost complete sequence coverage revealed intact N- and C-termini (Fig. S3). For Ssp1, we observed an intact C-terminus but the sequence of the very N-terminus corresponds to several tryptic peptides too small to be detectable by standard mass spectrometry, so we were unable to definitively confirm lack of processing at this end (data not shown).

The secreted small proteins, Ssp1 and Ssp2, exert distinct harmful effects when targeted to the periplasm in Escherichia coli and are neutralized by coexpression of the cognate immunity protein In order to confirm the antibacterial toxin function of Ssp1 and Ssp2 and establish in which cellular compartment they exerted their effect, each protein was produced in E. coli, either in the cytoplasm or artificially targeted to the periplasm (by the N-terminal fusion of the Sec-dependent OmpA signal peptide: sp-Ssp2 or sp-Ssp1). The presence of Ssp2 in the periplasm, but not the cytoplasm, prevented growth of E. coli on LB and minimal media; this toxicity was alleviated by the co-production of Rap2ab (Fig. 5A). Periplasmic Ssp1 was also toxic and its effect alleviated by co-production of Rap1ab (Fig. 5A). However Ssp1 toxicity was only observed at higher expression levels and on minimal media. The periplasmic localization of the Rap proteins in S. marcescens was confirmed by fractionation and immunoblotting of epitope-tagged versions of the protein (Fig. 5B, data not shown).

Next, we also determined whether Ssp2 and/or Ssp1 were essential for the observed antibacterial activity of the S. marcescens T6SS against other bacterial species (Murdoch et al., 2011). Neither protein was required for T6SS-dependent killing of other bacteria (Fig. S4). This implies redundancy of effector function, in other words that other T6SS-secreted toxins are still able to cause killing in the absence of Ssp1 and Ssp2. The Rap family of proteins display a new fold Bioinformatic analysis of the Rap protein sequences predicted similarities between them, despite relatively low sequence conservation, e.g. mature Rap1b and Rap2b share around 20% identity, as do mature Rap2a and Rap2b. All four Rap proteins appeared to be highly acidic, to carry an N-terminal periplasmic targeting signal sequence of about 24 residues, and were predicted to have similar α-helical structures (using PSIPRED). In addition, a cysteine pairing appeared to be conserved. Intriguingly, no structural relative of the Rap proteins could be identified; hence, we sought to obtain three-dimensional models using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Soluble recombinant Rap proteins were only obtained in high yield from E. coli Rosetta-gami (DE3), a strain engineered to support disulphide bond formation, and were dimeric in solution (Fig. 4). Well-ordered crystals of Rap1b and Rap2b were obtained and the structures were elucidated at 1.9 Å and 2.0 Å resolution respectively (Fig. 6, Table 1). A search for structural relatives using PDBeFold (pdbe.org/fold) and ProFunc (Laskowski et al., 2005) was performed using monomers and dimers of Rap1b and Rap2b as templates. The only matches were to short segments of α-helices with Z-scores (< 3) indicating low statistical significance. The lack of any convincing structural relationships indicates that the fold observed in both Rap1b and Rap2b is previously uncharacterized. Fig. 6Structural features of Rap1b and Rap2b dimers.

The PDB accession codes are 4AX2 (Rap1b) and 4B6I (Rap2b). The asymmetric unit of the Rap1b structure consists of a single subunit and crystallographic symmetry generates the dimer. Rap2b has two dimers, formed by subunits A : B and C : D, in the asymmetric unit. The four subunits are similar, with the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between superimposed Cα atoms ranging from 0.5 Å (subunit B and D) to 0.7 Å (subunits A and C). The two proteins display obvious similarities in terms of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (Figs 6 and S5). An overlay of Rap1b and Rap2b subunits matches 71 Cα atoms with a r.m.s.d. of 1.4 Å. Of note is the conservation of the disulphide bond, a key structural feature, likely critical to the stable folding of the subunit and subsequent dimerization of the Rap proteins. The Rap subunit is constructed around a helical bundle of five helices (α2–α6). A disulphide linkage (Cys54–Cys120 in Rap1b, Cys41–Cys101 in Rap2b) tethers α2 and α5 together. This association in turn supports formation of a hydrophobic core that is primarily aliphatic with residues contributed from α2, α4, α5 and α6. Three helices (α2, α3, α5) form a concave surface on one side of the monomer. A series of hydrogen bonding interactions also helps to stabilize the arrangement of α2 and α4. By virtue of being longer than Rap2b, Rap1b has an extension of five residues at the N-terminus and 13 at the C-terminus, the latter of which form a short helix α7. These segments of Rap1b are on the surface of the molecules at opposite ends of the dimer (Fig. 6). The Rap proteins display an extensive dimerization interface (Fig. 6), consistent with the observation that each Rap protein exists as a stable dimer in solution (Fig. 4A and B). The Rap1b dimer uses almost 24% of the accessible surface area of a subunit in formation of the dimer. In the case of Rap2b the value is 20%. Such percentages are indicative of highly stable oligomers (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). The dimer is stabilized by extensive van der Vaals interactions primarily involving aliphatic residues, in conjunction with hydrogen bonding interactions and solvent mediated bridging associations. The most important contributions are from side-chains on the concave surface, formed by α2, α3 and α5, interacting with the partner across the molecular twofold axis of symmetry. Additional interactions involve a self-association of the loop that links α2 and α3, together with the N-terminus α1 and α5. Helices α2 and α5 are thus not only critical for the fold of the Rap subunits but also to creating a suitable interface that leads to a highly stable dimer. This observation, together with the conserved disulphide bond (Fig. 7), ties in with the localization of Rap proteins to the oxidative environment of the periplasm where correct folding to support anti-toxin activity must occur.

Importantly, sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions for the other Rap proteins, in S. marcescens and other organisms, suggest strongly that the novel fold revealed by our crystallographic analyses is generic for this entire family of proteins (Fig. 7). Not only are the main α-helices observed in both crystal structures closely mimicked by the structural predictions of the other members of the family, the Cys residues contributing to the structural disulphide bond are also conserved. Additionally, Rap2b shares slightly higher sequence identity with Rap2a (23% identity for the mature proteins) than it does with Rap1b (20% identity). Given the similarity of the Rap1b and 2b crystal structures, discussed above (Fig. S5), then this provides confidence that Rap2a shares this new fold and indeed that the Rap fold is a defining characteristic of this protein family, many members of which are likely to represent T6SS immunity proteins."
13,PMC9040887,"YQL and AZL proteins in Streptomyces are evolutionarily distinct. E. coli YcaQ and S. sahachiroi AlkZ are the only characterized members of the HTH_42 superfamily and are unique in their ability to unhook ICLs and to provide cellular resistance to cross-linking agents. Both enzymes fully unhook ICLs derived from AZB (Fig. 1A). While AlkZ is specific for AZB-ICLs and is essential to the AZB-producing organism, YcaQ unhooks a broader range of ICLs, including those derived from the simple bifunctional alkylating agent mechlorethamine (Fig. 1B), and displays robust excision activity for N7-methylguanine (7mG) monoadducts (28, 30, 31). YcaQ and AlkZ belong to one of five classes of HTH_42 proteins characterized by domain organization, which accounts for >95% of all HTH_42 proteins (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Approximately two-thirds of the known HTH_42 proteins in prokaryotes are found in Actinobacteria, with ∼25% of those sequences from Streptomycetales (Fig. S1B and C). The remainder are found in several different orders of Bacteria and a very small number (12) in Archaea. FIG 1Phylogenetic organization of YQL/AZL proteins in Streptomyces.

To better understand the evolutionary and phylogenetic breadth of this superfamily in Streptomyces, we collected and analyzed all HTH_42 protein sequences from available genomes using a combination of BLAST searches against Streptomyces genomes in GenBank and HHMR protein domain searches of the BLAST hits against the Pfam database (Table S1). Alignment of the 897 sequences showed that YQL and AZL proteins fall into distinct clades that represent 49% and 43% of the total number of sequences, respectively (Fig. 1C). The clades are defined in part by unique catalytic motifs QΦD (YQL) and (Q/H)ΦQ (AZL), where Φ is an aliphatic residue (30, 31). YQL proteins show a high degree (>75%) of amino acid sequence conservation, whereas the AZL subfamily is more diverse, with only ∼40% amino acid similarity on average. The differences in conservation are consistent with mutation rates as approximated by tip-to-root branch lengths (0.23 for YQL and 0.59 for AZL). In addition, we found that 8% of sequences do not fall into either YQL or AZL clades and contain a unique catalytic consensus sequence, HΦ(S/T)(D/E) (Fig. 1C and D). Because these sequences exhibit greater sequence similarity overall to AZL than YQL, we refer to this third homolog as AZL2. Interestingly, AZL2 is more similar to YQL in its copy number and genomic location (see below) and, thus, is somewhat of a hybrid between AZL and YQL. We verified that proteins within the AZL2 clade contain bona fide DNA glycosylase activity, as the S. caeruleatus AZL2 protein excised 7mG from DNA in a manner similar to that of S. sahachiroi AlkZ (Fig. S1E). List of HTH_42 proteins by organism. List of all Streptomyces YQL (YcaQ-like), AZL (AlkZ-like), or AZL2 (AlkZ-like 2) proteins in this study, along with the GenBank/RefSeq genome/assembly ID for each organism. Homologs are alphabetized by organism. Download Table S1, XLSX file, 0.04 MB. Another striking difference between the YQL and AZL families is that AZL genes are often found in multiple copies and in different combinations in many species of Streptomyces. The copy number differences between the different clades are significant, with the majority (90 to 95%) of YQL and AZL2 homologs found as a single copy and AZL mainly found in multiple (2–5) copies (Fig. 1E). The coincidence of YQL and AZL also varies. Although the most common combination is the presence of a copy of each YQL and AZL, many other combinations are observed (Fig. 1F). The number of species that contain both genes decreases as the copy number increases. For species containing either YQL or AZL (not both), the majority contain a single YQL copy, with just a few species having only AZL present. These results show that both YQL and AZL proteins are broadly distributed across Streptomyces and are distinct with respect to sequence, diversity, and copy number. AZL proteins are prevalent in biosynthetic gene clusters. Given the distinct phylogeny of YQL and AZL proteins, we next examined their proximity to BGCs and characterized the identities of clusters containing a putative homolog. To perform this analysis, we identified all BGCs in the genomes of known Streptomyces species containing an HTH_42 protein, determined the most similar known cluster via BLAST, and extracted the distance in base pairs between the YQL/AZL gene and the nearest 3′ or 5′ end of each BGC (Fig. 2A and Table S2). Strikingly, none of the 442 YQL genes localize to within 20 kb of the most proximal gene cluster in that organism (Fig. 2B). In contrast, AZL genes are primarily found inside or in close genomic proximity to clusters, with an average distance of roughly 2.3 kb from the nearest BGC (compared to 25 kb for YQL). Despite their sequence similarity to AZLs, the AZL2 proteins are more like YQL in that they also are not observed within 20 kb of a BGC (Table S2). FIG 2Streptomyces AZL proteins are found in diverse uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters.

We found that AZL proteins are particularly enriched in uncharacterized Streptomyces BGCs, with 68 homologs localizing within a variety of different types of clusters (Fig. 2C and D and Table S3). Almost half (n = 32; 47%) localize to clusters resembling those producing known DNA-damaging agents, including AZB (n = 5), LL-D4919α1 (LLD, n = 6), HED (n = 4), ficellomycin/vazabitide A (n = 5), and C-1027/leinamycin (n = 2) (12, 16–18, 40, 41). In addition, several other clusters are related to potential DNA-damaging agents on the basis of a reactive epoxide functional group in the natural product, including angucycline-like molecules (n = 4) herboxidiene and asukamycin. The remaining 10 uncharacterized BGCs are related to clusters that produce macrolides/terpenes, tambromycin-like compounds, and various RiPPs/depsipeptides (Fig. 2C and D).

Download Table S3, XLSX file, 0.01 MB. Bacterial genes of similar function or in a particular pathway are frequently clustered into neighborhoods or operons within the genome; thus, we investigated the nearest neighbors of Streptomyces YQL and AZL genes. We collected gene ontology (GO) terms describing the biological functions of the five nearest neighbors on either side of 40 YQL genes, 40 AZL genes inside BGCs, and 40 AZL genes outside BGCs, which collectively represent ∼15% of the total of all homologs. Biological processes were grouped into three categories: metabolism, signaling/cell function, and genetic information processing. Several key differences were found between the neighborhoods of AZL genes inside versus outside clusters (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2). AZL genes within BGCs were more often found near terpenoid/polyketide/nonribosomal protein synthesis and resistance/defense genes. The defense genes fell into several types: ABC transporters/permeases, α/β-fold hydrolases (VOC resistance proteins), DinB DNA-damage inducible hydrolases, and other AZL proteins. For those AZL genes found outside BGCs, there is an abundance of neighbors involved in cell wall biosynthesis, cell cycle control, and signal transduction. In contrast, there were no significant differences between AZL neighbors involved in processing genetic information inside versus outside clusters (Fig. 2E). In contrast to the variation in the function of AZL gene neighbors, the functions of YQL neighbors (outside clusters) are nearly invariant and are composed of a variety of different gene types with no apparent functional connection between them (Fig. 2F). The functions of many of these neighbors have not been elucidated in Streptomyces, but some are homologous to N-acetyltransferase, a two-component transcription factor/histidine kinase, and a DNA helicase (ComF) involved in transformation competence. Thus, both the sequences and the genomic neighborhoods of YQL proteins are relatively conserved and always found outside of BGCs, in contrast to the more variable copy number, sequence, and neighborhood of AZL genes prevalent within BGCs. Nearest neighbor analysis of AZL proteins. Gene ontology (GO) analysis for AZL nearest neighbors (±5 open reading frames) inside (A) and outside (B) BGCs. Venn diagrams depict the number of neighbors involved in metabolism (blue), signaling and cell function (green), and processing of genetic information (orange). The boxes represent subdivisions of each of the three functions, colored with respect to the key below. Uncharacterized/hypothetical proteins (40 inside, 90 outside) that could not be identified by homology are not included in these data. Full GO term analysis can be found in Tables S5 to S7. Download FIG S2, EPS file, 0.9 MB. Characterized BGCs containing AZL proteins. With the discovery that a significant proportion of AZL proteins reside within BGCs, we took a closer look at the nine characterized BGCs identified to contain an AlkZ homolog in the MIBiG database (Table S3). Four of these produce known DNA-alkylating agents (Fig. 3A), which contain reactive epoxide moieties like AZB that are scaffolded on diverse natural product backbones (Fig. 3A). Whereas AZB is a bifunctional alkylating agent, HED, trioxacarcin A (TXNA), and LL-D49194α1 (LLD) are monofunctional alkylating agents that react with nitrogen N 7 of guanine in specific nucleotide sequences via their epoxide rings and also intercalate the DNA helix via their planar ring systems (12, 42). TXNA and LLD clusters each contain two AlkZ paralogs (TxnU2/U4 and LldU1/U5), whereas the HED cluster contains one (HedH4) that resides between the two polyketide synthase genes.

The remaining five AZL-containing clusters in MIBiG produce compounds that are not known to alkylate DNA but that share some structural characteristics with the alkylating agents described above (Fig. 3B). Aclacinomycin contains an anthracycline core surrounded by sugars that allow it to intercalate into DNA and act as a topoisomerase I poison, potentially generating downstream DNA damage (43). Asukamycin contains a modified PKS scaffold and an electrophilic epoxide ring and has been shown to act as both a farsenyltransferase inhibitor and a molecular glue between the UBR7 E3 ubiquitin ligase and the TP53 tumor suppressor, leading to cell death (44, 45). Armeniaspirol contains a unique chlorinated pyrrole and inhibits the AAA+ proteases ClpXP and ClpYQ, leading to cell division arrest in Gram-positive bacteria (46). The other two BGCs produce compounds of known structure but unknown function. Tambromycin and JBIR-34/35 are similar NRPS compounds containing densely substituted chlorinated indole and methyloxazoline moieties (47). The presence of AZL proteins in these clusters suggests that these compounds are genotoxins or otherwise react with DNA and/or that these particular AZL homologs have a function outside DNA repair. The AZL protein within the HED BGC is a DNA glycosylase specific for HED-DNA lesions and provides cellular resistance to HED toxicity. The alkZ gene embedded within the AZB BGC provides exquisite resistance to the potent cytotoxicity of this natural product (27, 28). To determine if AlkZ homologs other than those in the AZB BGC provide self-resistance to their cognate natural products, we characterized the DNA glycosylase and cellular resistance activities of HedH4 for HED-DNA adducts. HED is a potent antibiotic/antitumor agent that induces a strong DNA damage response (48). The bisepoxide side chain alkylates the N7 position of guanines in 5′-(C/T)G sequences (Fig. 4A), the highly oxidized aromatic polyketide intercalates the DNA helix, and two C-glycosidic linked aminosugars interact with the minor groove (12). We generated site-specifically labeled HED-guanosine adducts in DNA by reacting purified compound with an oligonucleotide containing a HED target sequence, d(TGTA). The HED-DNA adduct was stable relative to other N7-alkylguanine lesions as judged by thermal depurination (Fig. S3B) (31, 49). We first assessed the ability of purified HedH4 to hydrolyze HED-DNA using a gel-based glycosylase assay that monitors alkaline cleavage of the AP site product (30, 31). Reaction of HedH4 with HED-DNA followed by hydroxide work-up resulted in β- and δ-elimination products, consistent with production of an AP site from DNA glycosylase-mediated excision of the N-glycosidic bond of the HED-guanosine nucleotide (Fig. 4A and B). We verified the identity of the excision product as HED-guanine by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) (Fig. 4C). To verify that the HED-guanine product was not generated by a contaminating enzyme and to examine the conservation of the catalytic QΦQ motif, we purified alanine mutants of the two glutamine residues and tested their activity under single-turnover conditions (Fig. 4D and Fig. S3A and C). The calculated rate constant (kcat) for wild-type HedH4 was at least 7.8 ± 0.5 min−1 (the reaction was complete at the earliest time point). Relative to the wild type, the Q41A mutant was at least 225-fold slower (kcat = 0.04 ± 0.01 min−1) and the Q43A mutant at least 10-fold slower (kcat = 0.8 ± 0.2 min−1), indicating that both Gln residues in the HedH4 QΦQ play a role in HED-guanine excision. FIG 4HedH4 excises hedamycin-guanine adducts from DNA and provides cellular resistance to hedamycin toxicity. (A) HED modification of deoxyguanosine in DNA forms a HED-DNA adduct that is hydrolyzed by HedH4 to generate an abasic (AP) site in the DNA and free HED-guanine.

We probed specificity of HedH4 for HED-DNA adducts, first by asking whether the HED-guanosine lesion was a substrate for other bacterial alkylpurine DNA glycosylases with various specificities. E. coli AlkA and YcaQ and Bacillus cereus AlkC and AlkD excise a relatively broad range of alkyl-DNA adducts (31, 50–55). S. sahachiroi AlkZ, S. bottropensis TxnU2 and TxnU4, and S. vinaceusdrappus LldU1 and LldU5, like HedH4, are found in BGCs that produce bulky N7-alkyl- and intercalating DNA adducts (Fig. 3A), and each is specific for their cognate toxin (31, 56). Compared to HedH4, which excises 100% of the HED-guanine from DNA, none of the 10 alkylpurine DNA glycosylases tested showed any appreciable activity for HED-DNA after 1 h (Fig. 4E). Thus, the HED-DNA adduct is hydrolyzed only by the glycosylase found in the HED BGC. We next examined the ability of HedH4 to excise N7-alkylpurine lesions that act as substrates for other YQL and AZL enzymes. Interestingly, HedH4 showed no significant activity for the simple methyl adduct 7mG, which is removed by most alkylpurine DNA glycosylases, including E. coli YcaQ and S. sahachiroi AlkZ (Fig. 4F). HedH4 was also unable to hydrolyze TXNA-guanosine, a substrate for TxnU4 from the TXNA BGC (Fig. 4F) (56). We also tested the ability of HedH4 to unhook ICLs derived from AZB (Fig. 1A) and an 8-atom nitrogen mustard, NM8 (Fig. 4G), which are substrates for S. sahachiroi AlkZ and E. coli YcaQ, respectively. Compared to AlkZ and YcaQ, HedH4 showed little to no activity for either ICL. Thus, HedH4 is highly specific for DNA adducts derived from its cognate natural product. We next tested if the hedH4 gene provides heterologous resistance to HED cytotoxicity in cells. E. coli transformed with either vector containing hedH4 constitutively expressed at low levels or vector alone were grown in the presence of increasing amounts of HED (Fig. S3D to G). HedH4 provided modest protection against HED, as cells expressing HedH4 grew to a higher density at all HED concentrations (Fig. 4I and Fig. S3F and G) and had a higher 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) than cells treated with vector alone (HedH4, 5.9 μM ± 0.7; vector, 3.9 μM ± 0.4). The sensitivity differences between HedH4 and the vector control were more pronounced from a colony dilution assay performed under log-phase growth conditions (Fig. 4J). Cells expressing empty vector displayed an IC50 value of 11.1 ± 1.5 μM, while cells expressing HedH4 displayed a 4-fold reduction in sensitivity to HED (48.1 ± 13.8 μM). These results indicate that HedH4 is a DNA glycosylase specific for HED-DNA adducts and provides resistance to cells exposed to the antibiotic. YQL proteins from Actinobacteria hydrolyze simple N7-alkylguanosine lesions and interstrand cross-links. We previously characterized E. coli YcaQ to have robust activity toward 7mG and NM-ICLs (Fig. 1B and 4G), a substrate preference distinct from AZB- and HED-specific S. sahachiroi AlkZ and HedH4 (Fig. 4F and H) (31). We therefore were interested in determining if other proteins of the YQL subfamily were functional YcaQ orthologs. We purified YQL proteins from the Actinobacteria Thermomonospora curvata and Thermobifida fusca and tested their ability to hydrolyze 7mG and unhook NM8-ICLs (Fig. 5). Both proteins showed significant activity for both substrates, providing evidence that the YQL subfamily in general has comparable specificity for simple N7-alkylguanine lesions, distinguishing it biochemically from the AZL subfamily.

14,PMC9524394,"Statistics of antibiotic resistance open reading frames Non-redundant gene catalogs resulting from mWGS were subjected to Blastp with CARD (the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database) in order to detect and characterize ORFs referring to the ARGs and metabolic processes existing in the rhizobiome of Moringa oleifera and surrounding bulk soil microbiomes. Unique ORFs described in Supplementary Tables 2, 3 were generated either from assembled reads of a given soil sample or from scaftigs resulted from gathering and re-assembling unassembled reads of all samples (NOVO_MIX) referring to low abundant reads, respectively. The two tables described these ORFs, after being aligned with analog sequences in CARD, in terms of the mismatch and gap sizes (in nt) and nucleotides assigning gene start and end points. A total of 809 and 1,142 ORFs were generated from the two previously mentioned categories of gene assembly (Supplementary Tables 2, 3, respectively). Of which, a number of 1,416 ORFs across the two categories of gene assembly referring to a total of 183 ARGs were detected (Supplementary Table 4). The results in Supplementary Table 4 indicated that a number of 79 of these ARGs was represented by only a single ORF (referring to non-abundant ARGs), while the other ARGs were represented by two or more ORFs (referring to abundant, highly abundant, and the most highly abundant ARGs). Supplementary Figure 1 indicated the 30 most abundant ARGs referring to the top highly abundant ARGs with > 20 ORFs/ARG. Supplementary Table 4 indicates that the most highly abundant ARGs include mtrA (189 ORFs), soxR (104 ORFs), oleC (103 ORFs), golS (88 ORFs), and novA (74 ORFs) genes. Differential abundance of antibiotic resistance genes The results in Figure 1 indicated almost no differences in the total number of ARGs in samples of the two soil type (average of ∼125 ARGs/sample), while abundance of these ARGs in terms of ORFs/ARG was extremely higher in rhizosphere of M. oleifera than that in bulk soil microbiome. Supplementary Table 4 indicates abundance of ARGs across types of microbiome surrounding M. oleifera, while Figure 2 refers to the most highly abundant ARGs with > 20 ORFs/ARG. Abundance of these 14 ARGs in samples within each soil type was homogeneous, except for three genes, e.g., myrA, vanSO and dfrA3, that showed non-homogeneous abundance of ORFs among bulk soil microbiome samples (Supplementary Table 5). These three ARGs were not analyzed further. FIGURE 1Number (A) and abundance (no.

Estimated abundance (in unit ppm) of ARGs for the different samples of the two types of microbiomes is shown in Supplementary Table 5, while the most highly abundant ARGs (>20 ORFs/ARG) in microbiomes of the two soil types are shown in Figure 3A and described based on CARD information in Supplementary Table 6. The results in the table indicated that abundance of ARGs with > 20 ORFs/ARG was significantly higher in rhizobiome than that of bulk soil microbiome, except for golS gene, that showed no significant difference (P = 0.315) between samples of the two soil types. The results of relative abundance of ARGs supported those of abundance only for mtrA, novA, and parY mutant, as relative abundance of these three ARGs in rhizobiome is higher than that of bulk soil microbiome (Figure 3B). However, the results for golS (Pontel et al., 2007) and rpoB2 (Ishikawa et al., 2006) genes showed higher relative abundance in bulk soil microbiome than that in rhizobiome (Figures 3B, 4). We assume the results of both abundance and relative abundance of ARGs ought to be considered.

Differential abundance of bacterial phyla and antibiotic resistance mechanisms ARGs were further categorized to metabolic processes or AMR families at the bacterial phylum level (Supplementary Table 7). The analysis was focused on 12 bacterial phyla and 55 categories of ARG-related metabolic processes. Based on abundance results, Figure 5 describes the five most common phyla, e.g., Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes, and the 13 most common metabolic processes. Abundance of phyla with > 30 ORFs regardless of metabolic process, abundance of metabolic processes regardless of phylum, as well as abundance of the interaction between phyla and metabolic processes are shown in Supplementary Figures 2, 3, and 5, respectively. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria represent the most abundant bacterial phyla regardless of metabolic processes (Supplementary Figure 2). The eight most abundant metabolic processes shown in Supplementary Table 8 almost refer to all the previously detected highly abundant ARGs in Supplementary Table 6, except for rpoB2 and ileS genes, whose metabolic processes, e.g., rifamycin-resistant beta-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) and Bifidobacterium ileS conferring resistance to mupirocin, respectively, were less abundant (with < 30, Supplementary Figure 3), thus, were not analyzed further. These selected metabolic processes refer to three resistance mechanisms (Supplementary Table 8) namely antibiotic efflux, antibiotic target alteration and antibiotic target protection. FIGURE 5Circle chart of metabolic processes at the bacterial phylum level of the top highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes (>20 ORFs/ARG) in different samples of rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiome s surrounding Moringa oleifera.

While, colors in outer circle refer to detailed relative abundance of different metabolic processes per bacterial phylum (right side) and detailed relative abundance of different bacterial phyla per metabolic process (left side). AMR families referring to antibiotic efflux in this study include resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), ATP-binding cassette (ABC), major facilitator superfamily (MFS) antibiotics as well as the two-component regulatory kdpDE (potassium dependent D/E) system. AMR families referring to antibiotic target alteration included glycopeptide resistance gene cluster (vanRO), aminocoumarin resistance parY and aminocoumarin self-resistance parY. While, AMR family referring to antibiotic target protection included RbpA bacterial rpoB-binding protein, only. As indicated in Supplementary Table 6, ARGs of mtrA, soxR, and golS participate in the metabolic process of RND antibiotic efflux, while oleC and novA genes participate in the metabolic process of ABC antibiotic efflux. soxR and kdpE genes participate in the metabolic processes of MFS antibiotic efflux and two-component regulatory kdpDE (potassium dependent D/E) system, respectively. Thus, soxR gene is the only participating in two metabolic processes. vanRO, parY mutant, and rbpA genes participate in the metabolic process of glycopeptide resistance gene cluster, in the metabolic process of aminocoumarin resistance/self-resistance, and in the metabolic process of RbpA bacterial rpoB-binding protein, respectively (Supplementary Table 6). The results of circle chart of Figure 5 referring to the left and right sides of inner circle support those of Supplementary Figures 2, 3 in terms of abundance, respectively. In terms of relative abundance, the results in Figure 5 (outer circle) and Supplementary Figure 4 indicate that Proteobacteria relatively dominates in terms of RND antibiotic efflux pump followed by Actinobacteria. However, the other seven metabolic processes are relatively dominated by Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria also showed high relative abundance of processes MFS antibiotic efflux pump and two-component regulatory kdpDE system. The results involving the most highly abundant ARGs, along with their metabolic processes and resistance mechanisms referring to the five bacterial phyla are summarized in Figure 6.

Different intensities of the red color of the circles refer to the level of differential abundance in bacterial phyla. Validation of the resistomic data for the two soil types surrounding M. oleifera was done at the metatranscriptomic level via qPCR (Supplementary Figure 5). The experiment involved four highly abundant ARGs namely mtrA (acc. no. ARO:3000816), soxR (acc. no. ARO:3004107), oleC (acc. no. ARO:3003748), and novA (acc. no. ARO:3002522). Metabolic process of the first two ARGs is the RND antibiotic efflux pump, while that of the second two ARGs is the ABC antibiotic efflux pump. The results of qPCR for the metatranscriptomic data in Supplementary Figure 5 align with those of the in silico genomic dataset in Figure 3."
15,PMC10303725,"3.1. Complete Genome Information of Subtercola sp. PAMC28395 As shown in Table 1, the complete genome of PAMC28395 comprises a circular chromosome of 3,214,492 bp with a GC content of 64.5%. The number of contigs was one. A total of 2930 genes were predicted on the chromosome, of which 2849 protein-encoding genes were functionally assigned, with the remaining genes predicted as hypothetical proteins. We also found that 24 pseudogenes, six rRNA genes, 48 tRNA genes, and three other RNA genes that were distributed in the genome. The complete genome sequence of the PAMC28395 strain was deposited with an accession number of NZ_CP076547.1 in the NCBI database. The circular genome map provided a comprehensive characterization of PAMC28395. In addition, we provided classification in 20 functional COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups) categories (Figure 1). The most numerous COG categories are amino acid transport and metabolism (category E, 489 genes), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (category G, 235 genes), transcription (category K, 215 genes), energy production and conversion (category C, 170 genes), and inorganic ion transport and metabolism (category P, 170 genes), except for unknown function genes (category S, 489 genes) (Figure 1B). The fraction of proteins from a given genome assigned to particular COG functional categories is a helpful genome feature. It has been adopted by the Genome Standards Consortium as an essential characteristic of newly sequenced genomes [34]. Based on the COG annotation results, the predicted characteristics of the bacterial genome of PAMC28395 indicate the presence of the “metabolism” group, specifically falling between categories E and G. Category E corresponds to amino acid transport and metabolism, and category G pertains to carbohydrate transport and metabolism. This suggests that the gene content related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism is highly conserved within the genome of PAMC28395. In general, bacteria rely on cellular respiration to break down carbohydrates and obtain energy. This energy is then utilized in various cellular processes, including photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is converted into carbohydrates. This process temporarily stores energy in high-energy molecules such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). These metabolic mechanisms enable bacteria to adapt effectively to extreme environments [35,36]. We identified some genes related to amino acid transport, transcription, carbohydrate transport, and energy production or conversion. Thus, we predicted that this strain’s energy storage and carbohydrate metabolism functions would be higher than those of other bacteria strains because carbohydrates play a crucial role in many essential metabolic pathways. 3.2. 16S rRNA Phylogenetic Analysis and Calculation of ANI and dDDH The identification of PAMC28395 was verified using 16S rRNA sequence analysis (Figure 2A). Further phylogenetic analysis of PAMC28395′s 16S rRNA sequence in comparison with those from some representative families within Microbacteriaceae (Subtercola, Marisediminicola, Lysinibacter, Frondihabitans, and Glaciihabitans) showed that the PAMC28395 strain was most closely related to Subtercola species. This strain was phylogenetically placed with S. frigoramans and S. vilae. Results from phylogenetic analysis, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, and EzBioCloud revealed that it was closely related to S. frigoramans K265T (99.44%), S. vilae DB165T (97.83%), and S. lobariae 9583bT (96.87%). These results confirm that the PAMC28395 strain belongs to the family Microbacteriaceae, phylum Actinobacteria. However, strain S. frigoramans K265T was reported based only on 16S rRNA sequence comparison. Since there were little chemical taxonomic and phenotypic data to support this, it was reported that strain K265 should be included in a genus as a new species, for which the name S. frigoramans gen. nov. was suggested [10]. Indeed, using a measure called “completeness” allows for a reliable calculation of sequence similarity between PCR-derived (amplified) sequences and genome-derived reference sequences for the 16S rRNA gene. EZBioCloud, a bioinformatics platform, suggests utilizing this measure for such calculations [37]. Based on the analysis conducted using EZBioCloud, it was observed that there are 94 gaps or differences in the 16S rRNA sequence between strain PAMC28395 (1531 bp sequenced from the genome) and S. frigoramans K265T (1437 bp obtained through PCR). EZBioCloud calculated the similarity based on the completeness of the reference sequences. For instance, when the completeness of S. frigoramans K265T is 99.3%, the calculated similarity with strain PAMC28395 is 99.44%. Similarly, when considering S. vilae DB165T with a completeness of 100%, the calculated similarity is 97.83%. These results suggest that strain PAMC28395 likely belongs to the Subtercola genus and exhibits similarity to S. frigoramans. However, it is important to conduct further confirmatory experiments to provide more concrete evidence. Based on the observed differences and similarities, there is a possibility that PAMC28395 could be classified as a new species within the Subtercola genus, potentially positioned between S. vilae and S. frigoramans. There is little genomic information on the Subtercola genus in the NCBI database. Not all strains mentioned above have whole genomes. Among registered strains in the NCBI database, only the two strains of PAMC28395 and AK-R2A1-2 have complete genome sequences among Subtercola species. However, strain AK-R2A1-2 has recently been identified as S. endophyticus by Jiang et al. [14]. These strains were chosen based on their whole genome sequences and placement within the same phylogenetic group in the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree. Consequently, we compared average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between our strain and five strains with the sequenced genome data (Table S1). This comparison aimed to assess the ANI values and determine the bacteria species identified between our strain and the selected reference strains. In Figure 2B, the closest ANI value between PAMC28395 and the other type of strain was 89.58%, which was considerably lower than the threshold value of 96% for the boundary of species circumscription. ANI analysis shows the average nucleotide identity of all bacterial orthologous genes classified between any two genome sequences and offers identification between bacterial strains of the same or closely related species (i.e., species showing over 96% ANI values) [38,39]. The results presented in Supplementary Table S2 provide additional evidence suggesting that PAMC28395 exhibits digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values (%) ranging from 17.9% to 60.7% when compared to the genomes of four other strains. Typically, genomes with dDDH > 70% are regarded as belonging to the same species. In addition, dDDH values ≤70% are commonly used as an indicator that the tested organism belongs to a different species than the reference strain [40]. However, the results clearly indicate that PAMC28395 is indeed a distinct species, differing from both S. frigoramans DSM13057 (60.7%) and S. vilae DB165 (18.7%). This conclusion is supported by the significantly lower values observed for PAMC28395, which fall below the 70% threshold. Therefore, both ANI and dDDH values support that PAMC28395 should be identified as a novel species between S. vilae and S. frigoramans in the Subtercola genus. Further clarification of the new species within the Subtercola genus would require additional experiments. By conducting comprehensive experiments such as phenotypic characterization, biochemical assays, growth conditions analysis, and additional genetic analysis, the potential new species’ unique characteristics and distinct traits can be elucidated, leading to more accurate classification and characterization. While phylogenetic analysis can provide valuable insights and comparing ANI and dDDH calculates the value, experimental validation is crucial for definitively establishing a new species. Thus, we have mentioned the strain as Subtercola sp. PAMC28395. 3.3. CAZyme-Encoding Genes in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395 CAZymes are carbohydrate-degrading enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides such as cellulose into simple sugars. This is crucial for the survival of bacteria. Through complete genome analysis of various strains and cold-adapted species, evolutionary insights can be revealed. For example, it has been reported that Bacillus sp. TK-2 exhibits adaptability to cold environments through the expression of CAZyme genes involved in the degradation of polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicellulose [41]. However, the characteristics of glycogen metabolism in prokaryotes have not been well studied compared to eukaryotes. Particularly, the metabolism of microorganisms isolated from cold environments is not well known. This study predicted the role of CAZymes in cold adaptation and the characteristics of PAMC28395 involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism. Since genes related to carbohydrate metabolism are expected to be highly conserved, we conducted a detailed analysis of CAZymes. Among a total of 2849 identified protein-encoding genes in strain PAMC28395, 92 were annotated and classified into the group of CAZymes (glycoside hydrolase, GH; glycosyltransferase, GT; carbohydrate esterase, CE; auxiliary activity, AA; polysaccharide lyase, PL; and carbohydrate-binding module, CBM) using dbCAN3. Results provided insight into the carbohydrate utilization mechanisms of strain PAMC28395. Using the Signal P tool, we predicted the retention of 12 genes encoding signal peptides in the CAZymes of strain PAMC28395. In addition, we anticipated that enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism would be distributed as follows: 31 GHs, 47 GTs, 7 CEs, 4 AAs, 3PLs, and 2 CBMs (Figure 3A). GH gene annotation revealed that the PAMC28395 genome sequence contained genes involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism pathways, such as β-glucosidase (GH1, EC3.2.1.21), 1,4-alpha-glucan (glycogen) branching enzyme (CBM48 and GH13_9, EC 2.4.1.18), malto-oligosyltrehalose synthase (GH13_26, EC 5.4.99.15), limit dextrin alpha-1,6-maltotetraose-hydrolase (GH13_11, EC 3.2.1.196), trehalose phosphorylase (GH65, EC 2.4.1.64), and malto-oligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (GH13_10, EC 3.2.1.141) (Table 2). Glycogen is a homopolysaccharide composed of alpha-D-glucose held together by alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds. It is mainly found in animals, fungi, and bacteria. It acts as a significant source of energy storage in bacteria [42]. Organisms in cold environments require efficient energy storage systems to adapt and survive. Glycogen synthesis is one such system, particularly in bacteria which employ a passive energy-saving strategy through slow glycogen degradation in nutrient-deprived conditions. Glycogen is hypothesized to function as a long durability energy reserve, which has been reported as a Durable Energy Storage Mechanism (DESM) to account for the long-term survival of some bacteria in cold environments [43]. In recent years, there have been numerous reports on the ability of microbes isolated from cold environments to adapt to and survive in these conditions, particularly concerning glycogen metabolism identified by genome analysis. For example, Shigella sp. strain PAMC28760, Arthrobacter sp. strain PAMC25564, and Nakamurella sp. strain PAMC28650 isolated from cold environments have been reported to be able to adapt and survive in cold environments through glycogen metabolism [44,45,46]. Moreover, we found interesting CAZyme-related genes in genome information. Microbial α-galactosidases (GH36) play a crucial role in the breakdown of plant-derived α-galactosidases by human gut microbiota. Here, we identified another GH36 gene, similar to agaSK. When expressed in vivo, it might contribute to α-galactosidase activity. Enzyme AgaSK isolated from Ruminococcus gnavus E1 (RG E1) has recently been characterized as a bifunctional enzyme composed of a GH36 α-galactosidase and a kinase domain that can phosphorylate sucrose provided by raffinose hydrolysis, highlighting a putative novel glycolytic pathway in bacteria for sucrose assimilation. It shows partial plant oligosaccharide-degrading abilities. It plays an essential role in metabolizing complex oligosaccharides, working in conjunction with other GH enzymes and contributing to the degradation of mixed fibers [47]. We also identified a gene of the GH92 family as a promising candidate for a novel and highly active bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidase. Bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidases are attractive enzymes for in vitro enzymatic glycan modification of high-mannose-type N-glycans in natural and recombinant glycoproteins to hybrid or complex-type N-glycans. They are also appealing targets for a better understanding of how commensals and other bacteria can utilize host glycoprotein glycans to shape the microbiota community [48]. Recently, it has been shown that some bacteria can use high-mannose-type N-glycans efficiently for growth but not sialylated N-linked glycans [49,50]. 3.4. Comparison of CAZyme Patterns with Those from Closely Related Species By revealing key CAZymes involved in the cold adaptation of Subtercola species, this study offers valuable insights into the evolutionary strategies of these microorganisms. It presents exciting opportunities for developing novel biotechnological tools with diverse industrial applications. Considering the accessibility of available genome data, complete genomes of five strains, including our strain, were chosen for comparative analysis of CAZymes. Our results showed that the number of total CAZymes in each genome ranged from a minimum of 95 (PAMC28395) to a maximum of 157 (Subtercola sp. DB165). Our genome sequence analysis of the five strains confirmed our predictions, revealing a consistent pattern of 23 CAZyme genes across all strains, including AA3, AA7, CE4, CE14, CE9, GH1, GH3, GH13, GH15, GH23, GH63, GT1, GT2, GT4, GT20, GT28, GT35, GT39, GT51, GT76, GT83, CBM32, and CBM48 (Figure 3B). Of particular note, CAZyme member GH13 associated with glycogen and trehalose metabolism and energy storage was identified in all strains, suggesting its fundamental role in the degradation of glycogen and trehalose pathways. The presence of a diverse family of CAZymes and related genes for proteins with a strong ability to store and release energy in Subtercola species isolated from extreme environments highlights their adaptive strategy for survival in a cold environment. Despite being a complete genome, PAMC28395 had the fewest number of CAZyme genes among the five strains analyzed. Although CAZymes are predominantly responsible for the degradation and biosynthesis/modification of polysaccharides, not all members of this protein group are secreted. Additionally, we identified minor differences in CAZyme gene patterns among Subtercola species. However, it is noteworthy that the two genes related to α-galactosidases (GH36) and bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidase (GH92) had the highest probability of expression in this strain. In conclusion, our genomic comparison demonstrates the potential of these strains to degrade complex polysaccharides and store energy. 3.5. Glycogen/Trehalose and Pentose Phosphate Metabolic Pathway in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395 We investigated the glycogen/trehalose and pentose phosphate metabolic pathway to confirm related cold adaptation to a cold environment in PAMC28395 (Figures S1 and S2). This analysis assumed that the PAMC28395 strain would use glycogen/trehalose and pentose phosphate metabolic pathways to obtain energy or degrade polysaccharides. These strains showed related genes for one main pathway of trehalose biosynthesis and three pathways of producing D-glucose, which is responsible for maltose recycling to maltodextrins. In addition, we can predict that these enzymes constitute another method that bacteria use for sugar uptake when their energy source is phosphoenolpyruvate. As a result, this strain probably produces polysaccharides by themselves and from an external source using phosphoenolpyruvate rather than consuming energy because they have a related recycling gene for degradation or production. To adapt and survive in a cold environment, organisms must have well-developed functional energy storage systems. Glycogen is one of the carbohydrates stored in animal cells. It is used as an energy reserve to adapt and survive in a cold environment. It has a three-dimensional molecular structure comprising the most representative α-1,4-glucoside linkage and α-1,6-glucosidase linkage among carbohydrates [51]. Enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism include glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, branching enzyme, debranching enzyme, and phosphatase. These enzymes belong to the GH 13 family of CAZymes. Understanding the regulation and function of these enzymes in glycogen metabolism is essential for comprehending the mechanisms underlying energy homeostasis and metabolic adaptation in response to cold exposure. The classical pathway (CP) of bacterial glycogen metabolism includes five essential enzymes: ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (GlgC), glycogen synthase (GlgA), glycogen branching enzyme (GlgB), glycogen phosphorylase (GlgP), and glycogen debranching enzyme (GlgX). GlgB degradation of α-1,6-linkages in the branch portion of the glycogen molecule is needed to assist GlgP in producing glucose molecules. Finally, phosphatase regulates the metabolic pathway by removing molecules containing phosphate groups generated during glycogen synthesis and breakdown processes [42,44]. Moreover, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a major pathway for glucose catabolism, along with glycolysis. However, the extent of its contribution to bacterial metabolic adaptation, particularly in the context of bacteria, remains largely unexplored. The PPP comprises two branches: an oxidative branch and a non-oxidative branch. Glucose flux through the oxidative branch generates NADPH, which is an essential reductant in anabolic processes. Meanwhile, the non-oxidative branch produces ribose-5P (R-5P) from glucose, which can be converted reversibly into glycolytic intermediates such as glyceraldehyde 3P (GA-3P) and fructose-6P (F-6P) [52,53]. Although a vast majority of bacteria isolated from extreme environments are capable of using C5 sugars as a carbon and energy source, the underlying metabolic pathways are not yet fully understood [54]. Genome sequence analysis of PAMC28395 and bioinformatic analysis have provided valuable insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptability to cold environments. The strain utilizes the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for the degradation of C5 sugars and the production of pentose phosphates necessary for anabolic processes during glucose growth. Moreover, PAMC28395 possesses a range of carbohydrate-active enzymes and pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, enabling the degradation or production of various types of carbohydrates. These findings highlight the high adaptability of these strains to their environment, particularly cold environments. The presence of genes related to glycogen, trehalose, maltodextrin, and PPPs suggests their involvement in the degradation of polysaccharides, which may have implications for industrial applications. Microorganisms harboring these genes have the potential to produce D-glucose economically and harness their energy to thrive in cold environments. This adaptability is a characteristic often observed in bacteria thriving in extreme conditions such as cold environments. Furthermore, the results imply that the metabolism of trehalose in microorganisms depends on the specific metabolic requirements dictated by the environmental conditions they encounter. 3.6. Analysis of Secondary Metabolite BGCs and Antibiotic Resistance Genes The production of bacterial secondary metabolites has also been proposed as a strategy for adaptation to extreme environments due to their potential diversity. Typically, secondary metabolites are synthesized through biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which contain genes encoding core biosynthetic enzymes, transporters, and regulators found physically co-located. This knowledge drove us to investigate the genetic traits of the Subtercola genus evolutionarily, explicitly targeting those associated with cold environment adaptation to shed light on factors contributing to the bacterium’s diverse range of secondary metabolites. As shown in Table 3, antiSMASH analysis indicated that PAMC28395 had a total of five BGCs related to oligosaccharides, terpene, type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS), beta-lactone, and non-alpha poly-amino acids such as e-polylysin (NAPAA). Comparing putative BGCs in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, Subtercola sp. AK-R2A1-2, Subtercola sp. Z020, S. frigoramans DSM13057, and S. vilae DB165 suggested that four clusters (terpene, T3PKS, beta-lactone, and NAPAA) were conserved with few differences (Tables S3 and S4, and Figures S3–S5). Except for AK-R2A1-2, none of the other strains had BGCs containing the redox cofactor (Figure 4A), which was thought to be associated with adaptation to low temperatures [55]. Instead, gene cluster-encoding branched-chain fatty acids/oligosaccharides were found in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, Subtercola sp. Z020, S. frigoramans DSM13057, and S. vilae DB165, but not in Subtercola sp. AK-R2A1-2. In this gene region, while branched-chain fatty acid BGCs showed high similarity to known clusters, oligosaccharide BGCs containing three GTs were detected with low similarity to known clusters (Figure 4B). Considering that oligosaccharides are known to protect cell membranes through an ice inhibition effect [56,57], these biosynthetic genes may play an important role in the survival of those strains. As an additional analysis for the characterization of BGCs, antibiotic resistance genes were identified with the ARTS tool [33]. This tool enables prioritization of BGCs corresponding to antibiotics based on the understanding that antibiotic producers harbor self-resistance genes within the same BGCs responsible for making antibiotics [58]. Comparing antibiotic resistance genes in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, Subtercola sp. AK-R2A1-2, Subtercola sp. Z020, S. frigoramans DSM13057, and S. vilae DB165 revealed that strain PAMC28395 contained more core genes in BGCs than other strains (Table 4). Regarding the results of Subtercola sp. Z020 and S. vilae DB165, the number of core gene hits detected in a BGC was lower than the actual value due to analysis using a draft genome. Additionally, 19 resistance model genes were detected in PAMC28395, including dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, pyruvate carboxylase, pentapeptide repeat protein, DNA gyrases, DNA topoisomerases, and ornithine carbamoyltransferases (Table S5). In particular, the beta-lactone BGC described above contained pyruvate carboxylase, suggesting the possibility of producing inhibitors of this enzyme."
16,PMC7002339,"Monasones are bona fide SMs of M. ruber M7. Our previous studies have indicated that MonAzPs are largely (but not entirely) absent and that trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and monasones 3 and 4 (Fig. 1) are the major products of an M. ruber M7 mutant in which mrpigC, a gene within the MABGC, was deleted (16–18). This gene encodes the ketoreductase MrPigC that affords benzaldehyde 5 during MonAzP biosynthesis by reducing the C-11 ketone of the unstable intermediate 1, the putative product of MrPigA, a nonreducing polyketide synthase (nrPKS) (Fig. 1). We proposed that in the absence of MrPigC, intermediate 1 undergoes spontaneous aldol condensation to yield trihydroxynaphthalene 2, and this derailment product (compound 2) is subject to spontaneous oxidization to monasone A (compound 3), which in turn may be fortuitously reduced to monasone B (compound 4) by Monascus enzymes. Therefore, we and others interpreted these results by regarding monasones as incidental shunt products that may only be obtained in substantial amounts by blocking MonAzP biosynthesis (15–17). FIG 1A branching pathway yields MonAzPs and monasone congeners in M. ruber M7. The reactive polyketide intermediate 1 gives rise to MonAzPs on one branch (represented by rubropunctatin 7a and monascorubrin 7b) and to naphthoquinone congeners on the other branch (represented by trihydroxynaphthalene 2, monasone A [compound 3], monasone B [compound 4], tetralindione 8, and trihydroxytetralone MA-1 [compound 9]). The structures of the boxed compounds were elucidated by LC-MS/MS and NMR analysis (data for compounds 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 are in Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). A branching pathway yields MonAzPs and monasone congeners in M. ruber M7. The reactive polyketide intermediate 1 gives rise to MonAzPs on one branch (represented by rubropunctatin 7a and monascorubrin 7b) and to naphthoquinone congeners on the other branch (represented by trihydroxynaphthalene 2, monasone A [compound 3], monasone B [compound 4], tetralindione 8, and trihydroxytetralone MA-1 [compound 9]). The structures of the boxed compounds were elucidated by LC-MS/MS and NMR analysis (data for compounds 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 are in Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). To our surprise, we have found that cocultivation of the wild-type M. ruber M7 with various bacteria or fungi elicits the biosynthesis of compounds 2, 3, and 4 (see Table S3 in reference 19), while the production of MonAzPs remains undisturbed under these culture conditions (Table S4 [19]). All MonAzPs and the monasone congeners 2, 3, and 4 should be derived from M. ruber M7, since these compounds were not detected upon monoculture of the challenger microorganisms (Fig. S1, Penicillium expansum ATCC 7861 as an example [19]). Furthermore, we found that monasones 3 and 4 exhibit broad-spectrum antibiotic activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and antifungal activity against filamentous fungi, including the monasone-producing M. ruber strain itself (Table S5 [19]). Thus, we consider that under some ecologically relevant conditions (such as growth in mixed cultures), these supposed shunt products appear as authentic SMs that may function as allelochemicals against potential competitors of the producing fungi in their natural ecosystem (20). A nested subset of coevolving genes within the MABGC correlates with monasone production. We have confirmed that production of monasones by M. ruber M7 requires MrPigA, the nrPKS that assembles intermediate 1, since monasones 2, 3, and 4 were not produced by the ΔmrpigA knockout strain in monoculture or under monasone-eliciting cocultivation conditions (Table S3 [19]). Furthermore, bacteria and fungi did not stimulate M. ruber M7 to produce monasones when the gene mrpigB encoding MrPigB (also known as PigR) (21), the MonAzP cluster-specific positive regulator, was deleted (Table S3 [19]). To further confirm mrpigB function, we reevaluated the effects of the deletion of mrpigB on the transcription of each gene in the 16-gene MABGC by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, both under MonAzP-competent monoculture and monasone-eliciting cocultivation conditions (Fig. 2a). During MonAzP-producing monoculture, all MABGC genes were expressed in the wild-type strain, apart from mrpigI that encodes a transcription factor whose role in MonAzP biosynthesis is unknown. Unexpectedly, as shown by the ΔmrpigB strain, MrPigB controls the expression of only six genes in the MABGC: mrpigA, the nrPKS; mrpigH, an enoyl reductase; mrpigM and mrpigO, an acetyltransferase-deacetylase pair; mrpigN, a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase; and mrpigP, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter (Fig. 2b) (15). Furthermore, cocultivation did not restore the expression of these six genes in the ΔmrpigB strain, indicating that transcriptional activation of these genes upon elicitation is achieved primarily through MrPigB. This tight control by a transcriptional regulator purportedly governing MonAzP production was unexpected for some of these genes, since among the six genes in the MrPigB regulon, MrPigP had been shown to be unnecessary for MonAzP production, while MrPigH plays only a supplementary role in the biosynthesis of these pigments (15–17).

Genes encoding orthologues of the MFS transporter MrPigP (highlighted in pink) are present in the majority of the MABGC-like gene clusters. To obtain an evolutionary perspective on the MrPigB regulon, we analyzed filamentous fungal genomes available in the NCBI GenBank and in the “1000 Fungal Genomes Project” database of the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (http://1000.fungalgenomes.org, accessed 3 October 2019) for the presence of MABGC-related SM biosynthetic gene clusters. Apparent SM clusters with a gene encoding an nrPKS orthologous (>45% identity over the full length of the enzyme) to MrPigA from the MABGC of M. ruber M7 were found to exist in the genomes of 17 different fungal species from the genera Monascus, Talaromyces, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Coccidioides (Fig. 2b and c). Curiously, genes for orthologues of MrPigB and those for three proteins encoded in the MrPigB regulon (MrPigA, MrPigH, and MrPigN) were seen to be cooccurring and highly conserved in all these gene clusters (Fig. 2b and c). Orthologues of the multidrug transporter MrPigP are found in 11 of the 17 gene clusters (Fig. 2b), while orthologues of the rest of the MonAzP genes, including those encoding MrPigM and MrPigO from the MrPigB regulon of M. ruber M7, are only present in the minority of these putative SM biosynthetic gene clusters. Monasone biosynthesis is encoded by genes in the MrPigB regulon of M. ruber M7. MrPigA was characterized in our previous work by gene knockout as the nrPKS responsible for the production of the polyketide scaffold of MonAzPs (15). MrPigA was also shown to yield large amounts of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and smaller amounts of monasones 3 and 4 upon heterologous expression in yeast (15). In the present study, MrPigA was heterologously expressed in Aspergillus oryzae M-2-3 to yield compounds 2 and 3 (2.2 and 7.1 mg/liter) (Fig. 1 and 3a). We also observed that purified trihydroxynaphthalene 2 readily autooxidized into monasone A (compound 3) in aqueous solutions under aerobic conditions (Fig. S2a [19]). Remarkably, coexpression of mrpigA and mrpigN in A. oryzae led to the production of significantly larger amounts of compounds 2 and 3 (7.2 and 18.4 mg/liter) (Fig. 3a). Increased production of monasones was unexpected, as MrPigN had earlier been identified as the enzyme that is responsible for the hydroxylation of C-4 of benzaldehyde 5 during MonAzP biosynthesis (Fig. 1). However, MrPigN had not been implicated in naphthoquinone production until now, and monasones 3 and 4 do not feature a C-4 tertiary alcohol. FIG 3Biosynthesis of monasones during in vivo and vitro enzymatic reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN.

Statistical analysis with Student's t test revealed that there was a significant difference between group MrPigA and group MrPigA+MrPigN at P < 0.05. To further demonstrate the involvement of MrPigN in monasone biosynthesis, we expressed mrpigA and mrpigN under the strong promoter PamyB in A. oryzae M-2-3 and purified the corresponding recombinant proteins by sequential ultrafiltration, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and Ni-Sepharose column chromatography to yield 23 mg MrPigA and 42 mg MrPigN from 100 g wet mycelia (Fig. S3 [19]). Production of compound 2 was recapitulated in a reconstituted in vitro enzymatic assay with MrPigA from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), malonyl-CoA, NADPH, and S-adenosyl methionine as the substrates. Small amounts of the autooxidation product monasone A (compound 3) were also detected in the reaction. Meanwhile, recombinant MrPigN was shown to efficiently convert benzaldehyde 5 into azanigerone E (compound 6), as expected (Fig. S2b [19]). Importantly, coupled reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN afforded approximately 100% more product 2 than the reaction with MrPigA alone (Fig. 3b and c). Extended in vitro reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN also yielded minor amounts of tetralindione 8, the C-4 hydroxylated analogue of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 (Fig. 3b). MA-1 (compound 9) that derives from compound 8 by reduction was also detected in fermentations with A. oryzae strains coexpressing mrpigA and mrpigN (Fig. 3a), just as with recombinant yeast expressing these two genes, or with the ΔmrpigC knockout mutant of M. ruber M7 (15, 17). Taken together, these observations indicate that MrPigN not only is involved in MonAzP biosynthesis but also facilitates the formation of trihydroxynaphthalene 2, the precursor of monasones. To account for this result, we propose that during MonAzP biosynthesis, benzaldehyde 5 is readily hydroxylated by MrPigN to yield azanigerone E (compound 6) (Fig. 1). However, in the absence of MrPigC, MrPigN may also intercept intermediate 1, and the binding may assist the folding of this reactive intermediate into a pose conducive to the aldol condensation in the C1-C10 register, thereby increasing the yield of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and its naphthoquinone derivatives. Importantly, compounds 2, 3, and 4 were not accepted as the substrates for C-4 hydroxylation by MrPigN (Fig. S2c [19]), while intermediate 1 may not be a preferred substrate for hydroxylation, as shown by the very small amounts of compound 8 produced in the MrPigA+MrPigN coupled enzymatic assay and the low yield of MA-1 (compound 9) during the coexpression of the corresponding genes in heterologous hosts. The genes mrpigM and mrpigO encode an acetyltransferase-deacetylase pair necessary for MonAzP biosynthesis. Although these genes are part of the MrPigB regulon in M. ruber M7, they are not conserved in MABGC-like biosynthetic gene clusters (Fig. 2). Deletion of these genes did not influence monasone congener production in ΔmrpigM and ΔmrpigO strains upon monoculture or during cocultivation with P. expansum ATCC 7861 (Table S3 [19]), indicating that the corresponding enzymes do not participate in monasone biosynthesis. Reductive transformations of monasones by MrPigH may contribute to self-resistance. The MABGC gene mrpigH is part of the MrPigB regulon in strain M7, and orthologues of MrPigH are encoded by all of the MABGC-related SM biosynthetic gene clusters detected in databases (Fig. 2). MrPigH was proposed to contribute to, but is not strictly necessary for, the reduction of the C5(2′) double bond in MonAzP intermediates en route to the classical yellow MonAzPs monascin and ankaflavin (15, 16). MrPigH is a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase similar to enol reductases acting on various aromatic hydrocarbon substrates (22). Since monasones 3 and 4 feature enol groups, we wondered whether MrPigH may also be involved in the biosynthesis of naphthoquinone derivatives. Thus, we turned to in vitro reconstitution of the MrPigH-catalyzed reaction. The gene encoding MrPigH was expressed in A. oryzae M-2-3 under the inducible promoter PamyB, and 73 mg of MrPigH was purified from 100 g wet mycelia (Fig. S3 [19]). Considering that reductases such as MrPigH may yield different products under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions (23), we conducted in vitro assays under both conditions with recombinant MrPigH. When monasone A (compound 3) was used as the substrate in the presence of NADPH, distinct product pairs were detected under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions (compounds 10 and 11 versus 14 and 17, respectively) (Fig. 4). The structures of all four products were elucidated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). We conclude that MrPigH catalyzes a stepwise reduction sequence. Under aerobic conditions, reduction of the C4(5) enol yields the 4,5-dihydronaphthoquinone 10 with a secondary alcohol at C-5, followed by a further reduction to afford the 5,6-diol 11 (Fig. 4a and b). Under anaerobic conditions, monasone A (compound 3) was converted by MrPigH into the tetrahydroxynaphthalene 14 by reductive aromatization, and further reduced and dearomatized to form the tetrahydroxytetralin 17 (Fig. 4a and c). Formation of tetrahydroxynaphthalene 14 was observed only under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, while purified compound 14 was stable in the absence of oxygen in aqueous solutions, it was spontaneously oxidized to monasone A in the presence of oxygen (Fig. S4 [19]). FIG 4MrPigH-mediated reductive transformation of monasones. (a) Proposed metabolic grid for the enzymatic reduction of monasone A (compound 3) by MrPigH and MrPigC or a similar ketoreductase under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.

Reconstituted enzymatic reactions were performed in HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1.5 mM substrate and 1.5 mM NADPH at 30°C, and metabolites were detected by reversed-phase HPLC at 280 nm with a photodiode array detector. We previously observed the cooccurrence of monasone B (compound 4) with its congener monasone A (compound 3) in M. ruber M7 and in recombinant yeast and A. oryzae strains expressing mrpigA (15, 16). To account for the reduction of the carbonyl at C-11 of monasone A (compound 3), we decided to investigate MrPigC that reduces the analogous carbonyl in the putative nrPKS product 1. We purified the recombinant enzyme from A. oryzae expressing the mrpigC gene (Fig. S3 [19]) and used the clarified mycelial lysate of the ΔmrpigC knockout strain of M. ruber M7 as a control. To our surprise, both purified MrPigC and the MrPigC-free M. ruber M7 protein extract catalyzed the facile conversion of monasone A (compound 3) to monasone B (compound 4) (Fig. 4a; Fig. S5a [19]). Similarly, both purified MrPigC and the ΔmrpigC lysate efficiently reduced the C-11 carbonyl of trihydroxytetralone 11 to afford compound 12 (Fig. 4a; Fig. S5b [19]), that of tetrahydroxynaphthalene 14 to produce compound 15 (Fig. 4a; Fig. S5c, anaerobic conditions [19]), and that of tetrahydroxytetralin 17 to yield compound 16 (Fig. 4a; Fig. S5d [19]). Compounds 4, 12, 15, and 16 were isolated and characterized (Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). These experiments indicate that MrPigC shows considerable substrate promiscuity paired with strict regiospecificity in reducing the C-11 carbonyl of benzaldehyde (compound 1), naphthoquinone (compound 3), tetrahydroxynaphthalene (compound 14), tetrahydroxytetralin (compound 17), and trihydroxytetralone (compound 11) scaffolds (Fig. 4a). Apparently, M. ruber M7 also expresses another enzyme(s) that is able to carry out this same C-11 reduction, as was seen earlier with the ΔmrpigC strain that still produced small amounts of MonAzP congeners (15). Fittingly, the M. ruber M7 genome encodes two orthologues of MrPigC (GME804_g and GME2122_g, with 46% and 33% identities to MrPigC, respectively), although the role(s) of these proteins in these reductions would need to be confirmed by further experiments. We also demonstrated that the recombinant MrPigH enzyme can catalyze enol reduction with monasone B (compound 4) as the substrate, affording trihydroxytetralone 12 under aerobic conditions through the putative intermediate 13 (Fig. 4a and d). MrPigH is also able to convert monasone B (compound 4) to tetrahydroxytetralin 16 through intermediate 15 under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4a and d). All these reactions catalyzed by MrPigH and MrPigC form a complex metabolic grid that transforms monasone A (compound 3) to trihydroxytetralone 12 through a six-electron reduction sequence under aerobic conditions or to tetrahydroxytetralin 16 through an eight-electron reduction sequence under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4a). We have also tried to validate the contributions of MrPigH to monasone transformations in vivo. Despite our best efforts, we were unsuccessful in knocking out or silencing the mrpigH gene in M. ruber M7. Similarly, replacing the promoter of mrpigH with an inducible one such as Padh1 or Pcbh1 was also unsuccessful. However, MrPigH-generated compounds 10, 11, 12, and 16 were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in fermentations of wild-type M. ruber M7 under monasone-eliciting cocultivation conditions but not in monoculture (Table S6 [19]). Strikingly, the ΔmrpigC knockout mutant produced all naphthoquinone congeners (compounds 2 to 4, 10 to 12, and 14 to 17) under cocultivation conditions, presumably due to the additional C-11 ketoreductase activity of the fungus (Table S6 [19]). Next, we coexpressed mrpigH with mrpigA and mrpigN in A. oryzae M-2-3. Compared to that in the A. oryzae strain expressing mrpigA and mrpigN, production of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and monasone A (compound 3) was drastically reduced (Fig. S6a [19]). However, compounds 4, 10 to 12, and 14 to 17 were not detected in the A. oryzae production system (Fig. S6 [19]). Feeding any one of the compounds 2 to 4, 10 to 12, or 14 to 17 (each at 0.5 mg/liter) to A. oryzae M-2-3 showed that compounds 2 and 3 are stable, but compounds 4, 10 to 12, and 14 to 17 disappear during incubation with mycelia of this host (Fig. S6 and Table S7 [19]). Thus, naphthoquinone congeners produced by MrPigH from compounds 2 and 3 are readily catabolized by endogenous enzymes of the Aspergillus host. Monasone A (compound 3) and B (compound 4) were confirmed to show antifungal and broad-spectrum antibacterial activities, as expected (Table S5 [1, 2, 19]). However, compounds 12 and 16, the reduced derivatives of monasones A and B, displayed no antifungal or antibiotic activities against the same panel of microorganisms (Table S5 [19]). Intriguingly, while monasones A and B displayed self-toxicity to the producer fungus M. ruber M7, compounds 12 and 16 were found not to be growth inhibitory. Considering that the production of MrPigH is coregulated with the enzymes that produce monasones 3 and 4, these results suggest that the reductive transformations initiated by MrPigH may contribute to the self-resistance of M. ruber M7 against these compounds. MrPigP is a monasone exporter that also contributes to self-resistance in M. ruber M7. The MrPigB regulon of M. ruber M7 includes the gene mrpigP that encodes a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) multidrug transporter. MrPigP is not necessary for MonAzP production, as ΔmrpigP knockout strains continue to produce these azaphilone pigments undisturbed (18, 24). Although MrPigP orthologues are not universally conserved in MABGC-like clusters in fungi, we were intrigued by the possibility that MrPigP may be involved in the efflux of naphthoquinone congeners, at least in M. ruber M7. To test this hypothesis, we constructed the mrpigP gene knockout mutant (ΔmrpigP) and the mrpigP-complemented knockout strain (CΔmrpigP) (Fig. S7 [19]). Then, we compared the antifungal activities of monasones A and B and their reduced derivatives 12 and 16 against those of the wild-type M. ruber M7 and the ΔmrpigP and CΔmrpigP strains. The ΔmrpigP strain turned out to be markedly more sensitive to monasone A (compound 3) and monasone B (compound 4) than the wild type or the complemented strains (Fig. 5a and b and Table S5 [19]) while just as resistant to compounds 12 and 16 as the wild type or the complemented strain.

Data from all quantitative experiments are shown as the means ± SDs from three independent experiments of three replicates each, n = 9. Next, we performed flux assays with the same compound-strain combinations. Mycelia of wild-type M. ruber M7, ΔmrpigP, and CΔmrpigP strains were grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) for 7 days and then transferred to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing monasone A (compound 3), monasone B (compound 4), compound 12, or compound 16. After 6 h, the intracellular concentration of monasone A or B in the ΔmrpigP strain was found to be considerably higher than in the wild type or the CΔmrpigP strain (Fig. 5c; Fig. S8 [19]). However, the intracellular concentrations of compounds 12 and 16 displayed no obvious differences among the wild-type, ΔmrpigP, and CΔmrpigP strains under the same conditions. We also used qRT-PCR to quantify the expression of the mrpigP gene when M. ruber M7 was grown for 5 days in the presence of different concentrations of monasone A (compound 3), monasone B (compound 4), compound 12, or compound 16. The results indicated a notable increase in mrpigP expression with increasing concentrations of monasone A or monasone B (Fig. 5d; Fig. S9 [19]). Incubation with compound 12 or 16 led to only a weak induction of mrpigP expression (Fig. S9 [19]). Finally, to exclude a determining role of MrPigP in MonAzP export, we compared the intracellular and the extracellular concentrations of representative MonAzPs in the wild-type M. ruber M7 and the ΔmrpigP strains at mid-production phase (fermentations usually complete in 12 to 15 days). No obvious difference was detected between the two strains (Fig. 5e and f). Taken together, these experiments confirm that MrPigP is not involved in MonAzP biosynthesis or export, as suggested earlier (15–17). Instead, it is a naphthoquinone-inducible and naphthoquinone-specific transporter that contributes to the self-resistance of M. ruber M7 to monasone A (compound 3) and B (compound 4)."
17,PMC9054821,"Regio- and stereoselective N-acetylation of paenilamicin by PamZ To confirm our hypothesis that PamZ (NCBI WP_023484187) is an acetyl-CoA-dependent N-acetyltransferase that targets paenilamicins, we monitored PamZ-mediated antibacterial effects in vitro by agar diffusion assays against Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium) as indicator strain as well as by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To this end, the pamZ gene was amplified from the wild-type (WT) P. larvae ERIC II strain, inserted into the commercial pET28a(+) vector, and transformed into E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) for heterologous expression. PamZ was then purified (Supplementary Fig. 1) and used for the assays including four native paenilamicin variants as substrates and acetyl-CoA as co-substrate. The paenilamicin variants were purified from P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II, which preferably produce the paenilamicin mixtures A2/B2 and A1/B1, respectively (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, we also tested synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3)29. The agar diffusion assays clearly showed that paenilamicins incubated with PamZ and acetyl-CoA were not able to inhibit the growth of B. megaterium, whereas antibacterial activity was observed in the absence of acetyl-CoA and/or PamZ (Fig. 2). This loss of biological activity correlated with the conversion of paenilamicins to the corresponding N-acetylpaenilamicins as observed by HPLC-ESI-MS. ESI mass spectra revealed that the mass-to-charge ratios of natural and synthetic paenilamicins exhibited a characteristic mass shift of 42 Da indicative of the addition of an acetyl group (Supplementary Figs. 3–7).Fig. 2Deactivation of paenilamicins through PamZ-mediated N-acetylation tested by agar diffusion assay against B. megaterium as the indicator strain.Paenilamicin variants (PamA1, A2, B1, B2) isolated from P. larvae and synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3) were incubated in vitro with both acetyl-CoA and PamZ (1), acetyl-CoA only (2), or PamZ only (3). Samples 2 and 3 are negative controls and indicate the lack of bacterial growth. Fig. 2Deactivation of paenilamicins through PamZ-mediated N-acetylation tested by agar diffusion assay against B. megaterium as the indicator strain.Paenilamicin variants (PamA1, A2, B1, B2) isolated from P. larvae and synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3) were incubated in vitro with both acetyl-CoA and PamZ (1), acetyl-CoA only (2), or PamZ only (3). Samples 2 and 3 are negative controls and indicate the lack of bacterial growth. Deactivation of paenilamicins through PamZ-mediated N-acetylation tested by agar diffusion assay against B. megaterium as the indicator strain. Paenilamicin variants (PamA1, A2, B1, B2) isolated from P. larvae and synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3) were incubated in vitro with both acetyl-CoA and PamZ (1), acetyl-CoA only (2), or PamZ only (3). Samples 2 and 3 are negative controls and indicate the lack of bacterial growth. Paenilamicin contains several primary and secondary amino groups that are potential candidates for N-acetylation. To determine the site of acetylation, we monitored PamZ-mediated effects in fingerprint tandem MS and NMR spectra of paenilamicin before and after treatment with PamZ/acetyl-CoA. Besides the mass shift of 42 Da for the acetylation, characteristic MS2 fragmentation patterns originated from the difference between Glm and Aga residues in series A and B (+28 Da) as well as the difference between Lys and Orn residues in series 1 and 2 (+14 Da). MS2 fragmentation mainly resulted in fragment ions b4, y4 and y6 of each paenilamicin and N-acetylpaenilamicin variant acquired by collision-induced dissociation (Supplementary Table 1). Fragment ion b4 varied depending on the paenilamicin series showing mass shifts of 14 Da and 28 Da. Importantly, we observed a mass shift of 42 Da only for fragment ion b4, indicating acetylation in the N-terminal half of paenilamicin. By contrast, the fragment ions y4 and y6 did not exhibit any mass shifts of 42 Da between paenilamicins and N-acetylpaenilamicins. Thus, we excluded acetylation in the C-terminal half of paenilamicin (Supplementary Figs. 8–18). In addition, we detected and isolated small amounts of N-acetylpaenilamicin A1, B1, and B2 from supernatants of P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II (Supplementary Fig. 19), and compared them with our products formed in vitro. The MS2 fragmentation analysis confirmed that the mono-acetylation in the N-terminal half of paenilamicin also occurred in vivo (Supplementary Figs. 20–22). The MS2 experiments did not reveal whether the N-terminal amino group of Aga/Glm or its side chain (amino/guanidino group) was acetylated. To ultimately identify the functional group that is modified by PamZ, we acquired 1H-13C hetero-nuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra of paenilamicin B2 before and after incubation with PamZ/acetyl-CoA. Although both spectra were mostly superimposable, severe chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were observed for a minor fraction of cross-peaks (Fig. 3a). Mapping CSPs onto the structure of paenilamicin B2 revealed a well-defined region comprising the N-terminal half, with the strongest effect being located at position 6 of Aga (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 2). N-acetylpaenilamicin B2 also showed an additional cross-peak compared to paenilamicin B2, which we tentatively assigned to the methyl moiety of the newly attached acetyl group (Fig. 3a). Our data unequivocally demonstrated that PamZ mono-N-acetylates the N-terminal amino group at Aga-6 position of paenilamicin and thereby abolishes its antibacterial activity. Ultimately, this result is further supported by two synthetic diastereomers of paenilamicin B2 with l- instead of the native d-configuration at Aga-6 (PamB2_1 and PamB2_2), that were both antibacterially less active29 and that were not modified by PamZ (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 23).Fig. 3Identification of the N-acetylation site through 2D NMR spectroscopy.a Overlay of relevant 1H-13C HSQC sections of paenilamicin B2 (black) and N-acetylpaenilamicin B2 (blue).

The structure of PamZ:acetyl-CoA binary complex A BLAST30 search indicated that PamZ belongs to the GNAT superfamily with a sequence identity of 31% to the N-acetyltransferase, ZmaR, whose structure has not yet been determined and which confers resistance against the aminopolyol peptide antibiotic, zwittermicin A, in Bacillus cereus UW85 (Supplementary Fig. 24)31. We solved the crystal structure of PamZ in complex with acetyl-CoA at a resolution of 1.34 Å by using the uncharacterized N-acetyltransferase from Streptococcus suis 89/1591 (PDB 3G3S) for molecular replacement (Supplementary Table 3). The electron density was of excellent quality, allowed the modeling of the entire polypeptide chain, and unambiguously revealed the bound acetyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig. 25). PamZ comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–128, secondary structure elements indicated by primes) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 140–275), which both adopt the characteristic GNAT fold (Fig. 5a)32. The two tandem-GNAT domains, that may have originated from a gene duplication event, share low sequence identity (<20%) and are connected by an α-helical linker (αbridge, residues 129–139). The overall fold of each domain is very similar to that of bacterial aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases (AACs), as pairwise structural alignments with several AACs (PDB 1BO4, 1M4I, 1S3Z) gave root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of 2.9–4.2 Å for both the NTD and CTD (Supplementary Fig. 26)33. A structural superposition of the NTD and CTD of PamZ yielded an RMSD of 4.2 Å for 75 pairs of Cα atoms (Supplementary Fig. 27)33.Fig. 5X-ray crystal structure of Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase PamZ.a Structural topology of PamZ with its characteristic tandem-GNAT fold.

GNAT is an abbreviation of Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (Gcn5: general control non-repressed protein 5). However, a comparison with the typical GNAT fold revealed several unique features in PamZ. Instead of two N-terminal α-helices, α1 and α2, both domains of PamZ contain three short helical segments, α0-α1-α2 (α0’–α1’–α2’), which pack onto one face of the central antiparallel β-sheet, β2–β3–β4 (β2’–β3’–β4’), whereas helix α3 (α3’) buries its other side. A kink in the backbone conformation of strand β3, involving residues T199 and C200, causes a strong right twist and thus a distortion of the antiparallel β3–β4 arrangement, which led us to discriminate these strands as β3a/β3b and β4a/β4b (Fig. 5a). The central β-sheet is extended by strand β5’ in the NTD, whereas the CTD shows the characteristic β-bulge of GNAT enzymes — a V-shaped cavity between strands β4b and β5 accommodates the pantetheine segment of CoA (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the well-conserved pyrophosphate-binding loop (P-loop) of the GNAT family (R/Q-X-X-G-X-A/G)26 is only present in the CTD of PamZ (Q-N-K-G-L-A) between strand β4b and helix α3 (Fig. 6a)34, whereas the NTD is missing this signature motif. Accordingly, there is only one acetyl-CoA molecule canonically bound in the PamZ structure, namely to the CTD.Fig. 6Active site of PamZ.a Motifs A (β4–α3) and B (β5–α4) located in the C-terminal domain (CTD) interact with co-substrate acetyl-CoA. b Close-up view of the active site displaying the negatively charged groove (color code as in Fig. 5c). c Highlighted amino acid residues with hydrogen-donating and -accepting groups form the groove and are well-positioned to potentially interact with the substrate paenilamicin.

Hence, we concluded that the NTD is incompetent in binding acetyl-CoA and rather plays a structural role, in particular for substrate binding (see below). Notably, many GNAT enzymes exist as homodimers in solution with various arrangements of the monomer-monomer interface32. Likewise, AACs have often been crystallographically observed in a homodimeric state, although their quaternary structure in solution may vary35. PamZ exists as a monomer, both in solution and in the crystal (Supplementary Fig. 28). However, the tandem-GNAT domain constellation of PamZ achieves an intramolecular domain-domain interface that resembles that of some GNAT homodimers. There are several GNAT enzymes that utilize domain swapping of strand β6 to stabilize their homodimeric structure34,36,37. Interestingly, a major interface in PamZ is achieved by domain swapping of strand β6 (β6’), which inserts between strands β5’ and β6’ (β5 and β6) of the opposing domain and thus forms an extended, antiparallel, and strongly-twisted β-sheet throughout the enzyme (Fig. 5b). This β-sheet is only interrupted by the β-bulge in the CTD accommodating the cofactor and allowing the amide groups of its pantetheine portion to form pseudo-β-sheet hydrogen bonds to strand β4b (Fig. 6a). A very similar tandem arrangement of a pseudo-GNAT NTD and a canonical GNAT CTD can be found in the template protein (PDB 3G3S). Another example is the structure of mycothiol synthase MshD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is also organized as a tandem repeat of two GNAT domains with a catalytically inactive NTD38. PamZ appears to utilize its NTD to form a well-defined substrate pocket with strands β5 and β6’ representing its floor. A second interface between the NTD and CTD is accomplished through tight packing of helix α2’ onto the small β3b–β4a sheet. Further interactions involve helix α2 of the CTD and the loops between α2’ and β2’ as well as β3’ and β4’ of the NTD. These inter-domain contacts fully cover the central groove that is normally found at the interface of homodimeric structures of GNAT enzymes and restrict substrate entry to the opening that is also used by the cofactor. This remaining cleft between the two domains of PamZ is decorated with several acidic residues (e.g. E89, E116, E118, D120, D162, D170, D215, E216, E217, E218, E272, E274, and the C-terminus) and thus deploys a large negatively charged surface to attract its polycationic substrate (Fig. 5c). A corridor that lies aside and beyond the acetyl group of the cofactor is approximately 7–8 Å deep and 8–9 Å wide with respect to the thioester carbonyl atom. Although we did not obtain crystals of a ternary PamZ-acetyl-CoA-paenilamicin complex, the position of acetyl-CoA, the well-defined shape of the neighboring pocket and our knowledge about the substrate’s N-terminal acetylation site allows us to predict that the Glm/Aga side chain of paenilamicin very likely penetrates into this pocket. Acidic residues D25 (loop between α1’ and α2’), E122 (β6’), and E208 (β4a) are well-positioned within the pocket to accommodate and stabilize the guanidine group of Aga, as well as to tolerate the Nζ amine of Glm. Other residues that shape the substrate pocket include T58/T59 (loop between β3’ and β4’), T98 (β5’) and Y124 (β6’) of the NTD as well as C200/Y201 (β3b) and S245/F247 (β5) of the CTD (Fig. 6c). This shows that both domains most likely contribute to substrate recognition. Moreover, the structure of PamZ explains its regioselectivity: if PamZ was to modify e.g. the terminal amino group of spermidine in paenilamicin, the enzyme would not require such a deep substrate-binding pocket. The architecture of the central groove between the NTD and CTD has evolved to optimally accommodate the N-terminal Glm/Aga building block of paenilamicin, whilst terminal amines such as those of spermidine, ornithine and lysine side chains would not occupy this binding pocket, as they would experience significantly less binding stabilization. Such accommodation of Glm/Aga in the substrate pocket would position the N-terminal amino group of Aga-6 close to the thioester carbonyl of the cofactor. An active site aspartate or glutamate residue commonly acts as a general base to trigger the N-acetylation reaction by deprotonation of the amine followed by a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl of the thioester35. In PamZ, the side chains of E122 (β6’) as well as E208 (β4a) exhibit an interatomic distance of ~7 Å to the carbonyl atom of acetyl-CoA and thus might be in close proximity to the N-terminal amino group of Aga-6 (Fig. 6c). Residue S245 (β5) is sandwiched between E122 and E208, and may mediate deprotonation and/or proton shuttling. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the involvement of water molecules during proton transfer. An oxyanion hole as described for myristoyl-CoA transferase39 is not present in PamZ, but the amide proton of V211 (β4b) facilitates hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl oxygen of the thioester, which would increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon and stabilize the tetrahedral transition state after nucleophilic attack. Self-resistance mechanism of P. larvae The deactivation of paenilamicin through formation of N-acetylpaenilamicin by the action of PamZ (Supplementary Figs. 3–7) implicates that the enzyme may confer self-resistance to the producer strain P. larvae. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the deletion mutant P. larvae ∆pamZ to a mixture of paenilamicin A1/B1 in an agar diffusion assay. The mixture, which was purified from P. larvae ERIC II, inhibited bacterial growth of the deletion mutant ∆pamZ, but not that of the WT strain (Fig. 7a).Fig. 7Self-resistance of P. larvae against paenilamicin.a Deactivation of a paenilamicin mixture A1/B1 (left) was tested by an agar diffusion assay against P. larvae WT (top) and P. larvae ∆pamZ (bottom). The negative control (right) contained water only. b HPLC-ESI-MS spectra of cell lysates of P. larvae WT (top) and P. larvae ∆pamZ (bottom) are depicted. Relevant peaks for paenilamicin (A1/B1) and N-acetylpaenilamicin (Ac-A1/Ac-B1) species are labeled with corresponding m/z ratios (z = 4). WT - wild-type.

This result demonstrated that P. larvae requires the resistance gene, pamZ, to protect itself from the deleterious effects of its own antibacterial agent, paenilamicin. For further experimental support, we analyzed supernatants and cell pellets of P. larvae WT and ∆pamZ for paenilamicins and N-acetylpaenilamicins. In cell lysates of P. larvae WT, we exclusively found N-acetylpaenilamicin, whereas for the deletion mutant ∆pamZ only unmodified paenilamicin (Fig. 7b) was detected. From paenilamicin isolates of the WT strain, primarily paenilamicin and only small amounts of N-acetylpaenilamicin were found in the supernatant by HPLC-ESI-MS (Supplementary Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that the self-resistance factor PamZ enables P. larvae WT to acetylate and thus inactivate intracellular paenilamicin. N-acetylation functions as an efficient self-protection mechanism by scavenging paenilamicin that reenters the cells of P. larvae. However, this mechanism may not apply to intracellular paenilamicin after its release from the NRPS-PKS assembly line. Instead, it seems very likely that an inactive precursor, i.e. a prodrug, of paenilamicin is produced to mask the strong antibacterial activity before cellular export. Along these lines, the biosynthetic gene cluster of paenilamicin23 harbors the pamJ gene, which shows significant sequence similarity to a cyclic-peptide export ABC transporter with d-asparagine-specific peptidase activity that has been reported to be involved in a prodrug resistance mechanism in nonribosomal peptide synthesis40–43. The peptidase recognizes and cleaves an N-acyl-d-asparagine unit of the prodrug. Accordingly, P. larvae must have developed a dual self-resistance mechanism against paenilamicin both potentially addressing the N-terminal Glm/Aga residue, specifically the N-terminal amino group at Aga-6 position, as modification site. Not only P. larvae, but also other bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes refer to a dual self-resistance mechanism associated with NRPS-PKS-derived compounds like amicoumacin42,44, zwittermicin31, and edeine45 (Supplementary Fig. 29). In a very recent study, paenilamicin B2 showed an inhibitory effect (IC50 of ~0.3 µM) on the E. coli ribosome in vitro, whereas the non-native diastereomer PamB2_2 was approximately tenfold and the N-acetylpaenilamicin B2 approximately 100-fold less active29. The modifications of the N-terminal amino group at Aga-6 thus point to the importance of the N-terminal Glm/Aga residue as a major pharmacophore mediating recognition at the molecular target. The insights into the pharmacophore region of paenilamicins and the structure of PamZ including its substrate-binding pocket may lead to the development of inhibitors against the self-resistance factor to weaken the bee larvae pathogen. This study lays an appreciable foundation to understand the self-resistance mechanisms of P. larvae and to screen for potential small molecule inhibitors that target the active site of PamZ and compete with the naturally occurring paenilamicin. Consequently, the inhibitors would disable the self-resistance of P. larvae to paenilamicin resulting in the suicide of the bacterial pathogen for the benefit of the honey bee larvae. Such an anti-virulence strategy has the advantage that it circumvents the direct selection pressure on P. larvae to produce resistant strains because it only disarms the bacterium instead of interfering in essential bacterial functions. Therefore, it is not expected that inhibiting PamZ will readily lead to the development of resistant strains, as has already happened with the classical antibiotic treatment of AFB46. Assuming that the potential candidate has been confirmed in lab-scale applications, it could be applied in honey bee colonies by preventively impregnating the brood comb wax foundations with the substance so that it is dissolved in the brood food and then ingested by the larvae during early larval stages when P. larvae poses the most serious threat. Certainly, finding a small molecule inhibitor for PamZ and optimizing its application have to be further investigated in future studies. In summary, these results expand our knowledge of the molecular strategies exploited by P. larvae to survive in its ecological niche — knowledge that is needed to combat this pathogen and secure the health of bee colonies worldwide."
