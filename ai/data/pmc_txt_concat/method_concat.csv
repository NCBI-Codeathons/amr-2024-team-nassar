Streptomyces strains were grown at 30°C on solid MS medium (59) (mannitol soya flour medium), DNA (2.3% Difco nutrient agar), and MH agar (1.5% agar in Mueller-Hinton broth, purchased from Oxoid) or in liquid YPM2 (0.4% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 1% malt extract [pH 7.2]) or AVM (60) media. The spore suspensions of S. lincolnensis were prepared and germinated for 3 h in 2× GM (1% yeast extract, 1% Casamino Acids, 0.01 M CaCl2), and the spore suspensions of S. coelicolor were germinated for 6 h in 2× YT (1.6% Bacto tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) according to protocols published in Practical Streptomyces Genetics (61). For the selection of exconjugants, antibiotics were added to the cultivation media at the following concentrations: apramycin, 50 mg liter−1; kanamycin, 50 mg liter−1; carbenicillin, 100 mg liter−1; chloramphenicol, 25 mg liter−1; nalidixic acid, 25 mg liter−1; and hygromycin at 100 mg liter−1 (E. coli) or 40 mg liter−1 (Streptomyces) in agar plates or at 80 mg liter−1 (E. coli) or 40 mg liter−1 (Streptomyces) in liquid media. Statistics for proteomics data (Fig. 3a; see also Fig. S4a). Download Table S2, XLSX file, 0.03 MB. (i) For antibiotic production, proteomic analysis and RT-PCR, S. lincolnensis and its derived mutants or S. caelestis spores were germinated and inoculated into 50 ml of YPM2 (to reach optical density at 450 nm [OD450] 0.03) in 250-ml baffled flasks and cultivated on an orbital shaker for 40 to 42 h at 30°C and 200 rpm. A total of 2.5 ml of the YPM2 seed culture was used to inoculate 47.5 ml of fresh AVM broth (60), followed by cultivation in 250-ml baffled flasks for 120 h at 30°C and 200 rpm (see Fig. S7b). (ii) For the qPCR analyses and Western blot analyses of S. lincolnensis, spores were germinated, inoculated into 50-ml Falcon tubes containing 20 ml of YPM2 media (to reach OD450 0.03), and grown on an orbital shaker (8 h, 30°C, 200 rpm) prior to induction. The cultures were then induced with the antibiotic indicated, and the cultivation continued for an additional 8 h (see Fig. S7b). (iii) For the Western blot analysis of S. coelicolor, spores were germinated, transferred into 50 ml of YEME (0.3% yeast extract, 0.05% peptone, 0.03% malt extract, 1% glucose, 34% sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2) in 250-ml flasks with springs, and cultivated on an orbital shaker for 48 h at 30°C and 200 rpm. The cultures were then induced with clindamycin (0.03 mg/liter) and cultivated for 2 h (see Fig. S7c). Construction of knockout strains. The S. lincolnensis ΔA (BN3024), S. lincolnensis ΔB (BN3002), and S. lincolnensis ΔC (BN3001) mutants were constructed by replacing the entire coding sequence of the target gene with a cassette (773 or 775 [62]) carrying the apramycin resistance gene [aac(3)IV] and oriT of RK2 using the PCR-targeting method (63). Oligonucleotides used for gene deletion and verification of the deletion are listed in Table S2. PCR targeting was applied to the cosmid LK6 (23), which contained the entire lincomycin biosynthetic cluster. After conjugation of mutated cosmids into S. lincolnensis, kanamycin-sensitive (Kans) and apramycin-resistant (Aprr) double-crossover mutants with target genes replaced by the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette were confirmed by PCR amplification. For the construction of S. lincolnensis ΔAB (BN3021), S. lincolnensis ΔAC (BN3018), and S. lincolnensis ΔBC (BN3008) double mutants, the inactivation cassettes 773 in S. lincolnensis ΔB (BN3002) and S. lincolnensis ΔC (BN3001) single mutants were replaced by an unmarked in-frame deletion obtained by FLP-mediated excision of the disruption cassette (62). The second gene to be deleted was replaced with cassette 775 according to the same protocol as used for single-knockout strains. Knockout strains were verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. The scheme of the orientation of inactivation cassettes in all knockout strains is available in Fig. S1. Construction of vectors for natural, constitutive, or inducible expression. Details on the preparation of vectors and oligonucleotides used are listed in Table S2. The vectors An (bearing lmrA with its 1,330-bp upstream sequence), Bn (bearing lmrB gene with an 86-bp upstream region), and Cn (bearing lmrC gene and its 1,281-bp upstream region) were used to express resistance genes under its natural promoter. For constitutive expression, lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC were PCR amplified from ligated under the ermEp promoter of pIJ10257 (64), yielding plasmids AC, BC, and CC. For the coexpression of lmrA or lmrB with lmrC in the heterologous host, lmrC with the ermEp promoter was cloned into PtipA expression vector pIJ6902 (65) (construct Cc2). All the above-mentioned vectors were prepared by restriction enzyme cloning. Constructs CC-mCh, C-U-mCh, U-mCh, UC-mCh, 5′C-mCh, and C-mCh were prepared by using the SLICE cloning method (66) (for details, see Table S2). Inducible expression in vectors Ci and CEQ12i were achieved by introducing the theophylline-dependent riboswitch (67) via the whole plasmid PCR (details in Table S2). All the constructs described were verified by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis. To introduce mutations, the QuikChange protocol (Agilent) was used. In plasmid CEQ12, for expression of the lmrCEQ12 mutant, two mutations were introduced into the lmrC coding sequence: glutamate 167 was replaced with a codon for glutamine, and the parallel codon for glutamate 495 was replaced with a codon for glutamine. To test the putative terminator structure, a series of G-to-C and C-to-G point mutations were introduced into the lmrC upstream region in C-mCh vector, yielding plasmids pGBN120, pGBN121, and pGBN124. To test the function of uORFs 1 to 4, their START codons were mutated in C-mCh, yielding plasmids pGBN070 (uORF 1), pGBN106 (uORF 2), pGBN117 (uORF 3), and pGBN119 (uORF 4). All used oligonucleotides are listed in Table S2. All the constructs described were verified by sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility tests. The MIC values were determined on MH agar with a serial 2-fold dilution of antibiotics. Frozen spores (see Fig. S7a) or mycelia from 42-h seed culture or 120-h production culture (see Fig. S7b) were diluted in 2 ml of sterile water to optical density OD450 0.2 to 0.3, and 5 μl was spotted on MH agar with antibiotic and incubated at 30°C for 5 days. Extraction of lincomycin and celesticetin. A total of 1 ml of supernatant from 42-h seed culture or 160-h production culture (see Fig. S7b) was used for solid-phase extraction as follows: an Oasis HLB 3-ml 60-mg cartridge (hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced sorbent; Waters, USA) was conditioned with 3 ml of methanol and equilibrated with 3 ml of water, and then 1 ml of the supernatant of cultivation broth (for lincomycin extraction pH adjusted to 9.0 with ammonium hydroxide) was loaded. The cartridge was washed with 3 ml of water, and absorbed substances were eluted with 1.5 ml of 80% methanol. The eluent was evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in 150 μl of 50% methanol, and centrifuged at 12,045 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The extract was then diluted 10× with methanol-water (1:1 [vol/vol]) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as described below. LC-MS analysis of lincomycin and celesticetin. LC analyses of the samples depicted in Fig. 1 and in Fig. 3a were performed on an Acquity UPLC system equipped with a 2996 DAD detector and LCT premier XE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters). Five microliters of each sample was loaded onto an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 LC column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, inner diameter [ID]; particle size, 1.7 μm; Waters) kept at 40°C and eluted with a two-component mobile phase. For phases A and B, the A solution was 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 9) for lincomycin detection (prepared by titration of formic acid 98 to 100% [Merck, Germany] with ammonium hydroxide 28 to 30% [Sigma-Aldrich, Germany]), the A solution was 0.1% formic acid for celesticetin detection, and the B solution was acetonitrile (LC-MS grade; Biosolve, Netherlands). The analyses were performed with a linear gradient program (min/%B): 0/5, 1.5/5, and 12.5/58, followed by a 1.5-min column cleanup (100% B) and 1.5-min equilibration (5% B) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1. The DAD detector monitored the column effluent in the range 194 to 600 nm; the mass spectrometer operated in the “W” mode with its capillary voltage set at +2,800 V, its cone voltage at +40 V, its desolvation gas temperature at 350°C, an ion source block temperature at 120°C, cone gas flow at 50 liters h−1, desolvation gas flow at 800 liters h−1, a scan time at 0.15 s, and an interscan delay at 0.01 s. The data were processed by MassLynx V4.1 (Waters). UV chromatograms monitored at 194 nm were used for lincomycin quantitation based on a five-point linear calibration curve, which was constructed from peak areas corresponding to lincomycin. Calibration solutions were prepared by spiking lincomycin authentic standard at the required concentration into lincomycin-free cultivation broth, extracted and preconcentrated as described above. The quantitation parameters were as follows: concentrations used for the calibration curve were 3.78, 7.56, 15.125, 31.250, 62.5, and 125 mg liter−1, the correlation coefficient was r2 = 0.995, and the limit of quantification was 7.56 mg liter−1 (determined as the lowest point of the calibration curve with precision within 10%). Samples from 42 h of cultivation with lincomycin concentrations below the limit of quantitation were examined by MS detection: extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 407.2 were evaluated for the presence of lincomycin. The 160-h samples for celesticetin production were also examined using MS detection: extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 528.6 were evaluated for the presence of celesticetin. The LC-MS analyses depicted in Fig. 2b and Fig. S2 were performed on a 6546 LC/Q-TOF (Agilent Technologies, USA) connected to a 1290 Infinity II LC system. One microliter of the sample was loaded on a UPLC CSH C18 Premier column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, ID; particle size, 1.7 μm) kept at 30°C. The analytes were eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1 with a two-component mobile phase consisting of 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 9) (A) and acetonitrile (B) using a linear gradient program min/%B: 0/5, 1.5/5, 15/65, 15.1/100, 16/100, 16.1/5, and 17.5/5. The mass spectrometer operated in ESI+ mode (jet stream technology) with the following settings: capillary voltage, 3,500 V; nozzle voltage, 200 V; gas temperature, 250°C; drying gas, 8 liters min−1; nebulizer, 35 lb/in2; sheath gas temperature, 400°C; sheath gas flow, 12 liters min−1; fragmentor, 140 V; and skimmer, 65 V. The ions of m/z 80 to 1,200 were monitored with scan rates of 4 spectra s−1 and 250 ms/spectrum. The identity of the analytes was confirmed by the comparison of retention times with an authentic standard, accurate mass, and collision-induced dissociation fragmentation at a collision energy of 20 eV. The data were processed using Quantitative 10.1 software within a MassHunter workstation (Agilent). Lincomycin quantitation was performed using a standard calibration curve of the lincomycin standard (2-fold serial dilutions from 0.0097 to 40 mg liter−1) dissolved in the solid-phase extract of a lincomycin nonproducing Streptomyces lincolnensis
lmbD deletion mutant strain. The LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) was determined as the lowest analyte concentration determined with sufficient precision (relative standard deviation of 20%) and accuracy (80 to 120%) using a calibration curve with its lowest point being equal to LLOQ. Protein digestion for proteomic analysis. Mycelia (0.1 g) of 40-h seed culture inoculated from fresh spores (see Fig. S7b) were lysed in 0.5 ml of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 2% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 40 mM chloroacetamide and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo), and 20 μg of protein per sample was used for MS sample preparation. Samples were digested with trypsin (at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1/20) at 37°C overnight. After digestion, the samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 1%. Sodium deoxycholate was removed by extraction to ethyl acetate (68), and peptides were desalted on a Michrom C18 column. nLC-MS2 analysis. Nanoreversed-phase columns (EASY-Spray column, 50 cm by 75 μm, ID; PepMap C18; 2-μm particles, 100-Å pore size) were used for LC-MS analysis. Mobile-phase buffer A was composed of water and 0.1% formic acid. Mobile-phase buffer B was composed of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Samples were loaded onto the trap column (Acclaim PepMap300; C18, 5 μm; 300-Å Wide Pore; 300 μm × 5 mm; five cartridges) for 4 min at 17.5 μl min−1 loading buffer composed of water, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted with a mobile-phase B gradient from 4 to 35% B in 60 min. Eluting peptide cations were converted to gas-phase ions by electrospray ionization and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion (Q-OT-qIT; Thermo). Survey scans of peptide precursors from 350 to 1,400 m/z were performed at 120 K resolution (at 200 m/z) with a 5 × 105 ion count target. Tandem MS was performed by isolation at 1.5 m/z with the quadrupole, higher-energy C-trap dissociation fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 30, and rapid scan MS analysis in the ion trap. The MS2 ion count target was set to 104, and the maximum injection time was 35 ms. Only those precursors with charge states of 2 to 6 were sampled for MS2. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 45 s with a 10-ppm tolerance around the selected precursor and its isotopes. Monoisotopic precursor selection was turned on. The instrument was run in the top speed mode with 2-s cycles (69). Proteomic data analysis and interpretation. All data were analyzed and quantified with MaxQuant software (version 1.6.1.0) (70). The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% for both proteins and peptides, and we specified a minimum peptide length of seven amino acids. The Andromeda search engine was used for the MS/MS spectra search against the Streptomyces lincolnensis database (downloaded from the NCBI on July 2018). Enzyme specificity was set with the C terminus as Arg and Lys, also allowing cleavage at proline bonds and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification, and N-terminal protein acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. The “match between runs” feature of MaxQuant was used to transfer identifications to other LC-MS/MS runs based on their masses and retention time (maximum deviation, 0.7 min), and this was also used in quantification experiments. Quantifications were performed with the label-free algorithms described recently. The obtained normalized data were imported to Perseus 1.6.1.3 software (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Munich, Germany) (71). All numeric values corresponding to protein intensity were transformed to a logarithmic scale, and all samples were grouped using categorical annotation. Missing values were then replaced by random numbers drawn from a normal distribution of 1.8 standard deviations (SD) downshift and with a width of 0.3 of each sample. Heat maps of the relative abundance of selected proteins were generated from the matrix of protein intensities without imputation of missing values in Microsoft Excel. Proteomic analysis at 40 h was assessed in five biological (four for ΔC without clindamycin) replicates for each sample/treatment. RT-PCR. Mycelia from 16-h seed cultures were uninduced or induced by clindamycin (0.5 mg liter−1) (see Fig. S7c), and 5-ml portions the culture were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the analysis, samples were defrosted and incubated in 1 ml of RNAprotect cell reagent (Qiagen; 5 min, 25°C). Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged (4,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), and the pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of TE buffer. The suspension was mixed with glass beads (0.1-mm diameter) in a 2:1 ratio and disrupted using a Fast-Prep (MP Biomedicals) program for 1 × 60 s at a speed of 6 ms−1. Immediately after cell lysis, total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (T9424, 100 ml; Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated total RNA, resuspended in 100 μl of water, was treated with Turbo DNase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by an additional step of total RNA isolation using TRI Reagent. The integrity of RNA was controlled by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The purity and concentration of RNA were controlled by using NanoDrop.cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One microliter of reverse transcription reaction mix or total RNA was added to 20 μl of PCR mix using the primers indicated (sequences in Table S2). PCR was performed using Taq-Purple DNA polymerase (T107). The following PCR program was used: 96°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 96°C for 10 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 1 min. Quantitative RT-PCR. The 16-h clindamycin-induced and uninduced seed cultures were cultivated and incubated in 1 ml of Protect RNA in the same manner as for RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The isolated RNA was treated with DNase I (0.1 U μl−1, 30 min, 37°C) and repurified with an RNeasy RNA isolation kit. The RNA quantity and quality were checked with a NanoDrop instrument (DeNovix). The RNA quantities were normalized to the lowest concentration of RNA in the samples. The quantities of lmrC, lmbU, lmbN, and 16S rRNA transcripts were measured by one-step qRT-PCR (SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit) using the following oligonucleotides (10 μM): lmrCf+lmrCr, lmbUf+lmbUr, lmbNf+lmbNr, and 16SrRNAf+16SrRNAr. The following real-time PCR program was used: 60°C for 3 min, 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 65°C (lmbU, lmbN, and 16S rRNA) or 63°C (lmrC) for 20 s. CT values of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN transcripts, based on the standard curves, were normalized to CT values of 16S rRNA. The relative expression was calculated as 2–ΔCT. Western blotting and immunodetection. For S. lincolnensis, 20-ml seed cultures inoculated with germinated spores were induced with lincomycin (4 mg liter−1), clindamycin (0.5 mg liter−1), pristinamycin IIA (4 mg liter−1), tiamulin (0.125 mg liter−1), erythromycin (0.5 mg liter−1), pristinamycin IA (4 mg liter−1), chloramphenicol (4 mg liter−1), and carbenicillin (4 mg liter−1) at 8 h, and cultivation continued until the indicated time points (see Fig. S7c). Mycelia were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4°C, 4,000 × g), washed with buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]; pH 8.0). After sonication (3 × 40 s; UP200S Hielscher Ultrasonic GmbH), cell lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue to test the load of whole protein volume. Next, 8% SDS-PAGE with adjusted whole protein volumes was run, and samples were Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (semidry transfer, 15 V, 45 min, Trans-blot; Bio-Rad). A control SDS-PAGE was run in parallel. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking solution 5% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad) in PBS-Tween buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), followed by incubation for an additional 1 h with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-LmrC or rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dried milk in PBS-Tween buffer. Membranes were washed for three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG 1:2,000 in 1% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker in PBS-Tween buffer, and washed three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer. Antibody complexes were detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Merck) on a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). For S. coelicolor, the method was adapted as follows: 50-ml seed cultures inoculated with germinated spores were induced with clindamycin (0.03 mg liter−1) at 24 h, and cultivation continued for 2 h. Mycelia were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4°C, 4,000 × g) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche], 1% SDS [pH 8.0]). After lysis on Fast prep (four times for 20 s each time, with 4-min pauses on ice), cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (wet transfer, 30 V, 0.09 mA, 18 h). The membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking solution composed of 5% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad) in PBS-Tween buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and for 1 h with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody [Invitrogen] or mouse polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody [AB Clonal]) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dried milk in PBS-Tween buffer. Membranes were washed three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer, incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG 1:2,000 in 1% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker in PBS-Tween buffer, and washed three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer. Antibody complexes were detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Merck) on a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). After immunodetection, the membrane was washed with PBS-Tween buffer and then stained with 0.1% Coomassie R-250 in methanol/water (1:1) for 5 min, destained twice for 10 min each time in acetic acid-ethanol-water (1:5:4), washed with water, and air dried. The dry membrane was recorded on ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad) at 600 dpi, and the staining density for each complete lane was analyzed in ImageLab (Bio-Rad) or ImageJ software with an area outside the protein lanes defining the background. The signal intensities were normalized to the signal intensity of the induced BN3038 strain (for S. coelicolor) or BN3511 (for S. lincolnensis) transferred to the same membrane. Statistical analysis. The MIC, Western blot, and qRT-PCR results are expressed as the means ± the SD. Differences between two groups were analyzed using a two-sample t test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; and P > 0.05 if not indicated). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate unless otherwise stated. Antibodies. The anti-LmrC(2) antibody was generated by GenScript USA, Inc., by inoculating a New Zealand rabbit host strain with a peptide-KLH conjugate containing the LmrC peptide CLQRQAQESAGRAAS. The specificity of the LmrC antibody was validated using S. lincolnensis WT and ΔC mycelium from 16-h seed cultures (see Fig. S7c) grown in the absence or presence of lincomycin (LIN; 4 mg liter−1) or clindamycin (CLI; 0.5 mg liter−1) (see Fig. S5a). The anti-m-Cherry antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Cat PA5-34974) and AB Clonal. The ribosomal protein S7-specific antibody was obtained from Mee-Ngan F. Yap (72). Data availability.

1,PMC10269722,"Validation of the lexQSABC operon by RT-PCR. L. antibioticus strain OH13 was grown at 28°C overnight in nutrient broth (3 g beef extract, 1 g yeast extract, 5 g tryptone, 10 g sucrose [pH = 7.0 to 7.2] in 1 liter distilled water) as seed culture. Then, a 1% (vol/vol) seed culture was transferred to a 1/10 dilution of tryptic soy broth (TSB). L. antibioticus OH13 cells were immediately harvested at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.0 via centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. Total RNA was extracted using a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) and quantified using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. Subsequently, Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix was used to eliminate gDNA and produce cDNA from 250 ng of RNA. Specific primers for each fragment are provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Standard PCR used TransTaq-T DNA polymerase with cDNA as the template, RNA and H2O as the negative control, and gDNA as the positive control. Purification of LexR and mutants. The gene lexR was amplified from gDNA of OH13 with primers lexR-PF and lexR-PR (Table S1). The PCR product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into plasmid pET-28a to obtain a pET-lexR construct. The lexR sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression construct pET-lexR was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). The BL21-pET-lexR overnight culture was transferred to 100 mL LB medium containing kanamycin (25 μg/mL) and grown until an OD600 of 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and cells were cultured at 37°C for an additional 6 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mL buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 300 mM NaCl; pH 7.9) and then lysed ultrasonically on ice. The supernatant was then loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column previously calibrated with 5 mM imidazole buffer. His6-tagged LexR protein (53.1 kDa) was purified using an imidazole step gradient and detected with SDS-PAGE. Protein with His6 tag was concentrated and measured with Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and then used in EMSAs. Residue mutants LexR-V146A, LexR-K195A, and LexR-V146A-K195A were obtained using the appropriate mutant genes in the purification scheme. The site mutation for LexR was constructed through direct gene synthesis. EMSA. The promoter region of the lexQSABC operon was predicted with the online tool BPROM (http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=bprom&group=programs&subgroup=gfindb). A 165-bp DNA fragment containing the lexQSABC promoter region and a 158-bp promoter region from another RND efflux pump operon as control were amplified via PCR with 5′-end biotin-labeled primers. We also synthesized four pairs of complementary oligonucleotide 5′-end biotin-labeled primers. Primers were mixed with 1× annealing buffer (10× annealing buffer; 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) and annealed at 95°C for 5 min. The products were kept at room temperature for 2 h, and subsequently we obtained the probes. Probe 1 was a 58-bp sequence from the lexQSABC promoter, and probe 2 was a 50-bp sequence without the putative binding site of LexR. Probe 3 was a 58-bp sequence from the 158-bp control probe, and probe 4 was a 58-bp sequence replacing the putative binding site of LexR to probe 3. The sequences of probes are shown in the supplemental material. EMSA was conducted using LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kits (Thermo Scientific). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed for the EMSA, with binding reaction mixtures (20 μL) containing 1× binding buffer, 50 ng/μL poly(dI-dC), 2.5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl, 0.05% (vol/vol) NP-40, 5 fmol labeled probe, and different concentrations of LexR and myxin as required. Reactions were continued for 30 min at room temperature, and subsequent steps were completed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Chemiluminescence signals of biotin-labeled probes were captured using a Tanon 4600 imaging system (China). The primers are listed in Table S1. SPR analysis. The binding affinity of myxin for LexR and its mutants was investigated via SPR using a bScreen LB 991 label-free microarray system (Berthold Technologies, Germany). Myxin was immobilized on photo cross-linker SPRi sensor chips, and LexR and mutant proteins were diluted separately with running buffer phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST; pH 7.4) at concentrations of 10, 40, 160, 640, and 2,560 nM. The injection time was >600 s at a flow rate of 0.5 μL/s for each successive stage. Chips were then washed with running buffer for 360 s at a flow rate of 0.5 μL/s in each dissociation stage. Chip surfaces were regenerated to remove any remaining bound material with a pulse of 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) at 20 μL/min for 300 s at the end of each association-dissociation cycle. Complementation and site-directed mutation of LexR. For complementation of lexR, the target gene was amplified with primers lexR-CF and lexR-CR and then cloned into the plasmid pBBR1-MCS5. To construct the LexR site-directed mutants V146A or K195A, two sequences were obtained with primers (pBBR-lexR-F/146-1-R and 146-2-F/pBBR-lexR-R for V146A, pBBR-lexR-F/195-1-R and 195-2-F/pBBR-lexR-R for K195A), and then assembled with the plasmid pBBR1-MCS5. The expression constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and subsequently introduced into lexR deletion mutants by electroporation. The resultant strains were validated by PCR. The primers are listed in Table S1. qRT-PCR. Bacterial cells were cultured in 1/10 TSB and collected at an OD600 of ~1.0. RNA extraction was carried out with a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Yeasen MolPure, China). The concentration and quality of RNA were detected with an Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. cDNA synthesis was performed with 250 ng of RNA using a kit (Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix with gDNA wiper). Primers for qRT-PCR designed with primer 3 online are shown in Table S1, and the 16S rRNA gene was used as a reference. The qRT-PCRs was performed on a Quantstudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR master mix (Vazyme). The experiment was repeated three times, each time in triplicate. Relative expression was analyzed using the threshold cycle (2−ΔΔCT) method."
2,PMC10100954,"Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively, in the supplemental material. To harvest Streptomyces spores, Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and its derivatives, S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and its derivatives, and S. coelicolor M1146 were grown at 28°C on International Streptomyces Project (ISP) medium 3 agar (44), glucose-yeast extract-malt extract (GYM) agar (25), and MS (2% mannitol, 2% soya flour) agar, respectively. E. coli strains for nucleic acid manipulation were cultured at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. When necessary, antibiotics were added at the following final concentrations: 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 50 μg/mL apramycin or kanamycin, and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol for E. coli and 25 μg/mL apramycin, kanamycin, or nalidixic acid for Streptomyces. Construction of gene disruption and complementation mutants. Nucleic acid manipulations were performed using standard procedures for E. coli (45) and Streptomyces (46) and according to the instructions of the manufacturers of the restriction enzymes and kits. The lasalocid BGC sequences and genome sequences of Streptomyces were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. The Streptomyces mutant strains were constructed from wild-type strains by gene replacement via homologous recombination as previously described (26, 47). For the genetic complementation of lodR1, a DNA fragment carrying the lodR1 ORF was amplified by PCR using primers lodR1-orf-F and lodR1-orf-R (Table S3). The PCR product was gel purified and then ligated with EcoRV-digested pSET152 and a strong constitutive promoter, PkasO*, by Gibson assembly to give plasmid pSET152::PkasO*lodR1C. The recombinant plasmid was subsequently introduced into the lodR1 mutant (ΔlodR1) via conjugation to generate the ΔlodR1C complemented strain. Other complemented strains and heterologous-expression strains were constructed similarly. The primers used in this study are listed in Table S3. Analysis of lasalocid production and bacterial biomass. For lasalocid production, a suitable number of spores (~2.5 × 106) of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172-WT, wild-type S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T, or their mutants was inoculated into a 50-mL centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of liquid tryptic soy broth (TSB) (pancreatic digest of 1.7% casein and papaic digest of 0.3% soybean, 0.25% dextrose, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.25% K2HPO4 [pH 7.1 to 7.5]) and incubated on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm at 28°C for 48 h as a seed culture. Next, 1 mL of the seed culture was transferred into 50 mL of liquid SSC (2% soluble starch, 1% soybean powder, 0.5% calcium carbonate) medium. The cultures were incubated for different numbers of days at 28°C before sampling. For the analysis of lasalocid, 50 mL of fermentation broth was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min to separate the mycelia and the supernatant. The mycelia were extracted with 50 mL of ethanol, and the supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined and concentrated in vacuo to evaporate the solvent, and the residue was redissolved in 1.5 mL of methanol (MeOH) for analysis. HPLC analysis was performed on a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system using a Waters Xbridge octyl decyl silane column with a linear gradient of MeOH-H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of A: MeOH; and B: H2O. The following program was used to elute the column: 0 min, 20% A; 15 min, 100% A; 20.5 min, 100% A; 20.51 min, 20% A; 26.5 min 20% A. The effluent was monitored at 316 nm. Tandem mass spectrometry identification of lasalocid was performed as previously described (26). The lasalocid A standard was used as a positive control for HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses to confirm the production of lasalocid (Fig. S6). The bacterial biomass was determined by measuring the cell dry weight. An aliquot of 2 mL of the cell culture was harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to separate the mycelia and the supernatant, and the mycelia were then dried at 50°C to a constant weight. RNA isolation and transcriptional analyses. Total RNAs were isolated from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and its derivatives after incubation for 72, 96, and 120 h in SSC medium as described previously (48). Likewise, total RNAs were isolated from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and its derivatives after incubation for 120 and 144 h in SSC medium. First-strand synthesis of cDNA was carried out with a Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, CA, USA) using 1 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 20 μL according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cotranscriptional analysis was performed by RT-PCR according to previously reported procedures (49) to ascertain the transcriptional units of lod and las. Subsequent RT-qPCR of selected genes was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of each primer and 1 μL of cDNA in a total volume of 20 μL. RT-qPCR was also conducted without reverse transcriptase to test DNA contamination in the RNA. The 16S rRNA gene was used as an internal control to normalize the RNA concentration. Primers used for transcriptional analyses are listed in Table S3. Expression and purification of LodR1-His6, LodR2-His6, and Las3-His6 proteins. The lodR1, lodR2, lodR3, and las3 coding regions were amplified using primer pairs lodR1-orf-F/lodR1-orf-R, lodR2-orf-F/lodR2-orf-R, lodR3-orf-F/lodR3-orf-R, and las3-orf-F/las3-orf-R (Table S3), respectively. The amplified fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI and then inserted into the same sites of pET23b or pET28a to generate the expression plasmids. The recombinant plasmids were confirmed by sequencing and subsequently introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The transformants were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37°C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 16 h at 28°C. The recombinant proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Novagen). Protein purity was determined by Coomassie blue staining after SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The concentration of protein was determined according to the protocol of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Novagen). The purified proteins were stored at 4°C. EMSAs and DNase I footprinting. EMSAs were performed mainly as previously described (50). DNA probes covering the intergenic regions were amplified using primer pairs listed in Table S3. The probe (10 ng) was incubated individually with various quantities of the recombinant proteins at 25°C for 25 min in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μg/μL calf bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol in a total volume of 20 μL. After incubation, protein-bound and free DNAs were separated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 4.5% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with SYBR gold (Invitrogen), and the images were captured by a Bio-Rad GelDoc 2000 system. DNase I footprinting assays were performed as previously described (51), with slight modifications. To determine the LodR1- and LodR2-binding sites, 32P-labeled probes PR1–A and PR2–E were amplified by PCR with the labeled primers (Table S3). The footprinting reaction mixture contained 30,000 cpm of the 32P-labeled DNA probe, 0.2 to 1 μM LodR1-His6 or LodR2-His6, and 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) in 50 μL of EMSA buffer. After incubation at 25°C for 25 min, 5.5 μL RQ1 RNase-free DNase buffer and 0.2 U DNase I were added to the above-described reaction mixture, followed by further incubation at 25°C for 70 s. Next, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL of stop solution (20 mM EGTA, pH 8.0) and 100 μL of phenol-CH3Cl (1:1, vol/vol) to the mixture. DNA fragments in the mixture were precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of isopropanol, and the pellet was washed with 75% (vol/vol) ethanol. The samples were resuspended, denatured, and electrophoretically fractionated according to previously described procedures (51). The sequencing ladder was made using the Silver Sequence DNA sequencing system (Promega, USA). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-ray film. To determine the Las3-binding sites on Plas2–3, the DNA probe was amplified by PCR with 5′-fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labeled primer pairs. Different concentrations of Las3-His6 and 400 ng of the labeled DNA probe were incubated in EMSA buffer for 25 min at 25°C. Next, samples were digested by DNase I (Promega) at 25°C for 45 s, and digestion was terminated with 20 mM EGTA. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the resulting DNA samples were subsequently loaded onto an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer. GeneMarker v2.2.0 software was used to analyze the DNA regions protected by Las3. gusA transcriptional fusion assays. The gusA reporter system was constructed as previously described (33). Briefly, the putative promoter region from lod was inserted into the upstream region of a promoterless gusA gene to generate pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmids (Px represents the promoters of the lod genes tested). The authenticity of each recombinant plasmid was confirmed by subsequent sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into S. coelicolor M1146 via E. coli-Streptomyces conjugal transfer and integrated into the Streptomyces chromosome at the ΦBT1 attB site. The resultant S. coelicolor M1146 derivative strains were used as negative controls in β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays and as conjugation recipients for the overexpression of lodR3. Subsequently, pSET152::PkasO*lodR3C containing lodR3 driven by PkasO* was introduced into the M1146 derivatives in which gusA was controlled by different promoters of lod genes. The resultant strains were cultured on AS-1 (0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% soluble starch, 0.25% NaCl, 1% Na2SO4, 0.02% l-Ala, 0.02% l-Arg, 0.05% l-Asn) agar with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide (X-Gluc) at a final concentration of 100 μM at 28°C for 72 h to observe the chromogenic reaction. Statistical analysis. For each gene disruption, at least three individual mutants were tested. Other experiments were performed at least in biological triplicate unless otherwise stated, and the data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD). Statistical significance was analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant."
3,PMC8749412,"Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. Bacteria were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 28°C (X. nematophila) or 37°C (E. coli). When required, antibiotics were used at the following final concentrations: kanamycin, 20 μg/mL (or 10 μg/mL for chromosome selection); gentamicin, 15 μg/mL; chloramphenicol, 20 μg/mL for E. coli strains and 15 μg/mL for X. nematophila (or 8 μg/mL for chromosome selection); and ampicillin, 100 μg/mL. Ptet constructs were induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc) at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/mL. The Para ETγA (full-length recE, recT, redγ, and recA) and Para γβαA (redγ, redβ, redα, and recA) operons were induced by adding 10% l-arabinose. Plac constructs were induced by adding IPTG at a final concentration of 0.2 mM. We added 100 μg/mL of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) to cultures of the E. coli WM3064 strain, which is auxotrophic for this amino acid. Strains and plasmids used in this study. Download Table S1, PDF file, 0.1 MB. Molecular genetic techniques. DNA manipulations were performed as previously described (45). Plasmids were introduced into E. coli by transformation and transferred to X. nematophila by conjugative mating with WM3064 as the donor strain (46). All constructs were sequenced by Eurofins Genomics Germany GmbH. The primers used in this study (IDT) are described in Table S2. Primers used in this study. Download Table S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB. Recombineering construction of p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob. As previously described by Fu et al. (29), genomic DNA from X. nematophila was first digested with NcoI and SphI to generate a 45.2-kb fragment containing the odl-BGC locus and surrounding genes. Homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached by p15A-cm PCR with pACYC184 as a template. One homology arm started at the start codon of the first gene cloned (ectB gene) and extended 80 bp downstream. The other homology arm started at the SphI site and extended 80 bp upstream. After linear-plus-linear homologous recombination by RecET in GB05-dir activated with arabinose (0.3%), the odl locus was inserted directly into the p15A vector to create the p15A-odl-BGC containing a 44.5-kb odl-BGC fragment (four odl genes plus the surrounding genes). For expression of the odl-BGC locus, homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached to the Kmr-Tetr-PLtetO1 fragment of pSC101. One homology arm started at the start codon of the ectB gene and extended 57 bp downstream. The other homology arm started 216 bases from the p15A origin and extended 52 bp upstream. After linear-plus-circular homologous recombination by Redαβ in GB08-red activated with arabinose (0.3%), the Kmr-Tetr-PLtetO1 fragment was inserted into the p15A-odl-BGC plasmid between the p15A origin and the start codon of the ectB gene, to create p15A- Ptet-odl-BGC containing the 44.5-kb odl-BGC fragment under the control of the PLtetO1 promoter. For complementation of the odl mutant with p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC, homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached to the Gmr-mob fragment of pBBR1-MCS5. One homology arm started at the end of the kanamycin resistance gene sequence and extended 57 bp downstream. The other homology arm started at the end of Tetr and extended 54 bp upstream. After linear-plus-circular homologous recombination by Redαβ in GB08-red activated with arabinose (0.3%), the Gmr-mob fragment was inserted directly into the p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC plasmid, between Kmr and Tetr, to create the mobilizable plasmid p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob. Insertion of diverse genes into E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′. For identification of the odilorhabdin self-resistance gene, the regions upstream and downstream from the odl locus of X. nematophila F1 were amplified by PCR with the L-ectB-KpnI and R-c-SacI primers (for abc genes) or the L-d-KpnI and R-j-SacI primers (for defghij genes), respectively, and inserted into pUC19 digested with KpnI and SacI. Genes a, b, and c were amplified separately, by PCR, with L-ectB-KpnI and R-ectB-SacI, L-b-KpnI and R-b-SacI, and L-c-KpnI and R-c-SacI, respectively, and inserted into pUC19 digested with KpnI and SacI. All these constructs were used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ and were assessed separately in odilorhabdin MIC assays after the addition of IPTG. We assessed the functionality of diverse OatA proteins from Photorhabdus strains or OatA-like proteins from Xenorhabdus strains, by amplifying the corresponding genes by PCR with appropriate primers (Table S2) and inserting the amplicon between the KpnI and SacI sites of pUC19. The resulting constructs were then used to transform the E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ strain, and odilorhabdin MIC assays were performed after adding IPTG. The ngrA PCR fragment was inserted into the pBBR1-MCS2 broad-host-range vector with the L-ngrA-EcoRI and R-ngrA-BamHI primers digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the resulting construct was used to transform E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ before the addition of p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of OatA. For purification of the N-acetyltransferase, the oatA gene was first amplified from X. nematophila genomic DNA with the F-Nterm-oatA-NdeI and R-Stop-oatA-SalI primers (Table S2), digested with NdeI and SalI, and inserted into pET-28a previously digested with the same enzymes, at a position downstream from the T7 promoter and in fusion with the His tag, yielding pET-oatA. Fresh precultures of the overexpressing strain BL21(DE3) harboring the pET-oatA plasmid were grown overnight in 20 mL of LB broth supplemented with 20 μg/mL of kanamycin at 35°C. We inoculated 200 mL of LB broth supplemented with 20 μg/mL of kanamycin in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask with fresh overnight preculture (2% [vol/vol]) and incubated it at 35°C with shaking until the culture reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.4. The cells were induced by incubation with 0.2 mM IPTG for 3 h at 35°C. Cell pellets from two flasks were recovered by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, pooled, and washed once with saline. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 4 mL of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 2% glycerol (ACT buffer). Cells were lysed by processing the cell suspension in a Fast-Prep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 20 s at a speed of 4 m/s with 100-μm glass beads/cell at a suspension ratio of 1/3. The samples were then centrifuged (13,000 × g for 5 min) and the supernatants were recovered. Cell pellets were washed once with ACT buffer and the supernatants were pooled. Imidazole was added to a concentration of 10 mM before enzyme purification by the HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) Superflow agarose batch method (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, 1 mL of equilibrated Ni-NTA resin was added to 3 mL of sample. The mixture was incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking and was then washed four times with 25 mM imidazole in ACT wash buffer. Three elutions were performed, with 150, 250, and 500 mM imidazole. The eluates obtained with 250 and 500 mM imidazole were pooled and subjected to dialysis overnight against 75 mM HEPES at 4°C with a PurA-Lyzer cutoff at 3.5 kDa. Glycerol was added to the purified His-tagged OatA enzyme at a final concentration of 10% before storage at −20°C. Production and LC-MS analysis of secondary metabolites. For the detection of secondary metabolites in the culture supernatants, bacteria were collected from 96-h cultures by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants after filtration on 0.2-μm filters were analyzed by LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system coupled to an Agilent 6120 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The conditions for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation were as follows: a Symmetry C18 analytical column (5 μm, 4.6 mm by 150 mm; Waters Corporation) was used in positive mode, the injection volume was 100 μL, mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, mobile phase B was acetonitrile, and the linear gradient was 0% mobile phase B–100% mobile phase A at 0 min to 80% mobile phase B–20% mobile phase A at 40 min. UV detection was performed at 210 nm. During separation, the flow rate was 0.7 mL/min, and the column temperature was 37°C. In vitro acetylation of NOSO-95C. N-Acetylation of NOSO-95C or NOSO-95179 was performed in a polystyrene microtube with purified His-tagged OatA diluted to 300 μg/mL in 75 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) supplemented with glycerol (5.7% [vol/vol]), 250 μM NOSO-95C or NOSO-95179, and 750 μM acetyl-CoA in 75 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) for 24 h at 28°C. Aliquots were sampled at 15 min, 4 h, and 24 h. LC-MS/MS analysis. The acetylated NOSO-95C compounds were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Data were obtained in the positive mode on a Waters Alliance LC-MS/MS system (Waters Synapt G2-S mass spectrometer, Waters UPLC Acquity H-class). The HPLC column used was a Phenomenex EVO C18 T HPLC column (100 by 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) maintained at 25°C. Solvent A was H2O plus 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile plus 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phase composition was 100% solvent A from 0 min to 5 min, ramped to 30% solvent B at 10 min. Sample injection volume was 0.1 μL. UV-visible detection was by absorbance at 200 to 500 nm. An ion spray (IS) voltage of 3,000 V, a source temperature of 140°C, a desolvation temperature of 450°C, a declustering potential (DP) of 30 V, and a collision energy (CE) in the range of 20 to 60 V were applied. Antibiotic activity. Total antimicrobial activity was assessed with Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816 as a target of strains harboring odl-BGC loci. We placed 15 μL of an overnight bacterial culture on a plate containing Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Bio-Rad) supplemented with 1.4% agarose (Sigma), and aTc (200 ng/mL) was added when required. After incubation for 72 h at 28°C, the bacteria were exposed to chloroform fumes for 30 min and allowed to dry in air for 30 min. The Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (200 μL of an overnight culture) target strain was then added to 8 mL of MHB supplemented with 0.7% agarose, which was poured over the bacterial colony. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, zones of growth inhibition were observed. The antibiotic activity of the samples acetylated in vitro was also assessed, as follows. We spotted 10 μL of sample onto Mueller-Hinton II (Becton, Dickinson) medium supplemented with 1.4% agarose. We poured an overnight culture of E. coli ATCC 25922 in LB broth (2% [vol/vol]) over the plate. The plate was allowed to dry and was then incubated at 35°C for 20 h. We then observed the plates to check for zones of growth inhibition. IVTT assay. The effect of in vitro acetylation on bacterial protein synthesis was investigated in the Expressway cell-free E. coli expression system (Invitrogen). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was amplified from the pCmGFP plasmid (47) and inserted into pEXP5-CT TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the resulting plasmid was used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT). Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, in 50 μL of reaction mixture, in the wells of a black polystyrene 96-half-well microplate (Greiner). Feed buffer was added after 30 min of incubation, to ensure optimal protein synthesis. Reactions were initiated by adding 1 μg of plasmid DNA. The plate was incubated at 30°C and fluorescence was measured every 20 min (λex = 475 nm; λem = 520 nm) with a Spark M10 microplate reader (Tecan). Fluorescence from GFP synthesis was recorded at 20 min after addition of feed buffer using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Gentamicin was used as positive control at 10 μM. Gene expression and identification of the compounds produced in complemented strains. We investigated the production of secondary metabolites in complemented strains, by incubating 100-mL broth cultures of ΔxcnKL::odl1 (MCS5) and ΔxcnKL::odl1 (p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob) strains with gentamicin and aTc at 28°C for 78 h, centrifuging the cultures, and passing the supernatants through 0.2-μm filters and concentrating them 10-fold for LC-MS analysis. Natural odilorhabdins (NOSO-95A, -B, and -C) and xenocoumacin 1 (Xcn 1) were identified in culture supernatants by LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system coupled to an Agilent 6120 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The conditions for HPLC separation were as follows: a Symmetry C18 analytical column (5 μm, 4.6 mm by 150 mm; Waters Corporation) was used in positive mode, the injection volume was 100 μL, mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, mobile phase B was acetonitrile, and the linear gradient was 0% mobile phase B–100% mobile phase A at 0 min to 80% mobile phase B–20% mobile phase A at 40 min. UV detection was performed at 210 nm. During separation, the flow rate was 0.7 mL/min, and the column temperature was 37°C. Construction of X. nematophila mutants. For the construction of a ΔoatA mutant, we first constructed an ngrA-deficient strain, to prevent the suicide of the X. nematophila producer strain. The upstream and downstream regions of the ngrA gene were amplified by PCR with the L-PCR1-ngrA-XbaI and R-PCR1-ngrA-BamHI primers for the upstream region (579 bp) and the L-ngrA2bis-BamHI and R-ngrA2bis-ApaI primers for the downstream region (522 bp). The two fragments obtained were inserted, together with the 3.8-kb BamHI fragment omega interposon cassette from pHP45-ΩCm conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, into pJQ200SK digested with XbaI and ApaI for insertion of the ΩCam cassette between the two PCR fragments. The resulting plasmid, pJQ-ngrA::ΩCm, was used to transform E. coli strain WM3064 and was introduced into X. nematophila F1 by mating. Allelic exchange was performed as previously described (48). Omega insertion was confirmed by PCR analysis, and the loss of NRP products was checked by antibiosis tests. The clone obtained was called the ΔngrA clone. For construction of the ΔngrA ΔoatA double mutant, the upstream and downstream regions of the oatA gene were amplified by PCR with the appropriate primer pairs, L-SacI-b/R-SpeI-oatA (upstream) and L-SalI-oatA/R-ApaI-odl1 (downstream), generating a 595-bp PCR1 fragment and a 611-bp PCR2 fragment, respectively (Table S2). The pJQ-KmT1 plasmid was then digested with SpeI and SalI and the 2-kb KmT1 fragment containing the Kmr cassette and T1 terminators was purified with the Zymo gel purification kit (Ozyme). These three fragments were inserted into pJQ200SK digested with SacI and ApaI to introduce the Km-T1 cassette between the two PCR fragments. The pJQ-oatA::KmT1 plasmid was then introduced, by mating, into the X. nematophila ngrA mutant, and allelic exchange was performed. Kmr and Sacr exconjugants were selected on LB agar supplemented with 4% sucrose and kanamycin. The KmT1 insertion was checked by PCR analysis with the two primers L-b-KpnI/R-Km-PvuI amplifying a 1,791-bp fragment (Table S2), with confirmation by DNA sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). The resulting recombinant clone was named the ΔngrA ΔoatA clone. MIC determination. MICs were determined in triplicate, in accordance with CLSI guidelines but with modifications for Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus strains and for E. coli constructs (49). For Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus strains, inoculum preparation was modified as follows: 3 mL of MHB II (Becton, Dickinson, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was inoculated with bacteria grown overnight in LB broth and cultured to an OD600 of 0.11 to 0.15. The inoculum was prepared as described in the CLSI guide, with a 1:20 dilution in saline. Multiplates were incubated for 24 h at 28°C or for longer if the results were unclear. For E. coli constructs, a modified method of inoculum preparation was used in which about 10 colonies were picked from MH agar supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin and used to inoculate 10 mL of MHB II supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin. The inoculum was incubated for 1.5 to 2 h at 35°C, with shaking at 150 rpm, until the OD600 reached 0.15 to 0.25. IPTG was added at a concentration of 0.2 mM for induction, and the culture was incubated for 30 min at 35°C, with shaking at 150 rpm. The inoculum was then diluted 1:20 in saline to obtain the final inoculum. The reaction medium consisted of MHB II supplemented with 0.2 mM IPTG. For other E. coli constructs requiring aTc induction, aTc was added to the isolate used for streaking and the reaction medium at a concentration of 200 ng/mL. In all other respects, the procedure corresponded to the CLSI method."
4,PMC9241694,"Bacterial strains and culture conditions. Strains used for cloning or conjugation were E. coli XL11 blue (Agilent technologies) and the methylation-deficient E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 (47), respectively. E. coli strains were grown and maintained at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or LB agar (LB with 1.5% agar) supplemented with 30 mg/mL chloramphenicol, 50 mg/mL kanamycin, and 50 mg/mL apramycin, when required. Streptomyces strains were obtained from stocks of the actinobacteria collection of the pharmaceutical biology department of the University of Tübingen. S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622 was obtained through G. Padilla from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of Sao Paulo. S. peucetius DSM 40754 was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH (DSMZ). Streptomyces strains were grown and maintained at 30°C in trypticase soy (TS) broth and/or TS agar (Sigma-Aldrich), mannitol-soy agar (2% mannitol, 2% soybean meal, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.5% agar), R2YE (48), and R5M to produce cosmomycin D (5). Cosmomycin D production, purification, and structure integrity. Doxorubicin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cosmomycin D utilized in this study was isolated and purified from 5-L R5M medium fermentations of S. olindensis, as previously reported (6). For analysis of cosmomycin production, the crude extract was dissolved in methanol (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [LC-MS] grade; Merck) and applied to a solid-phase extraction cartridge (Strata-XL, 100 μm polymeric reversed phase, 2 g; Phenomenex). The adsorbed compounds were eluted in fractions using a stepwise gradient of 10% to 100% methanol and concentrated under reduced pressure. After resuspension of the residue, 10-μL samples were analyzed by high-performance (HP) LC-MS, using a reverse-phase column (Luna Omega Polar C18, 3 μm, 150 mm by 3.0 mm; Phenomenex) and a mobile phase of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.06% formic acid in water (solvent B). A gradient of 10% B to 100% B in 22 min, ending with 100% B for an additional 8 min, with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min was used. The fraction containing COSD (m/z 1,189.54) was further purified using a Waters HPLC system (Waters 1525 binary pump with a 7725i Rheodyne injection port, a Kromega solvent degasser and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector), using a linear gradient of 40% B to 60% B in 15 min, followed by a linear gradient of 60% B to 95% B in 20 min and an additional 10 min at 95% B (solvent A, 0.06% formic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min (Luna Omega Polar C18 column, 5 μm, 250 mm by 4.6 mm; Phenomenex) to obtain ~5 mg pure COSD. For structure determination, high-resolution LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)/MS and MS/MS measurements were performed on a Bruker Daltonics maXis 4G (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) connected to a Thermo Scientific UltiMate 3000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a reversed-phase Luna Omega Polar C18 column (3 μm, 150 by 3 mm) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A linear gradient of 10% to 100% solvent B in 40 min, ending with 100% B for an additional 15 min, was used (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid in water; solvent B, acetonitrile), with an injection volume of 5 μL and UV monitoring occurred at 210, 254, 280, and 360 nm. The range of MS acquisition was m/z 50 to 1,800. The acquisition parameters for the positive ion polarity were a capillary voltage of 4.5, nebulizer gas pressure (nitrogen) set to 2.0 bar, and dry gas flow of 9.0 L/min at an ion source temperature of 200°C. The measurements were internally calibrated using sodium formate as a reference. The data were compared to data of cosmomycin D and to published data of various related compounds (Fig. S9, Table S1) (6, 16). DNA isolation and manipulation. Plasmid preparation from E. coli was carried out with a commercial kit (QIAprep spin miniprep kit; Qiagen). Total Streptomyces DNA isolation, restriction endonuclease digestions, and ligations were performed as described previously (48, 49). DNA sequencing was performed at Eurofins Genomics Germany GmbH. Cloning and construction of plasmids for heterologous expression of cosmomycin resistance genes in S. lividans TK24. cosI, cosJ, cosP, and cosU genes were amplified from S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622 genomic DNA using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase from New England Biolabs, Inc., according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using the primers listed in Table S3. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pUWL_Apra-oriT vector containing an apramycin resistance gene cassette under the control of the constitutively active ermE* promoter to ensure a high level of expression. These constructs (Table S4) were transferred into E. coli XL1 blue and further into E. coli ET12567/PUZ8002 to obtain nonmethylated DNA. The constructs pRCWL04 (cosI and cosJ), pRCWL05 (cosP), and pRCWL06 (cosU) were finally transferred into S. lividans TK24 by conjugation (50). Expression and purification of recombinant CosP and CosP(C38S) in E. coli. For cloning and expression of the mycothiol peroxidase CosP, the IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible vector pHIS8 (51) was used to generate an N-terminally His8-tagged CosP. cosP was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (gDNA) of S. olindensis using primers containing recognition sequences for EcoRI and HindIII, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the expression vector through ligation, taking advantage of the EcoRI/HindIII restriction sites, generating plasmid pRCWL04. The integrity of the resulting plasmids was verified via sequencing. Plasmid pRCWL04 was further modified in the CALA coding region of the enzyme (MPx), exchanging cysteine (C) for serine (S) at position 38, using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies), resulting in plasmid pRCWL04M. Heterologous expression and purification of His8-tagged proteins were carried out using E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3)pLys (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) as the recombinant host strain. Strains containing the corresponding plasmid were cultivated in 1 L LB broth supplemented with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 50 μg/mL kanamycin at 37°C and 220 rpm. At an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6, the temperature was adjusted to 18°C and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The overnight culture was harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (3 mL/g pellet) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerin [vol/vol], 1% Tween 20 [vol/vol], 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], and 4 mg/mL lysozyme). The cells were sonicated (Sonifier generator; Branson) on ice for 10 min (amplitude of 40%, 5 s on/5 s off). After centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm (4°C), the clear lysate was filtered (0.45 μm) for affinity chromatography. Supernatant of each culture was applied to affinity chromatography using an Äkta start platform (GE Healthcare) equipped with a 5-mL His-Trap HP column (GE Healthcare). The His-tagged protein was washed and then eluted from the column using a linear gradient of 0 to 100% elution buffer over 60 min and collected by a Frac30 system (GE Healthcare). Fractions were tested for the presence of the respective proteins by SDS-PAGE and were concentrated and buffer exchanged into 25 mM KH2PO4,100 mM NaCl, pH 8.3, using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Mr cutoff of 10,000; Millipore). Concentrations of the purified proteins were measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficients (calculated with http://web.expasy.org/protparam/). The purified proteins were stored in aliquots at −80°C. Purification of total protein from Streptomyces strains. S. olindensis and S. lividans pUWL (apramycin) were incubated in 100 mL TS broth for 48 h at 30°C at 220 rpm. Five milliliters of the preculture was added to 100 mL of YEME (48) medium and incubated for a further 2 days at 30°C at 220 rpm. The cultures were stored on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mL/g pellet) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerin [vol/vol], 1% Tween 20 [vol/vol], 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 4 mg/mL lysozyme). The cells were ruptured with a French press under 10,000 lb/in2 pressure, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4°C for 45 min at 15,000 rpm. The clear lysate was filtered (0.45 μm) for buffer exchange (25 mM KH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.3). The purified proteins were quantified and stored at the same concentration at −80°C. Peroxide and protein quantification. The concentration of H2O2 stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was measured at 240 nm (ε240 nm = 43.6 M−1 cm−1) (52). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm; the molar absorption coefficients were calculated from the amino acid compositions (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/) (53). The calculated protein concentrations refer to those of monomers. FOX assay. WT MPx and its mutant were reduced with 10× excess dithiothreitol (DTT) in buffer solution (250 mM Tris buffer, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX) assay (54) was used to determine the H2O2 consumption over time by the purified MPx or the C38S mutant and total proteins from S. olindensis and S. peucetius strains isolated during antibiotic production. All measurements were performed in three replicates for each treatment. The H2O2 concentration was calculated based on an H2O2 standard curve. In the case of purified MPx and mutant MPx, 100 μM was mixed with 100 μM H2O2 in 100 mM assay buffer, pH 8, at 30°C, and 10-μL amounts of the reaction mixture were taken after 15, 30, 45, 90, and 180 s and mixed with 490 μL of the FOX reaction mixture (100 μM xylenol orange, 250 μM ammonium ferrous sulfate, 100 mM sorbitol, and 25 mM H2SO4) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. At the end of the reaction, the A560 was measured on a 96-well plate reader (FLUOstar Omega) as described elsewhere (54). To isolate total proteins from S. olindensis and S. lividans, cells were initially grown in TS broth at 30°C for 24 h. One percent preculture was used to inoculate the main R5M culture. This culture was grown at 30°C for protein extraction at 24, 48, and 72 h during the production of cosmomycin D for S. olindensis. Then, 100 mM H2O2 was added to equal concentrations of total proteins. Ten-microliter aliquots were taken after 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 s, as described elsewhere (54). Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. Total RNA of producer strain S. olindensis WT was extracted using RNAprotect bacterial reagent and the RNeasy minikit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). The frozen samples were ground in dry ice. Residual DNA was removed by treating with RNase-free DNase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). An aliquot of 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA was transcribed into cDNA using iScript reverse transcription supermix for reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). qPCR analysis. For qPCR, a Bio-Rad iQ5 thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) was programmed for an initial denaturation of 5 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°C and 15 s at 60°C. The specificity of the qPCR primers (Table S3) was evaluated by the melting curve, using a gradient of 55 to 95°C at 1°C each 30 s (Fig. S10). For each amplification reaction mixture volume, 2 μL of cDNA (50 ng), 10 μM each primer, and 10 μL of QuantiNova probe PCR kit (Qiagen) were used. iQ5 Optical System software was used to determine the relative quantification of the target genes in comparison to the reference gene. The selection of an endogenous gene, to be used as a normalizer, was made by testing the cycle threshold (CT) values for the different described endogenous genes (Fig. S10). The hdrB housekeeping gene presented the lowest ΔCT and the highest amplification efficiency, resulting in its selection as the normalizer for gene expression analysis. Determination of MICs of anthracyclines. Sterile 96-well plates were used to generate MIC values. Each well contained 100 μL of Bennett’s agar and doxorubicin or cosmomycin D with concentrations ranging from 0 to 512 μg/mL. Each well was inoculated with ~103
Streptomyces spores. Plates were incubated overnight at 30°C. Growth was compared with that of the controls, S. peucetius, S. olindensis, and S. lividans TK24/pUWL (empty vector). Construction of SSNs and GNN. Web tools of the Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI), available at https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/ (22), were used to generated sequence similarity networks (SSNs) from KDN80073.1 and the glutathione peroxidase Pfam family (PF00255). For the seed SSN obtained with the KDN80073.1 FASTA sequence, the option Maximum Number of Retrieve Sequences = 100 in the BLAST Retrieval Options tab was selected, and then the score threshold was adjusted to 65 using Percent Identity vs Alignment Score Box Plot in order to set up only the presence of nodes with identity equal to 70% or above. For the initial submission of PF00255, all settings were kept at the default, and a first SSN was generated using a Score threshold of 50, which means each edge joins nodes with at least 55% similarity. The second SSN used a slightly higher score threshold of 60 (nodes are joined if they share about 61% or more identity). Using the EFI Genome Neighborhood Tool (EFI-GNT tab) of the same website, a genome neighborhood network (GNN) and genome neighborhood diagrams (GNDs) of the second SSN were obtained using as parameters Neighborhood Size = 20 and Cooccurrence Percentage Lower Limit = 20."
5,PMC7947920,"Soil Sample Preparation Twelve soil samples (≥10 g) were collected from several different locations in Sweden (Table 1). Seven soil samples (1–7) were from Uppsala County along The Linnaeus Trails (Herbationes Upsalienses), one sample (8) was from Gävleborg County north of Uppsala, three samples (9–11) were from Norrbotten County, in the mountains above the Arctic Circle, and the last soil sample (12) came from a sandy beach in Gotland County, an island in the Baltic Sea. Samples were taken by pressing or digging a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube into the soil surface. The samples were kept cold until the time of dilution and plating. Aliquots of the individual soil samples were deep frozen and selected samples were later sent in a frozen state to BaseClear BV (Leiden, Netherlands) for DNA extraction, NGS (next generation sequencing) and analysis of microbial community composition (Supplementary Material).

Isolation of MDR Pedobacter spp. As growth medium base for isolation of bacteria, a modified CN medium was used (Gavrish et al., 2008). The modified medium base was denoted as NBCA (Nutrient Broth/Casamino Acid agar medium) and contained: 1 g Difco Nutrient Broth (BD Difco Ltd., Detroit, MI, Untied States), 1 g Casamino Acids (BD Difco Ltd.), 15 g Bacto agar (Saveen & Werner, Limhamn, Sweden) in 1 L of deionized water. Fungicides and various antibiotics were added to NBCA after autoclaving and cooling the medium to 50°C. To reduce the growth of molds, two fungicides, cycloheximide, and nystatin, were added to the final concentration of (100 mg/L) and (10 mg/L), respectively. The NBCA was also supplemented with varying combinations of antibiotics to provide the selection conditions for the isolation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Selected antibiotics covered different antibiotic classes and mechanisms of action and when supplemented to the NBCA the following final concentrations were used: ampicillin (AMP, 20 mg/L), kanamycin (KAN, 20 mg/L), nalidixic acid (NAL, 20 mg/L), streptomycin (STR, 20 mg/L) and erythromycin (ERY, 20 mg/L), lincomycin (LIN 10 mg/L) was 10 mg/L, gentamicin (GEN, 5 mg/L), vancomycin (VAN, 2 mg/L), polymyxin B (POL, 2 mg/L), and ciprofloxacin (CIP, 1 mg/L). Approximately 4 g of each individual soil sample was thoroughly mixed by vortexing with 40 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The mixture was allowed to settle for at least 10 min and then 1 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 9 mL of sterile PBS in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube. From this dilution, 0.1 mL was spread onto the NBCA isolation plates without (control) or with different combinations of antibiotics. The plates were then incubated at 20°C for approximately one week in darkness to avoid degradation of light sensitive antibiotics. Morphologically different bacterial colonies were afterward re-streaked on Vegetable Peptone Broth Agar plates (VPA), containing 10 g Vegetable Peptone Broth (VPB; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom), and 15 g Bacto Agar (Saveen & Werner) in 1 L deionized water. Antibiotic Resistance Pattern of P. cryoconitis UP508 The antibiotic resistance pattern of isolate UP508 was established using NBCA agar base (as above) supplemented with the following individual antibiotics at 20 mg/L: AMP, CIP, ERY, GEN, KAN, LIN, NAL, POL, STR, and VAN. The isolate was inoculated on the plates, which were incubated for 2–3 days in darkness at room temperature and inspected for bacterial growth. Identification and Phylogeny Twenty-eight bacterial strains isolated from soil samples were selected for identification by means of sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Sequencing was also performed for the five type isolates of different Pedobacter species purchased from the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms [BCCM/LMG, Pedobacter cryoconitis A37 (LMG 21415T) and P. lusitanus NL19 (LMG 29220T)], the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures [DSMZ, Pedobacter hartonius WB 3.3-3 (DSM 19033T) and Pedobacter westerhofensis WB 3.3-22 (DSM 19036T)] as well as from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms [JCM, Pedobacter himalayensis HHS22 (JCM 12171T)]. Briefly, colony PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed with the universal primers 27F (AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 1492R (TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT) followed by purification of amplified PCR-products (QIAquick PCR purifications kit, QIAGEN). Sequencing was then performed by Macrogen Europe (EZ-sequencing, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The resulting DNA sequencing chromatograms were assembled using the Geneious R8 software and manually inspected (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). The resulting 16S rRNA sequences were deposited at GenBank (accession numbers MW332350 to MW332382). The BLAST database for 16S rRNA sequences (Altschul et al., 1997) of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI2) was then used to retrieve the closest possible identity of the isolates. For aligning the sequences, the online MAFFT version 7 multiple alignment program for amino acid or nucleotide sequences3 was used and Neighbor Joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees were obtained after estimating the robustness of the internal tree branches by bootstrap analysis (Jukes–Cantor/bootstrap 1000) using 1000 replications (Katoh et al., 2019). Culturing, Collection, and Extraction of Metabolites Bacterial strains isolated from soil samples and the reference Pedobacter species, were grown in liquid cultures (150 mL in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks) using half strength VPB [15 g VPB (Oxoid Ltd.) in 1 L deionized water]. Cultures were either started by transferring a loop (10 μL) of 24–48 h-old bacterial colonies grown on VPA plates or by transferring 100 μL of deep-frozen isolate stock per 150 mL VPB. The cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker (130 rpm) for 96–120 h at 20°C in darkness. To collect extracellular metabolites, one sterile nylon mesh bag containing a polymeric resin, Sepabeads® SP850 (Sigma-Aldrich), was submerged in each actively growing culture, approximately 16–24 h after inoculation (approximately 8 g of resin per bag). At harvest, each adsorbent resin bag was washed with deionized water to remove bacterial cells and culture resins. Each bag was subsequently extracted with 2 × 20 mL MeOH and 2 × 20 mL MeCN, and the extracts were pooled and analyzed by UHPLC-MS and -MSMS (below), and the residues were dried in a vacuum centrifuge for subsequent fractionation by preparative HPLC (below). Analysis of Culture Extracts by UHPLC-MS and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis Adsorbent extracts were centrifuged (5 min, 13,000 rpm) and analyzed (injection volume 1 μL) by UHPLC-MS on a reversed phase column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.5 μm, Thermo Accucore Vanquish RP-MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II instrument connected to a maXis Impact ESI-QTOF MS (Bruker), using a gradient of MeCN in water (20–55% MeCN in 3 min, 95% MeCN for 1.2 min, at 0.9 mL/min, with 0.2% formic acid). The MS was operated in positive mode with scanning of m/z 50–1500, and calibration of the mass spectra was obtained by a sodium formate clusters. The software Compass DataAnalysis 4.3 (Bruker Daltonics) was used for calibration and data analysis. Isopedopeptins were identified by comparison with authentic compounds from previous work (Nord et al., 2020), and identification of other compounds was attempted by comparison of HRMS-data with databases (Antibase and Combined Chemical Dictionary). UHPLC-MSMS was run on the same instrument, column and UHPLC-conditions, on extracts or on extracts treated with 2% NaOMe in MeOH for 30 min at room temperature, using the auto MSMS function (1+, 2+, and 3+ precursor ions, m/z 200–1100, ramped fragmentation energies: 1+: 30/40/45 eV for m/z 100/500/1000; 2+: 15/25/30 eV for m/z 100/500/1000; 3+: 10/20/25 eV for m/z 100/500/1000). Following conversion of UHPLC-MS data to mzXML format using DataAnalysis 4.3, ion-chromatogram peak picking in the range 20–200 s was done by the program XCMS in the software environment R using the centWave method (peakwidth 3–20 s, m/z tolerance 5 ppm, noise 10,000) (Smith et al., 2006; Tautenhahn and Böttcher, 2008). XCMS was used for subsequent peak grouping and missing peak filling. The resulting peak-areas of the molecular features of each sample were normalized against the sum of peak-areas, and the resulting relative peak-areas were then 10-logarithmized. To reduce the complexity of the data set, only the dominant molecular feature for each molecule was used, and features with peak-areas <200,000 were not included. The data were used to construct a heat map with hierarchical clustering of both strains and molecular features (distance: Euclidean, clustering: complete). Fractionation of Culture Extracts by Preparative HPLC Based on the UHPLC-MS analyses and the heat map data, representative isolates were selected for fractionation and subsequent bioassays. The dried culture extracts were dissolved in 1 mL 50% MeCN and following centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 5 min), 1-mL samples were fractionated on a reversed phase preparative HPLC column (Luna Omega PS C18, 21.2 × 100 mm, 5 μm), eluted with a gradient of MeCN in water (15–50% MeCN in 15 min, 50–95% MeCN in 2 min, and a hold at 95% MeCN for 8 min, at 10 mL/min) with 0.2% formic acid. The eluent was monitored at 210 nm and fractions (2 mL) were collected in deep-well plates (start after 5 min). Aliquots (100 μL) of all fractions were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, dried over-night in a fume-hood, and subsequently analyzed for antibacterial activity (below). In vitro Bioassay of Antibacterial Activity Chromatographic fractions of the extracts of selected isolates (above) were assayed for antibacterial activity using an earlier developed protocol (Thaning et al., 2001; Nord et al., 2019) with the following human pathogenic bacteria or bacteria commonly used in such bioassays: Escherichia coli LMG 15862, Acinetobacter baumannii LMG 1041T, Enterobacter cloacae LMG 2783T, Klebsiella pneumoniae LMG 20218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 6395, and Staphylococcus aureus LMG 15975, all purchased from BCCM/LMG and maintained as advised by supplier. Briefly, cell suspensions (0.1 mL/well) at a concentration of 104 cells per mL half strength VBP (Oxoid Ltd.) were added to the microtiter plates with dried aliquots of HPLC fractions (above), and the plates were incubated at 37°C in darkness for 16–24 h. The effect on the bacterial growth was estimated visually according to the following scale: 3/red – full growth inhibition, 2/orange – intermediate growth inhibition, 1/yellow – weak growth inhibition, 0 – no growth inhibition. Positive controls were wells with cell suspensions in VPB only, and sterile VPB was used as negative control."
6,PMC4708987,"Fungal strains and general molecular techniques The wild-type strain of P. roqueforti CECT 2905 (ATCC 10110), originally isolated from a blue cheese sample, was used in this work. Penicillium roqueforti transformants were obtained by protoplast transformation of strain CECT 2905, as described below. Potato dextrose agar (PDA; Merck, Germany) was used for the routine growth of all the strains. The protocol described by Gil-Duran et al. [16] was used for DNA isolation. For total RNA purification, the strains were grown on YES agar (Bacto Yeast Extract (Difco, USA) 20 g/l, sucrose (Merck, Germany, biochemical grade) 150 g/l and Bacto Agar (Difco, USA) 20 g/l) for 7 days at 28°C. Total RNA was isolated exactly as described previously [16]. RT-PCR experiments were performed as described by Ravanal et al. [17]. RACE-PCR experiments were performed with the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer`s protocol. Bioinformatic identification and characterization of the mpa cluster of P. roqueforti The highly conserved MpaF protein, encoded by the mpaF gene from P. brevicompactum, was used to scan the whole draft genome of P. roqueforti [18] by tBlastN. Two contigs (GenBank accessions CBMR010000200 and CBMR010000309) containing ORFs encoding proteins with significant similarity to MpaF were identified and downloaded. The vicinities of each of these ORFs were then manually analyzed by BlastX, BlastP and BlastN. All Blast searches were performed using the online web interface at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Multiple alignments of deduced proteins were performed using Clustal Omega at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/. Construction of plasmids to silence the seven genes of the MPA gene cluster RNA-mediated gene silencing technology has been successfully used to silence genes in P. roqueforti [16, 19]. Here we used the same experimental approach. Plasmid pJL43-RNAi [20] was used to generate seven constructs (S1 Fig) as follows: pJL43-RNAi was digested with NcoI. In parallel, a small fragment of each gene from the mpa cluster was amplified with suitable primers and was also digested with NcoI. Finally, each digested fragment was ligated into pJL43-RNAi, thus giving rise to the plasmids pJL-RNAi-mpaA, pJL-RNAi-mpaB, pJL-RNAi-mpaC, pJL-RNAi-mpaDE, pJL-RNAi-mpaF, pJL-RNAi-mpaG and pJL-RNAi-mpaH, which were used to transform P. roqueforti (see below). These plasmids contain the respective DNA fragment flanked by two promoters in opposite directions (S1 Fig), which generate double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNAs). These dsRNAs activate the fungal RNA-silencing machinery, resulting in the degradation of target mRNAs [20]. S1 Table shows the primer sequences and the size of the fragment ligated in each construct. Transformation of P. roqueforti P. roqueforti transformants were obtained by introducing the genetic constructs described above into strain CECT 2905 by protoplast transformation. Protoplast obtainment, transformation, selection of transformants on Czapek-sorbitol medium containing phleomycin, and obtainment of homokaryotic strains were carried out exactly as described before [16]. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis The silencing level of each gene in the transformants was analyzed by qRT-PCR as described previously [16]. Total RNA was quantified in a MultiSkan GO quantification system (Thermo Scientific, Germany). Two μg were used to synthesize cDNA using RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific, Germany). Each qRT-PCR reaction (20 μl) contained 10 μl of KAPA SYBR Fast qRT-PCR Master Mix 2x (Kapa Biosystems, USA), 0.4 μl of each primer (at a concentration of 10 μM each), 0.4 μl de 50x ROX High/Low, 6.8 μl of water and 2 μl of cDNA. qRT-PCR reactions were carried out using the StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Amplification conditions were as follows: 20 s at 95°C and 40 cycles of 3 s at 95°C and 30 s at 50°C. Three replicates were performed for each analysis and suitable negative controls were included. Relative gene expression values were determined by the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method using β-tubulin gene expression as a normalization control. S2 Table describes the sequence of the primer sets used in qRT-PCR. All exhibited suitable efficiencies as required for the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method (S3 Table). Extraction and HPLC analysis of MPA Each fungal strain was grown on YES agar (see the composition above) for 7 days at 28°C. For each strain the mycelium from three Petri dishes was scraped off the agar. After that, the remaining agar was triturated. Both the mycelium and the triturated agar were extracted separately according to the method described by O´Brien et al. [21], with some modifications. Each sample (mycelium or agar) was extracted overnight with 50 ml of an ethyl acetate: dichloromethane: methanol (3:2:1) mixture containing formic acid (1%). The mixtures were then sonicated for 30 minutes, filtered through a 0.45 μm Millex-HV hydrophilic PVDF syringe filter (Merck Millipore), and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. The extracts were resuspended in 500 μl of methanol (HPLC grade) just before HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was performed on a Waters 1525 HPLC system (Waters, Ireland) equipped with a Waters 1525 Binary HPLC pump and a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array (PDA) Detector, using the chromatographic method described by Nielsen et al. [22] with some modifications. Briefly, 20 μl of the methanol suspension described before were injected into a 4.6 x 250 mm (5 μm) SunFire C18 column (Waters, Ireland). The column was held at 35°C. A solvent gradient with water and acetonitrile (both acidified with 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min was used. The gradient began with 15% acetonitrile and was increased to 68% acetonitrile after 25 minutes. The acetonitrile was then increased to 100% within 2 min. This percentage remained constant for 5 minutes before returning to 15% acetonitrile. MPA was detected by UV absorption at 300 nm and quantified using the pure compound as standard (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). MPA showed a retention time of 18.25 min. For each strain used, the quantity of MPA was normalized by the dry weight of the fungal mycelia. For this purpose, and after the extraction with ethyl acetate/dichloromethane/methanol, the mycelia from each sample were dried according to García-Rico et al. [23]. Analysis of the MPA resistance in P. roqueforti strains MPA treatment of the fungi was performed by the spot assay method described by Hansen et al. [24]. Briefly, spores from P. roqueforti strains were harvested, and a suspension of 1x106 spores/ml was obtained. From this initial suspension, 10-fold dilution series were performed on freshly made CYA-plates containing 100 μg MPA/ml (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Plates were incubated for 9 days at 28°C."
7,PMC4530439,"Fermentation for PHTs producing Seed cells of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A and gene in-frame deletion mutants were cultured by LB medium at 28 °C. Cells were harvested and washed twice with equal volume of distilled water, then transferred into sucrose minimal medium and fermented at 18 °C for 72 hours for PHTs producing. In the feeding experiments, 0.5 mM authentic oligopeptides were fed in the fermentation process of phtU- and phtQ- mutants respectively. PHT biosynthesis related genes in-frame deletion and complementation PHTs native producer P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A genome Fosmid library was constructed with CopyControl™ Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre® Biotechnologies products) according to standard protocols36. Fosmid 7C6 with a 33.6 kb DNA insert which covers the complete PHT biosynthetic gene cluster and flanking sequence of 5.5 kb upstream and 3.3 kb downstream was screened out by PCR. Gene phtU of Fosmid 7C6 was replaced by Apramycin resistant gene aac(3)IV from plasmid pIJ773 by PCR targeting with primer pair DUF1/DUR2 (Table S1)37. Gene aac(3)IV was eliminated by FLP-recombinase mediated excision in E.coli DH5α/BT340 to generate a disruption cassette pWHU2001. Plasmids pWHU2001 were transferred into P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A cells by electroporation and single crossover recombinant strains resistant to chloramphenicol were picked up. The phtU gene in-frame deletion mutant strains CL001 resulted from double crossover were selected out by rounds of relaxation and chloramphenicol sensitivity tests and then validated by PCR with primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Figure S2A, S2B, Table S1). Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ and phtL in-frame deletion. Primer pair DQF1/DQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ PCR targeting and primer pair VQF1/VQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ- mutant strain CL002 PCR validation (Figure S2C, S2D). Primer pair DLF1/DLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL PCR targeting and primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL- mutant strain CL003 PCR validation (Figure S2E, S2F). To the gene complementation of phtU and phtQ in CL001 and CL002 strains, the constitutive promotor of gene phtA was employed to construct infusion genes PphtA-ORFphtU and PphtA-ORFphtQ. A 227 bp DNA fragment containing PphtA was amplified by PCR with primer pair PphtAF1/PphtAR2 (Table S1). The ORF region of gene phtU was amplified by PCR with primer pair PhtUF1/PhtUR2 (Table S1). These two fragments were insert into the BamHI site of a RK2-derived plasmid pRKaraRED to give recombinant plasmid pWHU2004. Transformation of pWHU2004 into phtU- mutant strain CL001 gave phtU gene complementation strain CL004. Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ complementation strain CL005 construction with the exception of that phtQ was amplified with primer pair PhtQF1/PhtQR2 (Table S1) and the recombinant plasmid was defined as pWHU2005. ArgK over-expression and enzyme assay Gene argK was amplified by PCR with primer pair OKF1/OKR2 (Table S1) and inserted into the BamHI/XhoI locus of vector pET28a. His·tag-ArgK fusion proteins were over-expressed and purified with standard protocol36. Authentic standards of L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg were purchased from Life Tein L.T.D. Company (Beijing) (Figure S3). Transcarbamylase enzyme assay were performed in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes with a system as 0.2 mg purified ArgK, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Lithium carbamoyphosphate dibasic hydrate, 1 mM L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg, 2 mM MgSO4 and 0.5 mM ATP, 200 μL in total. ArgK was absent in the negative control reactions while the other factors remained identical. The enzyme was removed from the reaction system with a 10 KDa centrifugal filter at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The residual sections were diluted to ten times volume of the original reaction system before injected into the HPLC-MS analyzer. HPLC-MS analysis Culture supernatants for PHTs and biosynthetic intermediates discovery were thirty times concentrated by rotovaping at room temperature and then cut by methanol with a final concentration of 90%. Samples were dried out by rotovaping and re-suspended in ddH2O for HPLC-MS analysis. A Thermo hypercarb column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, column temperature 30 °C) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min was employed in the HPLC section. The HPLC gradient was 0% solvent B (4 min), 0–40% solvent B (12 min), 40–100% solvent B (3 min), 100% solvent B (3 min), 100–0% solvent B (3 min), 0% solvent B (5 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in H2O and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN. High resolution MS analysis was carried out in a positive mode on a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL Orbitrap mass spectrometer as described previously38. PHTs samples from the culture supernatants of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A were used to build the MS fragmentation fingerprint of PHTs and desulfonated PHTs by selected ion reaction (SIR) method. Daughter ions with m/z ratio at 189 and 374 were recognized to be the characteristic fragments of PHTs. To screen for PHTs biosynthetic intermediates, PIS was performed in a positive mode on a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Access MAX instrument (monitoring m/z ratio at 189 and 374) equipped with a Thermo Scientific Accela 600 pump. Target ions were selected out for HR tandem MS analysis as described above to figure out the elemental compositions. Enzyme assay samples were analyzed on the TSQ instrument with a selected ion monitoring (SIM) scan mode with a range from m/z ratio at 360 to 430. Reaction products were double checked by HR tandem MS analysis on the Orbitrap instrument. NMR analysis 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of tripeptides L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg (20 mg) and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg (20 mg) were recorded on Agilent 400 MHz instrument in D2O, respectively (Figure S3). Culture supernatants of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A were cut by methanol and dried out as described above. Residues were re-suspended in ddH2O with 10% D2O and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on Agilent 400 MHz instrument. Bioassay of P. syringae 1448A against L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg To evaluate the toxicity of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg to PHT producers P. syringae 1448A, authentic tripeptide L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg was added to the culture media of 1448A. Two kinds of media, LB (Tryptone 10.0 g, Yeast extract 5.0 g and NaCl 5.0 g for 1 liter, pH 7.2) and MM (Sucrose 5.0 g, KH2PO4 2.0 g, (NH4)2HPO4 2.0 g, MgSO4·7H2O 1.0 g, FeSO4·7H2O 0.01 g and MnSO4 0.01 g for 1 liter, pH 7.2), were employed in the assay. Two kinds of compound concentrations, 1 mM and 10 mM, were tested respectively. The OD600 value of bacterial cultures at different time points was monitored by a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer."
8,PMC3610138,"Strains and media Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 was maintained and cultivated to prepare genomic DNA according to
[12]. Streptomyces coelicolor ΔvanRS was gently donated by Hee-Jeon Hong, University of Cambridge, UK
[16], Streptomyces lividans TK24 and Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10595 were a gift from Mervyn Bibb, John Innes Institute, Norwich, UK
[14]. Streptomyces spp. strains were maintained as spores in 10% (v/v) glycerol and propagated in MYM and SFM agar media
[14]. For growing ex-conjugants containing pIJ86, pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-vanYn and pIJ86ΩvanYn, agar plates were added with 50 μg/mL of apramycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Agar plates were incubated at 28°C. Liquid media for streptomycetes were YEME -containing in (w/v) 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% bacto-peptone, 0.3% oxoid malt extract, 1% glucose in deionized water, pH 7.0- and BTSB -containing in (w/v) 10% sucrose, 1% yeast extract, 1% glucose, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5% soybean meal, 1.7% tryptone and 0.25% K2HPO4 in deionized water, pH 7.0. All medium components were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), unless otherwise stated. Colonies were picked up from agar plates and inoculated into 300 mL baffled flasks containing 50 mL of YEME or BTSB. Flask cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and 28°C. Media and culture conditions for E. coli were described in
[12]. E. coli DH5α was used as host for plasmid construction. Escherichia coli ET12567/pUZ8002
[5] was used as non-methylating plasmid donor strain for intergeneric conjugation with Streptomyces spp. Cells were propagated in Luria-Bertani (LB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) broth at 37°C. Plasmids pIJ86 (gift from Mervyn Bibb) was used as a multi-copy vector for heterologous expression in Streptomyces spp.
[12]. Plasmids pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn and pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn were constructed as follow. Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche, Milan, Italy) was used to amplify vanYn using genomic DNA of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 as template with oligonucleotide primers vanY004Fw (5′-ATAGGATCCCCAGACTGGAGGAGAGGGATGAGGAGAAGCGAGGGTGAC-3′) and vanY004Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGACCCGGCCCCCGTTCCGGCT-3′) that introduced a C-terminal tag of six histidine residues and the HindIII and BamHI (Roche, Milan, Italy) restriction sites, respectively, into the PCR product, allowing insertion into the multiple cloning site of the multicopy expression vector pIJ86. The vanYn with a N-terminal tag of six histidines was produced using as oligonucleotide primers vanY003Fw (5′-ATATTTGGATCCATGCACCACCACCACCACCACAGGAGAAGCGAGGGTGACGAC-3′) and vanY003Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCCCGTGCCCTAGCTAGACCCGGCCCCCGTTCCGGCT-3′) that introduced HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. The vanYn without any tag was produced using as oligonucleotide primers vanY86Fw (5′-ATGGATCCCAGACTGGAGGAGAGGGATG-3′) and vanY86Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCGATCCTGGAGTTCGTCTTC-3′) that introduced BamHI and HindIII restriction sites
[12]. The PCR products were purified, digested with HindIII and BamHI, and ligated with pIJ86 vector that had similarly been digested, to produce pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn and pIJ86ΩvanYn. These vectors with vanYn transcribed from the strong constitutive ermE* promoter
[14] were used to transform E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 cells. Intergeneric conjugation Intergeneric conjugation was performed according to a modified protocol from
[5,14]. In brief, a culture of the donor E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 containing the selected plasmid was grown in 10 mL LB supplemented with 50 μg/mL apramycin, 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 50 μg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to an OD600nm of 0.4. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with an equal volume of LB, and resuspended in 1 mL of LB. For each conjugation approximately 108Streptomyces spp. spores, collected from agar plates in sterile glycerol, were added to 500 μL 2X YT broth
[14], heat shocked at 50°C for 10 minutes and then allowed to cool. 500 μL of E. coli cells were added to 500 μL of heat-shocked spores and mixed briefly. Mixture was plated out on SFM or MYM agar added with 10 mM MgCl2 and incubated for 20 hours at 30°C. Plates were overlaid with 1 mL of water containing 500 μg/mL nalidixic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 50 μg/mL apramycin and were incubated at 30°C until colonies appear. Colony PCR and sequencing The presence of pIJ86ΩvanYn, pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn or pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn was checked by colony PCR and DNA sequencing of ex-conjugants. Single colonies were transferred onto DNA medium
[14]. Plates were incubated at 30°C overnight. Mycelium was scraped from the plates using a sterile toothpick and was introduced into 50 μL 100% v/v DMSO in a 1.5 mL tube. The tube was shaken vigorously for 1–2 hours and then centrifuged: 2.5 μL of the supernatant were used for PCR. For control, 1 μL of DNA samples were mixed with 1.5 μL DMSO. One initial step of 10 minutes at 95°C was included in the PCR program to ensure the complete cell lysis. The PCR was performed for 30 cycles as follows: 95°C for 45 seconds, 56°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 1 minute. vanY004Fw, vanY004Rev, vanY003Fw and vanY003Rev, vanY86Fw and vanY86Rev were used as oligonucleotide primers. VanYn expression Recombinant Streptomyces spp. were grown aerobically in 100 mL YEME and BTSB media added with apramycin (50 μg/mL) in 500 mL Erlenmayer flasks for different time intervals (up to 196 h) at 28°C and 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 39000 × g for 15 minutes and washed three times with water. The supernatant (named “extracellular fraction”) was collected and precipitated with the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method. TCA precipitation was performed adding 1/10 (v/v) of 100% TCA (w/v) to an appropriate medium volume and vortexed for 15 seconds, placed on ice for 15 minutes and then centrifugated at 14,000 × g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and discarded. The pellet was washed twice with 100 μL of pure acetone and then air dried for about 60 minutes. Washed cells were suspended in 10 mL of 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.4 M sucrose and 6.7 mg of lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). After 6 hours of incubation at 37°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 12800 × g for 10 minutes, obtaining spheroplasts clearly distinguishable at the optical microscopic observation (40X, Zeiss Primo Star microscope, Arese, Italy). The supernatant thus obtained was named “cell wall fraction”. The spheroplasts were washed with 0.4 M sucrose and then 5 mL of water was added to burst the spheroplasts. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 minutes. The supernatant and the precipitate were named as “cell-free soluble extract” and “cell-free insoluble fraction”, respectively. Scale up in 3-L reactor Flask cultures of recombinant Streptomyces spp. grown in YEME and apramycin (50 μg/mL) for 48–72 hours were used to inoculate - at 2.5% (v/v) - 3-L P-100 Applikon glass reactor (height 25 cm, diameter 13 cm) equipped with a AD1030 Biocontroller and AD1032 motor, containing 2 L YEME and apramycin (50 μg/mL). Cultivations in fermenter were carried out for 168 hours at 28°C, with stirring at 500 rpm (corresponding to 1.17 m/s of tip speed) and 2 L/min aeration rate. Dissolved oxygen (measured as % of the initial pO2 value) was monitored using an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode. The pH values of culture broths were monitored using a pH meter. Foam production was controlled by adding Antifoam SE-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) through an antifoam sensor. VanYn purification For protein purification, cultures of recombinant S. venezuelae grown in YEME medium were harvested and centrifuged at 39000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were sonicated in a buffer solution 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 10 μg/mL DNAseI (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 0.19 mg/mL PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 0.7 μg/mL pepstatine (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), for 15 cycles of 30 seconds each on ice. After a centrifugation at 39000 × g for 60 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected. N-His6-VanYn was purified by affinity chromatography onto a HiTrap chelating affinity column (1.6 × 2.5 cm, 5 mL, GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy) equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 30 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After extensive washing, the bound protein was eluted with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole
[17]. For C-His6-tagged VanYn, 6 M urea was added to the equilibration buffer as denaturant; in order to refold the protein bound to the column, a linear gradient from 6 to 0 M of urea (2 mL/min) was performed before starting the elution phase
[29]. Fractions containing pure recombinant VanYn were loaded on PD10 Sephadex G25 column (Ge Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy) equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (using 15% polyacrylamide gels and staining with Coomassie brilliant blue) and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was estimated using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm (45258 M-1 cm-1) determined by urea denaturation and the theoretical extinction coefficient based on amino acid sequence. Western blot analysis Following electrophoresis of proteins from bacterial cell fractions (corresponding to 100 μL of culture) or affinity-purified fractions and the transfer to a nitrocellulose sheet (GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy), the membrane was incubated with 1:1000 (v/v) His•Tag® Antibody HRP Conjugate Kit (Novagen, Milan, Italy) in alkalin-casein solution 1% (v/v). The immunorecognition was visualized by ECL Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy). The quantitative analysis was performed using the bioinformatics program Quantity One (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) and C-His6-VanYn from E. coli as standard protein.

Cells at different growth phases were harvested and suspended in 2 ml per gram of cells of physiological solution (0.9% (v/v) NaCl). The mycelium was fragmented by mild sonication and cells were collected by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 15 minutes. Alkaline extractions were carried out by suspending the cell suspension in ice-cold distilled water containing the proteinase inhibitors (0.19 mg/ml PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan Italy) and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatine (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan Italy) and then bringing the suspension to pH 12 by adding an appropriate volume of 2.5 N NaOH. After centrifugation (28,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), the supernatants were neutralized to pH 7 by the addition of 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4)
[30]. d,d-dipeptidase and d,d-carboxypeptidase assays Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the release of d-Ala from Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Ala by a d-amino acid oxidase/peroxidase coupled colorimetric assay (i) or by reaction with a fluorescent reagent (ii). All substrates were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. One unit of d,d-carboxypeptidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of d-Ala per min. (i) D-Amino acid oxidase/peroxidase assay
[17,18]. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mM of the substrate (Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, or acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala or d-Ala-d-Ala), 5 mM of the peroxidase colorimetric substrate 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP, from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 3 U/mL RgDAAO (d-amino acid oxidase from Rhodotorula gracilis[18]), 7.5 U/mL horseradish peroxidase (HRP from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 6 mM phenol in 50 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (pH 7.4) in a final volume of 1 mL. At 25°C, 40 μg of recombinant VanYn or the amount of cell wall alkaline extract correspondent to 50 mg of cells, or the soluble fraction or the supernatant, was added to the reaction mixture and the increase in absorbance (ΔAbs/min) at 510 nm was measured for the test sample as well as for the control to which no VanYn was added. A molar extinction coefficient for chinonemine of 6.58/mM cm was used. (ii) Fluorimetric o–phthaldialdehyde (OPTA) method
[20]. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mM Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, 40 μg of recombinant VanYn in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in a final volume of 200 μL. After 10 minutes at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 250 mM HCl followed by 750 μL of water. Enzymatically released d-Ala was detected by the addition of 100 μL of fluoraldehyde (OPTA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to 100 μL of the reaction mix, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. 800 μL of water was added and 200 μL was removed: the fluorescence intensity was measured (λex = 340 nm; λem = 455 nm) in a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan Infinite® 200 Pro, Milan, Italy). Assays were quantified from a standard curve prepared with known amounts of d-Ala. Circular dichroism measurements Far-UV CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-715 (Jasco Europe, Cremella, Italy) spectropolarimeter in the 195–250 nm wavelength range. Measurements were made in quartz cuvettes of 1 mm pathlength, employing protein solutions of 0.1 mg/mL, and were corrected for buffer contribution. Secondary structure fractions were calculated from deconvolution of the CD spectra using the program K2D2 (http://www.ogic.ca/projects/k2d2/)

Strain TTI-0885 was recovered from mixed pine-hardwood forest litter using the dilution-to-extinction method (Torres et al., 2011). For morphological analysis and photography, strains were grown on oatmeal-wheat germ agar, V8 juice agar, and double-strength malt-yeast extract agar. Strains are available from the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research Culture Collection (NRRL) as strains NRRL 66951 (TTI-0863) and NRRL 66952 (TTI-0885). General Experimental Procedures Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were collected on a Bruker 500 MHz NMR instrument equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe at 298 K, with CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard (δH/δC = 0). Semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separations and HPLC-MS (mass spectrometry) data were acquired on an Agilent 1260 system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) and coupled to an Agilent 6120 single quadrupole mass spectrometer, with a binary solvent system consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Growth Conditions To produce mycelial extracts for agar zone of inhibition (ZOI) assays, strains TTI-0863 and TTI-0885 were grown on five media in 12-mL fermentations. For the seed cultures, cryopreserved agar plugs were grown for 7 days in YM agar plates (malt extract 10 g, yeast extract 2 g, agar 20 g, 1000 mL deionized H2O). Six agar discs from each culture were inoculated into 50 mL of SMY (maltose 40 g, neopeptone 10 g, yeast extract 10 g, agar 3 g, 1000 mL deionized H2O) in a 250-mL baffled flask. Seed cultures were grown at 24°C, 220 rpm for 4 days. One mL aliquots of the seed cultures were transferred to 50-mL EPA glass vials containing 12 mL of the following media: Wheat 1 medium (5.0 g whole wheat seeds, 8.5 mL of base liquid consisting of yeast extract 2.0 g, sodium tartrate 10.0 g, KH2PO4 1.0 g, MgSO4.7H2O 1.0 g FeSO4.7H2O 0.050 g in 1000 mL deionized H2O); CYS80 (sucrose 80.0 g, yellow cornmeal 50.0 g, yeast extract 1.0 g in 1000 mL deionized H2O); MMK2 [mannitol 40.0 g, yeast extract 5.0 g, Murashige and Skoog Salts (Sigma-Aldrich M-5524) 4.3 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O]; MPP [maltose 25.0 g, glucose 10.0 g, dried baker’s yeast 5.0 g, Pharmamedia (Archer Daniels Midland) 10.0 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O], and MR (glucose 10.0 g, glycerol 10.0 g, sucrose 10.0 g, oat flour 5.0 g, soybean meal 20.0 g, primary yeast 10.0 g, CaCO3 1.0 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O). For TTI-0885, MPP medium was substituted for Supermalt (malt extract 50.0 g, yeast extract 10.0 g, FeSO4.7H2O 0.02 g, ZnSO4.7H2O 0.007 g, in 1000 mL deionized H2O), and MR for GGP media (10.0 glucose, 30.0 g glycerol, 5.0 Bacto peptone, 2.0 g NaCl in 1000 mL deionized H2O). Cultures in the Wheat 1 and CYS80 media were incubated statically with vials slanted at a 45° angle; the other media were agitated at 220 rpm. Fermentations were carried out at 24°C for 14 days, after which for each fermentation, 17 mL of 2-butanone was added and agitated at 220 rpm for 2 h. Eight mL of the organic phase was transferred to a glass vial and evaporated to dryness. The extracts were dissolved in 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to assay. For a scaled-up cultivation, 100 mL of SMY seed media in a 500 mL flask was grown for 4 days at 23°C and 180 rpm, then 2.5 mL was transferred to each of ten 250-mL baffled flask containing 50 mL of MMK2 media. Fermentations were carried out at 24°C for 10 days. Two-Plate Thermal Sensitivity and Zone of Inhibition Assays The assay for temperature-selective growth inhibition of C. neoformans was described previously (Xu et al., 2018). Overnight cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Sigma-Aldrich), and C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. neoformans H99 grown in YM broth (1% malt extract, 0.2% yeast extract in deionized H2O) at 37°C were diluted with ATCC 43300 sterile H2O to an OD600 of 0.4 for S. aureus and 0.8 for C. albicans and C. neoformans. One-mL aliquots of the resulting mixture were combined with 35-mL aliquots of YMA (or LB agar for S. aureus) at 45°C and dispensed into one-well plates (Nunc Omnitray). Test wells (4 mm diam) were aspirated from the solidified plates with a syringe tip, and 10 μL of each extract in DMSO was applied to each well. Sets of fungal fermentation extracts were tested at a density of 20 extracts/plate in paired plates. One plate of each pair was incubated at 25 and 37°C. ZOIs were photographed after 48 h."

All DHADs fused a 6×His-tag with a molecular weight ~62 kD were expressed at 16°C 220 rpm for 20 h after 100 μM IPTG induction (IPTG was added when OD600 = 0.8). Cells of 1 L culture were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4°C. Cell pellet was resuspended in 15 mL Buffer A10 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 8% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 16000 rpm at 4°C. The protein supernatant was then incubated with 3 mL Ni-NTA for 4 h with slow, constant rotation at 4°C. Subsequently the Ni-NTA resin was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A50 (Buffer A + 50 mM imidazole). For elution of the target protein, the Ni-NTA resin was incubated for 10 min with 6 mL Buffer A300 (Buffer A + 300 mM imidazole). The supernatant from the elution step was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE together with the supernatants from the other purification steps. The elution fraction containing the recombinant protein was buffer exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM GSH). In vitro activity assays were carried out in 50 μL reaction mixture containing storage buffer, 10 mM (±)-sodium α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate hydrate (4) and 0.5 μM of purified DHAD enzyme. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme. After 0.5 h incubation at 30°C, the reactions were stopped by adding equal volume of ethanol. Approximately 0.1 volume of 100 mM phenylhydrazine (PHH) was added to derivatize the product 3-methyl-2-oxo-butanoic acid (5) into 6 at room temperature for 30 min. 20 μL of the reaction mixture was subject to LC-MS analysis. The area of the HPLC peak with UV absorption at 350 nm were used to quantify the amount of 6. (Extended Data Fig. 2). The inhibition percentage of AA on DHADs determined using in vitro biochemical assays are calculated by following equation: 
inhibitionpercentage=1-initialreactionratewithAAinitialreactionratewithoutAA Growth inhibition assay of S. cerevisiae on plates or in the tubes S. cerevisiae was grown in isoleucine, leucine and valine (ILV) dropout media (20 g/L glucose, 0.67 g/L Difco™ Yeast Nitrogen Base w/o amino acids, 18 mg/L adenine, arginine 76 mg/L, asparagine 76 mg/L, aspartic acid 76 mg/L, glutamic acid 76 mg/L, histidine 76 mg/L, lysine 76 mg/L, methionine 76 mg/L, phenylalanine 76 mg/L, serine 76 mg/L, threonine 76 mg/L, tryptophan 76 mg/L, tyrosine 76 mg/L) to test growth inhibition of AA on S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae was incubated at 28°C until OD600 of the control strain without AA treatment reached about 0.8. The ratio of yeast OD600 in media with AA treatment to yeast OD600 in media without AA was calculated as the percentage of growth inhibition. The inhibition curve was plotted as percentage of inhibition versus AA concentrations. To further prove AA affects BCAA biosynthesis, isoleucine, leucine and valine was also complemented to the media with or without treatment of AA. The growth curves of TY05, TY06 and TY07 were also plotted in Extended Data Fig. 4. The OD600 was recorded for every 20 min over a total of 50 h. Percent inhibition. The growth inhibition percentage of AA on S. cerevisiae strain is calculated by dividing the cell density (OD600) of the AA-treated strain to the corresponding untreated strains when OD600 reaches ~ 0.8 using following equation: 
growthinhibitionpercentage=1-OD600ofAAtreatedstrain0.8 in which 0.8 is the OD600 of untreated strain. Growth inhibition assay of plants on plates or in the tubes MS (2.16 g/L Murashige and Skoog basal medium, 8 g/L sucrose, 8 g/L agar) media was used to test the growth inhibition of AA on A. thaliana, Solanum lycopersicum, and Zea mays. A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum, and Z. mays were grown under long day condition (16/8 h light/dark) using cool-white fluorescence bulbs as the light resource at 23°C. AA was dissolved in ethanol and added to the media before inoculating strains or growing plants. The media of control treatment contains the same amount of ethanol, but without AA. Plant growth inhibition assay by spraying AA was firstly dissolved in ethanol and then added to solvent (0.06 g/L Finale® Bayer Inc. + 20 g/L EtOH). The control plants were treated with solvent containing ethanol only. A. thaliana that are resistant to glufosinate (containing the bar gene) were grown under long day condition (16/8 h light/dark) using cool-white fluorescence bulbs as the light resource at 23°C. Spraying treatments began upon the seed germination, and was repeated once every two days with approximately 0.4 mL AA solution per time per pot. Structure determination of holo-pDHAD The gene encoding pDHAD (residues 35–608) was cloned into pET21a derivative vector pSJ2 with an eight histidine (8×His) tag and a TEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminus. The following primers were used for cloning: the forward primer DHAD-F and the reverse primer DHAD-R. The double mutant K559A/K560A for efficient crystallization was designed using the surface entropy reduction prediction (SERp) server34. Mutations were generated by PCR using the forward primer K559AK560A-F and reverse primer K559AK560A-R. All constructed plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. pDHAD purified under aerobic conditions was found to contain no iron-sulfur cluster (apo form). Hence we performed [2Fe-2S] Cluster reconstitution under the atmosphere of nitrogen in an anaerobic box. The protein was incubated with FeCl3 at the ratio of 1:10 for 1 h on ice and then 10 equivalents of Na2S per protein was added drop-wise every 30 min for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then incubated overnight. Excess FeCl3 and Na2S were removed using a SephadexTM G-25 Fine column (GE Healthcare)26. The reconstituted holo-pDHAD was crystallized in an anaerobic box. The proteins (at 10 mg/mL) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution in a 50 μL volume of 2 μL and equilibrated against the reservoir solution, using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 16°C. Crystals for diffraction were observed in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate after 5 d. All crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after cryo-protected with solution containing 25% glycerol, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0. The data were collected at 100K and at the Beam Line 19U1 in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Diffraction data of holo-pDHAD was collected at the wavelength of 0.97774 Å. The best crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.11 Å. The Ramachandran plot favored (%), allowed (%) and outlier (%) are 98.05, 1.60, and 0.36 respectively. All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL3000 package35. The crystals belonged to space group P42212. The statistics of the data collection are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The holo-pDHAD structure was solved by the molecular replacement method Phaser embedded in the CCP4i suite and the L-arabinonate dehydratase crystal structure (PDB_ID: 5J83) as the search model. All the side chains were removed during the molecular replacement process36,37. The resulting model were refined against the diffraction data using the REFMAC5 program of CCP4i38. Based on the improved electron density, the side chains of holo-pDHAD protein, iron sulfur cluster, water molecule, acetate ion, sulfate ions, and magnesium ion were manually built using the program WinCoot39. The Rwork and Rfree values of the structure are 17.67% and 22.15%, respectively. The detailed refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The geometry of the model was validated by WinCoot. Structural factor and coordinate of holo-pDHAD have been deposited in the Protein Bank (PDB code: 5ZE4). Homology modelling of AstD and docking of substrate or AA into active site of holo-pDHAD The structure of holo-pDHAD was prepared in Schrodinger suite software under OPLS3 force field40. Hydrogen atoms were added to reconstituted crystal structures according to the physiological pH (7.0) with the PROPKA tool in Protein Preparation tool in Maestro to optimize the hydrogen bond network26,41. Constrained energy minimizations were conducted on the full-atomic models, with heavy atom coverage to 0.5 Å. The homology model was performed in Modeller 9.1842, using the crystal structure of holo-pDHAD solved in this work as a template. Sequence alignment in Modeller indicated that AstD and pDHAD shared 56.8% sequence identity and 75.0% sequence similarity (Extended Data Fig. 6). All the highly conserved residues and motifs were properly aligned. A total of 2000 models were generated for each target in Modeller with the fully annealed protocol. The optimal models were chosen for docking studies according to DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score. All ligand structures were built in Schrodinger Maestro software26. The LigPrep module in Schrodinger software was introduced for geometric optimization by using OPLS3 force field40. The ionization state of ligands were calculated with Epik tool employing Hammett and Taft methods in conjunction with ionization and tautomerization tools43. The docking of a ligand to the receptor was performed using Glide44. We included cofactors observed in crystal structure during the docking. Since both water and SO42− occupied the catalytic site, they were excluded prior to docking. Cubic boxes centered on the ligand mass center with a radius 8 Å for all ligands defined the docking binding regions. Flexible ligand docking was executed for all structures. Ten poses per ligand out of 20,000 were included in the post-docking energy minimization. The best scored pose for the ligand was chosen as the initial structure for further study. The MM/GBSA method was introduced to evaluate the ligand binding affinity based on the best scored docking pose in Schrodinger software. Figures are prepared in PyMOL and Inkscape45,46. Both of native substrate α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate and AA were docked into the catalytic site of pDHAD. The cross-section electrostatic surface map shows this unique catalytic pocket has a positively charged internal and a hydrophobic entrance, which binds to negatively charged “head” and hydrophobic “tail” of substrate or AA respectively. Thus the negatively charged “head” can lead both of the substrate and AA into the catalytic chamber. The bulky hydrophobic tricyclic moiety of AA, however, provides stronger hydrophobic interactions to the entrance and blocks the entrance of active site due to the hydrophobic residues at the entrance, including G68, A71, I72, I134, A133, M141, V212, F215, M498 and P501. In contrast, the smaller “tail” of native substrate provides less interactions to entrance because the smaller size limits efficient hydrophobic contact to nearby residues. This implies that once AA binds to pDHAD, it can prevent substrate approaching the active site. We also introduced molecular mechanics generalized Born and surface area (MM/GBSA) continuum solvation method, an widely used approach for relative binding energy calculation, to evaluate the relative binding affinity for both ligands47. The MM/GBSA calculations had been done in Prime48 (Schrödinger 2015 suite). The MM/GBSA energy was calculated using following equation: 
ΔGbind=Ecomplex-Eprotein-Eligand E denotes energy and includes terms such as protein–ligand van der Waals contacts, electrostatic interactions, ligand desolvation, and internal strain (ligand and protein) energies, using VSGB2.0 implicit solvent model with the OPLS2005 force field. The solvent entropy is also included in the VSGB2.0 energy model, as it is for other Generalized Born (GB) and Poison–Boltzmann (PB) continuum solvent models. MM/GBSA calculation shows that the relative binding energy for AA and α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate is −18.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol and −13.3 ± 0.2 kcal/mol respectively, which shows the binding constant of AA to active site is about 6000 times greater than α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate. This further confirms that AA is a competitive inhibitor of pDHAD. Cytotoxicity assay of AA Cell proliferation experiments were performed in a 96-well format (five replicates per sample) using melanoma cell line A375 and SK-MEL-1. AA treatments were initiated 24 h postseeding for 72 h, and cell survival was quantified using CellTiter-GLO assay (Promega). Cross experiment of A. thaliana To make male sterile A. thaliana, AA was added to chemical hybridization agent (CHA) formulation (250 μM AA, 2% ethanol, 0.1% Tween-80, 1% corn oil in water), which has less inhibition effect on the growth of A. thaliana. Flowers of the AA treated col-0 were selected as the female parent. The non-treated A. thaliana containing a glufosinate resistant gene were used as male parent to donate pollen. 2-week old F1 progeny resulting from the cross were treated by Finale (11.3% glufosinate-ammonium) at 1:2000 dilution. The results are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 9. Construction of the transgenic plants The coding sequence of AstD was codon optimized for A. thaliana. A chloroplast localization signal (CLS) of 35-amino acid residues derived from the N-terminal of A. thaliana DHAD (MQATIFSPRATLFPCKPLLPSHNVNSRRPSIISCS) was fused to N-terminus of the codon optimized AstD. A 3×FLAG-tag was inserted between the CLS and the codon optimized AstD (Supplementary Table 6). The gene block containing CLS, FLAG-tag and astD was synthesized and then cloned into pEG202 vector using Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (ThermoFisher scientific). The original CaMV 35S promoter of pEG202 was substituted by Ubiquitin-10 promoter to drive the expression of AstD. The construct was electro-transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain Agl0 followed by A. thaliana transformation using the standard floral dip method49. The A. thaliana Col-0 ecotype was transformed. Positive transgenic plants were selected using the glufosinate resistance marker, and were tested for survival in presence of AA. Protein expression verification with western blot Approximately 0.5 gram of leaf tissue of transgenic A. thaliana was grounded in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were homogenized in 2× SDS buffer followed by 5-min centrifuge at 21,000 g to remove undissolved debris. The supernatant containing resolved proteins were loaded onto a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel, and separated using MOPS running buffer. Transfer was conducted using iBlot2 dry transfer device and PVDF membrane. The total proteins were stained with Ponceau to demonstrate equal loading. Western blotting was performed using Sigma monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-Peroxidase antibody, followed by detection using Amersham ECL Prime detection reagent.

11,PMC11069151,"Strains, plasmids, and growth conditions Streptomyces sp. CB03234-S [11] was used in this study. The strains and plasmids used or constructed in this study, as well as all designed primers, are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (Supplementary Material). CB03234-S and related mutants were grown on Gauze’s medium (G1) at 30 °C for sporulation. Tryptic soy broth (TSB) was used as the seed medium. Optimal production (OP) medium (15 g/L soluble starch, 15 g/L yeast extract, 2 g/L CaCO3, 0.1 g/L CuSO4•5H2O, 5 mg/L NaI, 1% w/w Diaion HP20 resins) was used for liquid fermentation. E. coil DH5α was used for cloning and S17-1 was used for intergeneric conjugation with CB03234-S. Mannitol soya flour solid medium was used for intergeneric conjugation. Antibiotics (40 mg/L nalidixic acid, 50 mg/L apramycin, 60 mg/L streptomycin, 25 mg/L thiostrepton, or 50 mg/L kanamycin) were added as required. All common biological and chemical reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources. Genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of CB03234-S CB03234-S was cultivated in TSB medium at 30 °C for 36 h. Mycelia were collected, washed with ddH2O, and sent to Biomarker Technologies Corporation (Beijing, China) for genome sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. High-quality clean reads were mapped onto the CB03234 reference genome (NCBI accession Number: NZ_LIYH00000000). The annotation of secondary metabolite BGCs in the sequenced genome of CB03234-S (Table S3) was performed using antiSMASH 5.0 software [28]. RNA sequencing data of CB03234 and CB03234-S from our previous study [29] were analyzed herein, and the raw sequencing reads were uploaded to the sequencing read archive (NCBI accession: PRJNA530700). Gene expression was normalized as fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The expression level of the internal housekeeping gene hrdB (encoding the principal sigma factor of RNA polymerase) was used as a reference to normalize the expression of target genes from different competitive BGCs, and heat maps were drawn using Log2 (target gene/hrdB) transformed data. Inactivation of competitive BGCs in CB03234-S Genetic manipulation of CB03234-S was carried out according to previously described procedures [30]. The core genes of seven competitive BGCs (Table S4) were deleted individually via homologous recombination. To construct a gene-knockout plasmid, regions approximately 2 kb upstream and downstream of the target gene, as well as the 810 bp thiostrepton resistance gene (tsr), were amplified using the high-fidelity Golden PCR Mix TSE101 (Tsingke Biotech. Co., Changsha, China). These DNA fragments were fused together and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pOJ260 using the Trelief SoSoo Cloning Kit (Tsingke). The resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing (Tsingke) and then introduced into CB03234-S via conjugation. The thiostrepton-resistant (TsrR) and apramycin-sensitive (AprS) exconjugants were verified using PCR amplification (Fig. S1) to obtain the BGC inactivation mutants, S1001‒S1007 (Table S1). The same procedure was used to construct the double inactivation plasmids, but tsr was replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene (kan). The resulting plasmids were introduced into S1004 (Δ8-BGC) to generate S1008 (Δ2/8-BGCs) and S1009 (Δ15/Δ8-BGCs), which were both AprS, KanR, and TsrR. The genotypes of the S1008 and S1009 mutants were confirmed using PCR verification (Fig. S1). Overexpression of target genes in CB03234-S and derivative mutants The core genes tnmE3/E4/E5/E/E10, post-modification genes tnmL/H, and putative self-resistance genes tnmB/T1/S3 were overexpressed in CB03234-S. Each target gene or gene combination was amplified and cloned into linearized pSET152 using HindIII/NdeI sites via seamless cloning. The constructed overexpression plasmids were respectively introduced into CB03234-S to generate mutants S1011‒S1018 (Table S1). The S1010 mutant carrying null pSET152 was also obtained as the negative control. Finally, tnmE10, tnmE, or tnmE/E10 were further introduced into S1009 to generate mutants S1019‒S1021 (Table S1). Evaluating TNM-A tolerance of selected strains To test the tolerance of each target strain to TNM-A, 1 mg/mL TNM-A stock solution was added to the medium to obtain G1 solid plates with different concentrations of TNM-A (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 mg/L). The spore suspension of each strain was adjusted to 1.0 × 108/mL, and then 100 µL spores were spread onto each G1 solid plates. After incubation at 30 °C for 3‒4 days, growth of each strain was observed and the number of single colonies was counted. Fermentation production and HPLC analysis of TNMs Briefly, 50 µL of spore suspension was inoculated into 50 mL TSB medium and cultivated at 220 rpm and 30 °C for 36 h. Then, 3 mL (6% v/v) of each suspension was transferred into 50 mL of OP medium and cultivated under the same conditions for seven days. The collected mycelia and resins were ultrasonically treated with a total of 50 mL methanol. The combined extracts were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis on a Waters E2695 HPLC system equipped with a PDA detector and a Welch Ultimate AQ-C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Welch Materials Inc., Shanghai, China). The mobile phase consisted of A (H2O) and B (CH3CN) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A gradient program (90% A for 1 min; 90% A to 5% A for 17 min; 5% A for 2 min; 5% A to 90% A for 3 min, followed by 90% A for 2 min) was applied to detect TNM-A and TNM-D at 540 nm. Scaled-up production of TNMs in a 30 L fermenter Scaled-up production of TNMs was performed in a T&J C-type 30 L fermenter (T&J Bioengineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Briefly, 50 µL spore suspension was inoculated into 50 ml TSB medium and cultured at 30 °C for 36 h. Subsequently, 5 mL primary seeds were inoculated into 500 mL TSB medium and cultured at 30 °C for an additional 24 h. Then 1.5 L of seeds was transferred into a 30-L fermenter containing 25 L of OP medium for the fermentation. The stirrer speed (100‒300 rpm), aeration rate (350 L/h), and air pressure (0.02‒0.04 MPa) were coordinated to maintain 40%∼60% dissolved oxygen (DO) in the fermentation broth. At the end of the exponential growth phase, the pH of the broth was adjusted to approximately 8.0 automatically by adding 50 g/L of acidic soluble starch solution (pH 1.0, adjusted using HCl). Samples were periodically collected and analyzed to monitor the yield of TNMs until the end of fermentation. Isolation, structural characterization, and cytotoxicity evaluation of TNM-W The resins were recovered from 25 L fermentation broth containing S1021 using a 60-mesh stainless sieve filter (diameter 0.125 mm) and then ultrasonically extracted with 1 L methanol four times (10 min each). The combined extracts were concentrated to obtain a brown-black crude extract, which was then resuspended in 500 mL pure H2O and extracted again with 500 mL ethyl acetate (EA) three times. The EA extracts were evaporated, redissolved in 5 mL methanol, and purified using a CombiFlash RF200 preparative chromatography system (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a Welch AQ-C18 flash column (20–40 μm, 80 g). Using a linear gradient from 10% methanol in H2O to 90% methanol in H2O at a flow rate of 10 mL/min, the fractions containing the target product TNM-W were combined and dried in vacuo. The resulting crude product was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography by eluting with methanol. The collected fractions were further purified using semipreparative HPLC to yield 4.7 mg of pure TNM-W. The structure of TNM-W was characterized by spectral analyses, including high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). To assess the cytotoxicity of TNM-W, the A549, KPL-4, Jurkat, and Caco-2 tumor cell lines were selected using TNM-A as a reference. Briefly, A549 and KPL-4 cells were cultured in DMEM, whereas Jurkat and Caco-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640. Each cell line was seeded in 96-well plates (4 × 103 cells per well), cultivated for 24 h, and then treated with different concentrations (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, or 50 nM) of TNM-W or TNM-A (100 µL media per well). After 72 h of incubation, cell viability was measured using a CCK-8 assay to determine the corresponding IC50 values. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Statistical analysis All fermentation experiments were performed at least in triplicate. At least three independent experiments were performed for each quantification. All data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Primer 5.0 and presented as mean ± SD. Significant difference analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. The significance level was set at P < 0.05 (*P < 0.05 was significant difference, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 were highly significant difference). Two-group comparisons were performed using Student’s t-test. All tests utilized the two-tailed methodology."

MM was supplemented with 10 mM uridine, 10 mM uracil, and 4 mM L-arginine when necessary. P. brevicompactum IBT 23078 was grown on Czapek yeast autolysate (CYA) agar at 25°C. CYA: 5.0 g/l Yeast extract (Difco); 15 g/l agar; 35 g/l Czapek Dox broth (Difco); 10 mg/l ZnSO4·7H2O; 5 mg/l CuSO4·5H2O. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.5 by using NaOH/HCl. Generating expression construct Amplification of DNA by PCR was performed using proof-reading PfuTurbo® Cx Hotstart polymerase (Stratagene) in 50 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixtures were heated to 95°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 3 min. A fragment containing the fungal selection marker argB was amplified from the expression vector pU1111 [18] with primers BGHA71 and BGHA72 and cloned into MfeI/SbfI digested expression vector pU0002 [18] resulting in construct pHC1. A 2689 bp fragment containing mpaF including mpaF promoter and terminator was amplified using primers BGHA125 and BGHA132 from P. brevicompactum IBT 23078 gDNA and cloned into the KpnI/AsiSI site of pHC1 resulting in pHC2. The flanking regions of imdA (AN10476, A. nidulans IMPDH) were amplified using primer pairs BGHA168/BGHA169 and BGHA170/BGHA171. pHC3 was created by USER cloning these fragments into pHC2 following the USER cloning method previously described [18,20].

A. nidulans strain construction Protoplasting and gene-targeting procedures were performed as described previously [21,22]. 5 μg pHC3 was digested with NotI to liberate the gene targeting substrate, which was used for transformation of NID3 [23]. Transformants containing the desired gene targeting event were verified by PCR with primer-pairs BGHA98/BGHA256HC and BGHA255HC/BGHA225 using Taq-polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) on genomic DNA obtained from streak purified transformants extracted using the FastDNA® SPIN for Soil Kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC). MPA treatment of fungi Spores from A. nidulans NID191 and A. nidulans NID495 were harvested. 10-fold dilution series was performed on freshly made MM-plates with 0, 5, 25, 100, 200 μg MPA/ml (Sigma). All plates contained 0.8% (v/v) methanol. Relative growth of the strains was assessed by visual inspection. Degenerate PCR An alignment with the DNA sequence (including introns) of the genes encoding P. brevicompactum IMPDH-B, A. nidulans IMPDH-A, P. chrysogenum IMPDH-A, P. chrysogenum IMPDH-B and Aspergillus fumigatus IMPDH-A was created by using ClustalW [24]. The ClustalW algorithm was accessed from the CLC DNA workbench 5 (CLC bio, http://www.clcbio.com/) with the following parameters: 'gap open cost = 20.0', 'gap extension cost = 1.0', and 'end gap cost = free'. The alignment was used to design degenerate primers to amplify either IMPDH-A like genes (BGHA236HC/BGHA246HC) or IMPDH-B like genes (BGHA240 HC/BGHA241 HC). The primer-set BGHA343/BGHA344 was used to amplify the β-tubulin sequence. Genomic DNA from P. brevicompactum IBT 23078 and four other fungi from Penicillium subgenus Penicillium were extracted using the FastDNA® SPIN for Soil Kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC). Touch-down PCR was carried out using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and the following program. An initial denaturation cycle at 98°C for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles at 98°C for 30 s, an annealing step ranging from 61°C (first cycle) to 54°C (last cycle) for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s. PCR mixture was made according to the manufacture's instructions. PCR products generated by degenerate PCR were purified from agarose gels using illustra™ DNA and Gel band purification kit (GE Healthcare). Sequencing of purified PCR products was performed by StarSeq (Germany). Cladistic analysis BLASTx search was performed with standard settings: 'blastp algorithm', 'expect threshold = 10', 'word size = 3', 'max matches in query range = 0', 'matrix = BLOSUM62', 'gap open cost = 11', 'gap extension cost = 1', and no filters were used. Alignment of DNA coding regions were performed with ClustalW [24] as implemented in the CLC DNA workbench 5 (CLC bio, http://www.clcbio.com/) and by using the following parameters: 'gap open cost = 20.0', 'gap extension cost = 1.0', and 'end gap cost = free'. A cladogram was constructed with the same software using the neighbour-joining method and 1000 bootstrap replicates [25]. The DNA sequence of IMPDH and β-tubulin from selected fungi with sequenced genome were retrieved from NCBI. These included IMPDH sequence from A. nidulans [GenBank:ANIA_10476], Aspergillus terreus [GenBank:XM_001218149], Aspergillus niger [GenBank:XM_001391855], P. chrysogenum putative IMPDH-A coding gene, [GenBank:XM_002562313], putative IMPDH-B coding gene [GenBank:XM_002559146], P. marneffei [GenBank:XM_002151867]. β-tubulin sequences from A. nidulans [GenBank:XM_653694], A. terreus [GenBank:XM_001215409], A. niger [GenBank:XM_001392399], P. chrysogenum [GenBank:XM_002559715] and P. marneffei [GenBank:XM_002151381]. The MPA gene cluster sequence from P. brevicompactum, which contains the IMPDH-B sequence (mpaF) is available from GenBank under accession number [GenBank:HQ731031]. Protein alignment Amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW [24] as implemented in the CLC DNA workbench 5 (CLC bio, http://www.clcbio.com/) by using the following parameters: 'gap open cost = 20.0', 'gap extension cost = 1.0', and 'end gap cost = free'. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers All sequences obtained via degenerate PCR were submitted to GenBank (Table 1).

(Integrated DNA Technology) and strains used in this study are summarized
in Supporting Information Tables S3 and S4, respectively. M. echinospora strain LL6000 and
calicheamicin γ1I were graciously provided
by Pfizer. Dynemicin and esperamicin A1 were generously
provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. All other reagents and chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated. All protein
structures were illustrated using PyMOL.58 Gene alignments and analyses were performed using Geneious Pro 5.0.3.59 Parental Plasmids for Protein Production For biochemical
characterization, genomic DNA was extracted from M. echinospora LL6000 using the InstaGene Matrix Kit (BioRad) following manufacturer’s
protocol. Primers CalU16-NdeI-F/CalU16-HindIII-R,
CalU17-NdeI-F/CalU17-HindIII-R, and CalU19-NdeI-F/CalU19-HindIII-R (Supporting Information Table
S3) were used to amplify each of calU16, calU17, and calU19, respectively. Amplification
was performed using the Advantage GC2 polymerase enzyme (Clontech)
and the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C
for 3 min; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65–62 °C
for 30 s, 68 °C for 35 s; final extension temperature at 68 °C
for 5 min. Each PCR product was gel purified using the QIAquick gel
extraction kit (Qiagen). Restriction digestion with NdeI/HindIII (New Englands Biolabs, NEB) followed by ligation using T4 DNA
ligase (NEB) into a linearized dephosphorylated pET28a (Novagen) yielded
pSECalU16, pSECalU17, and pSECalU19 for calU16, calU17, and calU19, respectively. Each
plasmid was transformed into NEB DH5α chemically competent cells
(NEB). Plasmids were purified using QIAprep Minispin kit (Qiagen).
Each plasmid was verified by sequencing and subsequently transformed
into the expression host BL21 (DE3) competent cells (NEB) to yield
pSECalU16-E. coli, pSECalU17-E. coli, and pSECalU19-E. coli, respectively. For structural
studies, plasmid preparation, overproduction, and purification were
conducted following standard protocols of the Northeast Structural
Genomics Consortium (NESG) to produce a uniformly 15N/13C-enriched and 5% biosynthetically directed 13C (NC5)-labeled protein samples for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine
(Se-Met) labeled samples for X-ray crystallography and details can
be found in Supporting Information Methods.60,61 In brief, calU16 was PCR
amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET15
expression vector (NESG Clone ID MiR12–15.1; PSI:Biology Materials
Repository clone ID MeCD000597015, see http://psimr.asu.edu/) to encode for the corresponding N-terminally tagged (MGHHHHHHSHM)
fusion protein. The plasmid was transformed into codon-enhanced E. coli BL21 (DE3) pMGK cells for protein production. Additional
plasmids and protocols employed for protein overproduction and purification
for biochemical studies are described in the Supporting
Information Methods. Structure Determination of CalU16 by X-ray
Crystallography Initial crystallization conditions for Se-Met
labeled CalU16 were
identified at the Hauptmann-Woodward Institute high-throughput screening
facility62 and further optimized manually
by microbatch methods at 18 °C. The protein was mixed in a 1:1
ratio with the precipitant containing 2.9 M sodium malonate pH 6.5.
The crystals were cryo-protected by 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and
2.6 M sodium malonate pH 6.5 prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen
for data collection at 100 K. A single crystal of Se-Met labeled protein
was used for data collection at a wavelength of 0.978 Å and diffracted
to 2.5 Å resolution. The data was collected at beamline X4A at
the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory,
and further processed and scaled using HKL-2000 (Table 1).63 Eight of the ten selenium
sites in the asymmetric unit were successfully located by the SHELXD64 program for initial phasing. RESOLVE65 was utilized for automated model building and
the model was further built by manual refitting with the program Coot.66 The data were twinned, and a twin refinement
was performed. The refinement involved iterations of manual model-building
in Coot and Refmac.67 The quality of the
final structure was validated by PROCHECK.68 The diffraction images illustrate diffuse scattering perpendicular
to the 61 screw axis indicative of order/disorder (Supporting Information Figure S24). The effects
of the disorder are also evident in the data anisotropy where the
B-factor component along the 61 axis is less than half
of the B-factor in the perpendicular direction. The unmodeled disorder
leads to higher than expected R-factors and is likely contributing
to the lower percentage of residues in the Ramachandran favored regions
(Table 1). The atomic coordinates and structure
factors have been deposited in the PDB (4FPW). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure
Determination of CalU16 NMR data were collected at 25 °C
on [U-13C, 15N]- and U-15N,
5% biosynthetically directed 13C (NC5)-labeled samples
in 300 μL buffered solution (0.9 mM CalU16, 0.02% NaN3, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM CaCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1× proteinase
inhibitors, 20 mM MES pH 6.5) in 5 mm Shigemi NMR tubes on a 600 MHz
Varian Inova spectrometer with a 5 mm HCN cold probe and a 850 MHz
Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer equipped with a conventional 5
mm HCN probe. A description of NMR experiments and methods for structure
determination and refinement can be found in Supporting
Information Methods. The protein was monomeric under the conditions
used in the NMR experiments based on analytical static light scattering
in-line with gel filtration chromatography and correlation time estimates
based on one-dimensional 15N T1 and T2 relaxation data (estimated τc 12.1 ns, Supporting Information Figure
S1). The assigned 1H–15N HSQC
spectrum is provided as Supporting Information
Figure S2. Chemical shifts, NOESY peak lists, and raw FIDS
were deposited in the BioMagResDB (BMRB accession number 18547). The
final ensemble of 20 models and NMR resonance assignments were deposited
to the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 2LUZ). Resistance Assays In vivo resistance
assays were performed using overnight cultures of the tested strain
diluted to OD600 ∼ 0.1 in molten LB agar supplemented
with final concentration of 30 μg mL–1 kanamycin
and 100 μM of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). The mixture was poured into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify.
A stock solution of 1 was prepared in methanol at a concentration
of 1 mg mL–1 and serial dilutions were prepared
such that the final concentrations tested ranged from 0.1 to 10 μg
μL–1. These were applied to sterile discs
such that the final quantities of 1 on the discs were
1 ng, 10 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, 1 μg, and 10 μg. The disks
were allowed to air-dry, and applied aseptically to the plates. All
plates were incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. Protein Cleavage Assay Final concentration of 1 μM
of each protein in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 in the presence of 1 mol equiv
of 1 with and without 0.2 mM DTT in a final volume of
500 μL was allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions
were lyophilized and resuspended in 25 μL of 50 mM Tris, pH
8.0. Cleavage was analyzed by mixing with equal volume of 2×
sample buffer. A volume of 30 μL was analyzed by NuPAGE 4–12%
Bis-Tris Gels (Life technologies) using protein ladder (Bio-Rad) as
size indicator. Trypsin Digestion and Mass Analysis A total of 4 μM
of each of CalU16 and CalU19 were added to 2 mol equiv of 1 in the presence of 0.2 mM DTT. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C
for 30 min. A fraction of each reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE
to confirm completion of the reaction. For proteolytic digestion,
the protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gel, washed with 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide
(IAA), and subjected to trypsin (for CalU16) or chymotrypsin (for
CalU19) digestion at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides resulting from
the proteolytic digestion were extracted from gel pieces and analyzed
by LC-MS/MS as previously described.69 Briefly,
the information-dependent acquisition of LC-MS/MS data were acquired
using an LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) coupled with a Nano-LC Ultra/cHiPLC-nanoflex HPLC system
(Eksigent, Dublin, CA) through a nano-electrospray ionization source.70 The results were subjected using ProteomeDiscoverer
1.3 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and MASCOT server.
The cleavage sites were deduced from nonenzymatic peptides ending
with an amine group (−NH2) from the Gly residue
attached to a nontrypsin or nonchymotrypsin digestion site. Determination
of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) Fourteen strains
created in this study (Supporting
Information Table S4, strains 2–15) were grown overnight
in LB supplemented with kanamycin 30 mg L–1. Each
overnight culture was diluted to OD600 ∼ 0.1 using
an Overnight Express Autoinduction System 1 (Novagen) supplemented
with kanamycin 30 mg L–1. Enediyne 1 was serially diluted 1:2 in DMSO such that the final concentrations
ranged from 2.4 μM to 4.5 nM for pSE28a-E. coli and from 12 μM to 22 nM for all other strains. Ampicillin
and kanamycin were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
All plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm. The residual
metabolic activity was monitored based on the irreversible reduction
of resazurin (7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one-10-oxide, blue) to resorufin
(7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, pink). For this assay, 10 μL
of resazurin (final concentration 100 μM) was added to each
well and allowed to incubate at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm
for 1 h to allow viable cells to convert resazurin to resorufin. The
well with the minimum concentration of 1 that did not
display bacterial growth but did display a red color after incubation
with resazurin was recorded as the MIC of that strain (Supporting Information Figure S9; Table 3)."

For antibiotic production analyses, strains were cultivated in 50 ml inoculum medium (R5) at 28°C in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (with steel springs) on an orbital shaker (180 rpm). After three days of cultivation, 5, 10 or 50 ml preculture was inoculated into 50, 100 or 200 ml of production medium (Supplementary Table S1), respectively. Cultures were grown for 4, 7 or 10 days at 28°C in 500 ml or 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks (with steel springs) on an orbital shaker (180 rpm). Bacillus subtilis bioassay Antibiotic activity was analyzed in agar plug diffusion assays using Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 as a test organism. Agar plugs of well-grown cultures of actinomycetes strains were placed on a B. subtilis test plate. In total, 5 μl of apramycin (50 μg/ml; Sigma) was applied as a positive control on filter discs. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and antibiotic activity was determined by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone around the agar plugs and filter discs, respectively. Target-specific bioreporter assay Impairment of protein synthesis, more specifically the occurrence of translation arrest, was determined using the bioreporter strain B. subtilis 1S34 PbmrC-lacZ and agar-plug reporter assays were carried out as reported previously (5). Briefly, actinomycetes strains were cultivated for 7–10 days at 28°C on the indicated agar plates. Then, grown agar plugs of the well-grown strains were transferred to an empty petri dish before embedding them in B. subtilis 1S34 PbmrC-lacZ-containing soft agar. The agar was supplemented 150 μg/ml X-Gal (Thermo Scientific), that gives blue colorization in plates after promoter induction. Extracts or purified compounds were directly spotted on solidified soft agar plates containing B. subtilis 1S34 PbmrC-lacZ. Antibiotic discs containing 10 μg of chloramphenicol (Oxoid) were used as a positive control. Agar plates were analyzed for promoter induction after overnight incubation at 37°C. PbmrC induction was indicated by a blue halo surrounding the zone of inhibition of the respective test sample. Genomic DNA isolation and sequencing Isolation of genomic DNA and genome sequencing of the strains Tü 2975, Tü 3180, Tü 6340 and KNN 49.3e was performed as described in Hennrich et al. (33) and for strains Tü 2108 and A 4/2 as described in Zecher et al. (34). Genome sequence-specific information is listed in Supplementary Table S2. Type Strain Genome Server (TYGS) The phylogenomic analysis of selected strains was carried out with the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) v. 1.0, a free bioinformatics tool for whole-genome-based taxonomic analysis (35). Phylogenetic classification using TYGS is based on a genome database that contains the genomic, taxonomic, and nomenclatural data of all currently available type strains. The database is constantly updated (https://tygs.dsmz.de/). The TYGS platform allows phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome sequence of the strain of interest, which is compared with a database of type strain genomes. Thereby, TYGS provides information on the similarity of the strain to its nearest related type strain with the help of digital DNA:DNA hybridization (dDDH) values calculated by the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) 2.1 (http://ggdc.dsmz.de) (36) and determines differences in genomic G + C contents. ARTS analysis The Antibiotic Resistance Target Seeker (ARTS) web tool v. 2.0 (21) was used to screen for potential self-resistance genes in genome sequences of natural compound producers. Genome sequences or accession numbers were submitted to the ARTS web-tool. The reference set was selected for Actinobacteria and the exploration mode was used. For all analyses, default settings were used. AntiSMASH analysis The antiSMASH web tool v. 6.0 (15) was used to analyze whole genome sequences for the presence of BGCs. Gene cluster similarity is displayed in % and indicates the number of genes similar to a known cluster. Genes are similar if a BLAST alignment yields an e-value <1 × 10–5 and if sequence identity is >30%. In addition, the shortest alignment must encompass >25% of the sequence. If all genes of a known cluster can be found in the query cluster, the sequence similarity is 100%. Similarity decreases if fewer genes of the known cluster can be found in the query cluster (37). Default settings were used for all analyses. In vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay The in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay was performed as reported previously (31). Briefly, an S12 extract was prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and mixed with nucleotides and amino acids as substrates for the transcription and translation process. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was added as an energy supply and pET28-egfp as reporter plasmid. In total, 85 μl of 2.5× ivTT buffer, 60 μl of the S12 extract, 20 μl of an amino acid mixture (2 mM each of all 20 proteinogenic amino acids), and 20 μl of an energy mixture (1.2 mM AMP, 0.85 mM each of CMP, GMP, and UMP, 0.5 mM IPTG, 34 mg/ml l-5-formyl-THF and 33 mM fructose-1,6- bisphosphate) served as the master mix for one sample of the ivTT assay (31). To test the actinomycetes culture extracts for translation inhibition, 30 μl of methanolic extracts were added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 30 min at 37°C to evaporate the methanolic solvent. The master mix and 10 μl of the reporter plasmid pET28-egfp (300 ng/μl) were added to each well to a final volume of 100 μl, thereby starting the reaction. All measurements were performed in triplicate using the same preparation of E. coli S12 extract. As positive controls, 5 μl of tetracycline (15 mg/ml; Sigma) or 5 μl of apramycin (50 mg/ml; Sigma) were used. The assay was incubated for approximately 2 h at 37°C. Fluorescence deriving from eGFP expression was measured at 485/520 nm excitation/emission with a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro device and analyzed with the i-control™ Microplate Reader Software 1.11 (Tecan). Compound extraction from actinomycetes cultures After cultivation of actinomycetes strains for 1–10 days in production medium, 5 or 50 ml of culture were extracted with 5, or 50 ml ethyl acetate, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. Ethyl acetate samples were evaporated in vacuo completely and then redissolved in 0.25 or 1.25 ml of methanol, respectively. Methanolic extracts were used for bioassays and high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) analysis, were stored at 4°C or frozen at −20°C for later analysis. As controls, pure media extracts were prepared at a ratio of 1:1 media/ethyl acetate. Semi-preparative purification by HPLC For compound isolation, semi-preparative HPLC was carried out with an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). A sample volume of 100 μl was injected at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min on a Luna C18 column (5 μm, 100 Å, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) and a linear gradient from 5% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 100% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 25 min at 25°C. 1.5 ml volume of each fraction was collected time based every minute. HPLC–MS analysis HPLC analyses were performed as described previously with a HP1090M system and ChemStation 3D software rev. A.08.03 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) on a Nucleosil C18 column (5 mm, 125 mm × 3 mm) fitted with a precolumn (20 × 3 mm) and with a flow rate of 850 μl/min (38). HPLC–MS was performed with an Agilent 1200 series chromatography system (binary pump, high performance autosampler, DAD-detector) coupled to a LC/MSD Ultra Trap System XCT 6330 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) (38). Samples were injected onto a Nucleosil 100 C18 column (3 μm, 100 × 2 mm) fitted with a precolumn (3 μm, 10 × 2 mm) at a flow rate of 400 μl/min and a linear gradient from 10% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 100% solvent B (0.06% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 15 min at 40°C. For the dereplication process, the UV-DAD spectra of the extracts/fractions were analyzed first for relevant signals. For this purpose, the peaks in the HPLC chromatogram were individually analyzed by comparing the chromatogram with an in-house HPLC–UV–Vis database (39). Peaks showing a coincident UV–Vis entry with a possible PSI substance were followed up. The masses of the possible PSI compounds were compared with the Dictionary of Natural Products as an external database (40). A substance was classified as ‘clearly identified’, if the match with the internal database and the external database confirmed the UV–Vis and MS criteria."
15,PMC3533786,"Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions All strains and plasmids used in this study are detailed in Table S1. All mutants constructed in S. marcescens Db10 were in-frame deletion mutants, generated by allelic exchange as described previously (Murdoch et al., 2011). Streptomycin-resistant derivatives were generated by phage ϕIF3-mediated transduction of the resistance allele from S. marcescens Db11 (Petty et al., 2006). Plasmids for constitutive expression of proteins in S. marcescens were derived from pSUPROM, plasmids for arabinose-inducible protein expression were derived from pBAD18-Kn, and derivatives of the pET15b-TEV plasmid were generated for protein overexpression and purification. S. marcescens was grown at 30°C in LB (10 g l−1 tryptone, 5 g l−1 yeast extract, 10 g l−1 NaCl, with 1.5 g l−1 agar for solid media) or minimal media (40 mM K2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.2% glucose) and E. coli was normally grown at 37°C in LB or M9 minimal media (M9). M9 (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) contained 0.5% glycerol (plus stated concentrations of arabinose and glucose as required). Growth analyses were performed in 96-well plates in a BioTek Synergy platereader. When required, media were supplemented with antibiotics: ampicillin (Ap) 100 μg ml−1, kanamycin (Kn) 100 μg ml−1, streptomycin (Sm) 100 μg ml−1, chloramphenicol (Cm) 25 μg ml−1; to maintain repression of proteins expressed from pBAD18-Kn, 0.5% glucose was added to the media for cloning and maintenance. Antibacterial competition/co-culture assays These were based on the assay described previously (Murdoch et al., 2011). In brief, the attacker strain and target strain (both at OD600 0.5) were mixed at an initial ratio of 1:1 attacker : target, co-cultured on solid LB for 7.5 h at 30°C and then the surviving target cells enumerated by serial dilution and viable counts on streptomycin-containing media. The target strain was always the streptomycin-resistant version of the mutant in question (Table S1). Statistical significance testing was performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post test (GraphPad Prism software). Bioinformatic identification of homologues of Rap and Ssp proteins and determination of their genetic contexts utilized the blast servers and sequence databases at the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Immunodetection of secreted proteins Anti-Hcp immunoblots were performed as described (Murdoch et al., 2011). For detection of Ssp1 and Ssp2, cellular and secreted fractions were prepared from 25 ml of culture grown for 7 h in LB. Secreted proteins were precipitated using 50:50 chloroform : methanol followed by methanol wash and resuspension in 2× gel sample buffer (Murdoch et al., 2011). Cellular samples were prepared by sonicating harvested cells in 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and isolating the soluble fraction by centrifugation. Anti-Ssp1 and anti-Ssp2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised to the purified proteins (Eurogentec, Belgium) and used at 1:1000; peroxidase-conjugated secondary (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at 1:10 000. Anti-RNAP β (Neoclone, USA) was used at 1:20 000, with anti-mouse secondary (Roche) at 1:10 000. In all cases, protein from the same number of cells was loaded in the secreted versus the cellular samples. Localization of Rap-HA proteins Fractionation was performed using a cold osmotic shock procedure. Following growth of cultures for 5 h in LB, Tris·HCl pH 7.8 was added to 5 ml of cells to a final concentration of 50 mM and the cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then recovered by centrifugation and washed once in LB. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 40% sucrose, 30 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. One hundred microlitres of this fraction (‘whole cell’) was removed for analysis. Remaining cells were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 900 μl of ice-cold water and incubated on ice for 10 min, resulting in the release of the periplasm. After centrifugation, 100 μl of the supernatant (‘periplasm’ fraction) was retained for analysis. The pellet, containing the ‘cytoplasm + membranes’ fraction, was resuspended in 900 μl of 50 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.8 and 100 μl retained for analysis. Equivalent amounts, on a per cell basis, of each fraction in each strain were assayed. Anti-RNAP β was used as above, anti-MBP (NEB) was used at 1:10 000 and anti-HA (Roche) was used at 1:6000, all with anti-mouse secondary as above. Microscopic analysis of colony and cell morphology Overnight cultures were normalized to OD600 0.5, diluted 10−2 (culture spots) or to obtain single colonies, 10 μl spotted onto solid media and grown for 24 or 48 h. Macroscopic morphology of culture spots and single colonies were recorded using a Zeiss MZ16FA Stereo Microscope with a Leica DFC350 FX camera and Leica AF6000 software. Microscopic analysis of single cells taken from spots grown on solid media as above was performed by Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy using an Axioskop 2 mot plus (Zeiss) with a SPOT RT KE camera and spot software (Diagnostic Instruments). Protein purification and in vitro analysis A full description of protein purification is provided in the Supporting information. In brief, proteins were overproduced in E. coli with a TEV protease-cleavable His6 tag and isolated by Ni2+ affinity purification. If required, the His6 tag was cleaved using TEV protease and the protein re-isolated by reverse Ni2+ chromatography. A final SEC step was then always performed. For SEC analysis of complex formation, His6-tagged proteins (10 nmol each) in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl were separated on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column, calibrated using molecular weight standards (GE Healthcare). Quantitative SYPRO Orange staining was performed as described (Rickman et al., 2004), with image analysis using ImageJ. Molar ratios were the mean of at least four quantifications. ITC was performed in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl at 30°C in a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter. The sample cell contained 6 μM Rap1a dimer or Rap2a dimer and the syringe contained 120 μM Ssp1 or Ssp2. Titrations consisted of 30 × 8 μl injections of Ssp into Rap (or into buffer alone as control). Data analysis was performed with the Origin software provided (MicroCal). For affinity isolation of Ssp1 and Ssp2, 10 μg of His6-tagged Rap protein was immobilized on magnetic Ni2+ beads (Qiagen), incubated for 1 h with culture supernatant (after 7 h growth in LB), beads washed and bound proteins eluted by the addition of gel sample buffer. Identified proteins were excised from the Coomassie- (Ssp2) or Silver- (Ssp1) stained gel and identified by mass spectrometry. Crystallographic analyses Well-ordered trigonal and orthorhombic crystals of Rap1b and Rap2b, respectively, were obtained. The asymmetric unit for Rap1b consisted of a single subunit, while Rap2b displayed two dimers in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were recorded in-house and experimental phases were derived by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction measurements (Micossi et al., 2002), exploiting the signal from endogenous S atoms and I− ions that had been added by soaking. The electron density maps were of high quality, and the models were completed, then refined to high resolution using standard methods (Dawson et al., 2008). Full crystallographic details are provided in the Supporting information and Table 1. Atomic co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes 4AX2 (Rap1b) and 4B6I (Rap2b)."
16,PMC9040887,"Reagents. DNA oligonucleotides (see Table S4 in the supplemental material) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Escherichia coli K-12 wild-type strain was purchased from the Keio E. coli knockout collection (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare). HED (Streptomyces griseoruber ATCC 23919) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute’s Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI DTP) Open Compound Repository (NSC 70929). Trioxacarcin A (TXNA) was isolated from Streptomyces bottropensis NRRL 12051 as described previously (56). AZB was prepared from organic extract of Streptomyces sahachiroi (ATCC 33158) as in reference 31. NM8 compound was synthesized and purified by the Vanderbilt Molecular Design and Synthesis Center (31). AlkA, AlkC, AlkD, AlkZ, LldU1/5, TxnU2/4, and YcaQ were purified as described previously (30, 31, 52, 56, 74, 75). Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and all enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB). Cellular strains, plasmids, and oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study. All oligonucleotides were dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to 200 μM, and the DNA was stored at −20°C (stored in the dark for the Cy5/FAM oligonucleotides). The underlined nucleotide in the 7mG_Top, HED_Top, TXNA_Top, AZB_Top/_Bottom, and NM8_Top/_Bottom oligonucleotides is the site of the N7-alkylguanine lesion. PCR was performed with a primer concentration of 500 nM. Download Table S4, XLSX file, 0.01 MB. Taxonomy and phylogeny of Streptomyces HTH_42 proteins. To identify HTH_42 proteins in Streptomyces, the protein sequences for YcaQ (GenBank accession number QHB65847.1) and AlkZ (GenBank accession number ABY83174.1) were used for tBLASTn and BLASTp searches (BLAST+ v2.11.0) against all Streptomyces genomes (taxid:1883). Searches were run with the BLOSUM62 matrix, 1,000 maximum target sequences, and 0.05 threshold using an e-value and identity cutoff of 10−4 and 25%, respectively. All hits were verified for the presence of the (H/Q)Φ(D/Q) catalytic motif, during which the (H/Q)Φ(S/T)(D/E) (AZL2) variant was identified. Truncated genes, poor-sequence-quality genes, and pseudogenes were eliminated. Additional sequences were obtained by searching the Pfam database v33.1 (76) for Streptomyces HTH_42 superfamily members (PF06224). Sequences from Pfam were sorted according to their domain classes (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material), and only sequences from class 1 with >75% coverage were included. Protein sequences were aligned using EMBL-EBI Clustal OmegaW or MAFFT v7 using default parameters (77, 78). The evolutionary history of YQL/AZL sequences was reconstructed using IQTREE2 with default settings (79), and the phylogenetic tree was assembled with the Interactive Tree of Life (v5) phylogeny display tool (80). Sequence logos were generated with WebLogo v2.8.2 (81). The copy number frequency and coincidence of YQL/AZL in the same genome was determined by manually counting the number and identity of homologs in each species. A list of all YQL/AZL/AZL2 proteins and Streptomyces genomes analyzed in this study can be found in Table S1. Identification of AZL proteins in known biosynthetic gene clusters. To find AZL proteins in verified and/or published BGCs, we searched MIBiG v2.0 for the AZB BGC (BGC0000960) from S. sahachiroi (27, 82), followed by an iterative search using the MIBiG Hits function until no more hits were obtained. The homologs TxnU2 and TxnU4 were identified from the initial BLAST search within the deposited NCBI trioxacarcin BGC sequence (83). The homolog within the aclacinomycin BGC was also identified in the initial BLAST search as appearing in proximity to aclacinomycin biosynthesis genes. Closer inspection of the published sequence for the aclacinomycin BGC (GenBank accession number AB008466.1) revealed an AZL protein (Orf1) located immediately 3′ of the cluster (84). A detailed list of the AZL proteins in known BGCs can be found in Table S3. Identification of AZL proteins in uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters. To determine the physical distance in base pairs between the genomic coordinates of AZL proteins and those of BGCs present in the genome assemblies of Streptomyces (average number of scaffolds, 96.30; minimum, 1; maximum, 1,956), we first predicted the BGCs in each genome using antiSMASH v5.1.0 (38) with the taxon parameter set to bacteria. Using the BGC sequences identified from antiSMASH and AZL sequences, a custom python script using Biopython (85) determined the shortest base pair distance between the physical location of the YQL/AZL gene and the location of the nearest BGC on the same scaffold (less than 2 Mbp away). To be considered within a BGC, the homolog had to be observed within 5 genes or 2 kb of the nearest cluster. Known Cluster BLAST was performed within antiSMASH to determine the BGC most similar to the unknown clusters, and the result with the highest percentage of similar genes was recorded as the most similar cluster. A detailed list of the genome information, cluster identifiers (IDs), and closest 3′ and/or 5′ BGC can be found in Table S2. Gene ontology analysis. To identify GO terms for nearest neighbors identified through BLAST, Pfam, and MIBiG searches, we randomly chose 40 homologs each of AZL inside BGCs, AZL outside BGCs, and YQL, which represent ∼10% of the sequences for each. Amino acid sequences for the five genes on both sides of the YQL/AZL genes were downloaded from the NCBI database, for a total of 400 neighbors for each of the three classes. Cellular functions of any already annotated genes in the NCBI database were identified and recorded. The downloaded sequences were then run through the GhostKOALA (v2.2) and eggNOG (v5.0) GO annotation databases (86, 87). After known GO terms for all gene neighbors were identified, proteins were categorized by biological processes and molecular functions, and the values for these terms were used to create the GO term distributions. Proteins that had multiple GO terms associated with them were counted into each class of terms. A list of all proteins and their annotated GO terms can be found in Tables S5 and S6. AZL nearest neighbor GO term analysis. Nearest 5 open reading frames (ORFs) upstream (−) (3′→5′) and downstream (+) (5′→3′) of AlkZ-like proteins predicted to be within (A) or outside (B) BGCs. ORFs are listed with their GenBank/RefSeq ID and biological pathway and molecular GO terms, as determined by NCBI, GhostKOALA, and eggNOG databases. Empty cells mean no GO terms could be assigned to these proteins through homology search. Download Table S5, XLSX file, 0.04 MB. YQL nearest neighbor GO term analysis.

Genes encoding Streptomyces caeruleatus AZL2, Streptomyces griseoruber HedH4, Thermomonospora curvata YQL, and Thermobifida fusca YQL were codon optimized and synthesized by GenScript and cloned into pBG102. The N-terminal His6-SUMO fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli Tuner(DE3) cells at 16°C for 18 h in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Clarified lysate was passed over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, and 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) and protein eluted in 250 mM imidazole-buffer A. Protein fractions were pooled and supplemented with 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) before incubation with 0.5 mg rhinovirus 3C protease (PreScission) at 4°C overnight. Cleaved protein was diluted 10-fold in buffer B (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA) and purified by heparin Sepharose using a 0 to 1 M NaCl-buffer B linear gradient. Fractions were pooled and passed over Ni-NTA agarose in buffer A, concentrated and filtered, and buffer exchanged into buffer C (20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 mM TCEP, and 0.1 mM EDTA). Protein was concentrated to 4 mg/mL, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Mutant protein expression vectors were generated using the Q5 mutagenesis kit (New England BioLabs), and proteins were overexpressed and purified the same as the wild type. DNA glycosylase activity. DNA substrates containing a single N7-methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine lesion and a 5′-Cy5 fluorophore were prepared as described previously (88). AZB- and NM8-ICL substrates were generated and purified as in reference 31. DNA substrates containing a single HED-guanosine or trioxacarcin A (TXNA)-guanosine adduct were prepared by annealing 5′-Cy5-labeled DNA containing the target sequence to the complementary unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide (Table S4). HED and TXNA were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 5 mM, and 100 μM DNA was incubated with 200 μM HED or TXNA in 10% methanol and 20% DMSO at 4°C on ice in the dark for 24 h. Unreacted drug was removed using an Illustra G-25 spin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the DNA was stored at −80°C. In each glycosylase reaction, 1 μM enzyme was incubated with 50 nM DNA in glycosylase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) at 25°C. At various time points, 4-μL aliquots were added to 1 μL of 1 M NaOH and heated at 70°C for 2 min. Samples were denatured at 70°C for 5 min in 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 80% (wt/vol) formamide, and 1 mg/mL blue dextran prior to electrophoresis on a 20% (wt/vol) acrylamide–8 M urea sequencing gel at 40 W for 1 h in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM borate, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were imaged on a Typhoon Trio variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare) using 633-nm excitation/670-nm emission fluorescence for Cy5, and bands were quantified with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). All excision assays were performed in triplicate. HPLC-MS analysis of HED and HED-guanine. HPLC was performed on an Agilent Series 1100 system equipped with an analytical SymmetryShield RP-C18 column (3.5 μm, 4.6 mm by 7.5 mm, 100-Å pore size) and using a linear gradient from 90% buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate)–10% buffer B (100% methanol) to 100% B over 40 min and a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. HED was diluted to 50 μM in 10% methanol and stored on ice prior to HPLC injection. To analyze the product of HedH4 activity, HED-DNA was diluted to 10 μM in glycosylase buffer and reacted with 50 μM HedH4 for 1 h at room temperature before injection. Mass spectrometry was performed with an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in positive ion mode from 300 to 1,000 m/z. Cellular assays for HED resistance. The hedH4 wild-type gene was subcloned from pBG102 into pSF-OXB1 using NcoI and XbaI restriction sites. The pSF-OXB1 vector contains a kanamycin resistance gene and allows for constitutive low-level expression from a modified AraBAD promoter. pSF-OXB1 and HedH4/pSF-OXB1 were transformed into E. coli K-12 cells. Cloning of hedH4 was confirmed by sequencing, restriction digest using NcoI-HF/XbaI (Fig. S4C), and colony PCR of K-12 transformants using the HedH4 NcoI and XbaI primers (Fig. S4D, Table S4). Cultures were grown at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/mL Kan. Growth curves were generated by diluting overnight cultures to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.01 in LB/Kan supplemented with 0 nM to 100 μM HED in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. The plate was incubated at 30°C with shaking for 24 h, and cell density was measured at 600 nm every 20 min using a Bio-Tek Synergy 2 microplate reader. IC50 values were determined from a fit to the equation lag time = minlag + (maxlag − minlag)/[1 + (IC50/[HED])h], where h is the Hill slope. Growth experiments were performed in triplicate. E. coli survival curves after HED treatment were performed using a colony dilution assay. A saturated overnight LB/Kan culture from a single colony was diluted to an OD600 of 0.01 in 1 mL fresh LB/Kan medium and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37°C. The cells were treated with various concentrations of HED for 1 h at 37°C. Treated cells were transferred to fresh LB/Kan medium and serially diluted by 10−6 in LB/Kan medium, and 100 μL of diluted cells was plated on LB/Kan agar plates and grown at 37°C overnight. Colonies were counted the next morning and the number of CFU/mL culture was determined. The percent survival was calculated as CFU/mL (treated) divided by CFU/mL (untreated). Curves were plotted on a logarithmic scale and IC50 values determined by nonlinear regression fits to the data. Growth experiments were performed in triplicate."
17,PMC9524394,"Sample collection and deoxyribonucleic acid extraction Microbial samples were collected in three replicates from rhizosphere of M. oleifera plant grown naturally in the North Western region of Mecca district of Saudi Arabia near the red sea coast (21°12′17.8″N 39°31′26.4″E) and from surrounding bulk soil (Al-Eisawi and Al-Ruzayza, 2015). The selected three plants for the experiment are single-grown, have similar size and received no rainfall for > 3 months prior sample collection, while bulk soil samples were concurrently taken ≥ 10 m apart from the plants. For soil rhizospheric samples, plant lateral roots were first cut at ∼10–30 cm depth. Then, soil of a maximum of 1 cm apart from the root, not the soil that physically adheres to the root, was collected and immediately put in liquid nitrogen, transported to the lab, and stored at −20°C until use (Hurt et al., 2001). Whole genome shotgun sequencing and bioinformatics analysis Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNAs) of different soil samples were extracted using CTAB/SDS method, and purity and integrity were checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA concentration was adjusted to 10 ng/μl using dsDNA Assay kit (Life Technologies, United States). Then, 1 μg of each DNA sample was shipped to Novogene Co. (Singapore) for whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. Physical fractionation of DNAs followed by data pre-processing were done and low quality bases (Q-value ≤ 38) exceeding 40-bp threshold were trimmed, and reads with N nucleotides over 10-bp threshold were removed. Then, effective clean data were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform after library preparation using an Ultra DNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEB, United States). Generated data were assembled to recover scaffolds using MEGAHIT (K-mer = 55) and chimeras were removed as described (Karlsson et al., 2012; Mende et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2014). Unassembled reads of different samples were mixed together to generate NOVO_MIX scaffolds exploring the less-abundant genes of the different samples. Generated scaffolds were cut off at “N” to get N-free fragments (or scaftigs) (Mende et al., 2012; Nielsen et al., 2014). Then, clean data were mapped to assembled scaftigs using Soap 2.21, and effective scaftigs (found in > 2 samples) were further utilized. Gene prediction was carried out by MetaGeneMark (Nielsen et al., 2014) and predicted genes were dereplicated using Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) (Li and Godzik, 2006; Fu et al., 2012). Then, non-redundant gene catalogs (nrGC) were constructed after removing redundancy using a greedy pairwise comparison (Li et al., 2014) and annotation was done using the binning reference-based classification method MEGAN (Huson et al., 2011, 2016). All unique open reading frames (ORFs) were subjected to Blastp against CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database)1 (e-value ≤ 1e–5) (Martínez et al., 2015) in order to identify and characterize ARGs. Then, relative abundance of different ARGs in unit ppm was estimated (Yang et al., 2013; Forsberg et al., 2014). ARGs were categorized to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) families (or metabolic processes) and resistance mechanisms were assigned as described (Liu and Pop, 2009). Based on abundance information of ARGs, heat map of abundance clustering for the top 30 highly abundant ARGs was drawn. Then, two circle charts were drawn to describe the overall proportion and distribution of the most redundant ARGs across the two soil types, on one hand, and the most redundant metabolic processes at the bacterial phylum level in ARO (antibiotic-resistant organisms) datasets, on the other hand. The first circle chart was divided into two parts of which the first refers to soil types (right side) and the second part refers to the most highly abundant ARGs (left side). The second chart was drawn to incorporate the most highly abundant bacterial phyla in terms of ARGs (right side) and the metabolic processes related to these highly abundant ARGs (left side). Stretches of different colors in the right side of inner circle refer to sum of relative abundance of all ARGs per sample in the first circus and sum of relative abundance of all metabolic processes per bacterial phylum in the second circus. While, color stretches in the left side refer to sum of relative abundance of all samples per ARG in the first circus and all bacterial phyla per metabolic process in the second circus. Colors in the right side of outer circle refer to detailed relative abundance of different ARGs per sample in the first circus and detailed relative abundance of different metabolic processes or AMR gene families per bacterial phylum in the second circus. While, colors in the left side refer to detailed relative abundance of different samples per ARG in the first circus and detailed relative abundance different bacterial phyla per metabolic process in the second circus. Validation of selected highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes via qPCR Total RNAs were isolated from samples gathered for each soil type using RNA PowerSoil® Total RNA isolation kit (Mo Bio, cat. no. 12866-25) following manufacturer instructions. DNA contamination was removed from RNA samples using RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and eventually checked by PCR. Then, primers of four highly abundant ARGs in plant rhizosphere in addition to those of 16S rRNA of Bacillus subtilis, used as a house-keeping gene, were designed using Netprimer software2 following standard criteria (Supplementary Table 1). Expression level of the different ARGs was detected by qPCR using Agilent Mx3000P System (Agilent technology, United States). Maxima™ SYBR Green/ROX qPCR was done as previously described (Bahieldin et al., 2015). Similar amounts of RNAs of the two samples were used and calculations were made to detect the expression level of ARGs relative to that of the housekeeping gene."
18,PMC7002339,"Strains and plasmids. Aspergillus oryzae strain M-2-3, an arginine auxotroph, was obtained from Colin Lazarus (University of Bristol, UK). Monascus ruber strain M7 was previously described (15). Plasmids pEYA and pTAYAGSarg3P were propagated in Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) as the host. Gateway destination vectors were propagated in E. coli
ccdB Survival 2 T1R cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant M. ruber and A. oryzae strains are listed in Table S1 (19). Primers used in plasmid construction are listed in Table S2 (19). Media and cultivation. E. coli was grown at 37°C in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. A. oryzae strains were routinely cultivated at 28°C in CMP (3.5% Czapek Dox broth, 2% maltose, 1% Polypepton) for 5 days with shaking at 200 rpm and were inoculated (1% [vol/vol]) from a preculture (a 100-ml overnight culture inoculated with 5 × 107 conidia/ml). M. ruber strains were cultured in PDB medium at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm, and the mycelia were harvested after 12 to 15 days of cultivation. For cocultivation, M. ruber strains were first grown as a monoculture in 100 ml PDB at 30°C for 3 to 4 days with shaking at 200 rpm, and then 5 to 10 ml of a freshly prepared culture of the challenger fungi or bacteria was added. The coculture was further incubated at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm for an additional 3 to 5 days. Challenger fungal cultures were prepared by culturing the appropriate strains in 100 ml PDB medium at 28°C for 2 to 4 days with shaking at 120 rpm. Mycelial pellets were dispersed by vortexing and resuspended in 100 ml fresh PDB. Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in LB medium at 37°C for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Qiagen) from mycelial samples that were prefrozen and ground to a fine powder. The resulting RNA samples were checked for purity (optical density ratio at 260 and 290 nm [OD260/280] of 1.8 to 2.2) and integrity (observation of two sharp bands for the ribosomal RNAs [rRNA] of the large and the small ribosomal subunits, with the intensity of the larger band approximately twice that of the smaller band). cDNA synthesis was performed in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing approximately 1 μg of total RNA, using the PrimeScript RT master mix (TaKaRa) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. qRT-PCR was performed using 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 5.0 μl SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (1×, TaKaRa), 0.4 μl of each primer (400 nM each), 0.4 μl ROX reference dye, and 1.0 μl of cDNA sample. A two-step thermal profile (step 1, 95°C for 10 s, and step 2, 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 25 s) was used on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed using the StepOne software (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems). The cycle number at which the fluorescence passed the cycle threshold (CT) was used for the quantitation of the expression level. Relative expression levels for each target cDNA were obtained by the 2−ΔΔCT method via normalization to β-actin (GenBank accession no. AJ417880), using the formula 2−(CT
target −
CT
actin). Controls with no added template were used to exclude the possibility that primer-dimer formation interfered with the calculations. Expression of biosynthetic genes in A. oryzae. The intron-free mrpigA polyketide synthase gene was amplified from M. ruber M7 cDNA as three overlapping fragments using primer pairs mrpigA-1-F/mrpigA-1-R, mrpigA-2-F/mrpigA-2-R, and mrpigA-3-F/mrpigA-3-R (Table S2 [19]). The resulting fragments were reassembled in the pEYA vector by homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741. The cloned mrpigA gene was then transferred to pTAYAGSarg3P by Gateway LR recombination (Invitrogen) to create pTAYAGSarg3P-mrpigA. In this vector, the mrpigA gene was under the control of the PamyB promoter and the TamyB terminator. Genes encoding tailoring enzymes were amplified from M. ruber M7 cDNA using primers (Table S2 [19]) that overlap the 3′ end of the appropriate promoter (Padh or Peno) or the 5′ end of the corresponding terminator (Tadh or Teno), respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pTAYAGSarg3P-mrpigA using the HiEff Clone One Step PCR cloning kit (Yeasen). After transformation of A. oryzae M-2-3 with the recombinant plasmids (Table S1 [19]), three to five independent isolates were evaluated for metabolite production for each recombinant strain. Protein extraction and purification. Genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes with an added N-terminal 6×His tag were cloned into the pTAYAGSarg3P vector and placed under the control of the PamyB promoter and the TamyB terminator. Plasmids were transformed into A. oryzae M-2-3 (Table S1 [19]). Recombinant A. oryzae strains were cultivated in CMP medium for 2 days with shaking at 200 rpm at 28°C and induced with 0.5% (wt/vol) maltose every day during continued growth for 3 days with shaking at 200 rpm at 28°C. Protein was purified as previous work reported with modifications (3). The mycelia were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by high-pressure homogenization with a French press in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Crude MrPigA protein extracts were filtered using a 0.22-μm cellulose nitrate membrane (Millipore) and then ultrafiltered (Millipore) to remove proteins with molecular weights less than 100 kDa. Crude protein extracts with MrPigC, MrPigH, or MrPigN were also clarified using a 0.22-μm cellulose nitrate membrane (Millipore), but the flowthrough fraction was collected during ultrafiltration (100 kDa cutoff; Millipore). The ultrafiltered protein extracts were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% to 90%) during overnight incubation at 4°C and then centrifuged, and the pellet was solubilized in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0). The resulting protein solution was clarified again by centrifugation, and the His-tagged enzymes were purified via Ni affinity chromatography (Thermo) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) with 50 mM NaCl and concentrated to greater than 1.0 mg/ml using a centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Protein deglycosylation. Five microliters of the purified protein sample (5 to 10 μg protein), 1.0 μl 10× glycoprotein denaturing buffer, and 4.0 μl water were mixed and then heated at 100°C for 10 min, followed by the addition of 2 μl 10× GlycoBuffer, 6.5 μl H2O, and 1.5 μl Endo H (NEB). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. In vitro enzymatic reactions. In general, substrates (1.5 mM each, final concentration) were dissolved in 150 μl HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0), and the reaction was started by adding 50 μl of the enzyme solution (10 μM, final concentration). Glycosylated enzymes were used for the reactions, as deglycosylated enzymes showed no improvements in their activities. After incubation at 30°C with shaking at 100 rpm for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl H2SO4 (1.0 M). Cosubstrates used for the MrPigA reaction were as follows (final concentrations): malonyl-CoA (10.0 mM), acetyl-CoA (3.0 mM), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM; 3.0 mM), NADPH (3.0 mM), and NADP (sodium salt, 3 mM). Reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN used cosubstrates as above. Reactions with MrPigC used NADPH (10 mM) as the cosubstrate. Enzymatic reactions with total protein extracts from M. ruber ΔmrpigC were performed as with MrPigC but with MrPigC replaced by the clarified lysate of the strain (50 μl). Reactions with MrPigH used NADPH (10 mM) as the cosubstrate and were conducted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. For anaerobic reactions, nitrogen was bubbled through the buffer solution for 1 h after degassing under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture was carefully flushed with nitrogen and stirred for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. For all reactions, the remaining substrate and the reaction product(s) were extracted with 200 μl of a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) three times, and the pooled organic phase was dried under a nitrogen stream, dissolved in 200 μl high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade methanol and analyzed by HPLC and NMR. Quantitative assays were repeated three times with three technical replicates each (n = 9). Qualitative assays were performed using three biological replicates. Extraction of metabolites. Mycelia of M. ruber strains were collected after cultivation for 12 to 14 days, while A. oryzae mycelia were harvested at day 5. Wet mycelia (100 g) were disrupted in a French press by high-pressure homogenization, acidified with 37% HCl to a pH less than 4.0, and extracted three times with 50 ml each of a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) by vigorous shaking for 1 h. The pooled organic fraction was dried on a rotary evaporator, and the crude extract was dissolved in 5 ml HPLC-grade methanol. Isolation of compounds. Compounds were isolated by HPLC on a Shimadzu autopurification system equipped with a supplementary L-10AP autosampler, an LC-6AD pump system, an SPD-M20A detector, and a Shim-pack C18 column (5.0 μm, 20 mm by 250 mm). The following gradient profile of solvents A and B was used at a column temperature of 30°C and at a flow rate of 20 ml/min: 0 to 5 min, 60% A; 5 to 25 min, 60% to 5% A; 25 to 30 min, 5% A; 30 to 35 min, 5% to 35% A; and 35 to 40 min, 50% A. The mobile phase solvent A was HPLC-grade water, and solvent B was HPLC-grade acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Detected peaks were collected in glass test tubes. The purified fractions were freeze-dried to completely remove the solvent. The purified compounds were subjected to HRMS/MS and NMR analyses. HPLC, HRMS, and NMR analyses. Analysis for metabolites was carried out using a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with an SPD-M20A photodiode array detector and a supplementary L-20A autosampler and managed by a LabSolutions LC Workstation (Shimadzu). The analytes were separated on an Inertsil ODS-3 C18 column (5.0 μm, 4.6 mm by 250 mm; Shimadzu) operating at 30°C, and compounds were detected at 280 nm. The mobile phase solvents A and B were water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.05% phosphoric acid. Gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min was performed as follows: 0 to 25 min, 85% to 30% A; 25 to 30 min, 30% to 5% A; 30 to 31 min, 5% to 85% A; 31 to 35 min, 85% A. High-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry were conducted on a Thermo Q Exactive Plus. 1H and 13C NMR was conducted on a Varian Mercury Plus 400 NMR spectrometer. The compounds 5, 7a, and 7b were characterized in our previous work (15). Antimicrobial susceptibility assays. The MICs of selected compounds against fungal and bacterial strains were determined using the broth microdilution method. Conidial suspensions of fungi were diluted to a final inoculum concentration of 1.0 × 105 to 5.0 × 105 spores/ml and dispensed into microdilution wells. Bacteria were grown on LB medium overnight at 37°C to an OD610 of 1.0 to 1.2 and inoculated (10%) into microdilution wells with fresh LB medium. The final concentrations of the test compounds were 0 to 256 μg/ml. For fungi, the inoculated microdilution trays were incubated at 30°C without shaking, and OD610 was measured on days 5 and 7. For bacteria, the inoculated microdilution trays were incubated at 37°C with shaking at 120 rpm, and OD610 was measured at 24 h. The MIC endpoint was defined as the lowest concentration that led to complete inhibition of growth. Test compounds were purified by semipreparative HPLC and analyzed by HPLC to show a purity of >95%. Assays were repeated three times with three technical replicates each (n = 9). Compound biotransformation with resting cells. A. oryzae M-2-3 was cultivated at 30°C in PDB medium with shaking at 200 rpm for 7 days. Compounds (each at 0.5 mg/liter) were added to mycelial pellets suspended in distilled water and incubated at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm. After incubation, the mycelia were processed by high-pressure homogenization on a GEA Panda2K NS1001L (GEA). The intracellular and extracellular test compounds were extracted by hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) and then analyzed by HPLC and LC-MS. Flux assays. M. ruber M7, ΔmrpigP, and CΔmrpigP strains were cultured at 30°C in 30 ml PDB medium in 250-ml flasks with shaking at 200 rpm for 7 days. The mycelia were dispersed by gentle vortexing with the help of glass beads for 5 min and incubated in PBS (50 mM, pH 5.5) containing the test compound (32 μg/ml, final concentration) at 30°C for 6 h with gentle mixing on a rotating table. The mycelia were washed with PBS (50 mM, pH 5.5) at least three times until the test compound was not detected in the eluent. The resulting mycelia were disrupted by high-pressure homogenization on a GEA Panda2K NS1001L (GEA). The intracellular test compounds were extracted every 2 h by hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) and then analyzed by HPLC. Assays were repeated three times with three technical replicates each (n = 9). Gene knockout in M. ruber M7. Targeted gene knockout and complementation of mrpigP in M. ruber M7 was performed as described in our previous work (15), and validation of the strains is shown in Fig. S7 (19). Data availability.

19,PMC5518548,"Fermentation, isolation, and identification of the thiotetronates For analysis of thiolactomycin and Tü 3010 production, strains were cultured in liquid production medium for 4 days. The fermentation broth was adjusted to pH 3, shaken vigorously with an equal volume of ethyl acetate for 2 hours (37 °C, 250 rpm), then clarified by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator, the crude extract was dissolved in 600 μl of methanol, and clarified by centrifugation (12 000 × g, 10 min). LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of Tü 3010 was performed on LTQ XL Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Thermo Instruments HPLC system, operated in positive ion mode with electrospray ionization. HPLC separation was achieved using a Phenomenex C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) equilibrated with 20 mM ammonium acetate (A) and methanol (B), and was developed with the following program: 0–2 min, 90% A; 2–4 min, 90% A – 40% A; 4–15 min, 40% A – 20% A; 15–16 min, 20% A – 10% A; 16–20 min, 10% A – 90% A. The flow rate was 1 mL min–1 and UV absorption was monitored at 238 nm and 303 nm. LC-ESI-MS analysis of thiolactomycin was performed on a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), operating in positive ion mode. It was coupled to a HP1100 HPLC system (Agilent), fitted with a Phenomenex Prodigy C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). Separation was achieved using a solvent system of acetonitrile and H2O (both containing 0.1% formic acid) with a linear gradient of 3–100% of acetonitrile over 42 min at a flow rate of 0.7 mL min–1. In vitro engineering of the core stu gene cluster The Type II Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) of Streptococcus pyogenes constitute a type of bacterial immune response, targeting cleavage of DNA perceived as foreign. RNA-guided Cas9 cleavage has been developed as the basis for highly precise and convenient genome engineering.59–61 In this work an in vitro CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing (ICE) procedure52 was used to specifically reduce the size of the DNA insert on 8G11 to the limits of the annotated stu cluster (stuE-stuF2). Cosmid 8G11 was first treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuF2O-1 and gRNA-stuF2O-2 to generate a linear DNA fragment of interest lacking the right unwanted arm (∼10 kbp) of the insert. After end-repair using T4 DNA polymerase, the resulting linear DNA was then cyclised. The cyclised recombinant was again treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuEO-1 and gRNA-stuEO-2, to create the linear DNA fragment now also lacking the left unwanted arm (∼5 kbp) of the insert. After end-repair, cyclisation generated pWHU2702, housing the annotated set of stu genes only. To study the role of the stuD1 and stuD2 cytochrome P450 genes in Tü 3010 biosynthesis, in-frame deletion recombinants for individual genes in the stu cluster were constructed using the ICE system described above. To construct pWHU2712 (ΔstuD1) for example, pWHU2702 was treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuD1-1 and gRNA-stuD1-2, and the resulting linear fragment was end-repaired and self-ligated to create pWHU2712. The same procedure was used with guide oligonucleotides gRNA-stuD2-1 and gRNA-stuD2-2 to generate a plasmid-borne stu cluster housing ΔstuD2. The in-frame deletion recombinant plasmids were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing of the editing joins. The recombinant plasmids were then each introduced into S. avermitilis MA-4680 by conjugation, and the resulting recombinant strains were analysed for the heterologous production of Tü 3010. Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis Whole genome sequencing for S. olivaceus Tü 3010 and Lentzea sp. ATCC 31319 was carried out by the DNA Sequencing Facility in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, and whole genome sequencing for S. thiolactonus NRRL 15439 and Streptomyces sp. MG11 was commercially performed by Shanghai Southgene Technology Co., Ltd. (SSGT). DNA was analysed and annotated using Artemis Release 13.0.28 The bioinformatics program antiSMASH was used in initial identification and analysis of genetic clusters.3,62 Functional analysis of each gene product was carried out using BlastP30 and multiple protein alignments were compiled by Clustal Omega.63 Predictions for PKS and NRPS domains were made using the University of Maryland PKS/NRPS Analysis Website.64 The structures of molecules were drawn and chemical compound masses calculated using ChemBioDraw Ultra version 14.0 (Perkin-Elmer Informatics).

Gene Deletion and Complementation The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. DNA manipulation was conducted by following the methods described previously (Zhao et al., 2016). Briefly, for gene in-frame deletions, fragments containing the upstream and downstream regions of the target genes were cloned into pJQ200SK (Quandt and Hynes, 1993) and transformed into E. coli DH5α for the construction of gene in-frame deletion constructs. The final constructs were transformed into the competent cells of OH13 wild type or its derivatives by electroporation. The gentamycin-resistant colonies were screened by PCR using primers to identify the single crossover mutants. Then, the single crossover mutants were grown on NAWS medium containing 8% sucrose, which would screen for deletion mutants through a second homologous recombination of the flanking regions. The mutants were verified by PCR using primers. For complementation, the open reading frames (ORFs) of the target genes with their own promoters were cloned into pBBR1-MCS5 (Kovach et al., 1995). The expression constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and introduced into wild type or corresponding mutants by electroporation. The complementation strains were screened on NAWS medium containing gentamycin and were validated by PCR. Preparation and Analysis of Myxin L. antibioticus OH13 was cultivated for 24 h in a 250 mL flask containing 50 mL NB medium. The seed culture was then transferred into 200 mL 1/10 TSB medium in a 1 liter flask (a total of 50 flasks). The flasks were placed in incubators for 24 h with shaking at 180 rpm at 28°C. Then, the cultures were extracted with equal volumes of ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to yield the crude extract. The crude extract was chromatographed over a Sephadex LH-20 column using 1:1 CH2Cl2-MeOH as the elution solvent. The fractions were further purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with CH3CN in H2O (Agilent-C18, 5 μm, 9.4 × 250 mm) under 283 nm with a 4.0 mL/min flow rate. To analyze myxin production in OH13 and its derivatives, equal volume of ethyl acetate was used to extract 1 mL supernatant of cultures grown in 1/10 TSB. The crude extract was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and fully evaporated. Then, the residues were dissolved with 200 μL methanol and prepared for HPLC analysis. To determine the production of intracellular myxin, 1 mL culture grown for 20 h in 1/10 TSB was harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. Supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 1/10 TSB for twice. The pellets were extracted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate overnight. Then the extract was dissolved in methanol and subjected to HPLC. The detection of phenazines was through HPLC (Agilent SB-C18, 250 × 4.6 mm) with a 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The mobile phase was 20–45% CH3CN in H2O from 0 to 5 min, 45 to 50% CH3CN in H2O from 5 to 19 min, 50 to 60% CH3CN in H2O from 19 to 20 min, 60 to 100% CH3CN in H2O from 20 to 23 min, 100% CH3CN from 23 to 27 min, 100 to 20% CH3CN in H2O from 27 to 28 min, and 20% CH3CN in H2O from 28 to 30 min. Susceptibility Test of L. antibioticus to Phenazines The susceptibility of the OH13 wild type and mutants to phenazines was determined by agar screening tests. Myxin was dissolved in DMSO, whereas PMS was dissolved in water. Liquid precultures of each strain to be tested were grown in NB medium to 1.0 of OD600. Five microliters of cultures were spotted on NA media containing the indicated concentrations of phenazines and incubated at 28°C. After 24 and 48 h of growth, the colonies were imaged using a Canon camera. For the inhibition assays of myxin against Lysobacter strains, bacterial suspensions with OD600 1.0 were 100-fold diluted and then spread on NA plates, and subsequently different concentrations of myxin were dropped on filter papers. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR Bacterial cells were cultured and harvested at an OD600 of approximately 1.0. RNA extraction was performed using the Omega bacterial RNA extraction kit (Omega biotek, Norcross, GA) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of RNA, A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios were determined by using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer plus. In qPCR analysis, a 250 ng RNA sample was used for genomic DNA elimination and cDNA synthesis by a Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix (with gDNA wiper) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Specific primers for qRT-PCR (Supplementary Table S1) were designed by Primer 3 online. The housekeeping gene 16S rDNA was used as a reference. The qPCR analysis was conducted on a Quantstudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems) using ChamQTM SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) with the following cycle profile: 1 cycle at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 34 s, and 1 cycle at 95°C for 30 s, 95°C 60 s, and 95°C for 15 s. The experiment was repeated three times, each time with triplicates. Data were analyzed using the 2–Δ

CT method. Construction of GFP Expressing Strains and Flow Cytometry Analysis Strains expressing GFP under the control of Plex were generated by homologous recombination. The fragment of gfp was integrated into the chromosome of L. antibioticus located in front of the lexA start site. We amplified regions ∼600 bp up and downstream of the gfp insertion locus using OH13 genomic DNA as a template, whereas gfp was amplified from a synthetic plasmid. The fragments were cloned into pJQ200SK using homologous recombination with a pEASY® -Uni Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen, China). The construct was transferred into the OH13 wild type and LaPhzB mutant strains through electroporation. After twice homologous recombination, the gfp fragment was integrated into the chromosome of L. antibioticus, subsequently obtaining the OH13 (Plex-GFP) and ΔLaPhzB (Plex-GFP) strains. For quantification of lex expression, strains were grown in 1/10 TSB medium for different time periods. The ΔLaPhzB (Plex-GFP) strain was also cultured in 1/10 TSB medium and supplied with different concentrations of myxin when the OD600 reached 0.6. GFP fluorescence was analyzed by detecting the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 10,000 cells with a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (BD FACSJazz). Construction of the Phylogenic Tree The amino acid sequence of LexB was applied to blast research in the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)1 and NCBI. 29 sequences from TCDB and 4 sequences of Lysobacter species from NCBI were downloaded. The amino acid sequences of the RND family proteins related to LexB were aligned, and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed with MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al., 2016)."
