["INTRODUCTION", "The increase in resistance to antimicrobials has become a serious challenge in the 21st Century, with rising antibiotic-resistant pathogens, particularly in hospital settings, and a paucity of new agents becoming available (Boucher et\u00a0al. 2009; Bush et\u00a0al. 2011). It is therefore essential that we continue our search for new antibacterial compounds, particularly novel natural products, which have the possibility of exploiting new chemical space. Actinomycetes, most notably the genus Streptomyces, have proved to be a rich source of bio-active molecules, with most antibiotics in current clinical use being actinomycete natural products or their derivatives (Clardy, Fischbach and Walsh 2006). In this review, we discuss the simocyclinones, natural products that were first isolated nearly 20 years ago from Streptomyces antibioticus T\u00fc 6040, which produces simocyclinones A1, B1, B2, C2, C4, D4, D6, D7 and D8 (Schimana et\u00a0al. 2000, 2001). More recently, Kitasatospora sp. and Streptomyces sp. NRRL B-24484 have been identified as producers of the novel simocyclinones D9, D10 and D11 (Bilyk et\u00a0al. 2016); representative simocyclinones are shown in Fig.\u00a01. As most work has been carried out on simocyclinone D8 (SD8), it will be the main topic of this review.", "Figure 1.Chemical structures of simocyclinones D8, D4 and C4.", "Chemical structures of simocyclinones D8, D4 and C4.", "The target of simocyclinones is the type II DNA topoisomerase, DNA gyrase (Fig.\u00a02). DNA topoisomerases (topos) are enzymes found in all organisms that catalyze the interconversions of different topological forms of DNA, e.g. relaxed\u2013supercoiled, knotted\u2013unknotted, catenated\u2013decatenated (Vos et\u00a0al. 2011; Bush, Evans-Roberts and Maxwell 2015) and are essential for DNA replication and transcription (Wang 2002). They are classified as type I or II depending upon whether their reactions proceed via single- or double-stranded breaks in DNA, and further divided into sub-types: IA, B, C and IIA and B, depending of mechanistic and evolutionary considerations (Wang 1996; Forterre et\u00a0al. 2007). DNA gyrase (the target of simocyclinones) is a type IIA topoisomerase, and the only enzyme that can catalyze the introduction of negative supercoils into DNA. It is essential in all bacteria but lacking from animals, including humans, making it an ideal target for antibiotics. The type II topoisomerase in humans, topo II, has been developed as an anti-cancer target (Pommier et\u00a0al. 2010) and can relax and decatenate DNA but cannot supercoil. Most bacteria, in addition to gyrase, have a second type II enzyme, topo IV, which is also a relaxing/decatenating enzyme, and is also a target for antibiotics.", "Figure 2.Schematic representation of the DNA gyrase A2B2 complex with bound G-segment DNA. Each subunit consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). For reference, the DNA gyrase structure shown in Fig.\u00a03 corresponds to a homodimer of a 55 kDa fragment of the GyrA NTD.", "Schematic representation of the DNA gyrase A2B2 complex with bound G-segment DNA. Each subunit consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). For reference, the DNA gyrase structure shown in Fig.\u00a03 corresponds to a homodimer of a 55 kDa fragment of the GyrA NTD.", "DNA gyrase consists of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB, which form an A2B2 complex in the active enzyme (Fig.\u00a02; Collin, Karkare and Maxwell 2011; Bush, Evans-Roberts and Maxwell 2015). The supercoiling reaction involves the wrapping of DNA around the A2B2 complex and the passage of one segment of DNA, termed the \u2018T\u2019 or \u2018transported\u2019 segment, through a double-stranded break in another, the \u2018G\u2019 or \u2018gate\u2019 segment. Catalytic supercoiling requires the hydrolysis of ATP. As this reaction proceeds via transient double-strand breaks in DNA, agents that can stabilize the broken DNA intermediate, such as the fluoroquinolones, are very effective antibacterial agents. A number of other compounds inhibit gyrase (and other topoisomerases) via this \u2018cleavage-complex stabilization\u2019 mechanism (Collin, Karkare and Maxwell 2011; Bush, Evans-Roberts and Maxwell 2015). In addition, gyrase and other type II topoisomerases can be inhibited by compounds that act at the ATP-binding site (Maxwell and Lawson 2003); this includes aminocoumarin antibiotics, such as novobiocin. As will be shown below, the inhibition of gyrase by simocyclinones occurs by a different, previously unknown, mechanism: they prevent the enzyme from binding DNA. It is possible that this mode of action can be exploited towards the development of novel, clinically relevant antibiotics. It is interesting to note that there are a number of peptide and protein inhibitors that exhibit the three mechanisms of gyrase inhibition (Collin, Karkare and Maxwell 2011). For example, microcin B17, CcdB and ParE can stabilize the cleavage complex, MfpA and Qnr proteins seem to prevent DNA binding, and FicT proteins modify GyrB and prevent ATPase activity (Harms et\u00a0al. 2015).", "Simocyclinones (D4 and D8) were discovered during the search for novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces strains derived from soil samples (Schimana et\u00a0al. 2000). These compounds showed antibiotic activity against certain Gram-positive bacteria and cytotoxic effects on tumor cell lines. By varying microbial growth and fermentation conditions the yield of these compounds was analyzed and optimized (Theobald, Schimana and Fiedler 2000; Schimana et\u00a0al. 2001). Using 2D NMR, the structures of SD4 and SD8 were determined (Holzenkampfer et\u00a0al. 2002) and shown to consist of an aminocoumarin moiety linked via a tetraene linker and olivose sugar to an angucyclinone polyketide moiety (Fig.\u00a01). The presence of an aminocoumarin group and the discovery that some of the biosynthetic genes were related to those of the \u2018classical\u2019 aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin (Galm et\u00a0al. 2002; Trefzer et\u00a0al. 2002; see below), suggested that these compounds were likely to target bacterial DNA gyrase and that this was the likely cause of their antibacterial activity.", "Simocyclinones have been studied most intensively as gyrase-inhibiting antibiotics, but the second section of this review covers the role of SD8 as an effector molecule controlling the activity of a transcription factor called SimR, responsible for linking the biosynthesis and export of SD8 in the producing organism, S. antibioticus. In addition, the SD8 precursor, 7-oxo-SD8, has been thoroughly characterized as a substrate for the enzyme SimC7, which reduces a carbonyl to a hydroxyl group at the C-7 position in the angucyclinone moiety of the molecule. This enzymatic step, which is critical because it converts an almost inactive precursor into the mature antibiotic, is covered in the third and final section of this review."]
