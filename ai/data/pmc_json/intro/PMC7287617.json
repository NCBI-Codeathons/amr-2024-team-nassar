["1. Introduction", "The foliar fungal microbiome of Douglas-fir evergreen trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) is a complex and diverse microbial ecosystem with underexplored chemical ecology [1,2]. Douglas-fir is an important commercial conifer species in forest plantations for timber and also most commonly used for Christmas trees in western North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand [3,4]. However, fungal pathogens, such as Nothophaeocryptopus gaeumannii, the causative agent of Swiss needle cast, have become a serious problem in Douglas-fir populations of western North America, where it has negatively affected the growth and production of this native conifer [2,4,5,6,7,8]. Plant-associated fungi often produce mycotoxins, or secrete effector proteins to suppress the immunity and defense mechanisms of their host [9,10,11], but the chemical interactions within fungal microbiome, ranging from mutualistic to pathogenic, are still elusive.", "Herein, we focused on the Douglas-fir associated fungus Zasmidium pseudotsugae and its specialized metabolism. Both Z. pseudotsugae and N. gaeumannii are member of the Dothideomycetes Capnodiales, Mycosphaerellaceae [12] and frequently occur together in close association on Douglas-fir foliage. However, Z. pseudotsugae is a relatively benign epiphyte unlike N. gaeumannii which causes a foliage disease. While many natural products are known from Ascomycota, relatively few natural products are known from the Mycosphaerellaceae [12,13,14,15]. The best known are dothistromin, an aflatoxin related compound from Dothistroma septosporum, and metabolites from Cercospora, including perylquinones, for example the light activated phytotoxin cercosporin, and the beticolins (also called cebetins), which are polyketide derived toxins [16]. Therefore, in our continued approach to discover new chemical entities from different environments [17,18], plant-fungi communities have been shown to be an excellent source for new natural products [19,20,21,22].", "Genome mining is now widely used for identification and connection of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) found in microorganisms and plants to their respective specialized metabolites [23,24,25]. Bioinformatic tools have become an important complementary asset for compound-, or activity-driven natural product discovery. Here, we include the bioinformatics-based prediction of the chemical potential of Zasmidium pseudotsugae and surprisingly, 36 biosynthetic gene clusters were present in its genome. In solid-phase cultivation of the fungus, only one metabolite was produced, named 8,8\u2032-bijuglone (1). The quinone was characterized by a combination of LC/MS and one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques and assessed for its antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activity. To our knowledge, this is the first bioactive metabolite isolated from Z. pseudotsugae."]
