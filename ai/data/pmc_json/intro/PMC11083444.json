["1. Introduction", "Plants have a fundamental role in the health and wellbeing of our lives. Importantly, they can also be utilized for their medicinal potential and are increasingly viewed as \u2018medicine\u2019, albeit of the \u2018alternative\u2019 variety. Humans have creatively employed plants as herbal medicine going back thousands of years. One of the oldest medical records, dated to 1500 B.C., is the Papyrus Ebers [1], which describes the usage of over 800 plants to treat a variety of ailments. Traditional Chinese medicine was first documented around 200 A.D. in The Divine Farmer\u2019s Materia Medica, which describes the benefits and drawbacks of 365 different plants [1]. Through trial and error, these communities established routine protocols for the treatment of a variety of disorders by employing plants. Today, many of these same plants continue to be employed as remedies. What is loosely termed \u2018Eastern medicine\u2019 focuses primarily on a holistic approach to an individual\u2019s illness while using natural medications. There are many potential positives to this approach. Foremost, when used appropriately, high-quality natural remedies generally produce limited side effects and are widely available at a relatively low cost [2]. Western medicine focuses more heavily on the scientific method and increasingly employs designer drugs binding with nanomolar affinity to validated, molecular targets [3]. Drugs are created with the intent of treating pathology and/or symptoms. They work by targeting specific cellular processes that contribute to an individual\u2019s pathology. Subsequent modifications focus on increasing bioavailability and reducing off-target effects. The process of synthesizing drugs is the foundation of Western medicine.", "However, the basis of modern Western medicine can trace its origins to phytochemicals. For instance, the natural opioids\u2014morphine, codeine, and heroin\u2014all share the same \u2018parent plant\u2019 but have undergone different manipulations. They come from the plant Papaver somniferum, also known as opium poppy. The plant\u2019s usage can be dated back to the Sumerian population, who referred to it as the \u2018joy plant\u2019. People later began using opium for pain management, sedation, and disease treatment. It was centuries later that scientists realized the plant\u2019s addictive qualities and toxicity. In the 1800s, scientists extracted morphine from the opium poppy and then further modified morphine into both heroin and codeine [4]. Both morphine and codeine are still used as anesthetics and for pain management. Another well-known use of phytochemicals in Western medicine is the derivation of penicillin from the fungus Penicillium notatum by Alexander Fleming in 1929. Of salience to this paper, phytochemicals further gained popular and commercial appeal in Western medicine for their initial use as chemotherapeutics. For example, the breast cancer drug paclitaxel was derived from the bark of Taxus brevifolia in 1962 [5]. Paclitaxel functions as a microtubule inhibitor, thereby disrupting cancer cell mitosis. The Vinca alkaloids, vincristine and vinblastine, furthered the use of phytochemicals in chemotherapy by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation in a similar mechanism to paclitaxel [6,7].", "Although both approaches to medicine have their individual benefits, they also have their own drawbacks. Western medicine, although evidence-based, can use data from under-powered clinical trials and has a pharmaceutical bias. In addition, many therapeutics can cause side effects that are poorly tolerated [3]. The natural remedies of Eastern, or traditional, medicine can exert health benefits; however, if they are combined inappropriately, used in excess of safe dosages, adulterated with toxic compounds or used for conditions or individuals for which indications are lacking, they can lead to patient harm [3]. Due to the drawbacks in both approaches, it can be difficult to reconcile the two approaches or, for people who practice one of the approaches, to understand and agree with the other approach. Nonetheless, there is the opportunity to combine the approaches by utilizing naturally occurring compounds from nature to enhance the effects of medications, thereby improving the treatment of a variety of diseases, specifically cancer.", "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Although current conventional treatments are generally effective in controlling certain cancer subtypes, they can also have significant drawbacks. For instance, chemotherapy is associated with lasting debilitating side effects, such as neuropathy, hair loss, loss of appetite, fatigue, pain, and immunosuppression [8]. Another major issue with these treatments is financial toxicity [9]. There may be opportunities for the addition of natural medications to aid in the treatment of cancers. Specifically, there are compounds, or phytochemicals, found in food, herbs, and plants that exert a variety of benefits. Several phytochemicals can aid in nausea and vomiting, neuropathic pain from chemotherapy, anxiety, and dyssomnias. There is also evidence that they may help enhance the efficacy of treatments and function as cancer prophylactics [10,11,12,13,14]. Using phytochemicals to treat patients most similarly resembles practices in Eastern medicine. However, combining Western and Eastern approaches could result in more positive prognoses and make undergoing conventional treatment more bearable for patients. This review reports on the potential for a variety of phytochemicals to increase patients\u2019 quality of life during and after treatment, as well as augment conventional treatment effects."]
