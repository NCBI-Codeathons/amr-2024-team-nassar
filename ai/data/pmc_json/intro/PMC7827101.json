["1. Introduction", "Bacteria, fungi, and plants produce an enormous variety of natural products (NPs), secondary metabolites with a fantastic array of molecular structures and biological and pharmaceutical properties. Natural products are a rich source for drugs\u2014including anticancer, antibiotic, and antifungal therapies\u2014as well as biofuels, cosmetics, perfumes, and flavors, to cite but a few applications [1,2,3].", "Most classes of natural products (Figure 1), including terpenoids [1], alkaloids [4], glycosides [5,6], and polyketides [7], as well as non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) [8], are synthesized by complex enzymatic pathways. The exceptions to this rule are the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), which are encoded directly by the genome and synthesized via the classical transcription/translation machinery [9]. The genes coding for these pathways are mainly organized in co-regulated (and generally transcriptionally repressed) biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [10,11], which also encode the necessary transcription factors, transporters [12,13], and proteins that protect against the toxic effects of natural products in their \u201chosts\u201d [14].", "Our knowledge of the genomic organization, biology, and chemistry of natural product biosynthetic pathways is rapidly increasing, thanks to advances in experimental and computational approaches and to the development of open-access databases and tools. These include reference resources of natural product structures such as The Natural Products Atlas [15] and the COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (COCONUT) [16,17], as well as tools to catalog, identify, and annotate BGCs in microbial and plant genomes such as the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) [18], ClusterMine360, a database of microbial polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide gene clusters [19], MIBiG [13], which provides a minimum information specification for BGCs, and antiSMASH (antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell) [20] and plantiSMASH [21], which exploit knowledge of the domain composition of key enzymes in BGCs to predict the natural products associated with each BGC.", "All genome data mining approaches to natural product discovery ultimately depend on the correct annotation of experimentally characterized enzymes, which provides the crucial link from genome sequence to chemical structure. The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB, www.uniprot.org) is one source of such knowledge\u2014a reference resource of protein sequences and functional annotation that is widely used for functional analyses of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data [22]. We have recently extended the scope of UniProtKB to cover small molecule metabolite and metabolomic data, including but not limited to natural products. We have performed a complete reannotation of all enzyme data in UniProtKB [23] using Rhea (www.rhea-db.org) [24], a freely available resource of expert-curated biochemical and transport reactions described using the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontology of small molecules (www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi) [25], and have begun a new program of annotation of natural products that focuses on enzymes in well-characterized pathways and the reactions they catalyze. We have also developed a range of tools and services that allow users of UniProtKB to map small molecule metabolites to proteins, facilitating the integration of metabolomics and proteomics. In the following section, we describe the annotation of enzymes and natural products in UniProtKB and provide examples of how to query UniProtKB for this knowledge using interactive and programmatic means."]
