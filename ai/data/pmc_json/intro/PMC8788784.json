["Introduction", "Natural products continue to be important sources for the discovery and development of antibiotics, immune modulators, and antitumor agents for human medicine, and other products for use in animal health and plant crop protection (Baltz, 2019; Demain, 2014; Katz & Baltz, 2016; Newman & Cragg, 2020). The concept of microbial genome mining to revitalize drug discovery emerged in the early 2000s from the observations that newly sequenced actinomycete genomes encode many more secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) than predicted from known secondary metabolomes (Baltz, 2008; Bentley et al., 2002; Ikeda et al., 2003; Ohnishi et al., 2008; Oliynyk et al., 2007). In recent years, the discovery of new and novel natural products has been accelerating by advancements in the microbial genome mining processes (Bachmann et al., 2014; Baltz, 2017a, 2017c, 2019; Foulston, 2019; Kalkreuter et al., 2020; Mitousis et al., 2020; Musiol-Kroll et al., 2019). Genome mining also provides an ever-expanding set of genetic parts and devices for synthetic biology approaches to facilitate combinatorial biosynthesis of novel variants of biologically active secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics (Baltz, 2018, 2019, 2021; Katz et al., 2018; Whitford et al., 2021; Yuzawa et al., 2018). In this perspective, I focus on a few key advancements and opportunities at the front end of the genome mining discovery process and limit my discussions to bacteria, primarily actinomycetes. I also discuss three examples of applying evolutionary relationships within families of BGCs encoded by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS-I) mechanisms to facilitate genome mining of structural variants of pharmacologically privileged chemical scaffolds."]
