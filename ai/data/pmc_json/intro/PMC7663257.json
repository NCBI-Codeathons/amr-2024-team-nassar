["1. Introduction", "During the immune response, the proper regulation of T cells is pivotal for maintaining immunological homeostasis, because T cells link humoral immunity to adaptive immunity [1]. Therefore, several events related to T cell activation, including antigenic priming by antigen-presenting cells, activation, and differentiation into effector T cells, should be accurately controlled. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that excessive T cell activity causes a severe immune imbalance or an autoimmune response [2,3]. To control the immunological diseases induced by excessive T cell activation, immunosuppressive reagents have been used. Such agents are categorized into two groups: Inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokine production from activated T cells or apoptosis promoters for hazardous T cells.", "T cell proliferation is crucial for elevating the adaptive immune response, which is induced by T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation by co-stimulatory molecules [4,5]. T cell proliferation is initiated by entry into the cell cycle, which is strictly controlled by sequential changes in cyclin expression [6]. During the G1 phase, cyclin D is expressed as the first cyclin protein, while cyclin A is expressed at the entry to the S phase [7]. Previously, it has been found that IL-2, a marker of early T cell activation, acts as the most potent growth factor for T cells [8]. Reduced T cell growth rates have been observed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-2, and T cells that are stimulated by antigenic engagement or mitogen activation have also shown proliferation upon treatment with IL-2 [9,10]. Several immunosuppressive reagents inhibit T cell proliferation in the presence of TCR-mediated stimulation or lead to cell cycle arrest [11,12]. Although various such reagents have been commercially developed, little is known about whether small molecules derived from natural products regulate T cell activation through proliferation pathways or cell cycle arrest.", "Salinosporamide A, derived from marine bacteria, such as Salinospora tropica and Salinospora arenicola, is a potent proteasome inhibitor that was first discovered and structurally elucidated in 2003 [13] (Figure 1). Salinosporamide A has been shown to promote the apoptotic pathway in cancer cells at 35 nM (11 ng/mL) by covalently altering the active site (threonine) of the \u03b2\u2013subunit of the 20S proteasome [14]. Although various proteasome inhibitors have been found to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, whether salinosporamide A has a regulatory effect on T cell activation has not yet been reported [15,16]. In the present study, we first found that treatment of T cells with salinosporamide A efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and promoted cell cycle arrest, in a dose-dependent manner. These inhibitory mechanisms result in the inhibition of T cell activity and the MAPK signaling pathway, following stimulation by anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies."]
