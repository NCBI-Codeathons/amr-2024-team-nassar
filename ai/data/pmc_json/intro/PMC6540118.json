["Introduction", "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common head and neck cancers, accounting for 90% of the total number of malignant oral tumors (1). The 5-year survival rate for OSCC patients is ~60\u201380%, and if not diagnosed, the survival rate will be reduced to 50% (2). Cisplatin compounds are widely used in the clinical treatment of OSCC and have a variety of advantages, including reducing distant metastasis rate, improving patient survival and maintaining organ function. The main mechanism is exerting its cytotoxic effect through the formation of intrachain DNA cross-linking in tumor cells (3,4). Most OSCC patients are less sensitive to cisplatin compounds, which is the main reason for the low survival rate of OSCC patients (5). Therefore, to clarify the molecular mechanism of chemotherapy drug resistance in OSCC patients is of great significance for improving the survival and prognosis of patients with OSCC.", "miRNAs (microRNAs) are a group of single stranded non-coding RNAs (6) that are 20 to 24 nt in length and exist in eukaryotes. By binding to specific genes, miRNAs can regulate the expression of multiple genes, and thus play an important role in physiological activities such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (7,8). Studies have shown that targeted inhibition of miR-27b can increase the sensitivity to doxorubicin of human thyroid cancer, and its mechanism may be related to the activation of PPAR (9). In addition, studies have shown that miR-27b expression levels are significantly reduced in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, possibly related to methylation of the miR-27b promoter region, whereas overexpression of miR-27b can enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen chemotherapeutic drugs through targeted inhibition of HMGB3 expression (10).", "However, the effect of miR-27b on OSCC cisplatin-resistant cells has not been reported yet. In this study, we detected the expression level of miR-27b in cancer tissues of cisplatin-resistant patients and cisplatin-sensitive patients, and further induced Tc8113/CDDP cells to construct the cisplatin-resistant cell line by using gradient concentration of cisplatin to detect the effect of miR-27b high expression on drug-resistant cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion and migration, and explored the molecular mechanism of miR-27b affecting OSCC cell resistance."]
