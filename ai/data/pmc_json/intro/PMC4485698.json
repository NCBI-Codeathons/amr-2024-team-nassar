["Introduction", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with uncertain etiology, characterized by social deficits, communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviors, and in some cases, cognitive delays.1", "ASD shows a striking sex bias, with a male:female ratio estimated at 3\u20134:1, and it usually appears by 3 years of age. Some authors have stated that ASD children often have relatively normal development during the first 12\u201324 months of life; then, after a period of regression, the full syndrome becomes evident.2", "The prevalence of ASD varies among countries and it has increased dramatically in the last decades, reaching 6\u20137 per 1000 individuals and even more in English-speaking countries. This rise is only partially explained by changes in diagnostic criteria.3", "Genetics is considered to play a relevant role in ASD, but only 16\u201317% of autistics are carriers of a known genetic variant, and only few common alterations have been recognized as candidate genes in linkage and association studies.1 Moreover, the gender distribution of the disease would seem to reflect a genetic X-linked pattern, but very few X-linked forms of autism susceptibility have been found to date. Therefore, in addition to genetics, possible environmental causes such as pathogens, use of antibiotics, heavy metals, chemicals, and toxins have been proposed,4 although in some cases their involvement has been or is still considered controversial. However, none of these factors alone can explain why only few children are sensitive to these environmental effects, why these effects occur in the first 3 years of age, and why males are more sensitive than females.", "In many patients, some other diseases, such as epilepsy, metabolic defects, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are in co-morbidity with autism and, interestingly, GI disorders have a strong correlation with the severity of the disease.5,6", "By collecting data from the literature and organizing fragmented hypotheses, we obtained a unique overview and formulated a hypothesis that tries to explain the sequence of possible causative events for regressive autism development. This hypothesis suggests how, in children not yet immune-competent, GI disorders and alterations of the intestinal ecosystem (gut dysbiosis) can establish, causing the synthesis of neuro-active molecules, leaky gut, and then neurotoxic xenobiotics (compound foreign to a living organism) production and absorption. We also found that, in animal models, some of these substances play a male-dependent neurodevelopment damage, thus reinforcing the environmental hypothesis for regressive autism. The combination of these factors, especially during infancy in which brain's sensitivity to senses and learning must be specifically timed,7 could lead to the development of ASD in vulnerable children. Our hypothesis can be the starting point for the prevention of all the conditions predisposing to dysbiosis and neurotoxic xenobiotics absorption, for the planning of probiotics and/or specific antimicrobial therapies, and to establish the toxin risk assessment and the daily tolerable intake."]
