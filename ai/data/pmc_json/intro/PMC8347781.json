["1. Introduction", "In recent years, mounting public awareness regarding diet-associated health issues has led to the development of natural and healthy functional foods or dietary items. Functional foods or drinks provide additional nutrients and energy to beneficially modulate metabolic functions of the body and reduce the risks associated with certain diseases [1].", "Functional soymilk is a milky fluid obtained from the overnight soaked and mashed soybeans, which contains many bioactive components that can reduce the pathophysiological responses associated with gut disorders to improve human health [2]. Soy-based foods or drinks are inexpensive and rich nutritional supplements for vegetarian and lactose-intolerant people. Previous studies have also reported that these are abundant in isoflavones and high-quality proteins that help in reducing the risks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular and hepatic disorders, diabetes, irregular menstrual cycles and menopausal syndromes, and premature aging. Moreover, they also assist in immunomodulation, neuroprotection, weight management, and enhanced athletic performance [3,4,5]. The aglycone form of isoflavones is preferred over the glycosidic form due to its enhanced bioavailability and health-imparting attributes. Thus, fermentation of soymilk with a suitable LAB strain is suggested to make isoflavones more bioavailable in the human body and to retrieve its maximum health benefits. Intestinal LAB strains have the capability of producing the \u03b2-glucosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes \u03b2-glycosidic linkages present in the isoflavones and results in the production of aglycone compounds, eventually enhancing their antioxidant and anti-tumor properties [4]. Moreover, LAB -mediated fermentation of soymilk also eliminates several non-digestible oligosaccharides by secreting the \u03b1-galactosidase enzyme [6]. LAB fermentation also mediates the production of several bioactive peptides such as antibacterial, antithrombotic, hypotensive, immunomodulatory, mineral binding, and opioid peptides that play a significant role in the prevention of various health disorders [7]. In addition, fermenting soymilk with a suitable LAB strain also improves its sensory attributes by removing undesirable beany flavor [5].", "Buttermilk is another very popular and desirable nutritional drink for lactose intolerant individuals, produced as a byproduct from the churning of the unfermented milk cream [8]. Buttermilk is also a rich source of proteins, vitamins, milk salts, and nutritional ingredients [9]. Currently, a wide range of buttermilk variants are available in the market but cannot be considered as health drinks due to added sugar, flavors, and preservatives in them, which can further impose serious health problems. Therefore, the preparation of functional buttermilk and soymilk using a natural flavor and a nutrition-imparting LAB strain is highly recommended to reduce their undesirable flavor and enhance consumer acceptability.", "L-alanine is an FDA-approved food flavor, low-calorie sweetener, fat substitute, and nutritional supplement [10,11]. It is an ideal ingredient for developing pharmaceutics to treat hypoglycemia, prostate hypertrophy, liver diseases, and urea cycle disorders [12,13,14]. It is widely used in fragrances, hair and skin conditioners, and personal care products [15,16]. Moreover, it provides high energy during intensive workouts, thus is added as a supplement to energy drinks to enhance athletic performance [17]. Therefore, an L-alanine producing P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain is being proposed hereby as a starter culture bacterium for the production of functional buttermilk and soymilk. Fermentation of buttermilk and soymilk was carried out for 24 h and evaluated for variations in their physiochemical and quality attributes. Further, GC-MS-based metabolomic fingerprinting was performed to identify the effect of LAB fermentation on increasing levels of certain desirable metabolites with pharmacological and flavor enhancement properties and reducing undesirable and quality detrimental compounds that impart bitterness, unpleasant flavor, rancidity, and unhealthy attributes to the fermented drinks."]
