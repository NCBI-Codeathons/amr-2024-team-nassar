["1. Introduction", "The intestinal microbiota is composed of an incredibly diverse array of commensal microbes that exist in a delicate yet relatively stable equilibrium. The stability and resilience of the healthy microbiome is critical for establishing a protective barrier from enteric pathogens [1], liberating essential nutrients [2], and modulating the host immune system [3]. Understanding the effectors that help to establish and maintain commensal colonization in the healthy gut is therefore critical, given the integral role of commensals in regulating gut homeostasis and host health.", "In the complex intestinal environment, survival involves competition for space and nutrients [4,5]. Bacteria have therefore evolved mechanisms to both respond to environmental challenges and to counteract competitors fighting for the same resources [6,7,8]. One such mechanism that is environmentally responsive and serves to inhibit the growth and survival of competitors involves the production of diffusible antimicrobial molecules known as bacteriocins [9,10]. Bacteriocins are toxins that have a specific host range and are generally lethal to closely related strains competing for similar resources [11]. A subtype of bacteriocins, known as colicins, are produced by Enterobacteriaceae. Colicins and their related genes are found within genomic clusters on colicinogenic plasmids. These clusters typically contain the colicin production gene which codes for the toxin, an immunity gene which codes for a protein that confers self-resistance by binding to and inactivating the toxin protein, and a lysis gene which codes for protein that aids in colicin release [12]. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that colicin expression from these plasmids is tightly regulated by the bacterial DNA damage stress response pathway, also known as the SOS response, or by nutrient limitation [13,14,15].", "Theoretical and laboratory-based studies have suggested that during periods of environmental stress, such as genotoxic stress or nutrient depletion, colicins aid in promoting survival of the colicin producing strain, potentially by modulating the broader microbial community [16,17,18]. Laboratory studies have defined synthetic triggers that precipitate colicin production, yet natural environments that trigger colicin production and subsequently require colicin production for bacterial survival have yet to be elucidated. One natural environment in which colicins may be instrumental for bacterial survival is the gastrointestinal tract. Colicin-producing strains are highly prevalent within the mammalian gut [12,19], with estimates that at least half of the E. coli strains in human fecal samples produce one or more colicins, and more than half of E. coli isolates from feral house mice contain colicinogenic plasmids [20,21].", "The mammalian gut is characterized by a high density and diversity of microbes, making it a plausible environment in which colicins could be critical for successful commensal colonization. Beyond the high density of microbes, the potential for genotoxic stressors or periods of nutrient limitation suggest a potential role for colicin production. A recent report revealed that a functional SOS response is critical for a colicin-producing commensal E. coli isolate to successfully colonize the healthy mammalian gut [22]. While the SOS response provides many diverse functions for bacteria, noncanonical functions such as colicin regulation could be the critical effectors of the SOS response that are required for sustained colonization of the mammalian gut. Despite implicit evidence that colicins may be important for survival in the mammalian gut, little work has been done that directly tests whether colicins are critical for native commensals to sustain colonization in their natural environmental niche.", "Attempts to elucidate the role of colicins within the intestinal microbiome have largely relied upon one of two mouse models in which the indigenous microflora and the homeostatic gut environment have been disrupted. In one model, streptomycin-resistant strains are used and streptomycin is administered throughout the course of the experiment. In this model, administering streptomycin is necessary to overcome colonization resistance, but continual streptomycin treatment has been demonstrated to reduce microbial diversity and alter the mouse immune status [23,24,25]. In a second model, colitis is induced to trigger expansion of strains; however, the factors involved in colonization likely differ in colitis relative to the unperturbed gut. These model systems have largely been employed because the commonly utilized E. coli laboratory strains are not natural colonizers of the murine gut and, consequently, in the absence of streptomycin or dysbiosis, most strains poorly and transiently colonize the healthy murine gut [23,26,27]. Despite the inherent limitations of these models, collectively these studies have suggested the importance of colicin production for stable colonization [28], for displacement of a colicin-sensitive strain [29], and for survival during intestinal competition [26,30,31] in the setting of dysbiosis. Whether colicin production is vital to commensal colonization in the context of a healthy gut environment and in the absence of antibiotic selection remains unknown.", "Given the limitations of prior models, we aimed to understand whether colicin production is a tool used by commensal bacteria to initiate and sustain colonization in a healthy gut with an intact microbiome. To address this gap, we studied the mouse intestinal commensal E. coli isolate, MP1, which can sustain colonization in the absence of exogenous antibiotic treatment [32]. MP1 has a naturally occurring colicinogenic plasmid, making it an ideal model to explore colicin dynamics during commensal colonization of the healthy gut environment. We demonstrate that colicin production is not critical for sustained colonization and that, in direct intestinal niche competition, colicin production does not confer a fitness advantage. Additionally, we found that an established commensal does not require colicin to limit invading strains. Our results suggest that although colicins may have a role in perturbed environments, host-adapted strains may not rely on colicin production for establishment and maintenance of colonization in a homeostatic environment. Our work lays the groundwork for further exploration into the environments that necessitate colicin production for bacterial survival and provides insight into molecular mechanisms that commensals use to sustain colonization in a healthy gut microbiota."]
