["Introduction", "The microbiome, a characteristic microbial community occupying a reasonably well-defined habitat with distinct physio-chemical properties, encompasses the microorganisms involved (microbiota), as well as their structural elements, metabolites, and surrounding environmental conditions (Berg et al., 2020). One Health (OH) is the holistic methodology of transdisciplinary cooperation to improve human, animal, plant, and environmental health simultaneously, and its adoption is continuously expanding (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Bronzwaer et al., 2021). Due to their functional potential and considering their associations with a range of diseases, microbiomes are key elements in the OH framework (Comitato Nazionale per la Biosicurezza, le Biotecnologie e le Scienze della Vita [CNBBSV], 2019; Merten et al., 2020). Their significance is partly due to pathogenic and commensal microbial transfer between humans, animals, and the environment and the human microbiome stands out with regards to its interactions with environmental and dietary chemicals that affect human health outcomes (Trinh et al., 2018). Of particular interest are the contact and mutual influence between the human gut microbiome (GM) and exogenous toxic chemicals, xenobiotics, focusing on their fate, metabolism, and toxicity (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], 2018; Abdelsalam et al., 2020).", "Among xenobiotics, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are especially important, and they have been associated with metabolic disorders, such as obesity, as well as with changes in the GM (G\u00e1lvez-Ontiveros et al., 2020; Aguilera et al., 2021). Recently the concept of microbiota disrupting chemicals (MDCs) has been proposed, which comprise EDCs and other xenobiotics with potential to alter the gut microbiota\u2019s composition and metabolism (Aguilera et al., 2020) via food ingestion, e.g., bisphenols and parabens (And\u00fajar et al., 2019; Monteagudo et al., 2021; Robles-Aguilera et al., 2021).", "The interactions between MDCs and the GM are complex. This is partly because multiple general mechanisms are involved including; direct effects of the MDC on the microbiome; altered epithelial-barrier functions (affecting uptake or excretion of MDCs); direct chemical transformations of MDCs; secondary transformation of host-generated metabolites (e.g., deconjugation by \u03b2-glucuronidases), and; altered expression of host-tissue metabolic enzymes and pathways (e.g., in the liver via microbial signaling molecules) (Ulluwishewa et al., 2011; Patterson and Turnbaugh, 2014; Peterson and Artis, 2014; Kelly et al., 2015; Selwyn et al., 2015, 2016; Claus et al., 2016; Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2016; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], 2018). Although these interactions can decrease MDC exposure and toxicity effects, they can also increase them. For example, several bacterial phyla in the human GM can produce azoreductases, which have been shown to reduce azo dyes that are common in foods into mutagenic and carcinogenic aromatic amines (Rafii et al., 1990; Xu et al., 2007). Overall, the role of these complex interactions in modifying human susceptibility to MDCs is beginning to be elucidated.", "Risk assessment (RA) is the science-based component of the food safety risk analysis framework, alongside risk management and risk communication. RA comprises; hazard identification; hazard characterization; exposure assessment, and; risk characterization (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 1999; Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, 2002). Traditionally, xenobiotic RA relies on data from animal experiments, human trials and/or human observational/epidemiological studies. Importantly, the extrapolation of this data across species or studied populations is not without challenge, partially due to GM variability and the complexity of MDC/GM interactions (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], 2018). Thus, the need for the incorporation of the GM in food safety RA of xenobiotics is well-justified (Merten et al., 2020) and by extension to MDCs.", "Another area of relevance to the GM in the context of OH is the identification of beneficial taxa and derived components (e.g., enzymes and biocompounds) in the GM and their potential application. In this context, toxicomicrobiomics, which study the aforementioned microbiome-xenobiotic/MDC interactions, along with culturomics, which aim to cultivate components of the human GM through the use of optimized selective and/or enrichment culture conditions coupled with metagenomic taxa identification, can shed light on the microbiome\u2019s capacity to metabolize xenobiotics (Aziz, 2018; Lagier et al., 2018; Comitato Nazionale per la Biosicurezza, le Biotecnologie e le Scienze della Vita [CNBBSV], 2019; Abdelsalam et al., 2020; L\u00f3pez-Moreno et al., 2022) and by extension MDCs. Thus, these approaches can help identify GM components with beneficial effects under OH, for example detoxification activity (L\u00f3pez-Moreno et al., 2021b) or next-generation probiotics (NGPs) (L\u00f3pez-Moreno et al., 2021a).", "A third area of relevance is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Undoubtedly, AMR is an important OH issue, with the major contributor being the misuse of antibiotics (World Health Organization, 2015, 2021; O\u2019Neill, 2016). Moreover, the GM has previously been considered as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (Gibson et al., 2015; Anthony et al., 2021). Non-antibiotic antimicrobials, including MDCs triclosan and parabens, commonly used as preservatives in foods, food contact materials (FCMs) and personal care products (Soni et al., 2001, 2002, 2005; Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel, 2008; Halden et al., 2017), may also contribute to AMR (Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety [SCCS], 2010). This is because some resistance mechanisms are common to both biocidal MDCs and antibiotics, for example, the former may; exert selective stress leading to the expression of bacterial resistance mechanisms and their dissemination, and/or; maintain mobile genetic elements carrying genes involved in antibiotic cross-resistance (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, 2009). Therefore, due to their detoxification potential certain GM taxa may become of particular interest in the context of such antimicrobials.", "This perspective discusses these interlinked areas of relevance to the GM in the context of OH (Figure 1). The first area relates primarily to human health. However, depending on the output of the RA and the antimicrobial or not nature of the xenobiotic, the other two areas are highly relevant to holistic xenobiotic risk management.", "FIGURE 1Three interlinked areas of relevance to the human gut microbiome (GM) in the context of One Health (OH); incorporation of the GM in food safety risk assessment of xenobiotics; identification and application of beneficial GM taxa and components (e.g., enzymes and bioactive compounds) to various areas under OH, and; specifically, in the context of antimicrobial resistance.
