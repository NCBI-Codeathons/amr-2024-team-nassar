["1 Introduction", "Antibiotics are one of the most notable medical achievements of the 20th century. Their development in clinical area has revolutionized the approach to treating infectious diseases and has played a crucial role in saving countless lives suffering microbial infections (Ghosh et al., 2020; Chahar et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023; Upadhayay et al., 2023). The wide application of antimicrobial reagents was regarded as a true blessing for humanity, not only serving medicinal purposes but also finding application in various fields, including animal breeding, care, and production. In low-income areas, antibiotics have been utilized as preventive measures for decades, further showcasing their widespread impact on public health and agriculture. Despite the increased focus on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections continues to escalate (Griffith et al., 2012; Durao et al., 2018; Xuan et al., 2023). Moreover, resistance to newly developed drugs is frequently observed shortly after their introduction. Unfortunately, the rate of discovering new antimicrobial drugs has significantly declined due to factors like low profitability and shifting priorities within the pharmaceutical industry (Aminov and Mackie, 2007). This situation further compounds the AMR crisis, presenting a significant challenge to public health and medicine.", "Salvador Luria (1912\u20131991) made significant contributions to our understanding of bacterial resistance to viruses (phages) (NIH, 2023). His research demonstrated that bacterial resistance to phages is a heritable trait, passed down through genetic inheritance. The rise of antimicrobial resistance has significantly amplified the impact of infectious diseases, leading to increased studies of AMR.", "The primary objective of this article is to emphasize the fundamental mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, it aims to outline the emergence and evolution of these mechanisms, and elucidate the factors that contribute to their enduring presence over time. By comprehending the evolutionary forces propelling antimicrobial resistance, there is potential to uncover fresh insights into strategies for addressing this substantial public health challenge."]
