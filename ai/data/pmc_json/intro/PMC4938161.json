["Introduction", "The biotrophic plant pathogen Claviceps purpurea infects a broad range of grasses including economically important cereal crop plants [1]. In the sclerotia, which are the overwintering structure of the fungus, C. purpurea produces the toxic ergot alkaloids. In the Middle Ages, the consumption of rye products contaminated with C. purpurea sclerotia led to the so-called St. Anthony\u2019s Fire epidemics and also in the 20th century this risk was still present [2]. Biochemistry and genetics of the ergot alkaloids biosynthesis have been well studied in C. purpurea [3], but apart from that, little is known about other secondary metabolites contributing to the toxicity of the ergot sclerotia.", "In filamentous fungi, the biosynthetic genes for secondary metabolites are typically clustered together [4] and these clusters usually consist of at least one backbone gene such as polyketide synthases (PKSs) or nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The availability of the C. purpurea genome sequence allowed the identification of 9 PKS- and 18 NRPS-encoding genes through a bioinformatical screening approach, demonstrating the great potential of the reference strain C. purpurea to produce previously unknown secondary metabolites [5]. As putative secondary metabolite gene clusters are often silent under standard laboratory conditions, an activation of cryptic clusters by genetic manipulation is a common tool to identify new metabolites [6,7].", "This paper reports the identification of a gene cluster in C. purpurea with a high similarity to gene clusters responsible for the formation of epipolythiodiketopiperazine (ETP) toxins in other fungi. This class of toxins is characterized by a diketopiperazine backbone (see bold structure element in Fig 1B) derived from two amino acids with an internal disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge is responsible for the toxicity of the ETPs by inactivating proteins through thiol conjugation and the generation of reactive oxygen species via redox cycling [8\u201310]. ETPs are toxic to a broad range of organisms, including viruses, bacteria or fungi [9,11] and some have also been associated with mammalian diseases [12\u201314]. On the other hand, the cytotoxicity of the ETPs has made them attractive as potential drug candidates [15\u201317].", "10.1371/journal.pone.0158945.g001Fig 1Organization of the different ETP biosynthesis gene clusters and structure of gliotoxin and sirodesmin.(A) Shown is the ETP gene cluster in C. purpurea in comparison to the gliotoxin and sirodesmin producing gene clusters from A. fumigatus and L. maculans.

(B) Structure of gliotoxin and sirodesmin PL with the bolded characteristic diketopiperazine moiety with an internal disulfide bridge.", "There is a great structural diversity of ETPs and so far over 100 different ETPs have been identified [18]. The diversity is due to variations in the set of amino acids which build the core ETP moiety. However, all known ETPs are derived from at least one aromatic amino acid [19]. ETPs can also differ in the amount of sulfur atoms. Most common are epidithiodiketopiperazines but epitri- and epitetrasulfide derivatives are also known [20,21]. One example for an ETP toxin is sirodesmin PL (Fig 1B). The phytotoxin contributes to the virulence of Leptosphaeria maculans causing yellow lesions on plant leaves [22]. Another well studied ETP is gliotoxin (Fig 1B), which plays a significant role in enabling the virulence of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus causing invasive aspergillosis [23]. Gliotoxin was first discovered in the plant-beneficial fungus Trichoderma virens [24]. In 2012 the corresponding gene cluster could be identified [25] and a knock-out of the NRPS demonstrated that gliotoxin is involved in mycoparasitism of the fungus [26].", "Putative ETP gene clusters are present in at least 14 ascomycete taxa including pathogens of mammals and plants [27]. The best characterized ETP clusters are the sirodesmin cluster in L. maculans [28] and the gliotoxin cluster in A. fumigatus [19]. In both clusters, genes encoding enzymes responsible for the formation of the common ETP moiety are present, like a NRPS, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and a methyltransferase [29]. A glutathione S-transferase is responsible for the sulfurization of the molecule by adding glutathione [30]. A further oxidoreductase mediates the formation of the disulfide bridge [31]. In A. fumigatus it was also shown that this oxidoreductase confers self-resistance of the fungus to gliotoxin [31,32]. The gliotoxin cluster is under the control of the Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor GliZ [33]. GliZ is also necessary for the production of several gliotoxin-related metabolites which appear to be shunt products of the gliotoxin pathway [34].", "In this paper, we describe the identification of an ETP gene cluster in C. purpurea and the gene cluster activation through overexpression of the cluster specific transcription factor. We also report the identification of novel unusual metabolites as end-products of the ETP gene cluster in C. purpurea and show that due to a dysfunctional cluster gene, this C. purpurea strain is not able to produce known toxic forms of ETPs. By heterologous expression of a L. maculans sirodesmin cluster gene in C. purpurea and detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as well as high resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) studies, we identified so far unknown ETPs as end-products of the C. purpurea ETP cluster."]
