["1. Introduction", "Natural products are secondary metabolites produced by organisms such as microbes and plants. They are usually small molecules not essential for their primary metabolism but often play important roles in ecological interactions and defense against predators or competitors. For example, many bacteria produce secondary metabolites with antibiotic properties that help them to compete for resources in their environment [1]. Almost a hundred years ago, the active-guide discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming\u2019s serendipitous isolation of a new natural product called penicillin, produced by Staphylococcus colonies, occurred, which was proved to control bacterial growth by inhibiting cell division [2,3]. The tremendous clinical success of penicillin fueled the search for new chemicals from microorganisms, plants, and other natural resources over the past century, which led to the discovery of a large number of biologically active natural products, including \u03b2-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide, lipopeptide, and other essential antibiotic skeletons and agrochemicals [4,5,6]. In the activity-guided approach to natural product discovery, highly efficient methods for activity screening, enrichment, and chemical isolation have been developed over the years to isolate pure bioactive compounds. Still, their discovery rate lags far behind the demand [7,8,9].", "The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology profoundly changed the traditional method of natural product discovery to the genome mining approaches [10,11,12]. The results of high-throughput sequencing have created a wealth of biological genomic data. For example, data analysis has shown that genes involved in natural product biosynthesis are closely aligned in the genome, forming so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [11,13,14]. In addition to genes encoding enzymes for the synthesis and modification of product backbone, metabolite transporters, and genes involved in the regulation of BGC expression, BGCs typically carry one or more genes, called self-resistance genes, encoding proteins that confer resistance to the natural product [15,16]. The basic logic behind self-resistance genes is that an organism must develop a mechanism to defend itself against possible damage caused by its metabolites, which, due to their biological activity, act on other organisms around it, thus ensuring that the organism gains an advantage over the competition [17]. This remarkable feature of BGCs has been used to develop the so-called Targeted Genome Mining (TDGM) methods, which first identify self-resistance genes and associated BGCs in the genome, and then predict the mode of action of natural products based on the mechanism of action of the resistance genes [16,18].", "Another motivation for developing self-resistance gene-directed genome mining comes from the request to find novel antibiotic drugs in the fight against the antibiotic resistance crisis in which global public health is polluted by the widespread misuse of antibiotics [19,20]. Indeed, the lack of novel antibiotics with new modes of action makes finding new compounds to combat drug-resistant pathogens a critical task in the current drug development process [21]. On the other hand, long before humans began the mass production of antibiotics to prevent and treat infectious diseases, bacterial species had evolved self-resistant genes to tolerate antibiotics, thus allowing them to survive in crowded and harmful environments. Drug-resistant genes result from sanitation pollution from the massive improper use of antibiotics and provide a direction for discovering new antibiotics. Therefore, detecting resistance genes from the genome or metagenome becomes a critical step in identifying BGCs of bioactive products. This requires first compiling a knowledge database of all known antibiotic resistance genes [22], including sequence, structure, function, site of action, antibiotic compounds, and resistance mechanisms, and then using this database to mine genomes for possible resistance genes. So far, there are a variety of resistance gene databases available. One example of a resistance gene database is the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) [23], which provides a centralized resource for researchers to access and analyze data on antimicrobial resistance genes. The CARD database includes over 2000 resistance genes, associated mutations, mobile genetic elements, and other relevant data. This database has been used to identify new resistance mechanisms and to track the spread of resistant organisms across different environments. The National Center for Biotechnology Information Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Database (NCBIAMR) [24] contains annotated sequence records of representative DNA sequences encoding proteins that confer or contribute to resistance to various antibiotics. This dataset was constructed by aggregating collections from multiple sources, managing conflicts, and adding additional sequences discovered through a literature review, culminating in the integration of a selected database of reference genes and a selected collection of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) models [25]. Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (MIBiG) [26] is a biosynthetic gene cluster database for the management and storage of known BGCs, providing a powerful annotation standard for the annotation and metadata of BGCs and their molecular products. It facilitates the standardized storage and retrieval of BGC data and the development of comprehensive comparative analysis tools. It advances the next generation of research on the biosynthesis, chemistry, and ecology of a broad class of socially relevant bioactive secondary metabolites, guided by robust experimental evidence and rich metadata components.", "Other databases include LacED [27], ARG-ANNOT [28], Resfam [29], DeepARG [30], ResFinder [31], ARTS-DB [18], etc., which, together, provide the basis for the TDGM discovery of natural products based on resistance gene screening.", "A typical TDGM starts with genome annotation to identify all genes present in the genome, and then, on this basis, different methods are developed to predict putative BGCs. The most popular ones are based on homology comparisons, such as antiSMASH [32] and PRISM [33], and rely on identifying BGCs known in other microorganisms and detecting conserved domains and motifs associated with biosynthetic enzymes in these BGCs in the target genome. ClusterFinder uses a probabilistic model to predict the probability that a gene cluster is a BGC, based on the presence of known biosynthetic genes and their synteny with other genes [34]. Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to BGC identification by learning complex protein features and patterns from large-scale sequence datasets, which has been shown to outperform traditional machine learning methods. Tools that use this technique include, for example, DeepBGC [35], e-DeepBGC [36], iPRESTO [37], and others. These tools use a variety of algorithms to detect genes involved in secondary metabolisms, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs), nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), hybrid PKS-NRPSs, and terpenoids. Another useful concept is the gene cluster family (GCF), which has emerged as a method to analyze BGCs on a large scale [34,38,39]. The GCF yields a network structure that significantly reduces the complexity of the BGC dataset and enables automatic annotation based on experimentally characterized reference BGCs. GCF networks have been used for the global analysis of bacterial biosynthetic spaces [34] and for bacterial genome mining at the scale of >10,000 genomes [40], and they have been integrated with metabolomics datasets for large-scale compound and BGC discovery [38]. In all these approaches, a notoriously tricky problem is predicting the natural product\u2019s function from a BGC, which usually depends heavily on applying the knowledge of the known BGC and well-characterized resistance genes, such as MIBiG [26], ARTS-DB [18], etc. Therefore, in addition to the functional analysis of necessary genes, the resistance genes must be identified and compared with a comprehensive dataset to assess the function novelty of the product and thus prioritize BGCs.", "In this study, we first compiled a new resistance gene database (RGDB) by integrating existing resources and applying additional detailed annotation, which clarified their intrinsic relationship with the natural production encoded in BGCs. The database and script codes for predicting resistance genes and their activities using the database are provided at https://github.com/mingdengming/rga (accessed on 23 February 2023). As an application, the method was used to analyze the MarRef bacterial genome dataset, which consists of more than one thousand genomes from the Marine Metagenomic Portal (MMP) [41]. As a genomic dataset for marine bacteria, the recently disclosed MarRef dataset has a good degree of completeness and systematicity and thus allows for the systematic detection of the occurrence of resistance genes in the RGDB in a given system. Both the resistance genes and some of the encoded natural products of the BGCs were predicted and analyzed using the database. The RGDB established in this work might enlarge our knowledge about resistance genes and mechanisms; it may help annotate the function of BGCs and facilitate TDGM in large-scale natural production mining."]
