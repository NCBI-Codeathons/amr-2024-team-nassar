["1. Introduction", "Secondary metabolites, also known as natural products, are complex and three-dimensionally oriented molecules that belong to diverse groups of organic compounds, which expand across the chemical space of known molecules [1]. Notably, secondary metabolites are important sources of chemical diversity for drug discovery and development [2].", "Ecologically, secondary metabolites are involved in the adaptive processes of species, interacting effectively and specifically with their biological targets [1,2]. Microorganisms, especially bacteria and fungi, are sources of a vast chemical diversity of metabolites, due to their constant interaction with widely colonized areas, which are competitive habitats under constant stress [3]. To increase survival rates under these conditions, microorganisms adopt several strategies, such as the production of secondary metabolites to counteract physicochemical changes in the environment (e.g., pigments), as well as bioactive secondary metabolites to combat their competitors in their native habitat. Examples of such metabolites are penicillin and epoxyketone peptides. The first, produced by fungi of the genera Penicillium, is induced in the presence of a bacteria, combating these competitors by covalently inhibiting Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs), many of which are essential for bacterial cell-wall synthesis and stability [4]. Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, are one of the main classes of antibacterial agents used by humanity. On the other hand, the epoxyketone peptides eponemycin [5] and epoxomicin [6] are produced by actinomycete bacteria, selectively binding to the active sites of the proteasome, an important proteolytic protein complex of eukaryotic cells, essential for protein homeostasis [7,8]. Along with their antifungal properties, proteasome inhibitors of bacterial origin have been crucial for inspiring the development of second (e.g., carfilzomib/Kyprolis\u00ae\u2014derived from epoxomicin [6]) and third (e.g., salinosporamide A/Marizomib [9]) generation proteasome inhibitors, with wide anticancer applications [10].", "However, finding and producing bioactive secondary metabolites under controlled artificial conditions is not an easy task. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by bacteria is a well-regulated process, involving groups of genes often organized into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within the bacterial genome. Each BGC can code for numerous biosynthetic enzymes, regulators and sometimes macromolecules that confer resistance to the final natural product [11,12]. The regulation of BGC expression provides bacteria with a way to expend energy on secondary metabolite production only when it is essential for growth or ecological competition [13]. BGC expression might be regulated by a variety of molecular mechanisms, and thus BGC regulation represents a hurdle for obtaining natural products under laboratory conditions, as most of cultivable bacteria do not express their biosynthetic potential outside of their native environment [14]. Therefore, the need to implement alternative and innovative methodologies to induce the expression of silent and/or poorly expressed BGCs to produce novel bioactive natural substances under controlled conditions is evident [15].", "Bacterial elicitation is a strategy being pursued by the natural product community [14,15,16,17]. It has been shown that physical and chemical alterations of growth media may alter the transcription rate of certain genes and may result in the induction of BGC expression otherwise kept silent under laboratory culture conditions. These alterations can involve the composition of growth media or growth conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, oxygenation), co-cultivation with competitors, addition of precursors or the use of chemicals that act as specific or broad epigenetic elicitors [17]. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic evaluation of such methods and the correlation between the growth condition and the elicitation method, the secondary metabolites produced and biological relevance of the produced compounds, is absent from the literature.", "Metabolic changes provoked by chemical elicitors can be monitored by hyphenated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), revealing how elicitors can globally modify the expression of bacterial natural products, even at trace levels. However, LC-MS/MS data processing and mining remain challenging due to the inherent properties of metabolite elution in the LC and its behavior in electrospray ionization (ESI). These challenges have been tackled by the scientific community, including our group, initially focusing on the subsequent experimental problems that can be handled by computational methods, using mathematical rules and the physicochemical logic behind the data. (i) LC provides the separation of stereoisomers, that may display very similar MS/MS spectra. The retention time of the MS/MS must be taken into account, thereby avoiding merging isomeric MS/MS spectral pairs during LC-MS/MS data processing. In addition, the peak area of elution related to a given single compound is important information for the relative quantification of compounds in the sample, and may also be annotated and used during LC-MS/MS data mining. (ii) Variations in ion formation by a given compound during ESI are often observed. For instance, the formation of adducts, dimers, multiple charges and in-source fragmentation are frequently observed leading to MS/MS data amplification (about 40\u201380% of the collected MS/MS spectra [18]) and loss of information of the MS/MS spectra related to the original compound. If not treated correctly, dataset dereplication with MS/MS databases of known compounds is further compromised, since spectral identification can be misled by spectral similarities to ionization variants instead of to the real metabolite. In addition to proprietary and publicly available LC-MS/MS data processing and mining tools, many advances in LC-MS/MS data handling have been recently reported, such as TidyMS for data extraction [19], mzAdan [20] and feature-based molecular networking [21] to account for ionization variants, and CANOPUS for systematic compound class annotation based on MS/MS data [22]. While these works were being reported, we developed our own tool, the NP3 MS workflow, for processing and mining of LC-MS/MS data obtained from unpurified natural product chemical libraries.", "In this work, we report a pilot library\u2014the elicited pre-fractionated bacterial (EPfB) chemical library\u2014which was prepared using a new methodology to select chemical elicitors aiming to modulate deep-sea bacterial metabolism. The investigation of the chemical diversity of the EPfB library was performed by frontier cheminformatic methods using MS/MS spectra, compounds and networks derived from the NP3 MS workflow data processing, assisted by the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) [23] and the Universal Natural Products Database (UNPD)\u2014In-Silico MS/MS DataBase (ISDB) [24] databases for compound identification. The biological potential of the EPfB library was assessed by comparing the chemical space achieved by the library with that of drugs and natural products, and further by screening the library in four bioassays. We show that the EPfB library\u2019s components overlap with the chemical space of drugs. Furthermore, chemical elicitation promoted the production of rare or potentially novel natural products, and bioactivity was mainly detected in the elicited pre-fractionated samples. These findings corroborate the statement that chemical elicitation and natural product library pre-fractionation are key strategies that allow the exploration of unique bioactive bacterial secondary metabolites. This work further pinpoints strategies for constructing and mining chemically diverse bacterial natural product libraries for natural product-based drug discovery pipelines."]
