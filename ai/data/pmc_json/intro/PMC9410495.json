["1. Introduction", "Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, MLT), a tryptophan derivative, was originally identified as an animal hormone produced by the bovine pineal gland in 1958, which has been associated with many physiological processes such as the regulation of circadian rhythms, immunological functions and antioxidant actions [1,2]. MLT was also found in many invertebrates, algae and plants [3]. MLT plays important roles in the regulation of plant growth and development, including stimulating seed germination, promoting photosynthesis and root growth, and enhancing stress tolerance [4,5]. MLT exhibits plant protection against multiple abiotic stresses such as salinity stress [6], water stress [7] and osmotic stress [8] and pathogen infection [9]. The protective effects are attributed to its free radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity to alleviate oxidative damage mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals [10]. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in plant defense responses mediated or caused by ROS under stresses [11]. NO could control ROS production by altering the activities of several ROS-scavenging enzymes and act as an antioxidant to improve plant stress tolerance, whereas over-accumulation of NO may cause nitrosative stress leading to toxic damage to plant cells [12]. A lower concentration of local NO is essentially required to impart resistance in plants against different stresses. Recently, Shi et al. (2015) demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) is a downstream signal of MLT in Arabidopsis against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringe infection [13]. NO-dependent melatonin synthesis was also observed in NaCl-stressed rapeseed seedling roots [14] and cadmium-stressed rice seedlings [15]. The counteracting effects of MLT on oxidative damages in those stresses were confirmed to be mediated by NO generation at lower concentrations.", "Compared with many studies of MLT in animals and plants, the research on MLT in microbes is scarce. MLT was first detected from the unicellular organism Gonyaulax polyedra by P\u00f6ggeler et al. (1991) [16] and a photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum by Manchester et al. (1995) [17]. These studies extended MLT research from plants and animals to microorganisms. Higher MLT content (9748 \u00b1 2430 pg/mg protein) was present in an aerobic photosynthetic bacterium Erythrobacter longus [18]. Exogenous MLT at 10\u22124 M could alter the circadian rhythm of NAD+ kinase in Neurospora crassa and bioluminescence in Gonyaulax polyedra [19]. V\u00e1zquez et al. (2017) also reported that MLT at 5 \u03bcM could mitigate H2O2-induced damage to yeast by decreasing ROS accumulation, enhancing GSSG/GSH, and increasing the expressions of endogenous antioxidant defense genes [20]. There were a few studies on MLT production of yeasts in fermented foods and beverages [21]. However, little information is available regarding the effects of MLT on fungal growth and metabolism.", "Shiraia bambusicola is a fungal pathogen on bamboos, and its fruiting body has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine to treat rheumatoid arthritis, tracheitis, stomachache and psoriasis [22]. Hypocrellins (HA-HC) with a perylenequinone (PQ) skeleton are the main bioactive components of Shiraia hypha and fruiting bodies [23]. The 4,9-dihydroxy-3,10-perylenequinoid moiety in hypocrellins is the essential structure for generating singlet oxygen (1O2) efficiently in photooxidative action [24]. The induced ROS could cause plant cellular damage and nutrient leakage, allowing for successful pathogenesis [25]. Due to superior singlet oxygen quantum yield and lower dark toxicity, hypocrellins have also been developed as new non-porphyrin photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) on cancers and viruses [26,27]. On the other hand, the production of 1O2 and other ROS in photosensitization reactions of hypocrellins could cause oxidative stress in the filamentous fungal Shiraia itself [28]. In hyphae of Shiraia sp. S8, we have recently detected the presence of MLT at 0.24\u20131.39 mg/g dry weight (DW) [29]. However, whether MLT could act as an antioxidant to improve fungal resistance to hypocrellin phototoxicity is still unknown. Therefore, as a follow-up exploration of signaling regulation of ROS, NO and extracellular ATP (eATP) on Shiraia hypocrellin biosynthesis in our lab [30,31], we wish to explore the physiological role of MLT on Shiraia growth and hypocrellin production. We investigated the possible mediation of ROS and NO during MLT action, especially on the inhibition of expressions of HA biosynthetic genes and HA production. This study may help us understand the resistance mechanisms by PQ-producing fungi and the signaling regulation of MLT on fungal PQ biosynthesis."]
