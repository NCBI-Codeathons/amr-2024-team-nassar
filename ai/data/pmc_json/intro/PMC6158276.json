["Introduction", "Strobilurin A 11 and oudemansin A 22 (also known as mucidin) are antifungal polyketides produced by various Basidiomycete fungi (Fig.\u00a01a). The key \u03b2-methoxyacrylate toxophore targets the Qo site of complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and prevents adenosine triphosphate synthesis3. The major class of \u03b2-methoxyacrylate agricultural fungicides were developed from the structures of 1 and 2 with the aim of increasing photo-stability and selectivity. Thus, compounds such as azoxystrobin 3 (Syngenta) and Kresoxim methyl 4 (BASF) are among the most widely used fungicides worldwide. This class of antifungals are used as effective treatments against a broad range of destructive fungal plant pathogens and make significant contributions to food security4,5. The strobilurin fungicides are estimated to have been worth $3.4 billion in 2015 and they make up 25% of the fungicide market and 6.7% of the total crop protection market. Numerous functionalised strobilurin natural products are known6 in which the aromatic ring is hydroxylated (e.g. strobilurin F 5)7 and chlorinated (e.g. strobilurin B 6)1 and the hydroxyl groups can be, in turn, methylated or prenylated (e.g. strobilurin G 7)7,8. Other compounds such as the formally reduced congener bolineol 89 have also been reported. Surprisingly, despite the high level of interest in the strobilurins as agricultural fungicides, remarkably little is known of their detailed biosynthesis.Fig. 1Structures of key natural (1, 2, 5\u20138) and synthetic (3, 4) strobilurins. a Compounds 1\u20133 and 5\u20137 feature the key \u03b2-methoxyacrylate toxophore, while 8 is reduced.

In fungi, polyketides are produced by iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes that extend acyl coenzyme A (CoA) starter units using decarboxylative Claisen-type reactions with malonyl CoA12. The isotopic labelling patterns of 1 and 2 are consistent with three extensions of a benzoate starter unit and C-methylation of the chain (Fig.\u00a01b) using S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). An unusual oxidative rearrangement is involved in the formation of the core \u03b2-methoxyacrylate, and O-methylations must also occur to give strobilurin A 1 and oudemansin A 2. However, the molecular basis for these reactions has remained unexplored.", "Here we reveal the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for the construction of the strobilurins and reconstruct the biosynthesis of 1 in the heterologous host Aspergillus oryzae. This reveals an unusual type of fungal PKS and the enzyme responsible for the key oxidative rearrangement reaction."]
