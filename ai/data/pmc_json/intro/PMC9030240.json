["1. Introduction", "The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis reveals a large number of proteins that enable the efflux of various biologically active components [1]. These include the class of lipopeptides as one of the most important groups of secondary metabolites produced by several Bacillus strains [2]. In the case of the established laboratory strain B. subtilis 168, lipopeptide production is facilitated by two operons (srfAA-AD for surfactin and ppsA-E for plipastatin) encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) [3,4]. Surfactin is the main lipopeptide in B. subtilis and is produced in several grams per litre under optimised conditions [5]. In adapted high cell-density fermentation bioprocesses using B. subtilis 3NA, an amount of about 26 g/L surfactin was produced [6]. To ensure controlled surfactin formation, several regulatory mechanisms are involved in lipopeptide production, such as ComX-mediated quorum sensing and nutrition state sensing regulators [7,8,9]. Posttranslationally, the peptidyl carrier protein domains of three surfactin synthetase subunits (SrfAA, SrfAB, SrfAC) need to be activated by the 4-phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp [10]. In particular, B. subtilis strain 168 exhibits a non-functional sfp version due to a single base duplication, which prevents surfactin formation [11].", "Surfactin is characterised by a cyclic lactone structure consisting of a peptide moiety comprising seven amino acids (L-Glu, L-Leu, D-Leu, L-Val, L-Asp, D-Leu, L-Leu) combined with a \u03b2\u2013hydroxy fatty acid of varying chain length from C13 to C15, with C14 and C15 usually being the predominant versions in B. subtilis [12,13]. Based on these structural characteristics, surfactin is reported to have a critical micelle concentration of about 15 mg/L [14]. In addition, antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor and haemolytic properties are attributed to surfactin [15,16,17,18]. In more detail, surfactin facilitates membrane destabilization through incorporation into lipid bilayers, chelation of cations and pore formation [19,20,21]. Previous studies have described antimicrobial activities against various pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus areus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22]. In addition, efficacy against the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides [23] and the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae [24] has been demonstrated. However, most studies report the effect of surfactin when using the whole Bacillus cell culture or the cell-free supernatant after cultivation, which also contain other antimicrobial metabolites such as fengycin, iturin or bacteriocins. Furthermore, other lipopeptides, including iturin and fengycin, can also be purified when surfactin is extracted from the cell-free supernatant, which can lead to combination effects when analysing the impact on microbes [25]. More efficient is the purification of the biosurfactant as described by Loiseau et al. [26] when antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against Legionella pneumophila was described using purified surfactin from the contaminant B. subtilis strain AM1.", "As a native production strain, B. subtilis displays strategies for tolerance to self-produced surfactin. In this context, the motive force-dependent efflux pump SwrC (YerP) has been described as a surfactin self-resistance protein involved in surfactin efflux [27]. In the presence of foreign biosurfactants, B. subtilis shows different regulatory systems for a flexible stress response. For friulimicin B, a cyclic lipopeptide produced by Actinoplanes friuliensis, and daptomycin, a cyclic lipodepsipeptide, Wecke et al. [28] showed that daptomycin exclusively stimulates the LiaRS two-component system, although the compounds are structurally similar antibiotics and induce cell envelope stress [28].", "In comparison, treatment with rhamnolipid, a rhamnose-containing glycolipid [29] produced by the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, activates the alternative sigma factor \u03c3M and the LiaRS and CssRS two-component systems in B. subtilis [30]. Rhamnolipids are composed of either a single or a pair of \u03b2-hydroxyl fatty acids with a varying chain length between C8 and C16 (C10 as the dominant version in P. aeruginosa) linked by the number of rhamnose units (mono- or di-rhamnolipid) [31]. This structure leads to a critical micelle concentration of about 25 mg/L [14]. As rhamnolipids are described as another type of bioactive molecule, several applications in the biomedicial therapeutic and agriculture sectors may be possible in the future [32].", "Another well-known biosurfactant that represents an important class of antimicrobial glycolipids is sophorolipid, which is produced by yeasts such as Starmerella bombicola [33,34]. Several studies have demonstrated both antimicrobial properties on planktonic B. subtilis cells and inhibitory effects on corresponding biofilms [35,36,37]. Sophorolipids are composed of a sophorose part associated by \u03b2-1,2 glycosidic linkages with hydroxy fatty acids (C16\u2013C18) as the hydrophobic part of this biosurfactant. Furthermore, the fatty acid chain can be modified by acetylation and lactonization [38]. Especially the lactonised version shows the ability to reduce surface tension and biological activity [39]. The biosurfactant activity was also clarified by describing a critical micelle concentration of about 70 mg/L [14].", "In this report, the overall antimicrobial effect of surfactin on the biotechnologically established bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida was compared with other antimicrobial biosurfactants, namely rhamnolipids and sophorolipids. In this way, the antimicrobial properties of surfactin for different Gram-positive and -negative bacterial species were compared and the occurring effects on bacterial growth were confronted with other bioactive biosurfactants that have been described with antimicrobial characteristics. Since derivatives of B. subtilis strain 168 with a functional sfp gene are native surfactin producers [6,40,41], the initial proteome adaptation of the non-producing B. subtilis strain KM0 (strain 168; trp+), as there is consequently no preadaptation to surfactin, was analysed after treatment with high amounts of surfactin using mass spectrometric approaches. The findings on the specific proteome response after initiation of surfactin stress will increase the knowledge on the adaptation of the production strain to high amounts of surfactin and lead to the identification of genetic engineering targets for improved production strains."]
