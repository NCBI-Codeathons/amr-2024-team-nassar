["1. Introduction", "The biodiversity of microbial communities is maintained by the counteraction of the production and degradation of antibiotics [1]. The external influence of disinfectants and antibiotics drives additional selective pressures, dramatically reducing the biodiversity of microbiomes [2,3] and providing conditions for antibiotic resistance propagation [4] and evolution [5]. Reduced microbiome biodiversity, in turn, is attributed to its impaired functionality [6,7] and health disorders [8], including the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases [9], autoimmune diseases [10,11], and allergic diseases [12,13]. Hence, directed microbiome remodeling provides pronounced health benefits and creates alternative therapeutic strategies [14]. Probiotics are applied to restore the composition of the microbiome and introduce beneficial functions to microbial communities [15]. Commensals serve as probiotics competing with opportunistic pathogens in natural microbiomes [16]. Therefore, probiotic strains may be isolated in microbiomes resistant to pathogen invasion [17]. Looking for diverse na\u00efve microbiomes as sources for probiotic strains, we addressed wild animals living in natural aseptic conditions and facing a broad range of microorganisms, including pathogens and invasive species.", "To explore probiotic strains in wild animal microbiomes, we applied an ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic platform for profiling of antimicrobial activity on a single-cell level [18,19,20]. This technology enables us to select the most efficient bacterial antagonists from the whole microbiome. A critical step is a single-cell cocultivation of microbiome biodiversity together with a reporter fluorescent pathogen in emulsion droplets, followed by the selection of reporter-free droplets using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and regeneration of effector strains. The principal advantage of this platform is its unprecedented productivity, which allows us to uncover rare probiotic strains with the most pronounced pathogen killing. Previously, the highly potent Bacillus pumilus 124 strain producing antibiotic amicoumacin A (Ami) was identified as a component of the microbiome of the East Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos collaris), which is highly active against the common human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus [19]. Originally, Ami was isolated from the B. pumilus BN-103 strain [21]. However, numerous B. subtilis selected for their antibacterial activity also mediate their antagonistic properties via Ami production, and some of them were isolated from the human microbiome [22,23]. Both B. subtilis and B. pumilus strains are widely used as probiotics for broiler chickens [24], pigs [25], aquaculture [26], and human use [27]. Despite their broad use, their genotypes and biosynthetic profiles are rarely characterized in detail.", "The ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic platform revealed different probiotic B. pumilus strains from microbiomes of diverse wild animals, including the skin beetle (Dermestes maculatus), Siberian lynx (Lynx lynx wrangeli), common raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and previously reported East Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos collaris). These strains were selected based on their anti-S. aureus activity and demonstrated prominent antagonistic properties toward different bacteria. Ami was determined as the main antibiotic component produced by the selected strains. While Ami is active primarily against Gram-positive bacteria [20], antagonistic properties of isolates were also observed against some Gram-negatives. Whole-genome sequencing and genome mining enabled us to depict a biosynthetic fingerprint of isolated B. pumilus strains. All their genomes have a similar set of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding Ami, siderophore bacillibactin, and putative analogs of antimicrobials including bacilysin, surfactin, desferrioxamine, and class IId cyclical bacteriocin. We speculate that this genotype mediates the prominent antagonism observed in coculture experiments. Genome mining indicates that Ami BGCs subdivide into three distinct families characteristic of the (i) B. pumilus type, (ii) B. subtilis type, and (iii) Paenibacillus type. Hence, similar antagonistic properties may be observed among these species.", "We believe that the detailed genomic description and analysis of BGCs provide an essential genotype-phenotype link that will further our understanding of the exact impact of probiotics on pathogens and hosts. Ultrahigh-throughput technologies facilitate the isolation of natural probiotic strains from various microbiomes. A deep understanding of their genotype is essential for the metabolic reprogramming of probiotics. Designer probiotics for pathogen control and microbiome remodeling will provide direct benefits in the food industry, agriculture, and healthcare."]
