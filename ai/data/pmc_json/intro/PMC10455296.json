["1. Introduction", "The genus Fusarium is a widespread and diverse group of filamentous fungi found in soils worldwide and interacting with various plants [1,2]. Although the majority of Fusarium species are harmless soil microorganisms, a small number of pathogenic Fusarium spp. pose a significant threat to agriculture, the food industry, and human and animal health [1,3,4,5]. These pathogenic species are capable of infecting a wide range of plants, including food and cash crops, medicinal plants and ornamentals [6,7,8]. Infection caused by Fusarium leads to different types of rot, such as root, stem, basal, flower and spike rot, by attacking and destroying the plant\u2019s vascular system [1,9,10]. In addition, Fusarium also damages plants by producing its own toxins, resulting in wilting, plant death and ultimately reduced crop yield or ornamental value of landscape plants [1,3,11]. The control of pathogenic Fusarium species is therefore a challenging task in agricultural production.", "Mycotoxins, toxic secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi, are a threat to human and animal health, and Fusarium is a major producer of these toxins [10]. Almost all Fusarium species produce these harmful chemicals. For example, F. fujikuroi, a globally distributed pathogen, causes Bakanae disease in rice by producing gibberellin, which causes abnormal stem elongation in the host plant [12]. Several studies have shown that Fusarium is capable of producing structurally complex toxic metabolites such as terpenes (e.g., T-2 toxin [13], deoxynivalenol (DON) [14], fusarenone X [15] and gibberellin [16]), polyketides (PKs, e.g., fumonisin B1 [17], fusaric acid [18] and zearalenone [19]), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs, e.g., enniatin A1 [20], beauvericin [21] and apicidin [22]) and hybrid compounds (e.g., fusarin C [23], equisetin [24] and (-)-sambutoxin [25]). These toxins not only contribute to the symptoms of plant infections but also enter the food chain and affect human and animal health, in some cases causing serious damage or even loss of life.", "The identification of core enzymes and gene clusters is of great importance in biosynthetic studies. In the case of well-documented compounds such as terpenoids, polyketides and nonribosomal peptides, the core enzyme plays a crucial role in determining the structural basis of the compound. On the other hand, gene clusters are responsible for the diversity and complexity of these compounds. To aid these studies, Synthaser software [26] not only provides a visual representation of the domain composition of multidomain enzymes but also allows the simultaneous alignment of multiple enzymes. Furthermore, Clinker software [27] allows a comprehensive comparison of the correspondence between biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and the genes within them on a large scale. Finally, Big-Scape software [28] takes the understanding of correlations and similarities between biosynthetic gene clusters to an advanced level. These software packages for biosynthesis research offer immense convenience and utility.", "Although previous studies have discussed Fusarium-derived mycotoxins and provided insights into the biosynthetic pathways of specific toxic compounds, little attention has been paid to exploring the prevalence and variability of BGCs for these toxins within Fusarium species. This study aims to address this gap by applying bioinformatics-based genome-mining techniques to 35 pathogenic Fusarium species, which provide valuable genomic information related to natural product biosynthesis. Through our comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, we have successfully identified more than 30 classes of enzymes involved in terpene synthesis, as well as more than twenty classes of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), and more than ten classes of PKS-NRPS hybrids. These findings open new avenues for future biosynthetic investigations and provide a theoretical basis for using biotechnology to mitigate the harmful effects caused by these pathogenic fungi."]
