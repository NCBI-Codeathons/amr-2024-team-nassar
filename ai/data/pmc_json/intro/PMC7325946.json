["Gpa Mode of Action and Resistance Genes in Gram-Positive Pathogens", "According to a recent report (WHO, 2017), drug-resistant infections will kill more people than cancer in just over three decades: by 2050, 10 million people are going to die every year due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Consequently, it is mandatory to stimulate discovery and development of novel antibiotics to counteract AMR (O\u2019Neill, 2016). Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are frequently used to treat life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., and Clostridium difficile (for a review on their discovery and development, see Marcone et al., 2018; on their antimicrobial activity and clinical use, Zeng et al., 2016). GPAs inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria by binding to d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) dipeptide terminus of peptidoglycan (PG) precursors, sequestering the substrate from transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions in the late extracellular stages of PG cross-linking. Thus, GPA action ultimately results in destabilizing cell wall integrity, causing bacterial cell death (Perkins and Nieto, 1974). Gram-negative microorganisms are intrinsically resistant to GPAs, because of their outer membrane, which prevents these molecules entering into the periplasm. In Gram-positive bacteria, the onset of vancomycin resistance was long-delayed in comparison to other antibiotic classes. The first vancomycin-resistant clinical isolate \u2013 an Enterococcus faecium strain \u2013 was reported in 1987, more than 30 years after the clinical introduction of vancomycin (Leclercq et al., 1988, Miller et al., 2016). Unfortunately, today a vast majority of E. faecium isolates harbor vancomycin resistance genes (van) (Vehreschild et al., 2019). The first vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolate was reported in 2002 as a result of horizontal gene transfer from resistant enterococci (Bartley, 2002; Weigel et al., 2003); nowadays, 52 VRSA strains have been described worldwide (Cong et al., 2020).", "The GPA resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens were intensively studied starting from the pioneering work published in the 1990s (Arthur et al., 1992, 1996). Gram-positive pathogens escape GPA action by reprogramming PG precursor biosynthesis, replacing the terminal d-Ala with d-lactate (d-Ala-d-Lac) or d-serine (d-Ala-d-Ser), thus reducing the affinity for cellular targets (Arthur et al., 1992, 1996; Courvalin, 2006). In enterococci, many different GPA-resistant phenotypes have been described according to their van gene operon organization (for a review, see Binda et al., 2014): in vanA, vanB, vanD, and vanM the key ligase determines the replacement of the terminus d-Ala with d-Lac, whereas in vanC, vanE, vanG, vanL, and vanN\nd-Ala. The d-Ala-d-Lac-type operons are located either on plasmids or on chromosomes, whereas the d-Ala-d-Ser-type ones are exclusively on the bacterial chromosome, except the case of vanN found on a plasmid in E. faecium. Operon expression could be inducible by GPAs (vanA, vanB, vanG, vanE, vanL, and vanM) or constitutive (vanC, vanD, and vanN) (Reynolds and Courvalin, 2005; Depardieu et al., 2007; Binda et al., 2014). The most clinically relevant manifestation of GPA resistance occurs in VanA enterococci and staphylococci, and in VanB enterococci. The first group is highly resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, whereas the second group only to vancomycin. In both of them, resistance is mediated by the GPA-induced expression of the transposone-located vanHAX gene operon under the transcriptional control of the VanR/VanS two-component system (TCS). VanS is a membrane-associated sensor that in VanA bacteria is activated by the presence of either vancomycin or teicoplanin, whereas in VanB it is activated only by vancomycin. Consequently, VanB enterococci are sensitive to teicoplanin (Arthur et al., 1997, 1999; Arthur and Quintiliani, 2001). Activated VanS transfers a phosphoryl group to VanR, which is the response regulator that controls the co-transcription of the vanH, vanA, vanX, and vanY genes (Wright et al., 1993; Arthur et al., 1997, 1999; Arthur and Quintilliani, 2001). VanH is a dehydrogenase that reduces pyruvate to d-lactate; VanA is the key ligase that catalyzes the formation of the d-Ala-d-Lac resistant depsipeptide (Bugg et al., 1991; Arthur et al., 1992); VanX is a d,d-dipeptidase, which removes the intracellular pool of d-Ala-d-Ala produced by the native enterococcal ligase, ensuring that d-Ala-d-Lac is incorporated into PG precursors (Reynolds et al., 1994; Wu et al., 1995); and finally VanY has an ancillary role as a d,d-carboxypeptidase cleaving the last d-Ala from the residual pentapeptide PG precursors terminating in d-Ala-d-Ala (Arthur et al., 1998). Among the d-Ala-d-Ser-type operons, the better investigated was the vanC. It encodes for a racemase (VanT) that converts l-Ser to d-Ser, a ligase (VanC) that synthesizes d-Ala-d-Ser, and a bi-functional d,d-dipeptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase (VanXYc) that cleaves the residual pools of d-Ala-d-Ala (Billot-Klein et al., 1994; Reynolds and Courvalin, 2005). In VanC phenotype, the TCS VanRcSc is located downstream the operon, but the resistance is constitutive due to mutations in the sensor VanSc (Healy et al., 2000; Hong et al., 2008; Koteva et al., 2010). VanC enterococci are intrinsically resistant to low levels of vancomycin, although they remain sensitive to teicoplanin.", "Additional variants of these van gene operons were found in other Gram-positive pathogens including Listeria spp., streptococci, clostridia (Biavasco et al., 1996; Poyart et al., 1997; Peltier et al., 2013), and also in nonpathogenic Gram-positives, including Bacillus circulans, Oerskovia spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Streptomyces coelicolor (Power et al., 1995; Fontana et al., 1997; Hong et al., 2004). A novel vancomycin vanF operon (vanYFZFHFFXF) was described in Paenibacillus popilliae, an environmental bacteria used as biopesticide to counteract beetle larvae that caused milky disease in Japan (Patel et al., 2000; Ahmed and Baptiste, 2018). The dissemination of GPA resistance more recently reached zoonotic pathogens such as the emergent Streptococcus suis, where the low level of vancomycin-resistance is due to the presence of a vanG-like operon (Huang et al., 2018). Herein, we focus our attention on van genes distribution and function in the GPA-producing actinomycetes, which are considered the putative primary source of the variety of GPA-resistant determinants occurring in environmental bacteria and pathogens (Marshall et al., 1998; Beltrametti et al., 2007; Marcone et al., 2010, 2014; Sch\u00e4berle et al., 2011)."]
