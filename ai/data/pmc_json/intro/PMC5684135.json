["Introduction", "Cyclopropanoid natural products possess a common-strained, three-membered cyclopropane ring, which frequently show excellent biological activities, and may serve as potential drug leads1, 2. Yatakemycin (YTM, 1), CC-1065 (2), and duocarmycins (3 and 4) belong to a family of cyclopropapyrroloindole compounds that exhibit remarkably potent DNA-alkylating activities3, 4 (Fig.\u00a01a); these have been harnessed to develop antibody-drug conjugates5. For example, the duocarmycin-derived ADC MDX-1203 has entered Phase I clinical trials for treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma5. Microorganisms that synthesize these cytotoxic cyclopropanoids must evolve efficient strategies to avoid suicide. Exploration of resistance genes from their producers is not only beneficial for drug discovery, but also for assessing the lifespan of drug utility6\u20138. Our previous biosynthetic studies on 1 revealed that a DNA glycosylase YtkR2 repairs the N3-YTM-alkylated adenine residues and confers self-resistance against 1 in the last resort9, 10. Here, we show an additional level of resistance regarding YTM cyclopropyl hydrolysis catalyzed by a subfamily of GyrI-like proteins exemplified by YtkR7, a gene product coded for within the same biosynthetic gene cluster of 1. We define this subfamily of GyrI-like proteins as cyclopropanoid cyclopropyl hydrolases (CCHs), and demonstrate that they share a conserved aromatic cage for the hydrolysis of 1 and 2, and thereby confer cellular protection. The results presented here suggest that the evolutionarily conserved GyrI-like proteins are involved in cellular detoxification against diverse xenobiotics via not only binding, but also catalysis.Fig. 1Structures of cyclopropapyrroloindole compounds and characterization of cyclopropanoid cyclopropyl hydrolases (CCHs). a Structures of yatakemycin (YTM), CC-1065, and duocarmycins. 1\u2009L, 1\u2009M, and 1\u2009R indicate the three subunits of YTM, respectively.
