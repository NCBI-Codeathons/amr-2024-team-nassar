["INTRODUCTION", "Actinomycetes are chemically extremely talented bacteria, known for the exceptional diversity of their secondary metabolites (Barka et\u00a0al. 2016; Jakubiec-Krzesniak et\u00a0al. 2018). They are a major source for bioactive natural products, serving as starting points for clinically important drugs, in particular antibiotics (Genilloud 2017). Genome analyses show that individual strains of actinobacterial genomes typically contain the biosynthetic machinery for several dozen secondary metabolites, encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome ready for horizontal gene transfer as a compact functional unit (Lee et\u00a0al. 2020). The emergence of advanced genome engineering techniques and the concepts and methodology of synthetic biology have stimulated renewed interest in exploiting the biosynthetic capabilities of actinomycetes, modifying and improving their performance as biotechnological sources of valuable drugs and drug precursors (Lee et\u00a0al. 2019; Palazzotto et\u00a0al. 2019; Zhao, Wang and Luo 2019). In this mini review, we highlight selected areas of synthetic biology as applied to actinomycete strain improvement. We focus on some areas of recent advances, as well as specific challenges encountered when engineering this specific group of microbes and offer an industrial perspective on the potential applications of synthetic biology to enhance the potential of actinobacteria as drug production hosts."]
