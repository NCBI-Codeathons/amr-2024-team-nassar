["INTRODUCTION", "Fumonisins are a class of toxicologically relevant Fusarium secondary metabolites that are produced predominantly by members of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (1). Particularly important are Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium proliferatum, and other species (Fusarium temperatum, Fusarium subglutinans) on maize in warmer climates, such as in Africa (2), where fumonisin was discovered. Fumonisin production and contamination also occur in southern parts of Europe, not only on maize but also in wheat and barley (3\u20135). Fumonisin-producing Fusarium proliferatum can also infect rice (6), where fumonisin production is a virulence factor in rice spikelet rot disease (7). While fumonisin production contributes to virulence in maize seedlings (8), it is dispensable for the ability to cause maize ear rot (9). Climate change seems to increase the previously rather negligible threat of fumonisin contamination in central Europe (10).", "Fumonisins are sphinganine-analog mycotoxins with a sphinganine-like backbone structure (11). They target ceramide synthases (very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA:sphingoid base N-acyltransferases) of animals (12), plants (13) and fungi and can trigger programmed cell death in animal cells and plant cells (14\u201316).", "To characterize the toxicity of fumonisins and to develop mitigation strategies, mostly chemical assay methods, requiring expensive equipment, are used since previously established bioassays for fumonisin toxicity have shortfalls. Highly purified toxin preparations are needed for mammalian cells cultured in vitro to avoid the unspecific toxic effects of other metabolites co-occurring in crude toxin extracts. The reported susceptibility of different human and animal cell lines is quite variable. The effective concentrations ranged mainly from 10 to 100 \u00b5M (17). The IC50 value for primary rat hepatocytes was reported to be 2,000 \u00b5M (18), while human HepG2 cells are more sensitive, with an IC50 value of 399 \u00b5M (19). Plants are typically very sensitive; e.g., Arabidopsis seed germination and root development are already strongly inhibited by 1 \u00b5M fumonisin B1 (FB1) (20). However, such bioassays are rather time-consuming (e.g., requiring a 10-day observation period). Duckweed (Lemna minor) growth inhibition by 40 \u00b5M of fumonisin metabolites over a 5-day period was used to investigate the structure-activity relationship of different fumonisins and metabolites (21). Similarly, labor-intensive and low-throughput whole-animal test systems were described. For instance, a 4-day incubation period was needed to observe the death or disintegration of Hydra attenuata during exposure to 150 \u00b5g/mL (~208 \u00b5M) FB1 (22). Similarly, microscopic observation of non-motile or dead brine shrimp (Artemia salina) yielded IC50 values for FB1 ranging from 1.7 \u00b5M (48 h) to about 10 \u00b5M after 24 h (23, 24).", "Adding detoxification enzymes to fumonisin-contaminated feed commodities (25) or expressing heterologous detoxification genes already in transgenic plants (26) are possible strategies to counteract and reduce mycotoxin contamination. However, testing enzyme activity in vitro is a major bottleneck in the development of such agents. As of now, in vitro efficacy is verified through the determination of the detoxified products [e.g., hydrolyzed FB1 (HFB1)], which requires costly and laborious liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Since little is known about fumonisin metabolism in plants, useful endogenous detoxification genes may exist that could be selected by breeders or manipulated by gene editing\u2014the search is ongoing. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previously mentioned test organisms can serve as convenient hosts for the expression and high-throughput screening of potential candidate detoxification genes. We therefore set out to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an indicator organism for monitoring the toxicity of fumonisins and to phenotypically detect and test expressed detoxification enzymes."]
