["Introduction", "Tuberculosis (TB) ranks 13th in the world as a cause of death (1). In 2021, there were 10.6 million new cases of TB worldwide. The burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) also increased in 2020\u20132021. Among the new TB patients in 2021, there were 450,000 cases of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB). The number of RR-TB and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients reported to have received appropriate treatment in 2021 is 161,746, covering only 1/3 of all patients requiring treatment. The current global treatment success rate for DR-TB is 60%, which is still very low. DR-TB remains a major public health problem.", "Chest imaging examination is crucial for the early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and monitoring whether treatment drugs are effective. There are imaging differences in the chest computed tomography (CT) scans of drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) and DR-TB (2-4). When multiple CT signs of DR-PTB coexist, chest imaging examination can be used as a starting point for timely detection of suspected DR-TB patients and improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis. In order to promote the effective implementation and promotion of imaging examination and standardized diagnosis of DR-TB, this consensus invited 36 Chinese national TB imaging experts to formulate an expert consensus on imaging diagnosis of DR-TB. This consensus is based on a review of the imaging literature on DR-PTB, combined with the methodological requirements of guidelines and standards for evidence-based medicine, comprehensive consideration of clinical practice, and the experience of specialist physicians to form the final recommendations for the imaging diagnosis of DR-PTB. The consensus was drawn to provide clinicians with a diagnostic basis, form the best decision-making scheme, and effectively improve the early diagnosis of DR-TB."]
