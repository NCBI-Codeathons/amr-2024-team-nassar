["1. Introduction", "Cucumber target leaf spot (TLS) is caused by Corynespora cassiicola (Berk and Curt, Wei) and has resulted in increasing losses in cucumber production in recent years. Thus far, research on TLS has primarily focused on identification, control methods and biological characteristics. Several resistant varieties, including Jinyou 3 [1], Jinyou38 [1], Marketmore97 [2], HygBrid72502 [3], and USDA6623E [4], have been identified by disease resistance phenotypes in both Asia and Europe. At present, the inheritance of TLS resistance in cucumber has been found in several studies by using marker-assisted selection (MAS) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques. A single dominant gene, Cca, show TLS resistance in the Royal Sluis 72502 cucumber line [5], while the single recessive genes cca-1, cca-2 and cca-3 show resistance to cucumber TLS [1,6,7]. Therefore, the controversy about the genetic control of TLS resistance, and whether TLS resistance is controlled by a single dominant or recessive gene remain unclear. In addition, the genetic and physical distances of linked markers from these studies are still far away from the target gene. These markers are not breeder-friendly and not amendable for high-throughput genotyping. Most plants have non-host resistance to microbial invaders, and this resistance mechanism provides broad-spectrum and strong resistance to non-adapted pathogens in plants [8]. The mildew resistance locus O (MLO) gene in non-host defense plays an important role in the model system of the interaction of barley with Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) [9,10]. Inducible defense responses in nonhost plants is mainly caused by the hypersensitive response (HR) of host plants, including the accumulation of ROS, the activation of pathogenesis-related genes, and localized reinforcement of the plant cell walls [11,12]. Therefore, we can screen related resistance genes and study their molecular mechanisms of host resistance to cucumber TLS. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of cucumber-C. cassiicola interactions is important for establishing ideal varieties.", "MLO genes are considered negative regulators of plant immunity [13]. For instance, Arabidopsis MLO2, MLO6 and MLO12 have genetic redundancy in which Atmlo2 Atmlo6 Atmlo12 triple mutants are fully resistant to the powdery mildew pathogen and Atmlo2 single mutants are partially resistant [14,15,16]. Subsequent studies revealed that leaf cells show spontaneous cell death, callose deposition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the genetic background of Atmlo2 Atmlo6 Atmlo12 triple mutants and Atmlo2 single mutants [17]. In addition, after inoculation with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, induction of Arabidopsis MLO2 gene expression is associated with salicylic acid (SA) signaling, and systemically enhanced in plant leaves exhibiting systemic acquired resistance (SAR) [18]. Furthermore, it may be worth mentioning that Arabidopsis mlo2 mutants are defective in SAR against P. syringae [18]. At present, MLO genes have been implicated in other resistance pathways. Barley mlo alleles enhance susceptibility to the necrosis-inducing toxin from Bipolaris sorokiniana [19]. Studies have identified the interactions between Arabidopsis and bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae), Arabidopsis and oomycetes (e.g., Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Albugo spp.), and Arabidopsis and fungus (Colletotrichum higginsianum) [20,21,22,23]. Furthermore, research has recently shown that the triple mutant line mlo2-5 mlo6-2 mlo12-1 increased susceptibility to P. syringae pv. Maculicola [24]. In our laboratory, transcriptome and iTRAQ analyses identified two CsMLOs of cucumber that are involved in the response to C. cassiicola [25,26]. However, the CsMLOs function in C. cassiicola infection, and the defense mechanisms have not been described in cucumber.", "Plant self-resistance causes a series of intracellular signaling responses under stress, and they include physiological and biochemical processes. ROS are important signal transduction molecules involved in different cellular signaling pathways [27,28]. The main sources of ROS production include superoxide radicals (O2\u00b7\u2212), hydroxyl radicals (OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen [29,30]. In plant immunity, ROS production in response to pathogen recognition is mediated by the In plant immunity, ROS production in response to pathogen recognition is mediated by the oxidase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, also called respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs), and arabidopsis AtRBOHD and AtRBOHF plays a key role in apoplastic ROS generation during plant-pathogen interactions [31,32]. Moreover, the outbreak of ROS, cell death that is phenotypically similar to a hypersensitive response (HR) and increased levels of ROS-producing enzymes play an active role in plant defense [33,34]. Additionally, stoma closure participates in H2O2 production in Arabidopsis, which is promoted in guard cells by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-induced abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, and this pattern increases plant resistance to pathogens [35,36,37]. Therefore, ABA is involved in the development of defense responses during plant-pathogen interactions to block pathogen invasion. Three core components include the ABA receptors PYLs, the negative regulator type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) and positive regulator subfamily 2 of SNF1-related kinases (SnRK2s) in ABA signal transduction plants [38]. ABA-insensitive 5 (ABI5), as a basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, is essential to ABA-mediated developmental checkpoints [39]. In cucumber seedlings, CsPYL2, CsPP2C2 and CsSnKR2.2 respond to the ABA signaling pathway under drought stress [38]. Furthermore, pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) proteins, including pathogenesis-related protein 1-1a (PR1-1a), \u03b2-1, 3-glucanase (PR2) and chitinase (PR3), are increased to promote resistance to pathogens [40,41]. However, these aspects of ROS and ABA signal transduction remain largely unexplored in CsMLOs-C. cassiicola interactions.", "In this study, CsMLO1 (XM_004148737) and CsMLO2 (XM_004142345) were shown to be induced by C. cassiicola. A subcellular localization analysis showed that these proteins are located on the plasma membrane. CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 respond differently to abiotic stresses. An investigation of their defense roles via transient CsMLO1/CsMLO2-silencing and CsMLO1/CsMLO2-overexpressing cucumber plants showed that CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 both function as negative modulators in the host resistance response to C. cassiicola. Furthermore, CsMLO1 silencing might participate in the defense response to C. cassiicola by inducing the significant upregulation of several ROS-associated genes, ABA signaling pathway-associated genes or pathogenesis-related proteins. We concluded that CsMLO1 participated in the defense response to C. cassiicola in plants through multiple signaling regulatory networks. CsMLO2 regulated the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins in uninfected cucumbers. There was no pattern in the expression of ROS- and ABA-related genes in CsMLO2 transgenic cucumbers, suggesting that this gene might regulate other signaling pathways that affect cucumber resistance to C. cassiicola."]
