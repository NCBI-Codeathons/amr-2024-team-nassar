["Introduction", "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, autoantibody production, and cartilage and bone destruction, the underlying cause of which lies in immune regulatory factors such as the loss of tolerance [1]. How this process is linked to a localized onset of inflammation in the joint is still unclear but it involves migration and accumulation of immune effector cells, including macrophages and osteoclasts, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), B cells and T cells [1]. Th17 subsets, which produce interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-21, also play a crucial role in the development of RA in combination with limited functional capabilities of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Current therapies for RA rely on early and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate and glucocorticoids and/or biological agents. These mostly include antibodies to pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and IL-6 and others, including rituximab (anti-CD20) and abatacept (CTLA4 IgG1 fusion protein), which also interfere with the underlying immune/inflammatory events. In general, monotherapy with DMARDs has limited long-term efficacy, probably as a consequence of multidrug resistance. Large clinical studies with long-term follow-up demonstrated that the use of combinations of conventional DMARDs, particularly methotrexate, with biological agents was highly effective in achieving clinical remission and preventing radiological deterioration in approximately 50% of RA patients, but the remaining 50% of patients still experienced insufficient disease activity reduction or sustained active disease [2]. Therefore, in RA treatment there is still room for investigational new drugs with novel mechanisms of action, including antibody-guided and small molecule-mediated targeting of specific cell types (T/B cells, macrophages, synoviocytes), cytokines and their receptors, and intracellular (signaling) pathways [1]. Janus kinase inhibitors and Spleen kinase inhibitors represent examples of these latter drugs, displaying great pre-clinical potential, but, as with biological agents, safety/toxicity issues apply [3].", "Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) may also fall in the category of potentially attractive investigational drugs for their ability to (a) inhibit the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and/or (b) induce apoptosis of activated immune cells. The rationale of PIs to act as anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (SS) and scleroderma, has been the subject of several recent publications and reviews [4-6]. In this review, we cover the diversity and relevance of constitutive and immunoproteasome subtypes in immune competent cells involved in autoimmune diseases, and provide an overview of several classes of reversible and irreversible PIs for therapeutic interventions. Consistent with the chronic nature of the disease, it is also of relevance to expand our knowledge on the efficacy of PIs following long-term PI administration, and the possible acquisition of resistance to PIs. This review also elaborates on this issue."]
