["1. Introduction", "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) [1], particularly dalbaheptides [2], belong to a clinically relevant group of natural compounds produced by soil-dwelling and mycelium-forming Gram-positive actinobacteria, traditionally named actinomycetes [3,4]. As with other natural compounds, genes responsible for the biosynthesis of GPAs are grouped in large biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [5]. GPAs are successfully utilized to treat severe infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) staphylococcal and enterococcal strains. Two natural and three semisynthetic GPAs are currently approved for clinical use [3,6,7]. Natural first-generation GPAs are vancomycin and teicoplanin, produced by the actinobacteria Amycolatopsis orientalis (various strains) [8] and Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121 [9], respectively. Vancomycin was introduced in clinics first (in 1958), followed by teicoplanin (1988) in Europe and then in Japan (1998) [3]. Semisynthetic second-generation GPAs include telavancin\u2014a vancomycin derivative [10], oritavancin\u2014a derivative of the natural GPA chloroeremomycin [11], and dalbavancin\u2014a derivative of the other natural GPA, A40926 [12].", "Although GPAs of both generations are still clinically useful, resistant pathogens are inevitably emerging [13,14,15,16]. Peculiarly, resistance mechanisms in GPA producers and pathogens are very similar [17]. It is likely that pathogens acquired GPA resistance genes from GPA producers, or more generally from non-producing actinobacteria, where GPA resistance determinants are abundant [18,19]. GPAs interact with d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) termini of the nascent peptidoglycan (PG), impeding upstream transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions and consequently blocking cell wall biosynthesis [20]. The resistance mechanisms shared between GPA producers and pathogens lead to the modification of the d-Ala-d-Ala termini, reducing the affinity of GPAs for their target. d-Ala-d-Ala termini in PG precursors are replaced by d-Ala-d-lactate (d-Lac) [17,21] or truncated to a single d-Ala residue [22,23,24]. The first mechanism requires a three-gene operon\u2014vanHAX, where vanH codes for a d-Lac dehydrogenase responsible for generating a d-Lac pool, vanX\u2014for a d,d-dipeptidase whose role is reducing the intracellular pool of d-Ala-d-Ala [25,26], and vanA\u2014for a d-Ala-d-Lac ligase [21,27]. The second involves a single d,d-carboxypeptidase named VanY, which trims the terminal d-Ala residue. In both cases, PG precursors still undergo transpeptidation reactions, but this process is not affected by GPAs [22,23,24]. The expression of vanY or vanHAX might be constitutive or inducible. The latter requires a two-component regulatory system consisting of a sensor histidine kinase (SHK) and a transcriptional response regulator (RR), also known as VanS and VanR, respectively [28,29,30,31]. VanS can specifically recognize extracellular GPAs and phosphorylate VanR, which, in turn, activates the expression of other van genes [29,30,31,32,33].", "Actinobacterial GPA producers such as A. teichomyceticus, Amycolatopsis balhimycina DSM 5908 (balhimycin producer), Nonomuraea gerenzanensis ATCC 39727 (A40926 producer), Streptomyces toyocaensis NRRL 15009 (A47934 producer), as well as the GPA non-producing Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) represent well-studied models of GPA resistance mechanisms (recently reviewed in [34]), although certain aspects are not fully elucidated yet and merit further investigation. In this work, the properties of Tei3\u2014the VanS ortholog from the teicoplanin producer A. teichomyceticus\u2014were investigated in vivo. Notably, A. teichomyceticus is resistant to very high concentrations of teicoplanin, likely due to the strong constitutive expression of the vanHAX orthologs\u2014tei7-6-5, which was previously reported during the transcription analyses of the tei BGC [35,36,37]. It was speculated that Tei3 acts as a constitutive SHK [35]. We aimed to experimentally investigate whether Tei3 really acts as a constitutive SHK and if any GPA is eventually recognized by its sensor domain (SD). Conducting a series of experiments in S. coelicolor as a heterologous host, it was found out that Tei3 does not require any ligand to function. Strikingly, the SD of Tei3 appeared to recognize not teicoplanin but the structurally related GPA A40926. Finally, reconstruction of the phylogeny of glycosyltransferases (GTFs) coded within GPA BGCs allowed us to build a possible scenario explaining the obtained results."]
