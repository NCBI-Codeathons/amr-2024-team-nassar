["Introduction", "Soil pollution and land degradation are global problems originating from anthropological and natural sources (Malla et al., 2018). Urbanization and industrialization are the major sources of anthropological pollution while the use of chemical agents over the year for increasing crop production has led to the spread and accumulation of pollutants in the environment (Prihandiani et al., 2021). The most common contaminants in the soil are heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), or pesticides. Pesticides are the chemical compounds used to kill unwanted pests such as bugs, flies, rodents, nematodes, fungal pathogens, and unwanted herbs to maintain plant health and increase agricultural production on limited land. Pesticides play an essential part in fulfilling the world food demand, though they are very hazardous, persistent, recalcitrant, and have extended half-life properties (Wattanaphon et al., 2008; Damalas and Eleftherohorinos, 2011; Odukkathil and Vasudevan, 2016; Lamilla et al., 2021). The most common pesticides used in India and the other countries are organophosphates like chlorpyrifos, profenofos, and glyphosate, with a few being organochlorine i.e., mirex, lindane, and chlordane (Lamilla et al., 2021). These organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticides are not target-specific and have high biological stability in the soil and water bodies, polluting the ecosystem and making it pestilent for humans and other organisms such as pollinators, cattle, microbes, and aquatic organisms (Gennari et al., 2009; Sequinatto et al., 2013). Most organophosphate pesticides are classified as class II carcinogens with mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects on humans and other organisms (Bhatt et al., 2021a).", "Looking at the grave danger of these toxic pollutants, there is an urgent need to deal with the harmful impacts of these toxic pesticides. Most physical and chemical pesticide removal methods have been in use for a long time. These methods include aeration, oxidation, excavation, incineration, landfilling, and storage, etc., which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, inefficient, and are not considered a sustainable method of remediation because they result in the generation of several secondary pollutants (Yoshikawa et al., 2017; Bhatt et al., 2021a). As a result, the implementation of bioremediation appears as the only answer to the issue mentioned above since it uses the ability of live indigenous microorganisms to clean the polluted site (Singh et al., 2011). Researchers worldwide are now trying to create the most cost-effective and long-term sustainable method for pesticide bioremediation. Microbial biosurfactant-based remediation is a natural, cost-effective, and environmental friendly method of on-site degradation of pesticides and other xenobiotics in which biosurfactants make pesticides bioavailable and microbes use them as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous (Abouseoud et al., 2008; Luna et al., 2013; Chapr\u00e3o et al., 2015; Odukkathil and Vasudevan, 2016; Bhatt et al., 2021b; Lamilla et al., 2021).", "Biosurfactants are secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms used in many commercial applications due to their low toxicity, substantial biodegradability, and environmentally benign nature (Thavasi et al., 2011; Chapr\u00e3o et al., 2015; Javee et al., 2020). Biosurfactants consist of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions that are formed from amino acids, as well as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, respectively (Sharma et al., 2015; Bhatt et al., 2021b), which enables a reduction in surface tension and reaching out between two solvate molecules, thus accelerates the solvation of hydrophobic molecules in aqueous media for emulsion formation (Banat, 1995; Lamilla et al., 2021). It has been observed that hydrocarbon-contaminated areas are the best places to isolate biosurfactant-producing microorganisms to improve pesticide remediation (Singh et al., 2016; Tan and Li, 2018; Bhatt et al., 2021a; Lamilla et al., 2021). Figure 1 depicted the entry of pesticides into the food chain and the fate of pesticides and presented the mechanism of biosurfactant mediated pesticides degradation. Several published reports are available wherein biosurfactant producing potential of microbes have been utilized for bioremediation of pesticides.", "FIGURE 1(A) Shows the pesticide application in the field and its fate in the environment leading to contamination of air, water, and soil along with screening and isolation of microbes residing at the contaminated site for biosurfactant production (B) presented the mechanism of biosurfactant mediated pesticides degradation.", "(A) Shows the pesticide application in the field and its fate in the environment leading to contamination of air, water, and soil along with screening and isolation of microbes residing at the contaminated site for biosurfactant production (B) presented the mechanism of biosurfactant mediated pesticides degradation.", "Although most of the studies on bioremediation are done using single microbes (particularly culturable ones). Several reports suggest the microbial consortia enhances the remediation process compared to a single isolate (Pacwa-P\u0142ociniczak et al., 2011; Rasheed et al., 2020; Madamwar et al., 2021). While in several cases, the role of unculturable microbes is often ignored, and the underlying mechanism of microbes-mediated pesticides degradation is still unexplored (Singh and Gupta, 2018; Singh et al., 2019). The use of metagenomics to understand the underlying mechanisms of biodegradation in in-situ and to forecast degradation potential has yet to be studied. So, there is a lack of information about microbes\u2019 functional genes and genetic potential and their products like biosurfactants involved in degradation (Datta et al., 2020; Femina Carolin et al., 2020). Against this background, this article aims to give a comprehensive overview of the function of microbial biosurfactants in the remediation of pesticides. We also briefly addressed how improved metagenomics techniques might assist clean-up by providing access to uncultivable microbial species."]
