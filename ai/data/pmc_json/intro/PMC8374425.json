["Introduction", "This article is conceived as a general roadmap with the central aim of promoting and accelerating translational science in the early stages of novel antibiotic discovery towards lead candidate development. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in healthcare and agriculture, together with inappropriate waste management and environmental transmission, have led to substantially increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR)1\u20135 and associated bacterial persistence6,7. This is of major public concern, since most areas of modern medicine are inconceivable without access to effective antimicrobial treatment8. It is estimated that at least 700,000 people worldwide die each year as a result of drug-resistant infections, and this could rise to as much as 10 million by 2050 if the problem of AMR is not addressed9,10.", "The anticipated death toll caused by drug-resistant infections over the next years and decades may be compared with the global fatality rate of the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/), which has already led to multibillion-dollar investments in vaccine development, repurposing existing drugs and antiviral discovery. A perhaps overlooked aspect of concern with the COVID-19 pandemic is the high numbers of secondary infections, often associated with multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are observed especially in hospitalized patients and those with already compromised immune systems11,12. Associated with this problem is the massive use of antibiotics as a COVID-19 (co)treatment worldwide13\u201324, which is predicted to add to the ongoing emergence of AMR25\u201329. This multiplying effect of COVID-19 on the spread of bacterial resistance will most likely have further negative clinical, economic and societal consequences in the near future30,31.", "Unfortunately, the dramatic worldwide rise of bacterial pathogens resistant to antibacterial agents32 cannot be counteracted by the current low development pace of therapeutics with new mode(s) of action (MoA(s)). While there are nearly 4,000 immuno-oncology agents in development33, only about 30\u201340 new antibacterial compounds are currently in the clinical trial phases of development, and, notably, those candidates targeting World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens are derivatives of existing classes34,35. Indeed, less than 25% of current drugs in the clinical development pipeline represent a novel class or act through a novel mechanism, and none of these are potentially active against Gram-negative\u00a0ESKAPE or WHO critical threat pathogens34,36. In fact, only a small fraction of the antibiotics approved over the past 40 years represents new compound classes, while the majority were derived from already known chemical structures, and the most recent new class of antibiotics was discovered during the 1980s37.", "Thus, strategic investment in new therapeutic options to fight AMR is urgently required to address unmet patient need and, additionally, to counterbalance the exponentially increasing financial burden on global health systems38. Consequently, the research field should aim to leverage hit identification and hit-to-lead optimization programmes to ensure a sustainable flow of new antibacterial drug candidates into the development pipeline. For this purpose, the initial stages of drug discovery and development need to be strengthened, since they are essential to identify and validate novel therapeutic candidates effective to fight antibacterial resistance. However, for many years, such early-stage projects have been mainly conducted by academia and are generally underfunded, while increased allocation of funding into early-stage and mid-stage research and development (R&D) has been recommended to make the pipeline more robust39\u201342. Our network has identified major funding gaps especially within the academic sector, as well as for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where research is mainly associated with the early hit discovery and hit-to-lead phases, as well as with late lead optimization prior to preclinical candidate nomination (Fig.\u00a01). Large pharmaceutical companies across the globe are extremely hesitant to fund early antibiotic R&D and, particularly, new classes of compounds, since the return on investment in this area is generally low or even negative. Further, the costs of developing entirely new scaffolds are much higher than for derivatives of established compound classes, while the attrition rate in antibacterial drug discovery has been particularly high in the recent decades, reflected by the fact that no new class of Gram-negative antibiotics has been launched for more than 50 years43,44. In the commercial sector, innovation has, thus, been left to SMEs, which must deal with high attrition associated with the early phases of discovery and optimization39,43,45\u201348, and the huge capital risks49,50.Fig. 1General scheme of antimicrobial drug development.Large funding gaps can be seen in the early stages of hit discovery, as well as during hit and lead optimization, which are associated mainly with academic research and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

A recent initiative that supports SMEs in the late-stage development of new antibiotics is the AMR Action Fund, which was launched by more than 20 leading biopharmaceutical companies to push mainly phase II and III trials of advanced candidates55. Unfortunately, the fund does not cater for the early stages of research. In addition, several countries are implementing new\u00a0pull incentive programmes with different priorities. While the Swedish model aims at securing sustained access to relevant antibiotics that have already been approved56, plans in the UK57,58 as well as in the USA (e.g. PASTEUR59 and DISARM60 acts) strive to stimulate the development of new antibacterial products by using\u00a0subscription models or delinkage models51. Such initiatives are promising, as they introduce much-needed market entry rewards, but they might fall short on a global scale if they do not include the \u2018critical mass\u2019 of the world\u2019s largest economies.", "Innovation in the early stages of antibiotic drug discovery can also be driven by the academic sector. However, from the academic perspective, partnering with external funders such as the pharmaceutical industry is, in many cases, only realistic after the nomination of extensively validated preclinical candidates, and often even requires phase I clinical data. Typically, this cannot be achieved by research-driven funding and infrastructure alone. Several global health organizations and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), including the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X), Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and others, started to support, at least partially, the mid-to-late lead optimization through to clinical proof of concept61\u201363, possibly accompanied by stakeholders associated with the Biotech companies in Europe combating AntiMicrobial resistance (BEAM) Alliance or the Replenishing and Enabling the Pipeline for Anti-Infective Resistance (REPAIR) Impact Fund64,65. However, even the growing diversity of such push incentives are, in many cases, insufficient and primarily focused on companies. In addition to these approaches, a strategy is required that helps academic researchers to advance their project portfolio to a level that facilitates early interaction and possibly partnering with pharmaceutical companies in the interest of a successful, cross-sectoral development pipeline66. Hence, creating new incentive models in the field is an essential process that can only be moved forward if the public, academic and industrial sectors join forces39,67\u201369.", "In this respect, our position paper provides an overview of the early phases of antibacterial drug discovery, including hit and lead identification, optimization and development to the (pre)clinical stages by summarizing current limitations, relevant approaches and future perspectives, as well as by presenting selected case studies. In terms of a principal guidance for researchers in the field, we suggest possible solutions for a number of obstacles to improve both quality and quantity of antibacterial hits and leads. To strengthen and emphasize these early stages as an absolute necessity for a sustained generation of novel antibiotics, we are recommending a new level of interaction between the various stakeholders and academic disciplines in the area of antibiotic drug research. The strengths and opportunities that small-molecule therapeutics offer can help address antibiotic resistance more successfully during the coming years, in the interests of both patients and investors, provided that the multiplicity of hurdles along the translational path will be overcome (Table\u00a01). Altogether, our aims are in line with the \u2018One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance\u2019 introduced by the European Commission70, as well as the WHO programme to fight the rising number of bacterial priority pathogens with steadily growing impact on global public health71.Table 1SWOT (strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis summarizing a path forward in the development of novel antibiotic drugsStrengthsWeaknesses (current limitations)Opportunities (possible solutions)ThreatsSuccessful clinical proof of concept for antibiotics over ~100 yearsCritical need for intensive care unitsNovel antibiotics are last resort against MDR pathogensKnowledge and technologies for antibiotic R&D established and steadily advancingHigh chance of finding new antibiotic classes due to largely underexplored biodiversityLarge and increasingly diverse chemical libraries available for screeningIncreasingly large and diverse online databases on antibiotic compounds, targets and resistance genes availablePredictive models available (via integrative chem-bioinformatics, for example PBPK modelling)Loss of efficacy controllable by antibiotic stewardshipIncreasing public awareness of AMR demands for and facilitates national and transnational solutionsUnavoidable resistance development with classic antibioticsUse of antibiotics in agriculture and aquaculture not globally regulatedPaucity of novel antibiotic classes against Gram-negative priority pathogensLack of innovative assays for hit discoveryCapacities in academia (MedChem, PK/PD etc.) insufficient for R&D project expansionHigh attrition rates until market entry, especially in the early stages of discovery and optimizationHigh capital risk and negative ROI mainly for industrial sectorNew incentives (push and pull factors) to attract industrial stakeholders:1.
