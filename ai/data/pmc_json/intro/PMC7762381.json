["1. Introduction", "Plant pathogens cause significant economic losses every year, thus driving continuous research and development for novel and effective disease control strategies to ensure grain yield and food security. Sugarcane is an important economic crop in the South China area as well as other tropical or subtropical regions. Sugarcane smut disease caused by S. scitamineum, belonging to smut fungi, the largest group of plant pathogens, is a major constraint in sugarcane production [1]. Traditionally used fungicides face a severe challenge in maintaining the efficiency and environmental impact in controlling the major phytopathogenic fungi. Application of such fungicides has limited effect on sugarcane smut as the chemicals find it difficult to penetrate the waxy coat of the sugarcane stem, within which the dikaryotic hyphae of S. scitamineum thrive systemically prior to the development of visible disease lesions/symptoms [2]. Thus, biocontrol is a relatively safe alternative compared with traditional chemical control. Endophytes and/or phyllosphere-associated microbes are the main source of potential biocontrol agents [3,4]. Such endophytic bacteria generally colonize the intercellular spaces of plant tissues and can be isolated from all compartments of the plant host including the seeds [5]. These are usually symbiotic, parasitic, promotive, or pathogenic within the host plants. Endophytes have been reported as plant probiotics, with functions including nitrogen-fixation, yield increase, phytohormone production, biocontrol of plant diseases [6], and degradation of pollutants [6,7]. Increasing examples have been reported of endophytes functioning as biocontrol agents in disease management programs in crops [8,9,10].", "Twenty-one genera of endophytic bacterial isolates have been reported from sugarcane tissues, with Bacillus, Burkholderia, Enterobacter and Pantoea being the dominant genera [11,12]. Several Burkholderia species can form either antagonistic or mutualistic interactions with fungi [13] and have also been reported as biocontrol agents, mainly based on their ability to secrete small antimicrobial compounds, including toxoflavin, chitinases, tropolone, pyrrolnitrin, etc. [13,14]. Thus far, there have been no reports about the interactions between Burkholderia species and sugarcane, or with a fungal pathogen(s) affecting sugarcane cultivation. In this study, we isolated and identified a novel B. gladioli strain, named CGB10, from sugarcane leaves. CGB10 was able to suppress the filamentous growth of several pathogenic fungi including S. scitamineum. CGB10 was tested as a biocontrol agent in a field trial and showed ideal effects in controlling sugarcane smut. Toxoflavin was identified as a secreted molecule from CGB10 and is likely responsible for the antifungal activity shown by CGB10. Correspondingly, toxoflavin biosynthesis and transport gene clusters were identified in the CGB10 genome. A quorum-sensing cluster was also predicted, as a potential regulator of toxoflavin production and/or transport. In summary, our study identified a potential biocontrol bacterial species for application in controlling sugarcane smut and proposed its beneficial mechanism(s) based on genomic and metabolite analyses and molecular characterization."]
