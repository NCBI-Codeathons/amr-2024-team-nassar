["Introduction", "The plant is an attractive versatile home for diverse microbes that can colonize internal plant tissues (endophytes), live on the surface (epiphytes) or in the soil surrounding the root system (rhizosphere microbiota) (Barea et al., 2005; Johnston-Monje and Raizada, 2011). Plant associated microbes have the potential to be used as biocontrol, the use of living organisms to suppress crop disease (Eilenberg, 2006) through various mechanisms including the production of antibiotics (Compant et al., 2005). Diverse classes of antimicrobial secondary metabolites of microbial origin have been reported (Mousa and Raizada, 2013), including polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, terpenoids, heterocylic nitrogenous compounds, volatile compounds, bacteriocins as well as lytic enzymes. Polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides constitute the majority of microbial derived natural products (Cane, 1997). Interestingly, the tremendous structural diversity of antimicrobial secondary metabolites originated via limited metabolic pathways utilizing few primary metabolites as precursors (Keller et al., 2005). Underlying the diversification of antimicrobial metabolites must have been a corresponding genetic diversification of ancestral genes driven by co-evolutionary pressures (Vining, 1992).", "The revolution in genomics, genome mining tools and bioinformatics offers a new opportunity to connect biochemical diversity to the underlying genetic diversity and to analyze the evolutionary events leading to biodiversity (Zotchev et al., 2012; Scheffler et al., 2013; Deane and Mitchell, 2014).", "The scope of this review is to describe the biodiversity of biosynthetic coding sequences (CDS) of plant-associated microbes (bacteria and fungi) that encode selected examples of antimicrobial secondary metabolites and lytic enzymes. For each example, the target pathogen(s) and mode of action are described where known, in order to highlight the diversity of biochemical targets. Out of necessity, the review focuses on compounds for which in depth molecular analysis has been conducted. We review data pertaining to the underlying molecular diversity and highlight comparative genomic data of the orthologous genes. The review concludes with a discussion of common themes and gaps in the literature, and discusses the role of evolution in the diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters including horizontal gene transfer (HGT)."]
