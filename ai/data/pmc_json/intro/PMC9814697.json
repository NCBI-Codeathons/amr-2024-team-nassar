["Introduction", "Nucleoside antibiotics are a group of natural products which specifically inhibit phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase (MraY), an essential enzyme involved in the bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis1. Up to date, no any antibiotics that inhibit MraY have been approved for clinical use, underscoring that MraY and nucleoside antibiotics respectively are drug target and drug candidate in pair as an ideal strategy to conquer antibiotic drug resistance2. The pathway elucidation for potent nucleoside antibiotics has been a research hot spot3. Two approaches are generally employed in the field, namely, in vivo and in vitro approaches. Both are not exclusive but complementary to each other. Noticeably, collecting and purifying hydrophilic intermediates from given mutants are tedious and challenging4. On top of that, no known substrates or substrates unavailability are another difficulty in in-vitro study. These limitations considerably hamper the progress of biosynthetic pathway illustration of natural products. To unravel these shackles, an integrated approach by combining in vivo, in vitro, synthetic chemistry and computational chemistry is emerging that has been proven powerful5.", "Nucleoside antibiotics, such as FR-900493 (1), caprazamycin (2), liposidomycin (3), sphaerimicin (4), and muraminomicin (5) (Fig.\u00a01), all feature a uridine moiety in addition to an unusual 5\u2032\u2032-amino-5\u2032\u2032-deoxyribose (ADR). In view of structures, nucleoside antibiotics can be subdivided into two groups: the lipid I transition-like subgroup e.g. compounds 2\u20135 and the Park\u2019s nucleotide subgroup e.g. compounds 6 and 7. The uridine moiety is coupled with a short-chain amino acid to form an ADR-GlyU (5\u2032-C-glycyluridine) core the drug warhead, which can be attached with a 6\u2032-N-alkylamine side chain. This alkylamine is hydroxylated at its \u03b2-position (\u03b2-OH) for the biosynthesis toward the lipid I transition-like subgroup6,7. On the other hand, the decarboxylation of the 6\u2032-N-alkylamine side chain is pivotal toward the biosynthesis of the Park\u2019s nucleotide subgroup (see below). FR-900493 (1) acts as a rudimentary structure, where the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core is associated with an aminopropyl group and a methyl group at the glycine portion. By contrast, caprazamycin (2) includes a characteristic seven-membered diazepanone ring with two methyl groups each at one of two ring-nitrogen atoms (caprazol 8); this heterocyclic ring is decorated with a long lipid side chain at the \u03b2-OH, to which 3-methyl glutaric acid and 2,3,4-O-methyl-L-rhamnose are appended8\u201311.Fig. 1Chemical structures of representative MraY inhibitors.Nucleoside antibiotics are composed of some characteristic moieties: uridine colored red, 5\u2033-amino-5\u2033-deoxyribose (ADR) colored green, the glycine moiety colored blue and the \u03b2-hydroxyl group colored orange.

However, the enzyme that commits the \u03b2-hydroxylation remains elusive. In view of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of lipo-nucleoside antibiotics caprazamycin (2) and liposidomycin (A-90289) (3), each individual BGC contains two \u03b1KG-dependent monooxygenases Cpz10,15 and LipG,L13,14, the potential candidates. Nonheme iron-dependent enzymes play crucial roles in the diversification of secondary metabolites15. This type of enzymes exists across all domains of lives and has been studied extensively, for example, dopamine hydroxylase, deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) and taurine dioxygenase (TauD)16\u201318. These enzymes utilize a high-spin iron (FeII) to activate dioxygen into a reactive FeIV-oxo species at the expense of one molecule of \u03b1KG to oxygenate/oxidize/rearrange a wide variety of organic compounds17,19. The active site is located within a core \u03b2-barrel domain in this class of enzymes16. Here we report that Cpz15 is the starter enzyme; Cpz10 is the \u03b2-hydroxylase recruiting an additional auxiliary iron to bring its activity into full play; Cpz27 is a phosphotransferase, alongside biochemical functionalities of Cpz13, 14 and Mur23. Our in vivo and in vitro results suggest that the phosphorylation at the 3\u2033-OH takes place after glycosylation, methylation and alkylation at odds with the previously proposed scenario4,20."]
