["Introduction", "Epithelial surfaces are typically the initial point of contact between metazoans and microbes (Brown and Clarke, 2017). As such, host factors at this barrier play an important role in facilitating or deterring microbial colonization. Bacterial attachment to epithelial surfaces is often mediated by a broad class of surface proteins termed adhesins (Kline et al., 2009). In addition to permitting the growth and colonization of commensal microbes, adhesins are also key virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. Adhesin-mediated adherence to host cells is often required for other downstream processes including biofilm formation, epithelial invasion, and the delivery of toxic effectors into host cells (Kline et al., 2009; Sadarangani et al., 2011; Figure 1). Microbial adherence can also trigger epithelial cell signaling cascades, further shaping host responses to resident and invasive microbes. Despite the fundamental importance of epithelial adherence for bacterial colonization and infectious disease pathogenesis, the dynamics of these interactions between host surface proteins and bacterial adhesions over evolutionary timescales remain a mystery. Theory predicts that exploitation of host proteins by pathogens places a significant burden on host populations, driving selection for beneficial mutations that limit microbial invasion or virulence. From a microbial perspective, host defenses can also pose an existential threat resulting in reciprocal adaptation to enhance colonization, growth, and transmission (Aleru and Barber, 2020; Brockhurst et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 1990; Van Valen, 1973). However, pathogens hijack many host factors not directly involved in immunity, possibly limiting their adaptive potential in response to pathogen interaction. For example, epithelial surface proteins are not only essential for interacting with the environment but also serve crucial cellular and physiological functions including barrier maintenance, cell-cell communication, as well as coordinating host physiological and developmental pathways (Kuespert et al., 2006). It therefore remains unclear the extent to which such proteins are able to adapt in the face of pathogen antagonism.", "Figure 1.Interactions between epithelial carcinoembryonic antigen-associated cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and bacterial adhesins.Bacterial attachment to host cells via adhesin proteins (purple) facilitates epithelial adherence. Adhesins also contribute to pathogenicity by promoting invasion, modulation of host cell signaling pathways, and by promoting the delivery of virulence factors into the host cell cytoplasm.", "Interactions between epithelial carcinoembryonic antigen-associated cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and bacterial adhesins.", "Bacterial attachment to host cells via adhesin proteins (purple) facilitates epithelial adherence. Adhesins also contribute to pathogenicity by promoting invasion, modulation of host cell signaling pathways, and by promoting the delivery of virulence factors into the host cell cytoplasm.", "Bacterial adhesins interact with a wide range of molecules present on host epithelial surfaces (Chatterjee et al., 2021). One important target of bacterial adhesins on vertebrate epithelia are the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family of proteins (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006). There have been multiple independent expansions of this gene family across mammals (Kammerer and Zimmermann, 2010; Pavlopoulou and Scorilas, 2014) and the human genome encodes 12 functional CEACAM genes as well as several pseudogenes (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006; Kammerer and Zimmermann, 2010). Collectively, CEACAMs are expressed on nearly all vertebrate epithelial surfaces including the microbe-rich surfaces of the urogenital, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts (Tchoupa et al., 2014). Epithelial CEACAMs play a variety of roles in cell adhesion as well as intra- and intercellular signaling (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006; Kuespert et al., 2006; Tchoupa et al., 2014). A subset of CEACAMs are also expressed on other cell types, including T-cells and neutrophils where they play important roles in immune signaling and pathogen recognition. CEACAMs typically consist of an extracellular N-terminal IgV-like domain (also termed the N-domain), a variable number of IgC-like domains, and either a GPI anchor or a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The characteristics of this cytoplasmic domain in turn influences the functional properties of CEACAM proteins. Extracellular protein-protein interactions involving CEACAMs have been shown to primarily occur through the extracellular N-domain (Kuespert et al., 2007; Markel et al., 2004).", "While the functions of many CEACAM proteins remain obscure, mammalian CEACAM1, CEACAM5 (also known as CEA), and CEACAM6 have been shown to contribute to immunoregulation, cell-cycle progression, and development (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006; Kuespert et al., 2006; Tchoupa et al., 2014). These CEACAMs, along with CEACAM3, are also notable as recurrent targets of bacterial adhesins (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006; Tchoupa et al., 2014). A growing number of bacterial genera have been found to target these CEACAM proteins to promote epithelial adherence and host colonization, including Neisseria, Haemophilus, Escherichia, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, and Helicobacter (Brewer et al., 2019; Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006; Javaheri et al., 2016; K\u00f6niger et al., 2016; van Sorge et al., 2021). Additionally, several viruses have been reported to bind CEACAMs, including human cytomegalovirus, influenza A, murine coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Chan et al., 2016; Hemmila et al., 2004; Macmaniman et al., 2014; Rahman et al., 2021). While many of the bacteria reported to target CEACAMs are able to colonize the host as benign commensals, they are also capable of causing serious infection especially in young children. Such infections may prove severely detrimental to host fitness even when not fatal.", "Among bacteria, a number of structurally unrelated CEACAM-binding adhesin proteins have been described. This diversity of structures suggests that CEACAM recognition has arisen independently multiple times during bacterial evolution. These structurally diverse proteins include the integral outer membrane Opa proteins in Neisseria (Fox et al., 2014), the immunoglobulin-type \u03b2 protein from group B Streptococcus (van Sorge et al., 2021), as well as other trimeric and globular protein domains (Bonsor et al., 2018; Conners et al., 2008).", "Bacterial CEACAM recognition can lead to several distinct outcomes (Figure 1). First, adherence to epithelial CEACAMs can provide a stable habitat to support bacterial growth and proliferation. In mice, for example, expression of human CEACAM1 is sufficient to establish stable colonization by otherwise human-restricted strains of Neisseria meningitidis (Johswich et al., 2013). Second, CEACAM binding may facilitate bacterial dissemination through the host epithelium (Wang et al., 1998). Third, in the case of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, CEACAM-adhesin interactions promote the translocation of virulence factors into host cells via the type 4 secretion system leading to severe gastritis and stomach ulcers in humans (Javaheri et al., 2016; K\u00f6niger et al., 2016). Finally, bacterial adhesins can potentiate CEACAM-mediated signaling cascades to manipulate cellular functions, including preventing immune cell activation (Gur et al., 2019a; Gur et al., 2019b; Sadarangani et al., 2011), increasing cellular adhesion to prevent shedding of infected cells (Muenzner et al., 2016; Muenzner et al., 2010), and activation of apoptosis (N\u2019Guessan et al., 2007). Interactions between adhesins and CEACAMs, particularly bacterial immunoglobulins that appear to mimic CEACAMs, are predicted to further disrupt endogenous CEACAM adhesion and signaling functions (Macmaniman et al., 2014; Moonens, 2018; van Sorge et al., 2021).", "Previous work has reported multiple instances of gene gain and loss as well as high levels of sequence divergence among a subset of CEACAM genes (Adrian et al., 2019; Rhesus Macaque Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium et al., 2007; Kammerer and Zimmermann, 2010; Pavlopoulou and Scorilas, 2014). These findings, coupled with the observation that many CEACAM-binding bacteria possess a narrow host range, suggest that host genetic variation may be a major determinant of bacterial colonization. In the case of CEACAM3, which is expressed exclusively in neutrophils and aids in destruction of CEACAM-binding bacteria, there is compelling evidence that residues at the interface of adhesin binding are evolving rapidly in a manner consistent with positive selection (Adrian et al., 2019). Unlike many other characterized mammalian CEACAMs, CEACAM3 appears to be a dedicated immune protein acting as a decoy receptor for CEACAM targeting bacteria (Bonsignore et al., 2019). The evolution of epithelial CEACAMs not dedicated to immune defense and the consequences of their evolution for microbial interactions remains unclear."]
