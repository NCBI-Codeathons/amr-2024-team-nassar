["1. Introduction", "Although glaciers are generally thought to only appear in cold environments, glaciers also exist in equatorial Africa, such as on Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mt. Kenya in Kenya, and the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda [1,2]. Among them, those in the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda are expected to disappear soon. However, research on this region is insufficient [3]. Tropical mountain environments face the imminent threat of disappearing due to climate warming, reduced humidity, and diminished cloud cover. The ongoing global warming trend suggests that these regions will experience substantial damage, second only to the Arctic, as the Earth\u2019s climate continues to warm [4]. Thus, continued interest in tropical mountain environments and research about their ecosystems, such as restoration mechanisms, are needed to reduce damage.", "Although glacier regions have sub-zero temperatures and harsh environments, they are home to several microbes that are significant sources of cold-adapted microorganisms [5]. Microorganisms isolated from extreme environments can adapt to and thrive in various environmental conditions, including freeze\u2013thaw cycles, nutrient limitations, high salinity, and low temperatures [6]. Isolating microorganisms from extreme environments can offer valuable insights into their unique genomic characteristics, ability to produce various cold-adapted enzymes, and genetic adaptability. At lower temperatures in environments such as the Arctic and Antarctic, oxygen solubility increases, leading to higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the resulting oxidative stress. While bacterial adjustment pathways involving the production of ROS have been recognized, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathways and alternative metabolic pathways in cold environments remain incompletely understood [7]. Cold-adapted microorganisms contain significant amounts of polysaccharides such as glycogen, trehalose, and maltodextrin as essential carbohydrates. Bacteria with complete metabolic pathways have demonstrated their ability to conserve and efficiently utilize energy in these conditions. Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) might also play a crucial role in the survival of microorganisms at freezing temperatures [8].", "A comparative genomic analysis based on genome data of available bacteria strains could reveal common species characteristics of large populations and the physiological characteristics of bacteria. Moreover, some research studies on the characteristics of related bacteria have proven that unique functional genes might be acquired from each natural environment and enhance their potential applications, such as in bioremediation, biomedical, and healthcare contexts [9]. The Subtercola genus, a member of the family Microbacteriaceae, belongs to the phylum Actinomycetota. The use of Subtercola boreus strain DSM13056T as a new psychrophilic actinobacterium isolated from groundwater was first mentioned in 2000 [10]. Subtercola species isolated from cold environments such as high-altitude extreme cold environmental niches, including snowy mountains [11], cold volcano lakes [12], glacier cryoconite [13], and plants from cold environments [14], have been reported. In addition, through sequence similarity analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomics analysis (more than 96%), it is possible to identify species related to the Subtercola genus in cold environments, such as the cold habitats of Antarctic and Arctic Oceans. These results show indication of a species of Psychrophiles [15,16,17]. Currently, various researchers have performed systematic research on cold environments in mid-latitudes and polar areas such as the Arctic and Antarctic, and some results have been obtained through the study of the cold environment [8]. The Subtercola genus is still considered new. So far, few studies have performed comparative genomic analysis of this genus. Subtercola species are a relatively established genus within the family Microbacteriaceae. It currently contains five recognized members: S. boreus, S. frigoramans, S. lobariae, S. vilae, and S. endophyticus. Genome sequences of 16 strains belonging to the Subtercola species have been registered in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Moreover, Jiang et al. [14] recently discovered a new species within the Subtercola genus. Strain PAMC28395 was obtained from a glacier located in the Rwenzori Mountains, and this study presents the complete genome sequence of this strain. A comparative genomic analysis was conducted using complete genome data in the NCBI database to gain insights into its characteristics within the Subtercola genus. This analysis helped predict gene functions and provided a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which PAMC28395 adapts to its natural environment, uncovering emerging evolutionary characteristics. This study\u2019s comprehensive examination of complete genomes offers valuable insights into the evolution and genetic composition of various strains and species inhabiting cold environments."]
