["INTRODUCTION", "Anthracyclines are part of the polyketide type II family and are an important group of natural compounds produced by actinobacteria. The basic structure contains an aglycone skeleton and 6-deoxyhexose moieties, biosynthetically derived from glucose-1-phosphate. The two anthracyclines reported first were isolated from the pigment producer Streptomyces peucetius and were named doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DNR) (1). Anthracyclines are clinically important compounds and are widely used to date for the treatment of different cancers, such as breast cancer, lymphomas, acute leukemia, neuroblastomas, and bone and soft tissue sarcomas (2\u20134). Streptomyces olindensis strain DAUFPE 5622 produces a purple-pigmented anthracycline with both antimicrobial activity (e.g., a MIC of 0.01\u2009\u03bcg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 29213) and antitumoral activity (e.g., a 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 0.110\u2009\u03bcg/mL against the HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line) (5). Structural studies determined that the molecule, called cosmomycin D (COSD), is an aromatic complex with two trisaccharide chains attached at positions C-7 and C-10 on the aglycone (5, 6). Cosmomycins are an interesting group of compounds because they show one of the most complex glycosylation patterns found in anthracyclines, with position C-10 less frequently glycosylated than position C-7 (7).", "Antitumor-antibiotic-producing microorganisms must be protected from the lethal effects of their own products. The ability inherent in the producer organisms is called self-resistance. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria and self-resistance mechanisms of antitumor-antibiotic-producing microorganisms is important to develop therapeutic drugs for the treatment of infectious diseases (8, 9). Antibiotic-producing microorganisms have a system that leads to transcription of the antibiotic-biosynthesizing genes at an appropriate time. To act effectively for self-resistance to its own antibiotic, antibiotic-modifying enzymes, target-protecting enzymes, antibiotic excretion systems, or DNA repair mechanisms must be present in the producer organisms when the biosynthetic pathway begins to produce the antibiotic (9\u201311).", "The resistance mechanisms found in some anthracycline producers, such as S. peucetius, occur by the action of DrrA and DrrB, members of the ABC family of membrane transporters, which influence the efflux of DOX and DNR by the formation of an ABC transporter complex comprised of an ATPase and a transmembrane protein (10, 12\u201314). The second mechanism involves an inhibition or destabilization of the binding of DOX and DNR to genomic DNA by the action of the gene product of drrC, which codes for a protein with similarity to bacterial UvrA (10, 13\u201315).", "In comparison with other anthracyclines, COSD exhibits a high toxicity (16), which leads to the hypothesis that this strain must possess additional or optimized self-resistance strategies. In the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), we identified a gene encoding a mycothiol peroxidase (MPx) inside the cosmomycin cluster, adjacent to other resistance genes that were very similar to those reported in other actinobacteria that use the low-molecular-weight thiol mycothiol (MSH) (17). MPx is a thiol peroxidase that belongs to the cysteine glutathione peroxidase (CysGPx)-like enzyme family, having the S-mycothiolation of the MPx as part of its H2O2 catalytic mechanism involved in controlling the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (17). There are two MPx paralog genes in the S. olindensis genome, while other species, such as Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces avermitilis, have only one MPx.", "We observed for the first time that MPx can reduce a cysteine\u2013MSH mixed disulfide, using a dithiol disulfide exchange mechanism, during the biosynthesis of COSD. Purification and identification of the MPx protein provided evidence that ROS-detoxifying proteins are employed by anthracycline producers. We describe in this study three self-resistance mechanisms against COSD in S. olindensis. The genes cosI and cosJ encode the first mechanism, an ABC transporter efflux system, while the second mechanism, encoded by cosU, is similar to drrC of S. peucetius and UvrA class IIa homologue proteins. Finally, a novel third mechanism, a mycothiol peroxidase (MPx) encoded by cosP, is involved in the detoxification of H2O2."]
