["Introduction", "The gut microbiota develops in the first years after birth, modulated strongly by the exposure to different dietary sources, antibiotics, and microbes from the environment (Tamburini et al., 2016). The exposure to antibiotics disturbs the development of microbiota throughout the first year of life, indicated by compositional deviations which are depending on the duration and type of antibiotic (Van Daele et al., 2022). A single course of 5\u20138\u2009days of amoxicillin in infants (average age of 4\u2009months) caused a long-term disruption for at least 6\u2009months while recovering to a community characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of clostridia and a decrease in the relative abundance of bifidobacteria (Korpela et al., 2020). Most studies have only focused on amoxicillin (\u03b2-lactam antibiotic), whereas the use of a combination of amoxicillin and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate, another commonly prescribed antibiotic in infants, showed a different pattern of microbiota changes compared to amoxicillin (Korpela et al., 2020). Moreover, the exposure to amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate in the gut might increase the risk of being colonized by antimicrobial resistant bacteria (Korpela et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022).", "Antibiotic exposure in early life is associated with an altered immune development and increased risk of infantile colic, wheezing, and overweight later in life (Saari et al., 2015; Korpela et al., 2017; Oosterloo et al., 2018, 2020); the antibiotic-induced perturbations in the development of gut microbiota are hypothesized to mediate this relation. As defined by Carvalho et al., antibiotic resilience is the capacity to recover from antibiotic exposure, while in practice this depends on which microbial system is considered, the disturbance applied (type, frequency, duration, and concentration of antibiotic), and the metric used to measure resilience (Carvalho et al., 1916). Strategies to recover the disturbed microbiota are needed to minimize antibiotic impact on both microbiota and immune development.", "In the preweaning period, the gut of infants is exposed to nondigestible carbohydrates derived from the milk diet (human milk or fortified infant formula) that act as prebiotics. Prebiotics are defined as compounds that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit to the host, with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) fitting this definition as infant prebiotics (Gibson et al., 2017). GOS are produced from lactose using \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme, resulting in a mixture varying in the degree of polymerization mainly between 2 and 8 with a terminal glucose and the remaining saccharide units being galactose, with differences in the linkages between monomers (Torres et al., 2010). On the other hand, HMOs are highly abundant and unique unconjugated complex carbohydrates in human milk, consisting of lactose at the reducing end, and composed of up to five different monosaccharide building blocks, including galactose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and sialic acid (Bode, 2012). One of the most abundant HMOs, 2\u2032-fucosyllactose (2\u2019-FL), is present in high concentration in the milk of over 70% of Caucasian women who actively express fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), also referred to as secretor mothers (Bode, 2015).", "The supplementation of 2\u2019-FL in infant formula has been shown to lower the abundance of opportunistic pathogens, stimulate the abundance of bifidobacteria, and support immune development to be more similar to that in breastfed infants (Goehring et al., 2016; Alliet et al., 2022). The supplementation of GOS in infant formula has been shown to stimulate bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, decrease fecal pH, increase the frequency of defecation, and soften the stools (Ben et al., 2008; Fanaro et al., 2009; Sierra et al., 2015). In adults receiving amoxicillin, the intake of GOS supported the recovery of bifidobacteria in in vitro and in vivo studies (Ladirat et al., 2014a,b), but this deserves further study in infants.", "The use of controlled in vitro gut models offers a promising approach to investigate how a community responds to a disturbance in early life. A controlled gut fermentation system has been successfully used to simulate the growth of the infant gut microbiota and to investigate the effect of pharmaceuticals and diet-derived compounds during infancy (Le Blay et al., 2010; Wiese et al., 2018; Salli et al., 2019; Van den Abbeele et al., 2021; Natividad et al., 2022). A dynamic in vitro gut model (TIM-2) has been used to evaluate the effect of probiotics and antibiotics on healthy adult gut microbiota (Rehman et al., 2012), thus providing opportunities to conduct similar studies on infant gut microbiota.", "The current study was conducted to study the resilience of the infant gut microbiota structure and activity in response to amoxicillin/clavulanate treatment, in the absence and presence of prebiotics, 2\u2019-FL, or GOS."]
