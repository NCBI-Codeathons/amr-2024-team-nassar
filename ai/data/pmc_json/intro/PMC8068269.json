["1. Introduction", "Actinomycetes are an extremely diverse group of Gram-positive, filamentous bacteria with high GC content genomes [1] considered as one of the most prolific sources for the discovery of new natural products (NPs) [2,3]. Among all the actinomycetes, the genus Streptomyces produces over 70\u201380% of the secondary metabolites with described therapeutic properties [4].", "The increasing number of sequenced genomes has revealed that actinomycetes carry the genetic potential to produce many more secondary metabolites than those detected under laboratory conditions [5]. The development of bioinformatic tools to identify the presence of new secondary metabolite Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) from genome sequences, such as antiSMASH [6] or MIBiG [7], among others [8], has permitted the development of targeted genome mining strategies directed at variants of specific families of compounds [9]. Among them, Ribosomally synthesized and Post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs) show more structural diversity than initially predicted from genome sequences [10]. Most RiPPs are synthesized as a longer precursor peptide, containing a C-terminal core peptide that undergoes a broad diversity of Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) directed by the N-terminal leader peptide [11].", "We have recently described the discovery of cacaoidin, a novel glycosylated lantibiotic produced by the strain Streptomyces cacaoi CA-170360 [12]. Cacaoidin represents the first reported member of lanthidins, also known as the new class V lanthipeptides, exhibiting remarkable structural features, such as a lanthionine ring and N-terminal dimethylation, restricted thus far to lanthipeptide [13] and linaridin [14,15,16] RiPP families, respectively, in an unprecedented N,N-dimethyl lanthionine system (NMe2Lan) [12] (Figure 1). In addition, cacaoidin contains several PTMs, some of them shared with other lanthipeptides, such as a C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl-3-methyl]-d-cysteine (AviMeCys) amino acid. AviMeCys is formed in lanthipeptides through an oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal cysteine by LanD and the resulting reactive thio\u2013enol intermediate cyclises with a Dhb residue, yielding AviMeCys [17]. This differs from the AviCys formation in linaridins [18], which occurs between two cysteine residues and is catalyzed by LinD [19]. The co-existing structural features restricted to lanthipeptides and linaridins have supported the proposal of cacaoidin as the first reported member of the lanthidins [12]. Cacaoidin also presents other unusual structural features, such as a high number of d-amino acids and an O-glycosylated tyrosine residue carrying a non-previously reported disaccharide formed by \u03b1-l-rhamnose and \u03b2-l-6-deoxygulose [12].", "Shortly after the discovery of cacaoidin, Xu et al. [20] described the novel RiPP lexapeptide as the first member of the new class V lanthipeptide. Lexapeptide is structurally similar to cacaoidin since it contains an N-terminal N,N-dimethylation, a C-terminal AviMeCys moiety and a d-Ala. According to this, and to the new RiPP classification established in a recent review [21], cacaoidin is the founding member of the class V lanthipeptides, firstly reported by our group as lanthidins.", "In this work, we present the identification and analysis of the cacaoidin BGC from the genome analysis of Streptomyces cacaoi CA-170360, showing its distinct gene cluster organization. We show that the BGC proposed contains all the genes required for cacaoidin biosynthesis that was successfully produced via heterologous expression. To our knowledge, this is the first class V lanthipeptide to be heterologously produced. We also describe that the cacaoidin BGC is a species-specific trait within the genus Streptomyces and identify the presence of other class V lanthipeptide pathways in public genome databases."]
