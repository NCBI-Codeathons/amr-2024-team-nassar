["1. Introduction", "Mycotoxins are considered among the most frequent toxic contaminants of several types of food and feed all over the world [1]. They are produced by several species of toxigenic fungi under certain environmental conditions, which differ between the fungal species [2]. Among these toxins, fumonisins (FBs) and aflatoxins (AFs) are dominant mycotoxins in maize and maize-based foods [3]. The fungal plant pathogens Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum are known to produce FBs [4,5,6], while Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are among the major producers of AFs [7]. The natural occurrence of these toxins has been recorded at significant concentrations in almost all the countries in the world [1,4]. The FB\u2019s family consists of numerous members, however, (fumonisin B1) FB1 is the most important one as it is the most common and toxic member of FBs [8,9]. Similarly, (aflatoxin B1) AFB1 is the most toxic to humans and prevalent member of the AF family in the agricultural commodities [10,11,12].", "Recently, the toxicity of FB1 has aroused widespread public concern [13]. Several studies have shown that FB1 can pose many toxic effects (neurotoxic, hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic) in humans [9,14,15]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified FB1 as group 2B (possible carcinogenic to humans), since there is no direct established causal association between FB1 exposure and cancer in humans (IARC, 2002). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of 2 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day for FBs [16]. As reported, the toxic effect of FB1 is more than 20 \u03bcg/mL in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells [17,18]. Several studies showed that the toxic properties of FB1 include profound cytotoxic effects such as increased lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative DNA damage [9,19,20,21,22]. Intracellular ROS accumulation was induced by FB1 through inhibition of the complex I of the electron transport chain [23]. As a result, it can cause a reduction in the rate of mitochondrial and cellular respirations and an increase in ROS generation in primary rat astrocytes and human neuroblastoma cells [24,25,26,27].", "AFB1 has hepatotoxic, immunotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic properties [28]. Strong evidence linking AFB1 consumption with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence has led the IARC to classify this mycotoxin as a Group I carcinogen for humans (IARC 2012). The PMTDI of 1 ng AF/Kg body weight (bw)/day may be used as a guidance value in the risk assessment of AF from food [16]. Moreover, most of the conducted research reported that the toxicity of AFB1 in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells occurs at a dose of 3.0 \u03bcg/mL [29,30]. AFB1 has been found to induce oxidative radical formation through the cytochrome-activated P450 enzyme system, generating lipid peroxidation and reducing antioxidant enzyme activity [31], resulting in the carcinogenicity. These radicals may induce pathologies by damaging lipids, proteins and DNA [32]. Previously, AFB1 has been reported to induce ROS generation and cause oxidative damage [33]. Induced ROS can cause unstable mitochondrial membrane potential [34]. Indeed, some papers describe that AFB1 can induce cell apoptosis mainly through mitochondria-associated pathways and also impair mitochondrial functions [35,36].", "In this study, we aim to further explore the more subtle effects of FB1 and AFB1 on key metabolic processes at subtoxic concentrations to model the impact of low-dose, and hence, more human-relevant, exposure to mycotoxins. To this end, undifferentiated Caco-2 and HepG2 cells as in vitro models for the intestine and liver, respectively, as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 of unwanted substances, were used to evaluate the toxicity of FB1 and AFB1. First line cytotoxicity assays were complemented by studies of the effect of FB1 and AFB1 on the mitochondrial respiration parameters and bioenergetic status of the Caco-2 and HepG2 cells. This study formed the essential basis for future studies of co-exposure and effects of mycotoxins with other contaminants, such as omnipresent microplastics."]
