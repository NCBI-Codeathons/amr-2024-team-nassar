["Introduction", "In the 1950s, J\u00fcrgen Aschoff, a nestor of chronobiology, suggested the term zeitgeber (time cue, from German)1 and operationalised its concept2 as an external signal that synchronises physiological 24-hour periodicity. We know of myriad, day-periodic, fundamental physiological processes in humans that are governed by an endogenous clock-like system that is receptive to zeitgebers such as the pivotal light\u2013dark cycle. This system is known as the circadian system which generates rhythms of approximately 24-hour period length (\u2018circadian\u2019 from Latin circa and dies, meaning \u2018about a day\u20193).", "The \u2018master clock\u2019 or \u2018pacemaker\u2019, that receives light\u2013dark information via the retinohypothalamic tract from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus region of the brain.4 Neuroendocrine output is the current postulated mechanism for circadian alignment throughout the body.5 6 Importantly, the synchronisation (or entrainment) of circadian rhythms to zeitgeber periods significantly contributes to physical performance, cognitive performance and overall health.7\u20139", "Zeitgeber information which an individual experiences can come from multiple sources and may interact with extreme consequences. It may allow said individual to \u2018run-like clockwork\u2019 or may turn his/her circadian system into a \u2018ticking time bomb\u2019.9 Modern societal demands can provide conflicting zeitgeber information insufficient for, or detrimental to, the chronobiological health of individuals and populations. For example, shiftwork that involves circadian disruption was classified as a group 2A carcinogen (\u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2010.10 Plausible effects of modern societal demands and conflicting zeitgebers could contribute to the current epidemic of sleep deficiency and the increasing global burden of mental, metabolic, cardiovascular and cancer diseases associated with chronobiological ill-health.9\u201317 Conversely, zeitgeber information acting synergistically at the right times may foster chronobiological homeostasis and ultimately health. To this end, it remains to identify zeitgebers comprehensively and to coordinate or align the information from multiple time-cues as much as possible to reinforce each other with resulting high zeitgeber strength in appropriate time windows.", "The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine instilled additional interest in the field of chronobiology. Sport, sports medicine, and exercise physiology may be particularly relevant fields in which chronobiology should be explored as exercise has been discussed as a potential zeitgeber for the human circadian system.18\u201322 Therefore, we explored the validity of that hypothesis through a systematic review of the literature."]
