["INTRODUCTION", "Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular bacterial and fungal megaenzymes responsible for the synthesis of various bioactive natural compounds, such as antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and vancomycin), antitumor drugs (e.g., bleomycins and cryptophycins), immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine), siderophores (e.g., enterobactin), and toxins (e.g., microcystins and cereulide) (1\u20135). Thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the mechanism of biosynthesis of these in vivo enzymatic machineries, which are organized in modules. Each NRPS module, responsible for recognition, activation, and the condensation of selected monomers, comprise at least an adenylation domain, a peptidyl carrier protein domain, and a condensation domain (A, PCP, and C domains, respectively) (6, 7). A domains act as selective \u201cgatekeepers\u201d recognizing and activating the precursors of the growing peptide, while PCP domains interact with A domains to form thioester intermediates and function as a peptide shuttle, transferring the intermediates between the A and C domains (8). The latter domains catalyze peptide bond formation between two substrates from the adjacent modules. In addition to these essential domains, NRPSs can harbor further domains, such as epimerases, methylases, and ketoreductases (E, M, and KR domains), increasing the biodiversity of peptide products (7). The last module of many NRPSs contains a terminal thioesterase (TE) domain, which catalyzes the release of the final product (9). Although considerable progress has been made in deciphering the structure and function of NRPS domains, it remains elusive how these large, highly dynamic and flexible multienzyme machineries are stabilized and organized in host cells to orchestrate NRPS domains and ensure correct product synthesis.", "Notably, NRPS gene clusters frequently harbor ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which have been reported to be involved in peptide export and/or self-resistance (10). ABC transporters are a superfamily of proteins found in all kingdoms of life that are characterized by conserved structures, typically consisting of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) involved in substrate and ATP binding, respectively (11). Apart from the well-established role of ABC transporters in drug resistance and secondary metabolite export (12), there are some indications that ABC transporters might also be involved in the biosynthesis of nonribosomally assembled secondary metabolites, such as toxins, antibiotics, and siderophores (13\u201315), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.", "Bacillus cereus is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes two distinct types of food poisoning. Various enterotoxins have been linked to the diarrheal form of the illness, while the emetic form of the illness is caused by depsipeptide toxin cereulide (16, 17). In contrast to the ribosomally encoded enterotoxins that are broadly distributed among the members of the B. cereus group, the potential for the production of the nonribosomally assembled depsipeptide cereulide is restricted to genetically closely related B. cereus strains (18, 19). In emetic Bacillus cereus a putative ABC transporter has been identified that is part of the genetic locus encoding the cereulide (Ces) NRPS responsible for the assembly of the highly bioactive and potent mitochondrial toxin cereulide (20). Ingestion of food contaminated with cereulide provokes emesis and occasionally leads to rhabdomyolysis, liver damage, and serious multiorgan failure, resulting in occasional fatalities (21\u201324). The cereulide synthetase ces genes are organized in an operon localized on the pCER270 virulence megaplasmid, which shares its backbone with the Bacillus anthracis toxin plasmid pX01 (20, 25). The ces operon includes a phosphopanteinyl transferase gene (cesP) involved in the activation of the NRPS, a putative type II thioesterase gene (cesT), the structural NRPS genes (cesAB), and an ABC transporter (cesCD) (20). As shown previously, expression of the cesPTABCD genes, which are polycistronically transcribed by a central promoter upstream of cesP (26), is a tightly regulated process that involves different realms of regulation (26\u201330). Deletion of cesCD disables cereulide biosynthesis, though transcription and translation of cesAB synthetase are not affected in the mutated strain (31), suggesting that the ABC transporter CesCD plays an essential role in cereulide biosynthesis.", "To elucidate the role of ABC transporters in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, we investigated possible interactions between the CesCD transporter and selected domains of the CesAB synthetase in vitro and in vivo. These studies, which provided evidence for direct interaction of the ABC transporter CesCD and the CesAB synthetase, were complemented by in vivo colocalization experiments, using Bacillus subtilis as a heterologous host. The genetic and biochemical data presented shed light on a so far poorly understood, yet potentially critical, aspect of secondary metabolite biosynthesis."]
