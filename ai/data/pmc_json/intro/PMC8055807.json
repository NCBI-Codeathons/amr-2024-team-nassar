["Introduction", "The cyclic lipopeptide surfactin synthesized by Bacillus subtilis displays promising characteristics in a variety of industrial sectors (Geissler et al. 2019a) due to its excellent surface-active properties and antimicrobial activities (Falardeau et al. 2013; Li et al. 2019). In addition, surfactin is a promising alternative to surfactants of petrochemical and oleochemical origin (Henkel et al. 2017). However, two bottlenecks regarding surfactin production must be mentioned that are often addressed in research. First, the excessive foaming during conventional aerobic processes, and second, the overall low titers of wild-type strains that are insufficient for industrial production.", "Studies reported both on difficulties in operation due to uncontrolled foaming and on a great loss of cultivation medium at high agitation and aeration rates (Davis et al. 2001; Yao et al. 2015; Yeh et al. 2006). If product separation by foaming is integrated into the process as a first surfactin enrichment, cells are also lost for further surfactin production (Willenbacher et al. 2014). Issues with blocked exhaust air filters and hence increase in pressure can also occur. However, high agitation and aeration rates are indispensable when defined oxygen levels shall be maintained in commonly employed aerobic cultivations. Indeed, Yeh et al. (2006) reported that up to a certain high level of aeration and stirrer speed surfactin synthesis was improved in carrier-assisted cultivation due to improved oxygen transfer rate and mass transfer efficiency. In contrast to these circumstances, other studies described that an enhanced surfactin production rate was reached in oxygen-limited conditions (Davis et al. 1999; Kim et al. 1997). In this sense, the set-points for both aeration and agitation rate are crucial to have the optimal performance in a bioreactor cultivation with a defined strain. Interestingly, an anaerobic cultivation of B. subtilis as demonstrated by Willenbacher et al. (2015) resulted in a completely foam-free approach for surfactin formation. Nevertheless, anaerobic nitrate respiration reveals some restrictions. Both the overall low growth rates of B. subtilis producer strains and comparatively low surfactin titers make these processes inferior to aerobic counterparts. Still, promising and high values with regard to product per biomass yields were obtained (Geissler et al. 2019b; Willenbacher et al. 2015). Another aspect is the negative impact of nitrite as well as acetate on anaerobic cell growth. Especially, the latter one increased drastically throughout nitrate respiration of B. subtilis and as such is an interesting candidate for strain engineering (Hoffmann et al. 2020).", "With respect to the overall low surfactin titers of wild-type strains, rational strain engineering is also often employed, as heterologous production of surfactin in other host strains is difficult to realize (Hu et al. 2019). In this field, substitution of the native promoter PsrfA, whose regulation is dependent on a complex quorum-sensing mechanism (Geissler et al. 2019a), constitutes one promising approach. The replacement of PsrfA by constitutively promoters was reported in several studies (Coutte et al. 2010a; Willenbacher et al. 2016). Results demonstrated that both gene expression during the time course of cultivation as well as the ability of the wild-type strain to produce surfactin influence final surfactin concentrations. In contrast to constitutive promoters, several studies reported on improved surfactin titers up to 17-fold employing IPTG-inducible promoters (Jiao et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2018). However, IPTG is rather expensive, which poses a bottleneck for large-scale production.", "The current study aimed to address the afore mentioned aspects and examined an oxygen-dependent, self-inducible expression system employing the promoters of the nitrate reductase PnarG and the nitrite reductase PnasD. Hence, the presented method takes advantage of the ability of B. subtilis to grow anaerobically by nitrate respiration, the most effective life style to generate ATP after aerobic growth with oxygen as electron acceptor (H\u00e4rtig and Jahn 2012). The adaptation of aerobic growing cells to anaerobic conditions is dependent on the interplay of three major regulators, which are ResDE, Fnr and Rex (a detailed overview is given by H\u00e4rtig and Jahn (2012)). In a first step, nitrate is reduced to nitrite by the catabolic nitrate reductase NarGHI (Nakano et al. 1998). In a second step, nitrite is further reduced to ammonium by the nitrite reductase NasDE. Indeed, NasDE is also involved in aerobic assimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite. However, the expression of NasDE was reported to be significantly induced in the absence of oxygen emanating from a promoter located in between nasC and nasD (Nakano et al. 1998). Hence, both PnarG and PnasD are involved in anaerobic nitrate respiration, although also the availability of nitrogen sources plays an important role in this issue. In addition to these anaerobically inducible promoters, B. subtilis exhibits more regulatory networks that allow induction of gene expression under oxygen limitation. An overview of B. subtilis transcriptome under anaerobic growth was provided by Nicolas et al. (2012). Hence, further promising promoters for anaerobic induction of gene expression are PlctE, PalsS and Phmp.", "We hypothesized that the presented self-inducible system poses an interesting novel cultivation strategy to synthesize surfactin under oxygen-limited conditions resulting in reduced foam formation. The proposed system is not only promising for foaming agents like surfactin, but also for other oxygen-sensitive target products. On top, preliminary investigations in bioreactor cultivations to establish a simple and robust cultivation strategy using a native B. subtilis surfactin producer strain and derivative strains with promoter exchanges are presented. Emerging limitations of bioreactor cultivations will be emphasized that display a promising starting position for further optimizations."]
