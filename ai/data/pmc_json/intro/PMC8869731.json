["1. Introduction", "Kasugamycin (KSM), an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kasugaensis, was discovered in 1965. KSM is composed of three structurally distinct sub-components: a glycine imine, an unusual amino-sugar kasugamine and D-chiro-inositol (Figure 1) [1,2]. It has long been known that KSM binds specially to the interface between E- and P-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit to control fungal and bacterial protein translation [3]. KSM was used as an agricultural supplement to protect rice from fungus-derived diseases [4]. Beyond that, a number of new findings revealed that KSM possesses several unexpected biological activities effectively countering some recalcitrant human diseases: (i) an in vitro and in vivo study showed that the combination of KSM with rifamycin is in a position to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis, [5] (ii) KSM was recently shown to be capable of inhibiting herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), [6] and (iii) KSM has also been shown to have a promising activity against COVID-19 by inhibiting 3a-channel [7] and chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) proteins [8]. We were attracted by these new findings and thus eager to investigate the biosynthetic pathway of KSM in the hope of generating new and useful KSM analogs in the future.", "The KSM biosynthetic pathway was proposed on the basis of the gene sequence similarity of each gene encoded in its biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) [9,10,11]. However, the gene products responsible for the formation of UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and myo-inositol, the possible starting units for the formation of the kaugamine moiety, were still unclear (Figure S1). Five enzymes (KasF codes for an acetyltransferase, KasD codes for a NAD-dependent dehydratase, KasR codes for a PLP-dependent dehydratase, KasP codes for an oxidoreductase, and KasC codes for an aminotransferase) were proposed to act on UDP-GlcNAc in sequence to form the UDP-kasugamine precursor. Two downstream gene products\u2014KasN, a glycine oxidase, and KasQ, an epimerase\u2014may drive reactions toward UDP-kasugamine and UDP-carboxyformimidoyl-kasugamine sequentially. KasA, a glycosyltransferase, could couple UDP-carboxyformimidoyl-kasugamine and myo-inositol to form a KSM disaccharide precursor, then KasJ, an epimerase, could complete the synthetic pathway by epimerizing the equatorial C1-OH of myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol (with an axial C1-OH) to afford KSM (Figure S1) [9,10,11]. KasH was reported as a self-resistance enzyme inactivating KSM by N2\u2032-acetylation [12]. F. Kudo et al. recently came up with a new biosynthetic pathway for KSM [13], whereas no intrinsic in vitro biochemical evidence was provided therein unequivocally delineating the actual roles of the enzymes designated in the biosynthesis of KSM. With the aim of determining the roles of these enzymes, our in silico analysis revealed that KasQ shares a high sequence similarity with many UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases, especially RffE (also referred to as WecB, 47% identity) and to SecA (44% identity). RffE converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc in the early stage of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis [14]. Likewise, SecA performs the same reaction in the first step of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis [15]. L. Zhang et al. further examined the substrate specificity of SecA with a group of C2 N-acyl-modified UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-ManNAc derivatives, concluding that the C2 N-acyl group in the UDP-acylhexosamines is critical for molecular recognition [16]. Of these facts, we speculated that KasQ should stand in the early stage of the biosynthetic pathway (converting UDP-GlcNAc 1 to UDP-ManNAc 4; Figure 1 and Figure S2) instead of the reported pathway where UDP-deoxy aminosugar is epimerized to UDP-kasugamine (Figure S1) [9,10,11]. This viewpoint, however, conflicted with the roles assigned for KasH and KasF; namely, they were proposed to prime and regulate the biosynthesis of KSM. We were thus prompted to resolve this long-standing issue by employing in vitro biochemical and biophysical analyses alongside in vivo isotope feeding assays, whereby we concluded that KasQ is the starter enzyme rather than KasF, and both KasF and KasH are self-resistant enzymes in the biosynthesis of KSM."]
