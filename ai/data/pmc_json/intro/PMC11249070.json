["Introduction", "New Delhi Metallo-\u03b2-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (NDM-1-KP) sequence type (ST) 147 poses a significant threat in clinical settings due to its evolution into two distinct directions: hypervirulence and carbapenem resistance. Hypervirulence results from a range of virulence factors, while carbapenem resistance stems from complex biological mechanisms. The NDM-1-KP ST147 clone has emerged as a recent addition to the family of successful clones within the species."]
