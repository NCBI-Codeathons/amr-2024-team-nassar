["Introduction", "Escherichia coli (E. coli) was first described in 1885 by Theodor Escherich.1 It is a Gram-negative, bar cylindrical shape-like structure, with flagella, non-sporulating, and facultative anaerobic bacteria,1,2 classified as one of the most genetically versatile bacterial species,2 belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family.2,3 It is generally motile by peritrichous flagella, regularly found within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of humans and vertebrate animals,4,5 and spread by fecal contamination.6 It can also be found due to contamination during food animal slaughter, but in most cases, it is found in soil, water6,7 and food7 due to fecal contamination,7 and those environments are referred to as secondary habitats2 which are becoming an ecological issue of significance,7 while the gut of vertebrates (mammals and birds)5 is referred to as its primary habitats where the bacterium lives as a commensal.2 Therefore, there are comprehensively two types of E. coli: commensal and pathogenic E. coli.4", "Commensal E. coli bacteria are essential as a major aspect of the typical gut flora and contrbiute to the innate and adaptive immunity, and additionally play a significant role in the GIT.1,2 Extrapathogenic E. coli can be categorized into different principle genetic groupings which include one of the phylogroups A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F, and clade I.2 Group A usually represents isolates \u00a0from the duodenum, ileum, and colon.2", "The pathogenic E.coli is classified into serotypes due to distinctive exterior differences of the antigens, as they can be speculated by distinguishing genes involved in antigen synthesis or identified by agglutination assays.4 However, different studies that have been conducted over the past years for the identification and analyses of E. coli using various methodologies were not able to distinguish any meaningful differences regarding virulence profiles and genetics in various E. coli pathotypes irrespective of the host origin. Therefore, E. coli has been recognized to potentially play a role in zoonotic infections3 as illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1E. coli O157:H7 infection.

It is a well-known fact that various infections can occur within similar groups, but in addition, they have similar symptoms.3,4 In Africa, the evidence of Shiga toxin-producing\u00a0E.\u00a0coli\u00a0 (STEC) O157:H7 infection among the environment, animals, and humans, in general, is not conclusive. In addition, the South African National Veterinary Surveillance and Monitoring Programme for Resistance to Antimicrobial Drugs have shown increased antimicrobial resistance in E. coli, and these results were similar to results in European countries.4 The high prevalence of pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance in E. coli is a worrying issue as it increases pathogenicity. However, such challenges cannot be addressed without sufficient research. Therefore, more studies are needed to be conducted, especially in developing countries such as South Africa.4\nE. coli is one of the components of the natural microflora of the GIT of animals and humans, but pathogenic strains such as O157:H7 can cause a variety of diseases through different viruelnce determinants.5 According to Figure 1, E. coli released from human and animal feces can survive in environments such as water and soil.5\nE. coli O157:H7 infection in humans has been well documented to be transmitted from animal food sources.6", "Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC)", "ETEC bacteria are recognized as a compelling cause of the overall problem of diarrheal disease worldwide.8,9 ETEC strains are of global importance as they are the leading cause of acute watery diarrhea (sometimes fatal) in children in developing countries and the leading cause of traveler\u2019s diarrhea.9,10 Verotoxin-producing\u00a0Escherichia coli (VTEC) is of particular concern as a food poisoning pathogen, especially in the United States. There have been many improvements in food safety, promoted by the outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 from ground beef.10 Infections with diarrheagenic E. coli are likewise more frequent in African countries, mostly in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa.10", "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)", "ETEC refers to strains of E. coli that produce one or more of the two enterotoxins, a heat-labile toxin (LT) and a heat-stable toxin (ST).11 Various pathogenic ETEC strains can excrete one or both toxins, but the diseases caused by each toxin are comparable.12,13 It is characterized by containing pathogenic E. coli strains that secrete multiple toxins from two characteristic groups of enterotoxins: ST and LT. ETEC strain was first identified as the cause of diarrheal disease in piglets, and the infection continues to cause fatal infections in young animals.13 A study conducted with ETEC in piglets first elucidated the mechanism of the disease using both plasmid-encoded enterotoxins.8,13 The most important region that can serve as a host for parasite interactions is the proximal small gastrointestinal tract where ETEC colonizes, and LT or ST proliferates.13 When the small intestine becomes infected with LT or ST, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract is irritated, secreting extreme water, and causing diarrhea.11", "Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)", "EPEC is characterized by the diarrheal agent E. coli releasing the attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions from enterocytes and belonging to one of the different serotypes.14 It attaches to the small intestinal cells via bundle-forming pilus and penetrates the microvilli structure by inducing typical A/E lesions.14 Cytoskeleton imbalances are complemented by an inflammatory response, active ion secretion, increased intestinal permeability, and loss of absorbable surface areas due to the disappearance of microvilli, thus causing diarrhea.14", "Clinical EPEC disorders are characterized by fever, malaise, vomiting, and diarrhea, with a significant amount of fluid, but no blood.15 The EPEC reservoir is unknown but is believed to be an asymptomatic or symptomatic child and an asymptomatic adult carrier. Spreading is often through the fecal-oral route.15 The prevalence of EPEC in infants is rather low, and EPEC is highly contagious in children. EPEC disease in children tends to be clinically more severe than many other diarrheal infections in this group. Some children experience persistent symptoms of diarrhea that last for more than 14 days.11,13", "Some verocytotoxin-producing E. coli induce adherent and decongestive lesions, EPEC induces lesions in the small gastrointestinal tract, while VTEC induces lesions in the colon.15 A distinguishing feature of VTEC is the expression of verocytotoxin, which is systematically absorbed and can cause life-threatening complications. VTEC is classified as E. coli with the presence of the vtx gene or the potential production of verocytotoxin (VT).15,16", "Clinically, VTEC disease is described by acute gastrointestinal infections with diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. One in three people suffering from bloody diarrhea appears to be associated with an increased risk of developing serious complications such as acute renal failure and neurological damage such as paralysis.11,15\u201317 Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a serious condition, and up to 50% of HUS patients can develop long-term renal impairment or blood pressure-related complications. Children aged two to six years are at increased risk of developing HUS.16,17 The risk of VTEC infection progressing to HUS depends on the characteristics of the infected strain, which is a subtype of the vtx gene. Some strains have been designated as HUS-induced or high-risk strains.10,15,18 VTEC reservoirs are usually found in the intestines of cultured ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats.16,19", "Figure 1 shows that the source of infection is beef, contaminated fruits, vegetables, or raw milk. VTEC can be transmitted via water or food and has a low infection rate (less than 100 VTEC bacteria), so human-to-human transmission is possible.16,17 Farmers who produce food or work with vulnerable groups (nursery children, patients, seniors) are quarantined if found to be infected with VTEC. Infected workers cannot\u00a0go to work or access the facility until two negative samples are collected.19,20 The incubation period is 1-8 days, and the illness period is usually 5-20 days.1 Treatment of VTEC diseases is limited to supportive measures. The use of antimicrobial agents and antidiarrheal treatments have been shown to increase the risk of HUS in children16,20 and are therefore these agents are recommended to be avoided in the acute phase.16,18,20", "Verotoxin-Producing Escherichia coli (VTEC)", "VTEC is called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), but because it is a subset of STEC, it is also classified as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). These types can cause the most extreme consequences, such as renal failure and death. The most widely recognized O group for this pathotype is the O157, even though the other O groups are observed in outbreaks.10,11,15,21 VTEC is frequently detected in food poisoning outbreaks worldwide.10,11,15,21,22 Infections can have harmful effects and are expected to cause serious cases in the medical field. However, in outbreak situations, it is essential to identify the source of infection and limit further infections.10,15,21 ETEC infection is known as traveler\u2019s diarrhea. This is because infectious diseases are common when traveling to developing countries, which have serious implications for tourism and thus the economy.10,11,15,16,22,23 EPEC is an important cause of diarrhea in infants. This, along with Shigella, was a major cause of diarrhea in children in hospitals.10,11,16,22,24 It is highly contagious to children and can cause long-term or chronic diarrhea that can affect the development and well-being of infected children.10,15,23,25"]
