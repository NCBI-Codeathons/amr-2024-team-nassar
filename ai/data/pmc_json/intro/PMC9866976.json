["1. Introduction", "Streptomyces and other actinomycetes are Gram-positive filamentous bacteria that offered most of the molecules of microbial origin that are now used in human and animal therapy [1,2]. The urge for new structural leads for both the agro-food and pharmaceutical fields has revitalized the interest for bioprospection of microorganisms dwelling in the most diverse and extreme environmental niches [3]. This quest for metabolite-producing bacteria in environments far from the ecological niches where they were mainly/originally isolated (such as rich organic soils for actinomycetes) is motivated by the idea that they would possess genetic features adapted to these specific and unusual environments, allowing them to produce uncommon \u2018specialized\u2019 metabolites [4].", "Caves, being inorganic and extreme oligotrophic environments, were initially considered as inhospitable places for streptomycetes and other microorganisms programmed for primarily consuming nutrients derived from the plant decomposing organic matter. Instead, this phylum is surprisingly omnipresent, displaying relative abundance and diversity depending on the type of cave and speleothem [5,6,7,8,9,10]. One such geological formation that was previously unexpected to house a huge diversity of actinomycetes is the so-called moonmilk, a soft white carbonate deposit in limestone caves mainly consisting of microfibers of calcite [11,12,13]. Even within the same cave, the diversity of actinomycetes can widely differ from one moonmilk deposit to another [6]. More astonishingly, these bacteria do not only inhabit moonmilk to benefit from the nutrients carried by the water percolating from the surface, but they also actively participate in the creation of the mineral structure itself [12,14,15,16,17,18].", "The decision of our laboratory to search for antibiotic-producing bacteria in moonmilk deposits originated from evidence of hundreds of years of mining activities for the use of this speleothem as powder with antimicrobial properties [13,19]. The first scanning electron micrographs of the calcite fibers of moonmilk also revealed filamentous bacteria further supporting the presence of microorganisms notorious as \u2018antibiotic-makers\u2019 [14,15,16,18]. Indeed, each actinomycete we isolated from three different moonmilk deposits of the cave \u2018la grotte des collemboles\u2019 (Comblain-au-Pont, Belgium) displayed antibacterial and/or antifungal activities [9,10]. A Streptomyces species that we found in all moonmilk deposits of the cave is Streptomyces lunaelactis with isolate MM109T as the archetype strain [9,10,20,21]. S. lunaelactis MM109T is the first fully characterized and completely sequenced Streptomyces strain originating from these speleothems [20,21,22]. Genome mining of the 18 S. lunaelactis strains revealed 42 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) with only 18 of them being conserved among all strains, thereby providing a remarkable example of a huge specialized metabolism heterogeneity within a single species [22].", "One of our aims in investigating cave microbiology is to identify the genetic and physiological features that make soil-dwelling bacteria to adapt to inorganic mineral environments [15]. Some of these adjustments must be part of their specialized metabolism used to capture essential nutrients and compete with other microorganisms or instead contribute to the survival of the entire microbial community. In our effort to identify the metabolites produced by moonmilk-dwelling actinomycetes, interesting findings came to light, such as the discovery of the BGC responsible for the hallmark green pigmentation of S. lunaelactis strains, which revealed a unique example of a BGC involved in the production of two structurally and functionally different metabolites, namely the bagremycin antibiotics and the iron chelating molecules that generate ferroverdins [22,23,24].", "Herein, we report how genome mining guided MS/MS-based networking and peptidogenomics allowed the discovery, the elucidation of the structure, and the biosynthetic pathway of lunaemycins, new, potent antibiotics produced by S. lunaelactis MM109T. Lunaemycins are new, piperazic acid-containing cyclic hexapeptides able to inhibit the growth of all tested Gram-positive bacteria, including various multi-drug resistant isolates, thereby in part explaining the success of this species at colonizing extremely competitive environments."]
