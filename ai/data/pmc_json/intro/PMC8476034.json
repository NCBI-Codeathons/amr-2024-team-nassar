["Introduction", "Secondary metabolites (SMs) are a diverse group of compounds with a plethora of different chemical structures and properties which are found in all domains of life, but are predominantly studied in bacteria, fungi, and plants [1]. SMs are not necessary for the basic survival and growth of an organism but can be beneficial under certain conditions. For example, pigments help to sustain radiation, antibiotics help in competitive situations, and toxins can serve as defensive compounds or as virulence factors [2,3]. Notably, many SMs are used by humankind as drugs and pharmaceuticals, pigments and dyes, sweeteners and flavours, and most recently also as precursors for the synthesis of plastics [4]. The study of the secondary metabolism holds the promise for novel antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and other useful compounds [5].", "A major hinderance in the discovery of yet undescribed SMs is the fact that most SMs are not produced under standard laboratory conditions, as they do not serve a purpose for the organisms then. Currently, different strategies are followed to circumvent this problem [6,7]. Untargeted approaches aim to induce the expression of any SM. To this end, biotic and abiotic stresses are applied, or global regulators and regulatory mechanisms are manipulated [8]. These strategies may lead to the discovery of novel compounds, whose corresponding genes have to be identified subsequently by time-consuming and expensive methods [7]. An extreme example are the aflatoxins, major food contaminants with serious toxicological effects [9]. It took over 40 years from the discovery of the aflatoxins as the causal agent of \u201cturkey X\u201d disease in the 1950s [10] until the corresponding genes were finally described in 1995 [11]. Targeted SM discovery approaches aim to induce the production of specific SMs by either overexpressing genes in the native host or by heterologous expression in another organism [12]. The targeted approaches, also called reverse strategy or bottom-up strategy allows a direct connection of SMs to the corresponding genes and does not rely on the inducibility of SM production in the native host. Inherently, the bottom-up approach is depending on modern genomics and accurate gene prediction tools [13].", "In bacteria and fungi, the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of a certain SM are often co-localized in the genome, forming so called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [14,15]. The BGCs consists of one or more core genes, several tailoring enzymes, and genes involved in regulation and transport. As all these genes are essential for the production of a SM in the native host, we will refer to them as \u201cessential genes\u201d in this study. The core genes are responsible for assembling the basic chemical scaffold, which is further modified by the tailoring enzymes yielding the final SM [16]. We refer to the core genes and the tailoring genes as \u201cbiosynthetic genes\u201d in this study. Depending on the class of the produced SM, the core genes differ. In fungi, the main SM classes are polyketides (e.g. the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin [17] and the mycotoxin aflatoxin [9]) and non-ribosomal peptides (e.g. the immunosuppressant cyclosporine [18] and the antibiotic penicillin [19]), with polyketide synthases (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) as core enzymes, respectively. Other SM classes are terpenoids, alkaloids, melanins [20,21], and ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) [22,23], whose corresponding genes may also be organized in BGCs. As mentioned, BGCs may also contain genes encoding for transporters [24], transcription factors [25], or resistance genes [26]. While their gene products are not directly involved in the biosynthesis of a SM they are still essential for the biosynthesis; we will call them \u201efurther essential genes\u201din the following and differentiate them from the \u201ebiosynthetic genes\u201c. The biosynthetic genes and the further essential genes are both necessary for the biosynthesis of a SM in the native organisms. In contrast, only the biosynthetic genes and a selection of the further essential genes (e.g. transporters) are necessary for heterologous expression [reviewed in [27]]. Notably, fungal BGCs often also contain genes that are not necessary for the production of a SM, the so-called gap genes. The gap genes are not involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, or transport of the SM, but have an unrelated function (Fig 1). We would like to stress here, that this cannot be predicted based only on the class of the gene product. For instance, a gene encoding for a transporter in the aflatoxin BGC was reported to have no significant role in aflatoxin secretion [28].", "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009372.g001Fig 1Schematic representation of the lovastatin BGC from Aspergillus terreus (lov).In red the biosynthetic genes for SM production, in gold the further essential genes, and in blue the genes not involved in the biosynthetic pathway.", "Schematic representation of the lovastatin BGC from Aspergillus terreus (lov).", "In red the biosynthetic genes for SM production, in gold the further essential genes, and in blue the genes not involved in the biosynthetic pathway.", "As mentioned, the bottom-up approach for SM discovery is depending on modern genomics and the accurate prediction of genes and BGCs. Each important gene missing in the prediction is detrimental for obvious reasons, whereas each unnecessarily considered gap gene makes the study of a BGC more complicated and complex, and the construction and transformation processes for heterologous expression more challenging. Currently, several BGC prediction tools are available for fungi. Some tools for genome mining are antiSMASH [29], CASSIS and SMIPS [30], SMURF [31], TOUCAN, a supervised learning framework capable of predicting BGCs on amino acid sequences [32], and DeepBGC, an unrestricted machine learning approach using deep neural networks [33]. These tools are effective and successful in finding and predicting BGCs based solely on genomic data. AntiSMASH uses a rule-based approach to identify BGCs based on the identification of core or signature enzymes and applies a greedy approach to extend a cluster on either side. This may result in overlaps or combinations of closely situated clusters. However, the genes within the predicted BGCs are classified into core biosynthetic genes, additional biosynthetic genes, transport-related genes, regulatory genes, and other genes based on profile hidden Markov models by the antiSMASH tool. The BGC prediction method of CASSIS and SMIPS is based on the principle that the promoter regions of genes in a BGC contain one or more shared motif, as they are co-expressed and presumably regulated by the same regulatory factors and/or mechanisms [30].", "As mentioned above, the class of an enzyme may be a good indication for a potential involvement in the biosynthesis of a SM but does not guarantee a correct prediction. This problem can be solved by the analysis of transcriptome data because the genes necessary for SM production within a BGC are normally co-expressed with each other but not with the gap genes [34]. Notably, this demands the knowledge of expression conditions and does not work for silent BGCs. However, it is an obvious advantage to have as much information as possible about a BGC before studying it in the native host or performing heterologous expression for a bottom-up approach for SM discovery.", "We speculate that a comparative genomics analysis focusing on the evolutionary history of the genes in a BGC might be a feasible alternative to a transcriptomics analysis in fungi for the following reasons. In general, BGCs are suggested to undergo a distinct and faster evolution than the rest of the genome, based on different mechanisms and genetic drivers [16,35\u201340]. In bacteria, the evolution of BGCs is strongly influenced by the strong occurrence of horizontal gene transfer in these group of microorganism [39]. Medema et al. performed a large-scale computational analysis of bacterial BGCs and found that many BGCs consist of sub-clusters. These sub-clusters encode for enzymes that work together to form a distinct chemical structure. Notably, this sub-clusters were described as \u201cindependent evolutionary entities\u201d and the contained genes are co-evolving. The authors suggested a \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d model. Therein, different sub-clusters, the \u201cbricks\u201d form different chemical building blocks for a secondary metabolite. Additional genes within the BGCs are encoding for enzymes that combine the building blocks, and fulfil other functions such as tailoring, regulation and transport. These individual genes are the \u201cmortar\u201d in the \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d model [40]. The \u201cbricks\u201d correspond to what we term \u201cbiosynthetic genes\u201d and the \u201cmortar\u201d to our \u201cfurther essential genes\u201d. Through horizontal gene transfer, the \u201cbricks\u201d can be easily exchanged and recombined to form novel BGCs and secondary metabolites[40]. Notably, not all bacterial BGCs are composed of exchangeable sub-units but some BGCs keep a stable architecture over a long time [40].", "In fungi, three molecular evolutionary processes were suggested to be responsible for shaping the BGCs in a recent study, i.e., functional divergence, horizontal gene transfer, and de novo assembly [41]. Rokas et al. define functional divergence as a \u201cprocess by which homologous BGCs, through the accumulation of genetic changes, gradually diverge in their functions changes\u201d [41] and horizontal gene transfer as a \u201cprocess by which an entire BGC from the genome of one organism is transferred and stably integrated into the genome of another through non-reproduction related mechanisms\u201d [41]. This implies in both cases, that fungal BGCs are staying intact. Further, the genes are suggested to undergo a co-evolution which is faster than the rest of the genome [41]. Medema\u2019s \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d model would more or less correspond to what Rokas et al. describe as \u201cde novo assembly\u201d. This is defined as a \u201cprocess by which an entire BGC is evolutionarily assembled through the recruitment and relocation of native genes, duplicates of native genes, and horizontally acquired genes\u201d [41]. Notably, Rokas et al. state that this is the\u201dleast well-documented evolutionary process involved in the generation of fungal chemodiversity\u201d [41], suggesting that in known and described fungal BGCs functional divergence and horizontal gene transfer are the two main evolutionary process, during which BGCs are staying intact and genes undergo a similar evolution. Further, we hypothesize that especially the biosynthetic genes in a BGC are co-evolutionary linked by the selection pressure to keep the biosynthetic pathway intact. Notably, a co-evolution analysis is a laborious and time-consuming task because a phylogenetic tree has to be calculated for each gene and then the trees compared to each other manually [42]. Recently, a method for the detection of co-evolution in bacterial BGCs was developed with the aim to identify sub-clusters [43]. That method is based on the detection of orthologous genes that are present in close vicinity in many BGCs. This method is working unsupervised but requires a large set of BGCs as input [43].", "In this study we describe a method (FunOrder) that allows a fast, semi-automated co-evolution analysis using individual BGCs as input. Based on this analysis and the assumption that the essential genes undergo a shared or similar evolution, FunOrder aims to identify essential genes in BGCs. To this end, we constructed a database of fungal proteomes as basis for the identification of co-evolutionary linked genes in ascomycetes. We determine the thresholds for the detection of co-evolution within different control gene sets. Then, we evaluated FunOrder and tested the underlying hypothesis, whether essential genes within a BGC could be identified based on the principle of co-evolution. We demonstrated the robustness and the applicability of the FunOrder method by analysing different control gene sets, including empirically validated BGCs and evaluated our method using stringent statistical tests."]
