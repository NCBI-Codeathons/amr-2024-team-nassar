["Introduction", "Thiolutin is a historically used transcription inhibitor with potentially multiple modes of action. Thiolutin is\u00a0one of a family\u00a0of microbially produced dithiolopyrrolone compounds that feature an intra-molecular and redox-sensitive disulfide bond (1,2). Holomycin is another notable compound in this class. These compounds are thought to be pro-drugs whose anti-microbial action requires reduction of the intramolecular disulfide. Thiolutin has been shown to inhibit bacterial and eukaryotic transcription in vivo and has been used to study mRNA stability in multiple species (3\u20136). However, the mode of action of thiolutin for transcription inhibition remains unclear and complicated (discussed below). In addition, thiolutin appears to affect multiple cellular pathways, including glucose metabolism (7), Tor signaling (8), Hog/MAPK pathway signaling (8), P body formation, mRNA degradation (9), the oxidative stress response (10), and proteasome activity (11). Inhibition of Tor signaling is especially notable as this would induce a rapid reduction in synthesis for many of the most highly transcribed genes in yeast.", "Recent progress has suggested that both thiolutin and holomycin act as redox-sensitive Zn2+ chelators, providing an explanation for their diverse cellular effects (1,11\u201313). It has been demonstrated in vitro that thiolutin and holomycin can be reduced by strong reductants such as DTT or TCEP (1,11) and that reduced thiolutin and holomycin can chelate Zn2+ (11,12). The Zn2+ chelating activity explains multiple thiolutin induced phenotypes, including alteration of glucose metabolism and proteasome inhibition through inhibition of Zn2+-specific metalloproteins (7,11). In addition, two observations suggest a possible mechanism for the thiolutin-induced expression of oxidative stress response genes (10). First, thiolutin and holomycin appear to require reduction for their activity, and reduction of thiolutin could in turn oxidize the cellular reductant or reducing proteins (1,12). Second, reduced holomycin can be spontaneously oxidized by molecular oxygen, suggesting that holomycin may be a redox cycling compound (14,15) and cause accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Whether thiolutin can act as a redox cycler has not yet been tested, and the cellular reductant(s) for thiolutin or holomycin remain complicated. Earlier reports indicated that glutathione does not reduce holomycin in vitro (1). Recently, levels of glutathione in the range of those in vivo have been shown to reduce multiple dithiolopyrrolones in vitro and to activate Zn2+-chelating activity, consistent with these natural products being pro-chelators requiring reduction (16). Together, the Zn2+ chelating and redox activities are consistent with previously observed diversity in thiolutin-induced phenotypes, though transcription inhibition has not been easily explained. Both thiolutin and holomycin have been observed to be inert against RNAPs under conditions where either should be able to chelate Zn2+. Furthermore, it is not clear how Zn2+ chelation would be expected to inhibit transcription. In light of these negative results, transcription inhibition by dithiolopyrrolones was concluded to be a secondary outcome of inhibition of a distinct target, such as the proteasome. For example, thiolutin elicits removal of zinc from Rpn11, an essential deubiquitinase required for the proteasomal processing of ubiquitinated substrates (11,12).", "There is extensive evidence for thiolutin inhibition of transcription in vivo in multiple species (17\u201319), though from in vitro studies it has been concluded that it inhibits prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs differently. Thiolutin inhibited all three partially purified yeast RNAPs in vitro (20), but failed to inhibit all tested prokaryotic RNAPs in vitro (18,19,21). Similar RNAP inhibition in vivo with lack of inhibition in vitro has been observed for holomycin (12,22). The recently reported lack of thiolutin inhibition for all three fully purified yeast RNAPs has added further confusion (11). Therefore, our current state of understanding is that thiolutin and holomycin do not appear to inhibit prokaryotic or fully purified eukaryotic RNAPs, suggesting indirect modes of in vivo transcription inhibition. However, without comprehensive assessment of the experimental parameters for different transcription assays, it seems difficult to rule out direct mechanisms of action for thiolutin on eukaryotic RNAPs, as recent work does not satisfactorily explain why thiolutin inhibited all three partially purified yeast RNA polymerases in vitro (20), and how thiolutin inhibited RNAPs prior to template addition, but did not inhibit the template DNA bound RNAPs (20). This critical order-of-addition requirement for treatment prior to DNA addition is reminiscent of RNAP switch region inhibitor behavior (23,24) and is consistent with inhibition of a specific and early step in transcription, in contrast to Zn2+ chelation.", "We can imagine a number of possibilities to reconcile the existing data. First, thiolutin may target a secondary protein, which is present in vivo and in partially purified RNA polymerase fractions (20) but not others (11,19,21). Second, as predicted (11,12), thiolutin may act as a prodrug that is activated in vivo and under the in vitro conditions of the early report (20) but not in assays used by others (11,19,21). To further investigate the mode of action of thiolutin, we have undertaken multiple approaches to screen for thiolutin resistant and sensitive mutants, as similar studies have contributed to understanding of modes of actions of many compounds (25\u201327), including holomycin (12). We identify a drug efflux pump functioning in thiolutin resistance and demonstrate that thiolutin treatment appears to induce oxidative stress. We propose that thiolutin likely induces the oxidative stress via oxidizing thioredoxins and possibly also through redox-cycling. In addition, we confirm that reduced thiolutin directly interacts with Zn2+in vitro, consistent with the recent reports on holomycin and thiolutin using different approaches (11,12). We also suggest that thiolutin alters cellular Zn2+ homeostasis in yeast similar to holomycin's effects in E.coli (12) but also find complex interactions with Co2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ that are distinct from those of 1,10-phenanthroline, another class of Zn2+ chelator that inhibits transcription in vivo but has been described as an inhibitor in vitro through a Cu-chelate (28).", "Finally, we have revisited in vitro biochemical studies with thiolutin and Pol II. We find that thiolutin indeed inhibits Pol II but critically requires the presence of small amounts of Mn2+, providing an explanation for disparate results across studies. First, DNA bound Pol II is resistant to thiolutin inhibition, recapitulating Tipper's early study (20). Second, though thiolutin appears to inhibit a very early step in Pol II transcription, when initiation is bypassed by use of specific nucleic acid scaffold\u00a0templates, thiolutin-treated Pol II exhibits pause-prone, slow elongation. Third, high DTT reverses the thiolutin inhibition, suggesting involvement of disulfide bond or redox sensitive covalent chemistry in inhibition. We find that thiolutin appears to inhibit initiation in vivo and reduces Pol II occupancy near promoters across many yeast genes. However, the most strongly affected genes are ribosomal protein (RP) genes with ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) genes being less but still strongly affected, consistent with rapid inhibition of Tor pathway signaling and downregulation of Tor pathway targets (29,30). Elongation of Pol II on genes also appears altered in that Pol II does not appear to completely run off longer genes as it would if elongation were unaltered, or if sole effects of thiolutin were indirectly through distinct signaling pathways. We propose that thiolutin inhibits Pol II transcription directly in vitro through a novel mechanism distinct from known Pol II transcription inhibitors but in vivo effects are complicated by high levels of pleiotropy. We caution that thiolutin use in vivo should be restricted to experiments aiming at understanding its complex modes of action and that any\u00a0use as a tool for transcription inhibition in vivo would be fraught with undesirable complexity."]
