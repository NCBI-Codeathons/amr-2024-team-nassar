["Introduction", "Activity in the brainmind moves through the passage of time and space with varying speed and direction. Phenomenologically, this activity may decelerate as it focuses and accelerate in transition from one experience to the next. In 1890, William James compared the rhythm of a bird\u2019s \u201cflights and perchings\u201d (p. 243) to exemplify the transitive and formative aspects of the stream of consciousness. An important part of psychotherapy is the formulation of a \u2018flight path\u2019 whereby the therapist can facilitate the maturation of psychological experience. Yet this process of maturation has multiple \u2018destinations\u2019 and may occur on a much smaller time-scale than generic treatment plans can offer. Small inputs may result in large changes within a single session. The type and timing of an intervention may be just as important as their delivery and relevance.", "The field of psychotherapy is vast, with several effective theoretical orientations emerging in reaction to one another; similar to the parable of blind men agreeing and disagreeing about their experiences as they examine specific parts of an elephant. Studies suggest that regardless of the approach, psychotherapy may facilitate neuroplasticity impacting brain structure and function (Cozolino, 2017; Kalsi et al., 2017), and furthermore, the positive outcome of treatment is quite comparable amongst the varying approaches (Cuijpers et al., 2019). The most profound factor facilitating positive change was not identified as any particular theory but rather the quality of the therapeutic relationship. One commonality that all approaches share is the necessity to consider the client\u2019s development of feelings and thoughts. Development occurs as a process which can be conceptualized through time and space, or in the terms of James, Flights and Perchings.", "In order to address individual differences within the vast spectrum of human experience, clinical practice has opened up to incorporate eclectic paradigms. The integration of various conceptual approaches often results in a particular form of treatment whose fundamental assumptions knit together consonance amongst theories, or a singular conceptual approach that may integrate techniques from other theories. With the abundance of theoretical orientations and techniques, therapists are often inundated with their applications leading to an increased risk of implementing them in the wrong context. One way to decrease this risk is to provide a process-oriented framework that may inform what techniques may be useful in any context.", "The purpose of this paper is to build, explicate and refine Chan\u2019s (2021) conceptual model that addresses Allan Schore\u2019s (2019) suggestion to direct \u201ctherapeutic technique toward the elevation of emotions from primitive presymbolic sensorimotor level of experience to mature symbolic representational level, and a creation of self-reflective position that can appraise the significance and meanings of these affects\u201d (p. 280)."]
