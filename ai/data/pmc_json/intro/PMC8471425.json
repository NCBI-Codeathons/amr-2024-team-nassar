["1. Introduction", "Soil salinization is one of the main abiotic stress factors, which affects crop morphology, physiology, biochemistry, and gene expression. Furthermore, it restricts the planting and growth of certain varietals and limits the potential for agricultural development. The area impacted by soil salinization is expanding worldwide [1]. Saline soils in China represent approximately 3600 \u00d7 104 ha, which accounts for about 25% of the cultivated land area [2]. Studies have found that exposure to salt stress inhibits most plant growth parameters to varying degrees [3,4]. Therefore, screening salt-tolerant varieties and studying the tolerance of crops to salt stress are effective methods for improving their adaptability. Furthermore, it is crucial to examine the growth patterns of crops under suitable salt concentrations. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a relatively stable, free-diffusing, and fairly long-lived active oxygen compound [5,6]. When crops are under various types of stress, the application of exogenous H2O2 can alleviate the stress and reduce crop damage. For example, pretreatment with exogenous H2O2 can increase the active enzyme content of rice under drought stress [7], reduce salt-induced damage to wheat roots [8], and improve the cold resistance and cell viability of rape seedlings [9].", "Buckwheat may refer to a variety of dicotyledonous plants in the genus Fagopyrum within the family Polygonaceae. They can be annual or perennial, and the plants are used for food and animal feed [10]. In China, buckwheat is divided into three major cultivated species: Tartary buckwheat (F. tataricum), sweet buckwheat (F. esculentum) and golden buckwheat (F. cymosum), and the rest are wild species [11]. F. tataricum is a cold-tolerant crop suitable for cultivation in high-altitude mountainous areas with short frost-free periods, such as southwestern China [12]. It has a high nutritional value, important health benefits, and contains starch, protein, vitamins, mineral elements and other nutrients. F. tataricum is also rich in flavonoids and other biologically active substances, which can help mitigate diabetes, prevent cardiovascular sclerosis, and regulate high blood pressure [13,14,15].", "F. tataricum frequently grows in poor quality soil including soils with increased salinity and H2O2 can alleviate the negative impacts of salt stress on seed germination. At present, there are few studies that investigate the effect of H2O2 seed soaking on the germination characteristics of F. tataricum seeds under salt stress [16,17]. We soaked F. tataricum seeds in different concentrations of H2O2 to examine the germination characteristics, seedling growth, antioxidant enzyme activity, membrane lipid peroxidation, and osmotic adjustment substances present in seeds under salt stress. A principal component analysis, stepwise regression analysis, and other methods were used to evaluate the salt tolerance of F. tataricum. Our aim was to investigate the effects of H2O2 pretreatment on alleviating the inhibition of F. tataricum seeds under salt stress and test the relationship between salt tolerance indicators and pretreating seeds with H2O2. Through this study, we hope to provide the theoretical basis for a treatment to improve the salt tolerance of F. tataricum seeds."]
