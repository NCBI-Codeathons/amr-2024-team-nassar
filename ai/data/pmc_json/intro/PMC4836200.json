["Introduction", "Intensive efforts have been made in the past decades to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of antibiotic biosynthesis because of the important roles of antibiotics in agriculture and medicine. In bacteria, genes responsible for biosynthesis, efflux, and regulation of an antibiotic are typically grouped together in the genome as gene clusters. Expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes is often tightly controlled at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by pathway-specific regulators, which commonly are encoded by genes located within the biosynthetic gene cluster, and global regulators encoded by genes distributed distally in the genome (Gross and Loper, 2009).", "Biased usage of codons is a well-established mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria (as reviewed in Ling et al., 2015; Quax et al., 2015). The genetic code is degenerate: 18 of the 20 standard amino acids are encoded by multiple synonymous codons and the usage frequencies of synonymous codons within a genome differ from one another (Chaney and Clark, 2015; Ling et al., 2015). Codon usage is thought to influence protein expression and activity through a variety of mechanisms, including alterations in translational rate and accuracy, co-translational protein folding and interaction with other cellular components during translation, and the stability of mRNA structure (Subramaniam et al., 2013; Chaney and Clark, 2015; Ling et al., 2015; Quax et al., 2015; Rahmen et al., 2015; Supek, 2016). In many organisms, strongly-expressed genes have more common codons than do weakly-expressed genes, and the cognate tRNAs for common codons are usually at relatively high abundance in the cell (Ikemura, 1985; Elf et al., 2003). Compared with the more commonly-used codons, rare synonymous codons are generally believed to be translated more slowly due to the lower level of cognate tRNA (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1989; Letzring et al., 2010). Biased codon usage is involved in diverse microbial functions including photosynthesis (Peden, 1999), stress response (Chan et al., 2012), colony differentiation (Nguyen et al., 2003), lipopolysaccharide synthesis (Daniels et al., 1998), expression of integrase proteins involved in bacteriophage DNA integration and excision (Zahn and Landy, 1996), and expression of type I fimbriae (Tinker and Clegg, 2001). UUA, the rarest codon in the genome of the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor, is present in several antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters and has a well-established role in the regulation of antibiotic production (Chandra and Chater, 2008). A mutation in bldA, which encodes the cognate tRNA for the UUA codon in S. coelicolor (Lawlor et al., 1987), has no obvious effect on vegetative growth but abolishes expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes and the production of antibiotics such as actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin, methylenomycin, and a calcium-dependent antibiotic (Guthrie and Chater, 1990). The dependence of antibiotic production on bldA can be relieved by substituting the UUA rare codon with a synonymous codon in genes regulating the biosynthesis of these antibiotics. For example, the biosynthesis of actinorhodin requires the pathway-specific activator gene actII-ORF4, which contains the UUA rare codon. Substitution of the UUA codon with the synonymous UUG codon in actII-ORF4 allows actinorhodin biosynthesis in bldA mutants (Fern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 1991). To date, however, the role of codon usage in regulation of secondary metabolism in Gram-negative bacteria is virtually unknown.", "In this work, we investigated the role of codon usage in antibiotic biosynthesis by Pseudomonas protegens strain Pf-5. This soil bacterium is a model organism for molecular studies of secondary metabolites with anti-microbial activity because of the large spectrum of antibiotics characterized in this strain (Paulsen et al., 2005; Loper and Gross, 2007; Gross and Loper, 2009). The seven known antibiotics produced by Pf-5 are pyrrolnitrin (Howell and Stipanovic, 1979), hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (Kraus and Loper, 1992), 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) (Nowak-Thompson et al., 1994), pyoluteorin (Howell and Stipanovic, 1980; Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999), orfamide A (Gross et al., 2007), rhizoxin analogs (Brendel et al., 2007; Loper et al., 2008), and toxoflavin (Philmus et al., 2015). In our ongoing investigations, we noticed that rare codons are present in many antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters of Pf-5 and hypothesized that rare codon(s) play a role in antibiotic production by strain Pf-5. Here we report that AGA, the rarest codon in the Pf-5 genome, is involved in the regulation of pyoluteorin production of Pf-5. The results of this study highlight the importance of codon usage in regulation of antibiotic production in a Gram- negative bacterium."]
