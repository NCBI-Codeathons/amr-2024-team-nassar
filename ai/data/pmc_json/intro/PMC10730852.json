["Introduction", "Many antibiotics have been discovered and subsequently utilized in clinical therapy or animal husbandry. However, anthropogenic activities, overuse/misuse of antibiotics, and spontaneous evolution via gene mutation have developed pathogens with antibiotic resistance and continue to be a threat to human health1,2. Antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) are widespread in nature and can be disseminated by one or more distinct gene transfer mechanisms3,4. Notably, ARGs are able to be transmitted by horizontal gene transfer from nonpathogens to pathogens. This mechanism for ARG dissemination has been a major pathway in the evolution of pathogens against antibiotics3,4. Fortunately, recent understanding of various antibiotic-resistance mechanisms provided insights into design and development of antibiotics to cope with the drug-resistance problems5\u20138.", "Mycobacteria tuberculosis is an archetypical human pathogen; it evolved with the human race and as much as one-third of world population is estimated to be currently infected9,10. Over 225 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) and 79 million TB-related deaths are estimated from 1998 to 203011. Unfortunately, this pathogen has evolved into the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and even the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) forms, which are insusceptible to four or more of the front-line drugs12. Capreomycin (CMN) and viomycin (VIO) are nonribosomal peptide (NRP) natural products (Fig.\u00a01) discovered and isolated from Saccharothrix mutabilis subsp. capreolus (previously named Streptomyces capreolus) and Streptomyces sp. ATCC11861, respectively13\u201316. CMN and VIO are known to bind to the 23S rRNA and 16S rRNA at the ribosome interface, consequently blocking the formation of the translation initiation complex and preventing the translocation of tRNA17\u201320. Both drugs belong to the tuberactinomycin family of antibiotics and CMN, in particular, has historically been a pivotal second-line drug for MDR-TB treatment. However, the growing concerns regarding treatment failures and relapses compared to regimens without it have diminished its preference. As a result, CMN is no longer recommended for MDR-TB treatment regimens. The World Health Organization (WHO) delisted CMN from the essential drugs roster in 201921. CMN now stands as a drug for conditional use.Fig. 1Structures of two congeners of capreomycin (CMN IIA and CMN IIB) and viomycin (VIO).Ser residue for Cph phosphorylation and \u03b2-Lys residue for Cac acetylation in CMN IIA and CMN IIB are colored red and green, respectively.", "Fig. 1Structures of two congeners of capreomycin (CMN IIA and CMN IIB) and viomycin (VIO).Ser residue for Cph phosphorylation and \u03b2-Lys residue for Cac acetylation in CMN IIA and CMN IIB are colored red and green, respectively.", "Structures of two congeners of capreomycin (CMN IIA and CMN IIB) and viomycin (VIO).", "Ser residue for Cph phosphorylation and \u03b2-Lys residue for Cac acetylation in CMN IIA and CMN IIB are colored red and green, respectively.", "Several genes are correlated with CMN and VIO resistance. The CMN- and VIO-producing strains possess intrinsic self-resistance determinants within or outside their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that protect themselves from their toxic products. Self-resistance determinants act as vital reservoirs and could influence the evolution of pathogens toward drug resistance22\u201324. In the CMN-producing strain, S. capreolus, three genes, cph, cac, and cmnU, were reported to be involved in self-resistance mechanisms: (i) cph, found within the CMN BGC, encodes a phosphotransferase that inactivates CMN by phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group of Ser16,25\u201327, (ii) cac, located outside the CMN BGC, encodes an N-acetyltransferase that inactivates CMN by acetylation of the \u03b2-Lys moiety25,26, and (iii) cmnU, also found within the CMN BGC, encodes a putative methyltransferase that was proposed to methylate 16S rRNA, which becomes insensitive to CMN via antibiotic target modification16. In contrast to the CMN BGC, only vph, a cph homologous gene, was found within the VIO BGC and reported to be involved in self-resistance mechanisms in the VIO-producing strain15,16.", "The BGC of CMN and its biosynthesis, both the formation of the cyclic NRP backbone and tailing modifications, have been extensively studied28\u201331. Our previous biochemical study and structural determination of Cph supported that it provides two molecular mechanisms of self-resistance: (i) Ser phosphorylation of CMN IIA and (ii) sequestration of CMN IIB, an Ala derivative of CMN IIA (Fig.\u00a01), in the substrate-binding pocket27. Cph alone endows S. capreolus with CMN resistance by both chemical modification and physical sequestration. Intriguingly, homologs of cph are broadly distributed in many bacteria species in nature. This raises an interesting question: do the natural cph homologs confer resistance to CMN? Furthermore, do these cph homologs show substrate specificity to CMN?", "In this study, we aimed to understand whether the widespread cph homologs function as resistance genes and confer resistance to the CMN family of antibiotics. To achieve this, we first generated a SSN that classified the Cph family into five major clusters. Sequence analysis initially suggested that the proteins in one of the SSN clusters were CMN-resistance proteins. Biochemical and structural investigation indicated that the proteins in this SSN cluster confer resistance to CMN. This study systematically discovers and identifies the specific genes for antibiotic resistance in genetic databases and contributes towards understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of the CMN-resistance proteins."]
