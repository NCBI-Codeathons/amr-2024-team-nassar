["1. Introduction", "Over the last decade, 34 novel species of myxobacteria have been described including representatives from 10 newly described genera within the order Myxococcales (Table S1) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Prevalent in soils and marine sediments, predatory and cellulolytic myxobacteria contribute to nutrient cycling within microbial food webs. Perhaps most-studied for their cooperative lifestyles, myxobacteria have been an excellent resource for investigations concerning developmental multicellularity and two-component signaling, swarming motilities and predatory features, and the discovery of biologically active metabolites [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Each of these areas of interest have benefited from the increased utility and accessibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. The driving force behind the recent surge in efforts to discover novel species of myxobacteria can also be attributed to advances in sequencing technologies. Genome sequencing of myxobacteria has demonstrated that they possess large genomes replete with biosynthetic gene clusters, and myxobacteria have recently been deemed a \u201cgifted\u201d taxon for the production of specialized metabolites with drug-like properties [24,25,26,27,28,29]. These efforts, combined with a thorough metabolic survey of over 2000 strains within the order Myxococcales, concluded that the odds of novel metabolite discovery increase when exploring novel genera of myxobacteria [30]. Motivated by these observations, we sought to isolate novel myxobacteria from lesser-studied North American soils.", "Recently, comparative genomic analyses have been utilized to provide efficient preliminary classification of novel myxobacteria, and we considered that such an approach would expedite prioritization of strains for future metabolic studies [3,8,11,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. While traditional myxobacterial classification efforts relied on morphology, biochemistry, and the conservation of 16S gene sequences, updated methods including genome-based taxonomy have provided excellent preliminary taxonomic classification of myxobacterial isolates [38,39,40]. Considering that genome sequencing would also afford the biosynthetic potential of any isolated myxobacteria, we sought to employ long-read sequencing to generate high-quality draft genomes hoping to avoid fragmented, partial biosynthetic pathways. For example, of the 11 currently sequenced myxobacteria from the genus Corallococcus, 68% of the 621 total putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) predicted by the analysis platform AntiSMASH are positioned on a contig edge and are potentially incomplete (Table S2). In fact, the only two Corallococcus genomes sequenced with long-read techniques (Corallococcus coralloides DSM 2259T and C. coralloides strain B035) each included 34 predicted BGCs with none located on a contig edge [41,42]. Ideally, larger contigs generated from long-read sequencing might benefit the comparative genomic analyses and provide a more complete assessment of biosynthetic potential.", "In addition to four environmental isolates of putative myxobacteria included in this study, we acquired two previously characterized myxobacteria from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): Archangium primigenium ATCC 29,037 and Chondrococcus macrosporus ATCC 29039. Previously miscategorized as Polyangium primigenium, the original morphological descriptions for A. primigenium were remarkably apt for the strain acquired from the ATCC and cultivated in our lab, including obvious fruiting body formation and carotene-like pigmentation (Figure 1) [43,44]. The original description of A. primigenium fruiting bodies initially piqued our interest in the strain as members of the genus Archangium typically do not or very rarely form defined fruiting bodies when cultivated with standard laboratory conditions [45,46]. Archangium species have previously been referred to as \u201cdegenerate forms\u2019\u2019 of myxobacteria due to diminished fruiting bodies with no sporangioles or absent fruiting body formation [46]. Comparatively, little historical data is available for C. macrosporus ATCC 29039. The strain was deposited at the ATCC by distinguished taxonomist Professor V. B. D. Skerman and was subsequently included in a methodology study focused on isolating myxobacteria from soils [47,48,49]. The decision to change the genus Chondrococcus to instead be Corallococcus has been validated with many novel Corallococcus species being described afterwards [8,40,50]. However, we were curious to determine the status of C. macrosporus ATCC 29039. Considering the proposed reassignment of Corallococcus macrosporus DSM 14697T to the genus Myxococcus, it was unclear if C. macrosporus ATCC 29,039 should also be reassigned. Both characterized using traditional approaches that heavily relied on morphology, we sought to determine how genomic comparisons might impact the current taxonomic assignments of these available myxobacteria."]
