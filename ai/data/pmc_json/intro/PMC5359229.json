["Introduction", "Secondary metabolite production is controlled by complex regulatory networks which are affected by environmental factors such as temperature, nutrient availability, and signaling. Given the complex nature of such regulatory systems, the expression of secondary metabolites is often difficult to replicate within a laboratory setting, and many clusters remain silent (Rutledge and Challis, 2015). The jadomycins (Figure 1A) are angucycline antibiotics (Ayer et al., 1991; Doull et al., 1993) with cytotoxic activities (Jakeman et al., 2009a; Dupuis et al., 2012) and unique drug efflux properties in drug resistant breast cancer cell lines (Issa et al., 2014; Hall et al., 2015) produced by Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 (ATCC10712) that are regulated by a \u201ccryptic\u201d pathway; expression is induced with the use of minimal media under stress conditions including ethanol shock, phage induction or co-culture with yeast (Doull et al., 1994; Jakeman et al., 2006). In the absence of these additional stress factors, chloramphenicol (Cam) is the major natural product produced by S. venezuelae ISP5230. The E-ring present in the jadomycin angucyclic framework arises from a rare spontaneous biosynthetic step involving the incorporation of an amino acid. This chemistry enables a strategy for facile derivatization of the jadomycins using culture media containing a single amino (Jakeman et al., 2005, 2009b; Robertson et al., 2015). Recently, as a result of genome analysis a number of natural products have been discovered from S. venezuelae ISP5230, including gaburedin (Sidda et al., 2014), venezuelin (Goto et al., 2010), forxymithine (Kodani et al., 2015), (+)-isodauc-8-en-11-ol (Rabe et al., 2015), and venemycin (Thanapipatsiri et al., 2016).", "Figure 1(A) Extensive cross regulation has been reported between the biosynthetic pathways of jadomycins (i.e., JdDS) and chloramphenicol (Cam) within S. venezuelae ISP5230.

Regulatory genes are colored in green, predicted promoter regions in red, angucycline biosynthetic structural genes in gray, sugar biosynthetic structural genes in blue, and jadL, which codes a predicted transport protein, is hatched.", "(A) Extensive cross regulation has been reported between the biosynthetic pathways of jadomycins (i.e., JdDS) and chloramphenicol (Cam) within S. venezuelae ISP5230.

JadL is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily MFS, Transporter Classification (T.C. 2.A.1), a large and functionally diverse, although structurally and mechanistically conserved, family of transporters with substrates including sugars, amino acids, peptides, drugs, and small anions or cations (Quistgaard et al., 2016). Given the location of jadL within the context of the jadomycin gene cluster, we predicted that its primary role would be extracellular export of jadomycins. Herein, we have studied the effect of jadL disruption on jadomycin production, that we hypothesized would result in a reduction in the amount of excreted jadomycin.", "Figure 2(A) Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) agarose gel (1% w/v) of PCR products using template S. venezuelae ISP5230 gDNA (lane 1) and S. venezuelae VS678 gDNA (lanes 2\u20137) with indicated primers (1) PL-for/PL-rev; (2) PL-for/PL-rev; (3) PApr-for/PApr-rev; (4) PL-for/PApr-rev; (5) PL-for/PApr-for; (6) PL-rev/PApr-rev; (7) PL-rev/PApr-for.
