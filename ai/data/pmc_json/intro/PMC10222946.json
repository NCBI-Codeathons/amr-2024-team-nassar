["1. Introduction", "The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases including neurodegenerative, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases can be addressed by adopting a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet. Different kinds of less/fat-free diets, low carbohydrate diets [1], and soy-based diets [2] including others are gaining importance and are adopted for good health, together with increased usage of functional food, nutraceuticals, and drugs to delay aging and promote well-being [3,4,5,6]. Microorganisms define a key platform to produce different kinds of high-value metabolites/food products for thousands of years, and have garnered attention in commercial initiatives, towards the bio-based production of metabolites for value addition [7]. Several decades have witnessed the consumption of fungi as functional food, majorly including edible mushrooms (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), regarded as edible delicacies and key nutritional sources, across the globe. Although several yeasts (Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Yarrowia lipolytica) and multiple fungal strains have been industrially employed to produce high-value metabolites, filamentous fungi demonstrate key properties, including presence in solid-state cultures, metabolite production, and polymers degradation, and thereby, prospects in commercial applications [8,9]. The presence of natural products in fungal species provides a defense against predators, harmful UV radiation, and competitive microbes, ensuring their survival in the ecological niche, while broad-spectrum functions prove beneficial for human health [10]. In the present era, several fungal species (including non-Basidiomycota species) are being explored and commercialized as nutraceuticals/supplements, and functional foods attributed to multiple pharmacological properties [11,12], and some well-known examples include Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium sp. The mycelia of some fungal species comprise healthy lipids, dietary fiber, vitamins, etc., and the consumption of these components defines key health advantages [13,14]. Certain filamentous fungi are used as an alternative protein source (due to higher protein contents) [13] while other species are defined as good sources of food flavors, probiotics, and healthy food lipids, respectively. Recent advances in scientific interventions (e.g., 3D printing in food) are widely employed in improving food product shapes, colors, sizes, and textures [15].", "Present decade has witnessed research initiatives on filamentous fungi yielding high-value substances of socio-economic significance, including citrate from Aspergillus niger [16], penicillin from Penicillium rubens [17], pigments [18], pharmaceuticals (lovastatin and cyclosporine) [19,20], industrially important enzymes from A. oryzae and A. niger [21], lycopene (carotenoids) from Blakeslea trispora [22], organic acids (itaconic acid) and secondary metabolites (lovastatin) from A. terreus [23,24,25], \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (cephalosporins) from Acremonium chrysogenum [26], riboflavin (vitamin B2) from Ashbya gossypii [27], \u03b2 galactosidase from Trichoderma sp. [28], cosmetics ingredients, namely, kojic acid [29], fortified nutraceuticals lipase (lipopan F, folate) from Rhizopus oryzae [30], and S. cerevisiae [31], polyunsaturated fatty acid (arachidonic acid) from Mortierella alpina [32], probiotics (whole cell) of Saccharomyces boulardii [33], and fibrino (geno) lytic enzymes from Penicillium sp. [8], including others.", "In recent times, the production of food products from microbial sources has witnessed a tremendous upsurge, attributed to the nutritional content and health benefits of high-value compounds. Microbial biosynthesis not only improves the nutritional content/quality of the food, but it also improves the bio-functionality of the food products via imparting beneficial properties including antimicrobial action, peptide production, probiotic properties, removal of antinutritive substances, and fibrinolytic activity, among others [34,35]. A variety of food products/ingredients have been produced by fungi including food pigments, enzymes, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals, among others [36,37]. Functional food represents an alternative means to decrease the likelihood of chronic diseases by optimizing or addressing any defects in metabolic processes, thereby promoting quality of life. Edible mushrooms are cultivated worldwide, constituting a high protein source in balanced diets [38]. Edible mushrooms comprise a key protein source, with good concentrations of unsaturated fats, fibers, minerals, vitamins, etc. [39]. Nutritional benefits of fungal species, amino acid profiles, and high protein content (some filamentous species) comprise distinct benefits [13,40], while other fungal species are valued for the presence of healthy lipids, probiotics, flavors, etc. [41]. Oligosaccharides produced from copropilous fungi are gaining attention as functional food, comprising significant health-promoting properties [42]. The low molecular weight carbohydrates include xylooligosaccharide, inulooligosaccharide, and fructooligosaccharide and are used as substitutes for low cariogenic sugar in the diet. In this direction, key studies discussed the biological activities of polysaccharides isolated from edible fungi and comprise: antioxidant polysaccharides from Tremella and their free-radical scavenging effect, and polysaccharides from Morchella esculenta improve the activity of antioxidant enzymes [43]; antitumor polysaccharides from Agaricus bisporus controlling cancer cell lines growth [44]; anti-aging polysaccharides from Tremella that relieve epidermal bleeding and inflammation [45]; and immunomodulatory polysaccharides from Ganoderma that promote the immune function [46], among others. Furthermore, fungal species have been extensively documented to be an invaluable source of functional foods and nutraceuticals and marketed as Ganoderma capsules (for increased immunity) [47], Lentinan from Lentiana edodes (as chemotherapy adjuvant) [48], Hanqi edible mushroom products from Coprinus comatus, and A. camphorata (which reduce high blood pressure) [49], pork sausage from Pleaurotus eryngii (food ingredient) [50], Canned ground ham from Winter mushroom (a substitute of synthetic nitrite) [51], and Pasta from L. edodes (nutritional supplement) [52], among other examples.", "Several fungi culture strategies, including solid-state fermentation (SSF) and liquid-state fermentation (LSF), increase the production of fungal biomass, facilitating an easy recovery and increased metabolite production [53]. Furthermore, biotechnological interventions have facilitated the monitoring of variables in edible fungi cultivation, extraction of bioactive constituents, redefining the commercialization of functional food from fungi. Figure 1 provides a schematic outline of high-value substances of socio-economic significance produced from fungi.", "Fungal biotechnology aims to define and harness the metabolic functions of filamentous fungi of potential interest and their commercialization in diverse industries, and the health sector [54]. The branch of fungal biotechnology has increasingly tried to promote a bio-based economy and develop alternative biological resources to address the growing global food demands [35,36]. Studies are increasingly investigating the economic potential of fungal species, via metabolic pathway elucidation and optimization of fungal strains, toward the development of efficient biofactories [55,56]. However, multiple bottlenecks/knowledge gaps exist in the complete exploitation of beneficial fungal strains via metabolic engineering. The fungal species Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus terreus, Trichoderma reesei, and Thermothelomyces thermophiles are selected for genetic manipulations attributed to their biotechnological potentials [21,57]. Particularly, A. niger is extensively used in diverse industrial applications and harnessed to produce food ingredients, metabolites, vegan leather, vitamins, etc. [21]. Besides A. niger, many other filamentous strains are used nowadays, in diverse commercial applications, including biofuel, textile, food, pharma, and chemical industries.", "While substantial progress has been made in engineering S. cerevisiae, the metabolic engineering attempts toward the chassis of filamentous fungi are still limited. The synthetic biology-mediated chassis of fungal strains for introducing a desired trait or enhancing the production of high-value metabolites for biotechnology or therapeutics is gaining momentum. Biotechnological advances in genome editing via CRISPR-Cas, metabolic pathway reconstitution, and expression in a heterologous host, and gene knockouts, have yielded translational success, as exemplified by key examples [10,19,58]. We herein provide a comprehensive insight into the current state of the art of metabolic engineering initiatives in fungi towards enhanced production of high-value metabolites and functional foods."]
