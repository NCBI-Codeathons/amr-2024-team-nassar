["Introduction", "ST-F the first known congener out of the streptothricins (STs) family was isolated from the culture of S. lavendulae in 1943 (Fig.\u00a01a)1. Its chemical framework is composed of an unusual aminosugar, carbamoylated D-gulosamine, to which two nonproteinogenic amino acids, streptolidine (a bicyclic streptolidine lactam) and L-\u03b2-lysine (\u03b2-Lys), are adorned respectively at the anomeric carbon and C2-amine. Analogs with various lengths of \u03b2-Lys oligopeptides such as ST-D and ST-E (with oligo(\u03b2-Lys)3 and oligo(\u03b2-Lys)2, respectively.), which exhibit relatively higher antibacterial activity2. Other ST congeners with structural nuances exist, such as BD-12 (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 2) which has an unusual N-formimidoylglycine in place of the \u03b2-Lys oligopeptide3\u20135, and glycinothricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 1), which is similar to BD-12 but lacks the N-formimidoyl group (Fig.\u00a01a)6. STs are broad-spectrum antimicrobials that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria, fungi, and insects, but not phytogrowth7\u201314. However, the severe cytotoxicity of STs, such as nephrotoxicity, limits their clinical use15\u201318. To reduce STs\u2019 toxicity in eukaryotes, substantial efforts with organic chemistry-based strategies were made but remained in vain19.Fig. 1Chemical structures of STs and ST-related antibiotics.a The gene product of orf1 encoded in the BD-12 producing strain is able to catalyze glycinothricin to BD-12. Other than glycinothricin, glycylthricin, 3-aminopropionylthricin, 4-aminobutylthricin and ST-F can serve as substrates of Orf1 to bring on N-formimidoylated or N-iminoacetylated corresponding products. b The N-formimidoylation or N-iminoacetatylation was presumed to follow multiple steps of reactions in one single reaction site as does a typical FAD-dependent enzyme. c The proposed mechanisms of N-formimidoylation or N-iminoacetylation catalyzed by Orf1 that recruits a FAD prosthetic group and an NOS protein-ligand covalent modification to enable multiple reactions to take place at two separate but adjacent reaction chambers.

Of them, the biosynthesis of BD-12 (accession no. LC122485) differs from others as it recruits a Fem-like enzyme to install a glycine at the C2-amine of streptothrisamine in a tRNA-dependent manner, resulting in the production of glycinothricin23,24. Orf1, which encodes a N-formimidoyl fortimicin A synthase-like enzyme, has been proposed to convert glycinothricin to BD-12. In silico analysis indicates that Orf1 is a flavoprotein oxidoreductase (monooxygenase, FPMO or oxidase, FPOX). FPMO or PFOX are classified into three main categories (I-III), which are further subdivided into nine subgroups (A-I)25,26. Orf1 belongs to category III since its own substrate reduces flavin as opposed to those requiring an external NAD(P)H (category I; the one-component) or a NAD(P)H-dependent flavin reductase (category II; the two-component)26. The N-formimidoyl group in N-formimidoyl fortimicin A originates from glycine through multiple reactions, including glycine oxidation, amine addition, second oxidation, and decarboxylation (Fig.\u00a01b). The enzyme (Fsm14) that catalyzes this modification is characterized as a FAD-dependent oxidase (FPOX) because two stoichiometric quantities of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are produced at the expense of one equivalent of glycine27. However, this conclusion conflicts with the current understanding of FAD-dependent oxidative decarboxylation, where H2O2 commonly engages with a presumed imino product of the first-half reaction. Furthermore, it remains unclear how multiple reactions are hierarchically executed in a single enzyme (Fig.\u00a01b)28\u201330.", "Bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics that inhibit protein biogenesis can occur by decreasing antibiotic uptake/accumulation (e.g. efflux pumps), altering 16\u2009S rRNA, other ribosomal proteins, or modifying chemical structures of antibiotics per se (e.g. aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, AACs)31. The inactivation of STs has been ascribed largely to chemical modification of the oligo(\u03b2-Lys) sidechain by \u03b2-N-acetylation (Fig.\u00a01a) as manifested in the ST producers S. lavendulae32,33, S. rochei34, and S. noursei35, where a universal gene encoding an N-acetyltransferase (NAT) is applied to the acetylation modification at the \u03b2-amine group of the \u03b2-Lys pharmacophore. Whether the N-formimidoyl modification is immune or succumbs to N-acetylation by ST-NAT alike (e.g. SttE from S. lavendulae) is still an unanswered issue. An encouraging example is that FDA-approved \u03b2-lactam antibiotic imipenem that is N-formimidoylated thienamycin36, demonstrating superior efficacy to the latter for both drug resistance and stability. Similarly, N-formimidoyl fortimicin A (dactimicin) is insusceptible to AAC3 as well as has lower nephrotoxicity37,38.", "Here we report that Orf1 is a FAD-dependent enzyme encompassing two separate reaction centers one catalyzing formation of a reactive aldoxime-like intermediate and the other catalyzing a N-formimidoyl substitution reaction. Together, these reactions make Orf1 an noncanonical FAD-dependent monooxygenase (functionally Orf1 should be termed as N-formimidyol/iminoacetyl synthase) (Fig.\u00a01c). Most amazingly, the enzyme evolves an unprecedented N\u2013O\u2013S enzyme-substrate linkage rod mechanism to mediate nucleophilic addition and FAD-peroxide-independent decarboxylation reactions. The N-formimidoyl modification is a result of molecular evolution enriching the structural landscape of STs, intrinsically diversifying the types of molecules and leveraging bacterial drug-resistance."]
