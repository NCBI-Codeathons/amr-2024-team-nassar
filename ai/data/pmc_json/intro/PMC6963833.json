["1. Introduction", "More than 70 years has passed since the discovery of the first antibiotics from actinomycetes. Although some of the high G+C (bacteria with high guanine- (G) and cytosine- (C) content in their genomes) [1,2], Gram-positive bacteria of the order Actinomycetales and their products have been studied in depth, they remain one of the most important sources of secondary metabolites, including the naturally-derived antimicrobial drugs (e.g., \u03b2-lactams, tetracyclines, rifamycins, macrolides, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides). In the past, the producers of valuable bioactive compounds were mainly isolated from soil samples and either directly or indirectly, using culture filtrates or extracts, subjected to susceptibility testing (diffusion method) (Figure 1). Recent advances in different disciplines of science, such as robotics [3], biology [4], chemistry [5,6,7], genetics [8], and/or bioinformatics [9] has extended the spectrum of methodology applied to the isolation and identification of actinomycetes and the produced metabolites. In addition to technical innovations which, for example, enable sampling of unexplored and difficult to access environments, Next Generation Sequencing Technologies (NGST) and genome mining facilitate accurate and cost-effective sequencing of actinomycetes genomes and a fast identification of genes encoding the proteins of the secondary metabolite biosynthetic machineries (biosynthetic gene clusters, BGCs). In the past two decades, hundreds of actinomycetes genomes have been sequenced and many of them have been fully annotated. The analysis of the data has demonstrated that a significant portion of the BGCs are associated with polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways, indicating that polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and their hybrid compounds are the major secondary metabolites of actinomycetes [10,11]. The biosynthesis of both, polyketides and nonribosomal peptides, involves multifunctional megaenzymes referred as PKSs and NRPSs, respectively (Section 2). Despite the fact that polyketides are assembled according to a similar biosynthetic principle, a wide variety of chemical structures are found in the producer strains. This structural diversity is mainly accomplished through the different architecture and specificity of the PKSs, variation of the building blocks for the polyketide chain biosynthesis, and post-PKS modification reaction. Consequently, it is expected that the chemical arsenal provided by polyketide pathways encompasses molecules targeting various cellular compartments or interacting with distinct sites of the same target. Indeed, polyketide drugs such as erythromycins and rifamycins have a different mode of action. The antimicrobial drug-target interactions and their effects are well described [12,13,14]. In general, the four major mode of actions (MOAs) include interference with cell wall synthesis (e.g., penicillins), interference with nucleic acid synthesis (e.g., rifamycins), inhibition of metabolic pathways (e.g., sulfonamides), and inhibition of protein synthesis (e.g., erythromycins) [15,16]. A fifth MOA has been identified for the polymyxins and colistin, which disrupts the bacterial cell membranes by increasing membrane permeability [17].", "Based on the success of antimicrobial drugs during the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of antibiotic discovery (1940s\u20131960s) some experts were confident that \u201cthe tide had turned\u201d in the war against pathogens causing severe infections. However, microbes develop the ability to resist the effects of an antibiotic whenever the dose of the drug is too low to eliminate the whole population of the pathogen (minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)) and thus, antibiotic resistance developed shortly after the drugs were applied [18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Resistance to antibiotics arises from chromosomal mutations or acquisition of genetic elements encoding resistance genes (horizontal gene transfer). Several resistance mechanisms have been reported [25,26,27]. The most frequent resistance mechanisms are exported through the efflux pumps, degradation or inactivation of an antibiotic, and modification or alteration of the cellular target of the antibiotic [15,28]. Furthermore, the overuse and misuse of antimicrobial drugs have promoted and accelerated the spreading of antibiotic resistance (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)). New resistance mechanisms are constantly being reported, and transmission elements are identified on a regular basis [29]. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), antimicrobial resistance is widely regarded as one of the greatest global challenges to humanity (estimated 10 million lives a year by 2050) [30]. Thus, guidelines and initiatives are being put forward in order to limit the further spread of antimicrobial resistance [31]. Some of these initiatives include the development of vaccines, faster diagnostic tests to ensure appropriate antibiotic administration, and immune-based therapies [32]. These measures could provide promising solutions for prevention of infections however, once infection occurs in a human host, antibiotics remain the choice of treatment for bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore, the need for new antibiotic classes and improvement of the old compounds remain more important than ever. Unfortunately, discovery of novel antibiotic classes is halted by the low return on investment, forcing companies to abandon their discovery platforms. According to an issue brief of The Pew Charitable Trusts from March 2019 [33], out of the roughly 38 companies currently invested in antibiotic clinical development, only four of these are multinational pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, 90% of the current products in development are studied by small pharmaceutical or biotech companies, which are ill-equipped to deal with the expense of possible setbacks, delays or even rejections, which are often faced in clinical trials [34].", "Since polyketide-derived antimicrobials have had a historical significance in human therapy, this group of compounds remain important for continuation of research aiming at: the identification of new structures and activities, the biosynthesis and/or chemical semi-synthesis for discovery of novel derivatisation routes, and finally, at understanding of resistance mechanisms to overcome this obstacle.", "In this review, we focus on the therapeutically relevant polyketide drugs which were derived from actinomycetes. We describe compounds active against microbial pathogens, including pathogenic fungi and bacteria, their biosynthesis in the natural producer, and the most recent results on production optimization and derivatisation attempts. This review should serve as a \u201clexicon\u201d of actinomycetes-derived antimicrobial polyketides, not only to scientists from the Natural Products field, but also to clinicians and others interested in this topic."]
