["1. Introduction", "Bacteriocins are heat-stable, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and archaea release antimicrobial peptides extracellularly in the late-exponential to the early-stationary growth phases [1]. An essential attribute of bacteriocins is the antimicrobial activity against different bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses, and even against natural resistant structures, such as bacterial biofilms [2,3,4,5]. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria. They are classified according to glucose fermentation characteristics, cell morphology, capacity to utilize sugars, and optimum growth temperature range [6]. Thus, this classification system recognized a core group consisting of four genera: Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leucononstoc, and Streptococcus [7]. Molecular biological methods have increased the number of genera, including the following: Aerococcus, Alloiococcus, Carnobacterium, Dolosigranulum, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Lactosphaera, Melissococus, Oenococcus, Tetragenococcus, Vagococcus, and Weissella [6,8]. Various studies have shown that LAB inhibit pathogenic microorganisms growth, degrade mycotoxins, and have a probiotic effect [6]. LAB are found abundantly in nature and symbiotically interact with higher organisms. They have been isolated from several sources, including dairy products, meat, fruits, and vegetables. They can also be found in mucous membranes of the respiratory, intestinal, and other anatomical sites of man and animals, even in plants, wastewater, soil, and manure [9]. Bacteriocins have been used as food preservatives, due to their ability to inhibit microorganisms potentially harmful to human health. They are safe for consumption and do not alter the quality and safety of food [10,11]. Furthermore, bacteriocins from LAB have had a significant development in other fields, such as in the cosmetic industry and human and veterinary medicine [12,13]. In animal production, bacteriocin-producing bacteria have been used as probiotics in the diet or drinking water of pigs, poultry, and fish, which has increased their growth rate [14,15].", "LAB are among the important groups of bacteria that provide health benefits for humans and animals. Therefore, in this review, we focus on showing the advances in applying LAB bacteriocins as antimicrobials, probiotics, and immunomodulators in animal production and veterinary medicine."]
