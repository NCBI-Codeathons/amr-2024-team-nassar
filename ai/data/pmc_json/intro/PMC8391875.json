["1. Introduction", "The global market value of amino acids, especially the nonessential ones, has enhanced significantly over the years owing to their humungous industrial applications [1]. L-Alanine, though a non-essential amino acid, has extensive food, pharmaceutical and veterinary applications [2,3]. It is an FDA-approved food additive and nutritional supplement, mainly used as a low-calorie sweetener, a fat substitute and as an ingredient of therapeutic formulations for treating hypoglycemia, liver diseases, prostate hypertrophy and urea cycle disorders [4,5,6]. It is widely used as a hair and skin conditioning agent and as an ingredient in cosmetics and several personal care products [7,8]. Additionally, it has also been explored as feedstock for the manufacture of engineered thermoplastics [9].", "Commercially, L-alanine production is achieved by enzymatic conversion of L-aspartic acid using immobilized cell suspensions of Pseudomonas dacunhae [10], which is limited by factors such as high production cost and poor substrate availability, as the substrate L-aspartic acid is usually produced from fumaric acid, which is further obtained from the non-renewable petroleum feedstock [11]. Thus, to meet the increasing demand, biotechnological approaches offer a great alternative to chemical synthesis for the cost-effective production of L-alanine using a \u201cbiological\u201d way. The most preferred route for microbial L-alanine synthesis from pyruvate via glycolytic pathway is facilitated by the alanine dehydrogenase enzyme (AlaDH), which catalyzes the reductive amination of pyruvate into L-alanine. L-alanine production from pyruvate by NADH-linked AlaDH has already been reported in various microorganisms, such as Arthrobacter oxydans [12], Bacillus sphaericus [13], Clostridium sp. P2 [14], recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum [15,16], recombinant Escherichia coli [11,17], recombinant Lactococcus lactis [2] and Zymomonas mobilis [18]. However, the production of L-alanine in most of the previously reported native and recombinant microbial strains suffered from slow fermentation productivities, lesser purity and poor yield, due to the formation of racemic mixtures and co-products.", "L-alanine is mainly used in the food industry; thus, the functional starter culture lactic acid bacterial strains could serve as potential hosts for microbial L-alanine production. However, till date, no starter culture bacterium (except for recombinant Lactococcus lactis) has been explored for the fermentative production of L-alanine at a commercial scale [2]. These limitations have aroused a dire need to develop an efficient bioprocess for the microbial production of L-alanine by employing synthetic metabolic engineering strategies for strain improvement and using efficient fermentation approaches such as fed-batch fermentation for enhancing production yields.", "Fed-batch fermentation has been widely employed for the enhanced production of desirable microbial metabolites. The fed-batch cultivation process is being carried out by intermittent or continuous addition of essential nutrients to the culture vessel for optimizing cell growth and maximization of product yield during fermentation [19]. In fed-batch cultivation processes, feeding of a substrate or carbon source at defined time intervals and concentrations is one of the most important factors for efficient conversion of substrate into the desired end product. However, the substrate additions should be carefully monitored to avoid any inhibitory effect. Despite the above limitation, the fed-batch cultivation process offers several advantages, such as improved cell biomass, enhanced productivity, reduced substrate or end-product inhibition, reduced viscosity of the culture broth and elevated dissolved oxygen rate [20].", "Metabolic engineering strategies in combination with synthetic biology approaches intend to enhance the production of desirable metabolites in the industrially relevant microorganisms by tailoring their genetic and regulatory processes [21,22,23,24]. Therefore, the present study was designed to tailor existing cellular metabolism of P. acidilactici BD16 for the construction of a novel L-alanine production pathway, which can boost its potential industrial applications. The Gram-positive homo-fermentative lactic acid bacterial strains have been extensively harnessed for various food-based applications due to their probiotic and GRAS (generally recognized as safe) attributes [25,26,27,28]. The synthetic alaD genetic construct was designed insilico, synthesized and expressed into native P. acidilactici BD16 strain using recombinant shuttle vector pLES003alaD. L-alanine production in the recombinant strain was achieved using fed-batch fermentation by supplementing dextrose after defined intervals under oxygen deprived conditions to achieve enhanced production titers. Further, the produced L-alanine was analyzed for its enantiomeric purity, spectral and chromatographic attributes and crystal morphology using various analytical techniques."]
