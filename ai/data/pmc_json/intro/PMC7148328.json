The core structure of A40926 consists of a heptapeptide containing the proteinogenic amino acid tyrosine and the non-proteinogenic amino acids 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DPG) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (HPG). The heptapeptide is assembled by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and modified by the action of various enzymes: four oxygenases, one halogenase, one hydroxylase, two glycosyltransferases, one hexose oxidase, one methyltransferase, one N-deacetylase, one N-acyltransferase and one O-acetyltransferase1. The form with the acetylated mannose (acA40926) is considered the final biosynthetic product2. However, mild extraction conditions are necessary to isolate acA40926. While A40926 and acA40926 are equipotent in antibacterial activity against most strains, the former is slightly more active against S. aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae3. Hence, the desacetylated form has been used as the substrate for dalbavancin semi-synthesis. In addition, as many methods for complex analysis involve alkaline treatment of the culture, which results in hydrolysis of the ester bond, past literature considered A40926 as the main fermentation product. Detailed studies of the regulation of glycopeptide biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis will be crucial for the development of rational approaches towards overproduction of the dalbavancin precursor. The dbv gene cluster for acA40926 biosynthesis contains 37 protein-coding sequences (Fig.\u00a01C) that participate in antibiotic biosynthesis, regulation, immunity, and export1,4. Specifically, the cluster encodes the positive regulators Dbv3 and Dbv4 that indirectly or directly activate different operons leading to acA40926 biosynthesis5,6. Dbv3 and Dbv4 belong to the LAL (large ATP binding regulators of LuxR) and the StrR family of regulators, respectively. The cluster also contains the putative response regulator dbv6 and the sensor-kinase dbv22, whose products may be part of a two-component system (TCS), even if the genes are not organized in a bicistronic operon4,7. A relevant characterized TCS in actinomycetes is the Streptomyces coelicolor VanR (VanRsc) and VanS (VanSsc) system associated with a glycopeptide resistance cassette in this species, which however does not produce any glycopeptide.", "In S. coelicolor, following vancomycin induction, the VanRSsc TCS activates transcription of the vanHAX genes, leading to the synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors terminating with D-alanyl\u2013D-lactate (DAla\u2013D-Lac), \u00a0causing a 1000-fold decreased binding affinity of vancomycin to its target8\u201311. Thus, in its induction mechanism and in the resulting peptidoglycan modification, the mechanism leading to glycopeptide resistance in S. coelicolor resembles that used by pathogenic Enterococcus spp12,13. While some glycopeptide producers do contain a vanHAX cassette, either associated with the gene cluster14\u201316 or elsewhere in the genome17, the N. gerenzanensis genome does not contain any such genes18. N. gerenzanensis must thus use different strategy(ies) to cope with the self-toxicity of its own product. Marcone and coworkers showed that the wild type strain synthesizes a peptidoglycan with 3\u20133 cross-linked peptide stems using the carboxypeptidase Dbv719. Using substrates mimicking peptidoglycan, it was shown that Dbv7 cuts the D-Ala-D-Ala end of the peptidoglycan precursor on the outer surface of the cell membrane, mainly before and during antibiotic production19,20. However, deletion of dbv7 in the original host or its heterologous expression result in measurable but modest differences in glycopeptide resistance19.", "In this study, we characterized the function of dbv6 and dbv22 with respect to glycopeptide biosynthesis and resistance in N. gerenzanensis and established that dbv biosynthesis genes are under negative control by this TCS, while the resistance gene dbv7 is under positive control. In addition, we discovered that exogenously added A40926 and acA40926 differently affect transcription of selected dbv genes. Based on the current results and those reported previously2, a complex model of regulation can be depicted with the late pathway intermediate A40926 and the end product acA40926 having different roles in controlling antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance."]
