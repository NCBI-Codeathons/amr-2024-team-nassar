["Introduction", "Lung cancer is considered one of the most lethal forms of solid cancer that have destroyed the lives of thousands of people internationally (1). According to WHO, lung cancer is the most common cause of tobacco-related deaths worldwide. Its survival rate is very low with just 5 years of survival in 18% of the patients diagnosed with this disease, which may be attributed to its late diagnosis in advanced stages (2). Generally, it is divided into two main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is the major subtype of lung carcinoma that accounts for 85% of the cases, and the available chemotherapies, radiotherapies, and surgical options are less effective against this type of carcinoma (3). In a survey in 2012, it was estimated that 1,800,000 new cases of lung carcinoma were reported, out of which, 1,600,000 died making the death rate of lung cancer 87% in 1 year. It is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in both men and women (4).", "Thus, patients having lung cancer should be intervened in its early stage; otherwise, despite all of the treatment strategies, they are not able to survive stage IV of lung cancer (5). Standard chemotherapeutic drugs have been used over the years to treat NSCLC; however, now, advanced therapeutic options are required to overcome the limitations of cytotoxic drugs (6, 7). Even though all of the genetic alterations, especially anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene mutation and alteration in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in NSCLC, are well understood, certain limitations still need to be addressed (8\u201310). Recent research suggests that immune-mediated disruption of carcinogens is more beneficial than the standard chemotherapeutic approach, so immunotherapy is under consideration for lung cancer treatment (11)."]
