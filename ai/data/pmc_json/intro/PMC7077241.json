["1. Introduction", "Citreoviridin (CTV) is one of the mycotoxins that contaminates a wide range of agricultural products, including rice. It is produced by Aspergillus terreus, Eupenicillium ochrosalmoneum and Penicillium citreonigrum [1,2,3]. Toxicological studies indicate that CTV could induce acute neurotoxic effects, such as respiratory failure, circulatory failure, paralysis and convulsions, in humans and experimental animals [4,5,6]. Previous studies demonstrate the relationship between CTV and several human diseases. Several decades ago, shoshin-kakke (cardiac beriberi) occurred in Japan, and it is related to the consumption of molded yellow rice, which is contaminated with CTV produced by P. citreonigrum [7]. Recently, outbreaks of beriberi have occurred in Brazil, and P. citreonigrum and CTV were detected in rice samples of related outbreaks [8,9]. CTV has also been implicated in Keshan disease, which is an endemic cardiomyopathy condition of China and North Korea, through an oxidative stress mechanism [10]. Additionally, it is possible that CTV is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis [11].", "CTV is a highly reduced polyketide product, and its chemical structure was determined in the 1960s by Sakabe [12]. The structure is similar to aurovertins, which are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration, and in vitro studies demonstrate that CTV inhibits triphosphate adenosine and thiamine diphosphate, which may reveal a potential mechanism for how CTV causes cardiac beriberi [13,14,15].", "Recently, the gene cluster for CTV biosynthesis was identified in A. terreus ver. aureus [16]. Lin et al. revealed the cluster by a resistance-gene-driven genome mining method. To achieve self-resistance against its self-produced metabolites, fungi may occasionally harbor duplicated resistant targets within the biosynthetic gene cluster [17,18]. As such, an extra gene copy of the F1-ATPase \u03b2-subunit, a well-known target of CTV, was found and named ctvE. Furthermore, ctvE was located next to putative enzyme genes that are involved in the synthesis of CTV. A highly reducing polyketide synthase (HR-PKS) gene (ctvA), and the following genes for other putative enzymes are required to synthesize the tetrahydrofuran ring and methylated \u03b1-pyrone in CTV: methyltransferase (ctvB), flavin-dependent mono-oxygenase (ctvC) and hydrolase (ctvD). Heterologous expression in A. nidulans revealed that these four genes together are sufficient for CTV formation [16]. Nevertheless, the gene cluster for CTV biosynthesis in P. citreonigrum, which is a species that is believed to be responsible for yellow rice toxicity and recent outbreaks of beriberi, has still been unclear. In the present study, we hypothesized that homologous genes to the CTV biosynthesis genes in A. terreus are involved in the biosynthesis of CTV in P. citreonigrum, and as such, these genes are searched for in the genome."]
