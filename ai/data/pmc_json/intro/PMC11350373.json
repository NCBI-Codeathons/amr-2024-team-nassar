["Introduction", "Owing to the constant threat of viral predation exerted by bacteriophages (or phages), bacteria have evolved an extensive repertoire of antiphage defense mechanisms. In recent years, advancements in high-throughput bioinformatics and experimental approaches have expanded our understanding of bacterial antiphage defense to over a hundred different systems, unveiling an unexpectedly rich portfolio of systems and mechanisms (Georjon and Bernheim 2023). While previous knowledge of antiphage mechanisms was largely confined to restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas systems targeting invading nucleic acids, recent discoveries have exposed remarkably intricate bacterial immune strategies. These include systems that rely on intracellular signal transduction facilitated by cyclic (oligo-)nucleotides and systems recognizing conserved structural patterns in viral proteins or RNAs to initiate immune responses (Cohen et\u00a0al. 2019, Ofir et\u00a0al. 2021, Tal et\u00a0al. 2021, Gao et\u00a0al. 2022, Tal and Sorek 2022). Recent studies also revealed several mechanisms that are shared among cells within a microbial community. These communal defenses encompass the extrusion of membrane vesicles serving as a phage decoy, quorum sensing-based activation of defense systems, biofilm formation, and secretion of antiphage small molecules (Luthe et\u00a0al. 2023).", "Soil-dwelling bacteria of the genus Streptomyces are sophisticated producers of bioactive compounds endowed with antibacterial, antifungal, or even anticancer properties (Barka et\u00a0al. 2016). The natural producers usually possess self-resistance mechanisms to prevent autotoxicity (Hopwood 2007), thereby conferring them a fitness advantage over other microorganisms (Tyc et\u00a0al. 2017). Shortly after their discovery, bacterial secondary metabolites emerged as a pivotal breakthrough to combat bacterial and fungal infections or applications in chemotherapy (Al-Shaibani et\u00a0al. 2021). Their production is usually closely linked to the multicellular life cycle of Streptomyces. When conditions are favorable, spores germinate and develop into a vegetative mycelium in response to adverse conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, Streptomyces sacrifices parts of this vegetative mycelium via programmed cell death, supplying nutrients for the erection of aerial hyphae, which further differentiate into chains of spores. Typically, this developmental switch to reproductive growth aligns with the onset of secondary metabolite production, presumably to protect released nutrients from competing soil organisms (Fl\u00e4rdh and Buttner 2009, McCormick and Fl\u00e4rdh 2012, Schlimpert and Elliot 2023). Interestingly, recent studies indicate that bacterial small molecules also exhibit antiphage activity (Hardy et\u00a0al. 2023). The Streptomyces-derived, naturally secreted anthracyclines doxo- and daunorubicin, which are primarily recognized as anticancer drugs, have been shown to efficiently inhibit infection of dsDNA phages, presumably by specifically intercalating into phage DNA (Kronheim et\u00a0al. 2018). In our previous report, we expanded the repertoire of known antiphage molecule classes by demonstrating the antiphage properties of aminoglycoside antibiotics in widely divergent bacterial hosts (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022, Hardy et\u00a0al. 2023).", "Aminoglycosides are bactericidal antibiotics that inhibit protein translation by binding to the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit (Krause et\u00a0al. 2016). While different aminoglycosides exhibit varying specificity for distinct regions on the ribosomal A-site, they all induce a conformational change leading to the promotion of mistranslation by inducing codon misreading upon the delivery of aminoacyl transfer RNA. Despite the initial recognition of their antiphage properties as early as the 1960s (Brock et\u00a0al. 1963, Schindler 1964, Bowman 1967), the exploration of these features in the context of bacterial antiphage immunity was not further pursued. In-depth analysis of this observation using aminoglycoside-resistant strains revealed a strong inhibition of phage infection by addition of pure apramycin as well culture supernatant (=spent medium) of the natural apramycin producer Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius (suborder Pseudonocardineae, order Actinomycetales) (Tamura et\u00a0al. 2008), hinting toward an ecological relevance of such chemically mediated antiphage defense via aminoglycosides. Their secretion into the environment could create an antiviral microenvironment, thereby providing a chemical defense against phages at the community level (Hardy et\u00a0al. 2023, Luthe et\u00a0al. 2023). However, in order to benefit from this, neighboring cells or mycelial structures must possess resistance mechanisms to counteract the antibacterial impact of the compound without abolishing the antiphage effect. For aminoglycosides, three main resistance mechanisms are currently known including aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AME) for drug modification, 16S rRNA methyltransferases for target site modification, and increased export or decreased uptake (Garneau-Tsodikova and Labby 2016). Recent investigations reveal the widespread distribution of AMEs across different continents and terrestrial biomes, wherein \u223c25% of sequenced bacteria carrying at least one AME (Pradier and Bedhomme 2023). This distribution is expected to be closely correlated with the high mobility of AMEs. Remarkably, \u223c40% of the detected AMEs are located on mobile genetic elements, facilitating their acquisition and broadening of the resistance spectrum via horizontal gene transfer (Pradier and Bedhomme 2023). Additionally, they are often carried by phage plasmids, allowing them to be easily transferred across bacteria upon infection without direct cell\u2013cell contact (Pfeifer et\u00a0al. 2022).", "In this study, we systematically examined the influence of various resistance mechanisms, encompassing a set of AMEs and a 16S rRNA methyltransferase, on the antiphage properties of aminoglycosides. Remarkably, our results demonstrated that diverse aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms acting through drug modification as well as target site modification did in fact abolish the antibacterial properties, while the antiphage activity was retained. This evidence provides the prerequisite for making a community-wide antiphage defense, even on an interspecies level, conceivable."]
