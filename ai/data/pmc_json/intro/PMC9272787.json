["Introduction", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pae) is associated with a broad spectrum of acute and chronic infections (Kerr and Snelling, 2009; Williams et al., 2010), and notorious for its resistance toward a variety of antibiotics (Pang et al., 2019). The pathogenic potential of Pae is based on its metabolic versatility, permitting fast adaptation to changing environmental conditions and to different niches such as soil, marine habitats, or different organisms (Gellatly and Hancock, 2013).", "In Pae, the global regulator Hfq is involved in small RNA-mediated riboregulation as well as in carbon catabolite repression (CCR; Sonnleitner and Bl\u00e4si, 2014; Ferrara et al., 2015; Moreno et al., 2015; Sonnleitner et al., 2017). The function of Hfq in riboregulation of Gram-negative bacteria has been well studied. Hfq is known to stabilize sRNAs and to facilitate their annealing with target mRNAs (Santiago-Frangos and Woodson, 2018). Moreover, in Pae, Hfq was shown to bind directly to mRNAs that contain (AAN)n or (ARN)n repeats, in which A is an adenine, R is a purine (A/G), and N is any nucleotide. When present in the translation initiation region, these motifs can engage the tripartite binding pockets on the distal face of Hfq (Link et al., 2009; Malecka et al., 2021) to block translation during CCR (Sonnleitner and Bl\u00e4si, 2014). Hereby, the catabolite repression protein Crc acts as a co-repressor by stabilizing the Hfq-RNA complex (Sonnleitner et al., 2018; Pei et al., 2019; Malecka et al., 2021). Transcriptome analyses with PAO1\u0394hfq and PAO1\u0394crc revealed many overlapping mRNA targets, regulation of which is governed by both, Hfq and Crc, during CCR (Sonnleitner et al., 2018). In this way, Hfq/Crc ensure a hierarchical use of nutrients by precluding the synthesis of uptake- and degradative functions required for metabolization of C/N sources other than the available preferred one(s), such as C4-dicarboxylates. Furthermore, a ChIP-seq approach showed that Hfq and Crc co-associate with nascent transcripts, whereas Crc was not observed on RNAs in the absence of Hfq (Kambara et al., 2018). These in vivo findings are in accord with previous results, showing that Crc is devoid of RNA binding activity (Milojevic et al., 2013), and that the association of Crc with RNA requires Hfq (Sonnleitner et al., 2018). Moreover, a RNA-seq based comparative transcriptome analysis of the Pae strains PAO1\u0394hfq and PAO1\u0394hfq\u0394crc strongly suggested that Crc does not exert an independent regulatory function (Malecka et al., 2021).", "Recent structural studies have revealed that Hfq/Crc complexes formed on individual mRNAs vary in form and composition (Dendooven, 2020). It is therefore conceivable that Hfq/Crc mediated regulation results in differential translational repression of target genes. This hypothesis may explain variations in translational control of individual genes in Pae crc deletion strains (Corona et al., 2018), which can result in a change of the order of metabolite utilization (La Rosa et al., 2016). In fact, the absence of Crc caused an unbalanced metabolism with poorly optimized metabolic fluxes in P. putida (La Rosa et al., 2015; Molina et al., 2019).", "The response to different C-sources is coordinated by the RNA CrcZ (Sonnleitner et al., 2009; Valentini et al., 2014). CrcZ sequesters Hfq and/or Hfq/Crc when CCR is alleviated (Sonnleitner and Bl\u00e4si, 2014; Sonnleitner et al., 2018), which in turn leads to the metabolization of non- or less preferred C sources, such as mannitol. CrcZ expression is under control of the alternative sigma factor RpoN and the two-component system CbrA/B (Sonnleitner et al., 2009; Abdou et al., 2011). The signal responsible for CbrA activation remains unknown, but it is thought to be related to the internal energy status of the cell (Valentini et al., 2014). Furthermore, as CrcZ acts as a decoy for Hfq, CrcZ does not only interfere with direct translational repression by Hfq/Crc (Sonnleitner and Bl\u00e4si, 2014) but also with Hfq-mediated riboregulation by sRNAs (Sonnleitner et al., 2017). Moreover, Hfq-mediated regulation is linked to complex behavior including the control of virulence genes (Sonnleitner et al., 2003, 2006), quorum sensing (Kimyon et al., 2016; Yang and Lan, 2016), biofilm formation (Pusic et al., 2016) as well as antibiotic susceptibility (Pusic et al., 2018; Sonnleitner et al., 2020).", "Most studies on Hfq/Crc mediated regulation in Pae have been performed during growth on specific carbon sources (Corona et al., 2018; Kambara et al., 2018; Sonnleitner et al., 2018; Molina et al., 2019). Comparatively, little is known on the dynamic rewiring of gene expression during diauxic growth in the simultaneous presence of a preferred carbon source, such as succinate, and a non-preferred one, such as mannitol (Valentini et al., 2014). Here, we aimed at obtaining a picture on the re-programing of regulatory networks and genes by using a multiomics approach, revealing changes in the transcriptome (RNA-seq), translatome (Ribo-seq), and proteome (MS, mass spectrometry). On the one hand, it was expected that these studies verify and validate transcripts subject to Hfq/Crc regulation during CCR. On the other hand, we anticipated that these studies reveal novel target genes that are differentially regulated after relief of CCR, i.e., after titration of Hfq/Crc by the RNA CrcZ, the levels of which are known to rise when the preferred carbon source is exhausted (Valentini et al., 2014). Here, we report an upregulation of the mexGHI-opmD operon encoding an efflux pump that expels the antibiotic norfloxacin and the virulence factor 5-Methyl-phenazine (5-Me-PCA). A model is presented for an indirect upregulation of the mexGHI-opmD operon after CrcZ mediated titration of Hfq."]
