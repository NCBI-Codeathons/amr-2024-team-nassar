["Introduction", "The global chemical industry is transitioning from reliance majorly on petrochemical processes to more sustainable bio-based production. This development holds promise to improve the sustainability of the chemical industry while also reducing the overall production costs of chemical products. In order to establish a cost-competitive bioprocess, titers of fermentations frequently exceed 100 gl\u22121, which leads to a significant stress on the host organism. Indeed, a majority of industrial bioprocesses are limited in production due to several stresses, for example, osmotic stress, leading to product toxicity.", "One of the most significant bio-based chemical products is L-lysine. The global bio-based L-lysine production is estimated to reach 3.0 million tons in 2022 corresponding to 5.6 billion USD of market value according to the current L-lysine market report (Elder, 2018). Industrial L-lysine bioprocesses entirely rely on Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli production strains that achieve titers over 1.2\u2009M (Becker and Wittmann, 2012; Lee and Kim, 2015). It was observed that the L-lysine export rate is inhibited by 50% upon exceeding the extracellular concentration of 400\u2009mM compared to that at 80\u2009mM (Kelle et al., 1996), indicating the substantial inhibition of the L-lysine-specific export in industrial fermentation. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the benefit of incorporating active efflux systems to address intracellular product accumulation in bio-based production (Malla et al., 2010; Hemberger et al., 2011; Borodina, 2019). Hence, L-lysine export system is an obvious target to maintain the producer organism at high lysine concentration as well as easing the downstream process. Despite its importance, there are only two identified lysine-specific exporters: (i) LysE as a member of the lysine efflux permease (LysE; 2.A.75) family (Vrljic et al., 1999; Bellmann et al., 2001) and (ii) lysine outward permease (LysO or YbjE in E. coli; Vrljic et al., 1996; Pathania and Sardesai, 2015) achieved five-fold higher lysine export rate upon overexpression of LysE in C. glutamicum (Vrljic et al., 1996). Similarly, Yasueda and coworker have deployed this strategy for 10-fold improvement in L-lysine production by expressing a spontaneously mutated LysE from C. glutamicum in Methylophilis methylotrophus (Gunji and Yasueda, 2006). In addition to the rational engineering of the existing exporters, there is an urgent demand for new genetic building blocks to further improve L-lysine tolerance and production.", "Functional metagenomic selection is an effective approach to discover novel genes and enzymes due to its ability to access the wide range of genetic elements present in a particular environmental niche (Sommer et al., 2009, 2010; Munck et al., 2015; Forsberg et al., 2016). Hence, we set out to use functional metagenomic selection to identify novel L-lysine transporter candidates from a cow fecal library, with the goal of improving industrial L-lysine production (Figure 1A). Using C13-labeled L-lysine and mRNA expression of the screened transporter in Xenopus oocyte, the transporter candidate was confirmed as L-lysine exporter. Expression of the metagenomic derived L-lysine transporter improved titer and productivity in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative production strains.", "Figure 1Functional metagenomic screening and Lysine tolerance of the screened metagenomics clones.
