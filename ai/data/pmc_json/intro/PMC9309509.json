["Introduction", "The Streptomyces sp. are producers of natural products that are often synthesized by genes in proximity in the genome, collectively referred to as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Hopwood, 2007; Medema et al., 2015; Genilloud, 2017). Many of these BGCs share common core genes such as polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which form an assembly line that elongates the metabolite backbone. The combination of these core genes with various functional groups and structure modifying enzymes in a BGC allows the Streptomyces sp. to produce a diverse variety of compounds that are difficult to efficiently produce through chemical synthesis (Hopwood, 2007; Rossiter et al., 2017; Genilloud, 2018).", "The democratization of genome sequencing has revealed the variety of BGCs in the genomes of Streptomyces spp., which contributes to the recent interest in leveraging this genus for synthetic biology applications (Genilloud, 2018). This led to the increased popularity of genome mining, the identification of novel BGCs in newly sequenced genomes via sequence analysis paired with experimental confirmation of the products of the BGCs. One of the most widely used genome mining tools is antiSMASH, which predicts BGCs in the genome and matches the predicted clusters against a database of previously documented BGCs, allowing for rapid identification of putative BGCs in a newly sequenced genome (Blin et al., 2021). Another important genome mining tool is PRISM which uses machine learning to predict the products produced by the identified BGCs (Skinnider et al., 2015). However, putative BGCs predicted by genome mining are not always specific, and many are not actively expressed or \u201csilent.\u201d In addition, since many BGCs are present in a single genome of Streptomyces sp., linking predicted BGCs to their respective metabolites can be challenging.", "Complementing genome mining approaches with expression-based analyses, such as transcriptomics or proteomics, can help to focus the search for the BGC(s) responsible for the production of compound(s) of interest by correlating secondary metabolite production levels to gene expression levels (Gubbens et al., 2014). For example, transcriptomics has been performed on Streptomyces flaveolus (Qu et al., 2011) and on several strains of Salinispora pacifica (Amos et al., 2017) to search for BGCs. However, transcripts have short half-lives in bacteria, making it difficult to determine the optimal time points to capture the shift in expression patterns (Moran et al., 2013). On the contrary, proteins are the actual actors in natural product biosynthesis in real-time; thus, one expects that protein levels should be more reliably correlated with secondary metabolite production (Du and van Wezel, 2018; Ludvigsen and Honor\u00e9, 2018). The term \u201cproteomining\u201d was coined by Gubbens et al. (2014) to describe the strategy of identifying potential BGCs by correlating changes in the protein expression pattern, measured by proteomics, with the production of secondary metabolites of interest.", "The early proteomining methods targeted the phosphopantetheinyl cofactor of PKS and NRPS (Meluzzi et al., 2008; Bumpus et al., 2009). They utilized the mass shift that occurs due to the ionization-induced release of 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine to identify spectra corresponding to PKS/NRPS peptides linked to this cofactor. The sequence of these peptides was then determined de novo and reverse translated to develop primers for the targeted PCR study of the gene. To improve the selectivity for peptides of PKS/NRPS, Meier et al. (2009, 2011) developed probes that bind to the conserved active sites or the phosphopantetheinyl cofactor to selectively pull down expressed PKS and NRPS. In another approach, high molecular weight proteins were isolated from streptomycetes to select for PKS and NRPS complexes (Bumpus et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012, 2013a,2013b). However, these approaches are \u201cbiased,\u201d being able to detect only NRPS and PKS, and do not cover the whole proteome but have the advantage of not requiring the whole genome sequence. To this end, an unbiased method employing shotgun proteomics to compare the proteomes of mycelia grown on different media was proposed (Gubbens et al., 2014). Using this method, the authors linked the expressed BGCs to antibiotic activity and subsequently identified the biosynthetic pathway of a novel juglomycin antibiotic.", "In this work, we exploited the actinomycetes\u2019 characteristic of secondary metabolite BGCs expression during nutrient starvation and developed a label-free proteomics-based method for proteomining. The non-producing, nutrient-rich growth phase was used as background to the secondary metabolite producing, nutrient-starved stationary phase. This served as another axis of comparison alongside comparison between mutant strains or different fermentation media. The contrast between the producing/non-producing proteome states, combined with the clustering of differentially expressed proteins based on proximity in the genome, would pinpoint expressed BGCs. To demonstrate the utility of the method, three Streptomyces sp. were studied in this work. First, we applied the method to the well-studied Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) as a proof of concept. Then, we sought to identify active BGCs in Streptomyces chrestomyceticus BCC24770 and Streptomyces tenebrarius."]
