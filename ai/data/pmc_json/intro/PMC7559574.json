["1. Introduction", "Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized proteins or short polypeptides that have antibacterial activity and are closely related to the producing strain. Bacteriocins act by interacting and destroying cells with specific surface receptors [1]. In a microbial community, cells can be bacteriocinogenic (produce bacteriocin), sensitive, or resistant to each bacteriocin. When all three cell types are present and compete for limited resources, only a small percentage of bacteriocinogenic cells will be induced to produce and release bacteriocin [2]. Some sensitive cells are immediately destroyed, while others contain mutations that determine their resistance. Resistant cells quickly displace producing cells due to the bacteriocin production \u201ccost\u201d [3].", "Bacteriocin encoding genes, a set of immune proteins, and other auxiliary proteins are organized into operons that are located in the ring chromosome, plasmids, or other mobile genetic elements [4]. These gene clusters are usually inducible and require the secretion and extracellular accumulation of peptides for induction [5,6,7,8].", "Bacteriocins are antibacterial peptides synthesized by ribosomes produced by bacteria that inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strains [9]. A number of bacteriocins from a wide variety of bacteria are discovered and their various structures are described. More and more data indicate that bacteriocins have different structures, modes of action, mechanisms of biosynthesis and self-immunity, as well as gene regulation. Bacteriocins are considered an attractive compound to use in the food and pharmaceutical industries for preventing food spoilage and the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, the elucidation of their biosynthesis led to the use of gene expression systems controlled by bacteriocin and enzymes of biosynthesis of lantibiotics, a class of bacteriocins, as tools for the creation of new peptides [9].", "A huge variety of chemical structures allows bacteriocins to affect various vital functions of a living cell (transcription, translation, replication, and cell wall biosynthesis), but most act by forming membrane channels or pores that violate the energy potential [2]. Studies of the modes of action of bacteriocins focus on two different action aspects\u2014kinetics of the physical interaction between bacteriocin and susceptible cells and detection of specific biochemical lesions in target cells [10]. It is widely hypothesized that the interaction of bacteriocin with the target cell occurs in two stages. The first stage, which is probably reversible, corresponds to the physical adsorption of bacteriocin in the cell using receptors. Removing the bacteriocin at this stage appears to leave the cell intact, since there is no permanent physiological damage. The second stage leads to irreversible pathological changes as a result of specific biochemical damage to the cell [2].", "It is known [11] that, in nature, microorganisms can have several mechanisms for establishing interaction and protection. One of these mechanisms is associated with the production of bacteriocins, peptides with antimicrobial activity. Bacteriocins are found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria are of particular interest, due to the industrial use of several strains belonging to this group, especially lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which have the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status. This paper discusses the latest trends in the field of inventions and the state of the art related to the production of bacteriocin by Gram-positive microorganisms. Since 1965, one hundred and eight patents relating to manufacturers of Gram-positive bacteriocins have been filed, 57% of which are related bacteriocins derived from Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Pediococcus strains. Surprisingly, patents for the production of heterologous bacteriocins have been presented mainly only in the last decade. Although the main application of bacteriocins is in the food industry to combat spoilage and foodborne bacteria, in recent years the use of bacteriocin has been shifted to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, as well as resistance to plant diseases and growth stimulation [11].", "In [12], it is described that bacteriocins are ribosome-synthesized (poly) peptides produced by almost all prokaryotic lines. Bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria and probiotic bacteriocin-producing organisms have been thoroughly studied due to their broad spectrum of action, long-term use in food fermentation, and consideration of these microorganisms as beneficial to humans. Most research on the biotechnological use of various bacteriocins has focused on their use as food preservatives, the prototype of which is nisin, which has been successfully used in food. However, bacteriocins from LAB have demonstrated remarkable potential as therapeutic agents for medical or veterinary use, alone or in combination with conventional antimicrobial agents. The interest in them is even greater now, when resistance to antibacterial agents used in therapy is growing [12].", "It is expected [13] that the bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria will be safe antimicrobial agents. While the most studied LAB bacteriocin, nisin A, is widely used as a food preservative, various new bacteriocins are required to better control unwanted bacteria. In order to detect new bacteriocins at an early stage of the screening process, a rapid screening system that evaluates the bacteriocins produced by recently isolated LABs, based on their antibacterial spectra and molecular weights is developed. Various new bacteriocins have been identified using this system, including nisin variant, nisin Q, two-peptide bacteriocin, lactococcin Q, leaderless bacteriocin, lacticin Q and ring bacteriocin, lactocyclic Q. Moreover, it is found that some LAB isolates produce several bacteriocins [13]. They have been characterized in relation to their structure, mechanisms of action and biosynthetic mechanisms. The new LAB bacteriocins and their biosynthetic mechanisms are used for such applications as food preservation and peptide engineering.", "Bacteriocins\u2014bacterial proteins or peptides\u2014are considered as candidates for a new generation of effective antimicrobial agents [14]. The analysis of the properties of natural and genetically modified bacteriocinosis from the standpoint of the molecular basis of their production and activity is presented. Most bacteriocins have a narrow spectrum of inhibitory activity. Some of the broad-spectrum bacteriocins have a ring structure (the C- and N-ends of the amino acid chain are linked by a peptide bond). The fixed position of the ends of the protein molecule gives the protein the ability to bind to different receptors on the surface of target cells. Genes encoding the production of bacteriocins and associated proteins can be expressed in foreign cells, including eukaryotic cells. There is also information on changes in the properties of bacteriocin by using site-specific mutagenesis [14].", "Bacteriocins are small peptides with antibacterial properties. They are produced by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To date, several hundred bacteriocins have been described [15]. The classification of bacteriocins is undergoing constant changes as new developments appear regarding their structure, amino acid sequence, and the recognized mechanism of their action. Some bacteriocins (lantibiotics) contain atypical amino acids such as lanthionine (Lan), methylanthionine (MeLan), dehydroalanine (Dha), dehydrobutyrin (Dhb), or D-alanine (D-Ala). The best known bacteriocins are produced by lactic acid bacteria, including nisin, produced by strains of Lactococcus lactis. These bacteriocins are recognized as completely safe for humans. Nisin is currently used in the food industry as a preservative [16].", "The purpose of this work is to analyze global trends in bacteriocin research (classification, description and comparison of methods for their production, application, etc.). The cytotoxic potential of bacteriocins has been established and the need for an in-depth study of the cytotoxic mechanism of action of modern bacteriocins has been shown.", "The study is relevant, since it systematizes information related to the detection of specific biochemical lesions in cells using bacteriocins and possible methods of combating these lesions."]
