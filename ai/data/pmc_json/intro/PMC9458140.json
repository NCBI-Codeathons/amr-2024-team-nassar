["1. Introduction", "Actinomycetes are one of the most widely used biocontrol microorganisms; have great practical value; and are closely associated with human health, agriculture, and biotechnology [1]. Approximately 8,000 bioactive substances have been discovered in microorganisms, of which approximately 70% are derived from Actinomycetes [2]. New biological pesticides developed by using the secondary metabolites of Actinomycetes have become an important component of pollution-free pesticides and provide the direction for the future development of green pesticides, which have the advantages of low residue, low pollution, less drug resistance, low cost, and easy production [3,4]. Streptomyces is a genus with the most species in the Actinomycetes, involving approximately 600 kinds, and accounting for approximately 90% of Actinomycetes. Approximately 2/3 of the known antibiotics are derived from Actinomyces, and approximately half of all antibiotics are derived from Streptomyces [5].", "For instance, mitomycin is a metabolite isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptoverticillium rimofaciens Niida that inhibits the synthesis of fungal proteins and has a good control effect on powdery mildew diseases [6]. Streptomyces kasugaensis can produce kasugamycin, which inhibits the protein synthesis of many microorganisms and is currently used as a biopesticide to control rice blast and other diseases caused by Pseudomonas on crops [7]. Polyoxins B and D isolated from the metabolites of Streptomyces cacaoi var. asoensis were reported to interfere with the formation of the fungal cell wall of Rhizoctonia solani by inhibiting its chitinase activity [8].", "The main chemical structures of the active metabolites secreted by Streptomyces include polyketides, macrolides, cyclic dipeptides, pyrones, and indoles [9]. For instance, phenyltetracenoid polyketides isolated from Streptomyces morookaense exhibited inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis [10]. Streptomyces fungicidicus can metabolize to produce the tetraene antifungal antibiotic, fungicidin, which has the activity of inhibiting filamentous fungi, yeast, and protozoa. Streptomyces misionensis V16R3Y1 metabolizes cyclic dipeptide (L-Leu-L-Pro) with broad-spectrum resistance to phytopathogenic fungi [11]. Antimycin is a quinone antibiotic produced by the metabolism of Streptomyces and can inhibit the synthesis of pathogen RNA and protein due to their unique chemical structure [12].", "Tomato early blight caused by Alternaria solani is one of the important diseases in tomato cultivation, which can lead to detaching of the leaves, drying of branches, and premature fruit drop, and the resulting fruit yield losses often amount to 50\u201386% [13,14]. The main chemical agents that have been applied to control tomato early blight include trifloxystrobin, tebuconazole [15], oxathiapiprolin, and benthiavalicarb [16], while the currently used biocontrol agents include Bacillus [17] and Trichoderma [18], which are still very limited. In this study, A. solani was used as an indicator fungus, and four active compounds were obtained from a Streptomyces fungicidicus SYH3 fermentation broth by a series of separation and purification procedures. The structures of the four compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR data, MS, and by comparison with the literature data. One of these active compounds (4) was determined to be a new compound 6-(5-hydroxy-6-methylheptyl)-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and we applied for a Chinese patent (number: CN111320597A). The other three compounds (1\u20133) were previously reported as cyclic dipeptide compounds, and their IC50 values against A. solani were 43.4, 42.9, and 30.6 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The new compound 4 has a significant inhibitory effect on A. solani and can significantly affect the spore germination and mycelial morphology of the pathogen."]
