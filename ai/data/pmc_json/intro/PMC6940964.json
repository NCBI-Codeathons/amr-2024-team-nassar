["1. Introduction", "Iron, copper, and zinc are representative essential trace elements and perform many physiological roles in living organisms. The function of iron, copper, and zinc in living cells has been studied in various model organisms. Iron is an essential metal ion that works as a cofactor of many enzymes, and iron deficiency results in fatal diseases, such as hereditary anemia [1]. On the other hand, iron overload induces the so-called Fenton reaction, which mediates the production of hydroxyl radicals and is fatal to living cells by affecting DNA and proteins [2]. For this reason, iron homeostasis is strictly regulated. Copper also carries out many important roles in living organisms, and copper deficiency or overload causes severe genetic diseases, such as Menkes disease or Wilson disease [3], respectively. Zinc deficiency also causes several diseases, such as impaired immune function, growth defects, and psychological disorders in humans [4,5,6]. Iron, copper, and zinc are divalent metal ions that carry out oxidoreduction reactions and produce reactive oxygen species that affect cellular activity.", "These three metals also have important functions in the pathogenesis of microbial pathogens, and most of the gene products involved in metal metabolism work as virulence factors [7]. Loss of the uptake systems for these metals in microbial pathogens results in loss of virulence, and this phenomenon is observed in many different microbial pathogens, such as Candida albicans [8,9], Cryptococcus neoformans [10,11], Aspergillus fumigatus [12,13], and Neisseria spp. [14,15]. When microbial pathogens infect a host, competition for metal acquisition between the host and pathogens occurs. For example, when infecting a host, A. fumigatus is confronted with macrophage phagocytosis, and zinc is depleted by the host zinc transporter system during the phagocytic pathway [16]. Microbial pathogens cannot use zinc from the environment and fail to grow in macrophages [17]. Therefore, we tried to further identify the detailed role of zinc in the pathogenicity of A. fumigatus.", "Zinc exists as a variety of forms and acts as a cofactor in many proteins, such as transcriptional factors, metallothioneins, and various zinc-binding proteins [18,19]. A. fumigatus, which is a fungal pathogen, needs zinc to carry out physiological functions. Zinc uptake by A. fumigatus depends on the ZIP (Zrt-, Irt-like proteins) family encoded by ZrfA, ZrfB, and ZrfC [20]. Zinc transporters efficiently take up zinc in zinc-limiting conditions from the extracellular environment into the cytoplasm. ZrfC functions as a major zinc transporter because of its unusually long N-terminus, whereas ZrfA and ZrfB seem to play an accessory role [12,21]. Interestingly, the expression of ZrfC is higher in alkaline conditions than in acidic environments, while the ZrfA and ZrfB expression patterns are opposite to that of ZrfC [22]. ZafA is a zinc-responsive transcriptional activator and is an ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Zap1 transcription factor [23]. In acidic conditions, ZafA binds to the promoter regions of ZrfA and ZrfB, whereas in alkaline media, ZafA binds to the ZrfC promoter region and activates the expression of those genes [21,24].", "Recently, it has been reported that metals control the production of secondary metabolites of fungal species, which act as virulence factors of microbial pathogens [25]. Secondary metabolites are produced by microorganisms, and they perform a protective function against the host [26]. For example, A. fumigatus produces several secondary metabolites that are most likely involved in invasive aspergillosis [25]. The transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis has been studied in A. fumigatus, and LaeA, which is a transcriptional activator, has an important function in secondary metabolite production, such as that of melanin, ergot alkaloids, and gliotoxin [27,28,29]. The genes involved in secondary metabolites are clustered in the genome, and gene expression is regulated by LaeA [29]. Gliotoxin is one of the secondary metabolites produced by A. fumigatus. Gliotoxin is a nonribosomal peptide and a member of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) class of redox-active secondary metabolites naturally produced by A. fumigatus and is one of its virulence factors. It contains a disulfide bond bridge across a piperazine ring that seems to be responsible for its toxicity [30,31]. In A. fumigatus, gliotoxin is encoded by a cluster composed of 13 genes, namely, GliZ, GliI, GliJ, GliP, GliC, GliM, GliG, GliK, GliA, GliN, GliF, GliT, and a separate GtmA gene. It is well known that gliotoxin has multiple immunosuppressive activities and inhibits the nuclear transcription factor NF-kB, especially inducing host cell apoptosis [32,33]. It has also been demonstrated that gliotoxin can inhibit macrophage functions, including phagocytosis [34].", "Furthermore, it has been reported that the production of gliotoxin is regulated by zinc availability [35] and that the gene expression of GliZ is upregulated by zinc starvation; however, the detailed regulatory mechanism remains to be solved [35]. In this paper, we demonstrate the detailed regulatory mechanism of gliotoxin biosynthesis by zinc."]
