["1. Introduction", "Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic fungus that can colonize diverse ecological niches facilitated by its great plasticity to adapt to different environments and the wide dispersal of its small, airborne spores called conidia [1,2]. The conidia allow A. fumigatus to reach all chambers of the human respiratory tract, where the fungus is able to cause a wide range of infections depending on the immune status of the patient [3,4,5,6].", "The biological characteristics that allow A. fumigatus to colonize and/or infect the respiratory tract are known as virulence factors. These include the fungal cell wall and the proteins involved in its formation, the resistance of the conidia to ultraviolet radiation and dryness, the mechanisms to evade the immune response, and the production of proteases and toxins [6]. In fact, the A. fumigatus genome contains a great variety of biosynthetic clusters [7,8] that provide the fungus with complex and bioactive secondary metabolites, including the production of toxins [9,10,11]. Among the variety of toxins produced by A. fumigatus, several have been linked with enhanced virulence and include gliotoxin [12,13,14,15], fumitremorgin A and B [16,17], hexadehydroastechrome [18], hemolysin, and mitogillin [19].", "The role of fumagillin in fungal virulence has not been completely elucidated yet. This toxin has been widely studied for other reasons, such as tumor control due to the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and its effect as an anti-tumor molecule [20]. Furthermore, it has been used as an antibiotic agent in the treatment against different pathogens, such as microsporidia, parasites, and as a treatment of diseases such as AIDS and obesity [21]. The mycotoxin is produced by a series of enzymes encoded in a biosynthetic cluster located on chromosome 8 of A. fumigatus [22]. The members of the biosynthetic cluster are overexpressed in the lungs of intranasally infected mice [23] and include the fumagillin pathway-specific transcription factor [24]. In fact, a non-fumagillin producer mutant strain caused significantly less cellular damage than the wild type in vitro, demonstrating a potential relevance of this toxin in virulence [23].", "Given these previous data and the need to deeply analyze the involvement of secondary metabolites in virulence [25], the aim of the present study was to assess the role of fumagillin in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus. For this purpose, we studied the effect of commercial fumagillin on A. fumigatus itself, macrophages, and epithelial cells. Additionally, a non-fumagillin producer mutant strain was used in co-incubation with cell cultures and during murine infection to determine the potential impact of the toxin on fungal virulence."]
