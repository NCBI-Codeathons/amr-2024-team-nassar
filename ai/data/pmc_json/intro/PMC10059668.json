["1. Introduction", "The emergence, and re-emergence of diseases caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, and parasitic organisms in plants, invertebrates, vertebrate animals, and humans provide arguments for the urgent search for new antimicrobial-active drugs with novel modes of action [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. This study intended to contribute to the research field on the drug potential of natural biosynthetic antimicrobial peptides as chemotherapeutic tools against multi-drug resistant pathogens, especially, multi-drug resistant pathogens, [13]. The term \u201cantimicrobial peptides\u201d (AMPs) [14] includes any polyamide (or even biopolymer with ester, thioester, or otherwise modified backbone) that can be made on a contemporary chemical peptide synthesizer. The limit in size is greater than the arbitrary cutoff of 50 amino acids set up by the US Food and Drug Administration [15] for proteins and far exceeds that of biological recognition elements [14]. Therefore, not only the gene-encoded, ribosomal templated antimicrobial peptides, (RT-AMPs) but other peptides of antimicrobial activity, including enzymatically (bio)-synthesized non-ribosomal templated antimicrobial peptide (NR-AMP) molecules should also be considered. The AMPs are of great perspectives to combat MDR prokaryotes because antibiotic-resistant bacteria perform a high frequency of collateral sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides, [16]. Furthermore, the mobility patterns of AMP-resistance genes differ from those of the antibiotics-resistance genes [17]. AMPs are produced by all but Archea taxa, [18], and are considered innate components of the innate immune systems of all known eukaryotic organisms, [19]. The RT-AMPs are usually narrow target spectral drugs, [20], but their target spectrum can be extended in vivo [21] probably due to their immune-modulatory actions [22,23]. The \u201csecrete\u201d of their future drug potential is their molecular versatility, allowing QSAR modeling [24], and computer-aided design of antimicrobial peptide analogs, and peptides [18,25], and benefiting from the well-suited and powerful tool of proteomics, for a better understanding the respective study molecular responses to antimicrobial compounds, [26]. The vast majority of MPs are membrane-active [25] Others penetrate and bind to intracellular targets like proline-rich PrAMPs, [27]. Several AMPs proved efficient against pathogenic-parasitic Leishmania and Trypanosoma species. Unlike those of the RT-AMPs, the target spectrum of most NRP-AMPs is usually large [28,29]. In eukaryotic targets, some induce apoptotic death of leishmanial protist parasites through a calcium-dependent, caspase-independent mitochondrial toxicity mechanism [30].", "Entomopathogenic bacteria (abbreviation: EPBs), the obligate symbionts of entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) species synthesize and release NRP-hybrid peptides that provide well-balanced pathobiome conditions for the respective EPN/EPB symbiotic complex in polyxenic (insect cadaver in the soil) environments [31,32]. These bacteria are considered potential sources of potent natural anti-microbial [31], and anti-protist [33] compounds. We have previously found extreme antimicrobial-active secreted peptides produce by Xenorhabdus budapestensis (EMA) and X. szentirmaii (EMC) [34,35] in both solid and liquid media that were active against Gram-positive and -negative pathogenic bacteria, [34,36]; anti-plant pathogenic bacterial [37,38], anti-coccidial [39], anti-oomycetes [37,40], as well as antifungal (Ujszegi et al., in preparation) activity. ENMA and ENC are not simply good but the best antimicrobial-peptide-producing Xenorhabdus strains we have ever seen so far.", "As for the latest exciting trend of this research field, it has recently been discovered that the operons encoding the various enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway of each NR-AMP are globally regulated by the gene called Hfq in EPB species, providing an option to create EPB strains each of which produces only one single NR AMP molecule. (The method of constructing such a strain in the lab is called by using the \u201ceasyPACId\u201d method) [41].", "The main aim of this study was to learn whether our per os administered, food-supplement bio-preparation (called XENOFOOD) which contains antimicrobial peptides of Xenorhabdus origin (with accompanying in vitro detectable) cytotoxic effects) as ingredients could be considered a safely applicable preventive feed supplement.", "We conducted a 42-day feeding experiment on freshly hatched broiler cockerels. XENOFOOD (containing autoclaved X. budapestensis, and X. szentirmaii cultures developed on chicken food) were consumed by the birds. The XENOFOOD exerted detectable gastrointestinal (GI) activity (reducing the numbers of the colony-forming Clostridium perfringens units in the lower jejunum. No animal was lost in the experiment. Neither the body weight, growth rate, feed-conversion ratio, nor organ-weight data differed between the control (C) and treated (T) groups, indicating that the XENOFOOD diet did not result in any detectable adverse effects. That is in vitro toxic ingredients of the XENOFOOD seemed to be inactivated in vivo in chicken.", "We suppose that the parameters indicating a moderate enlargement of bursas of Fabricius (average weight, size, and individual bursa/spleen weight-ratios) in the XENOFOOD-fed group must be an indirect indication that the bursa-controlled humoral immune system neutralized the cytotoxic ingredients of the XENOFOOD in the blood, not allowing to reach their critical cytotoxic concentration in the sensitive tissues.", "This conclusion may have some significance concerning the application perspective. Whether the different NR-AMPs could ever be utilized as drugs not only against prokaryotic (bacteria) pathogens but eukaryotic (fungal pathogens, and parasitic protists) depends on the side effects. To get experimental experience with the option of applying EPB-produced antimicrobials to pathogens, and parasites of veterinary significance, we present here the results of an in vitro, and an accompanying in vivo study on chicken. In the in vitro study, we tested the cytotoxic potential of the cell-free conditioned culture media (CFCM) of three entomopathogenic bacterium species, \u2014X. budapestensis, DSM16342 (EMA); X. szentirmaii DSM16338 (EMC); Photorhabdus luminescens ssp. akhurstii TT01-on chicken tissue culture cells, namely, on the Leghorn Male Hepatoma (LMH, see Materials and methods) Icells, (a permanent confluent hepato-carcinoma cell line). Each CFCM proved rather cytotoxic in this test. In the in vivo study, we fed freshly hatched male broiler chickens for 42 days with XENOFOOD [39] which contained autoclaved cultures of EMA, and EMC. These bacteria were grown on standard chicken (starter and grower) feed, and the whole culture was used as a \u201cfeed supplement\u201d. It had been known that these EPB species cannot grow at body temperature (above 33 \u00b0C)."]
