["Introduction", "Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are large multidomain enzymes that operate in an assembly line fashion to produce a broad variety of nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) with diverse bioactivities and functions1\u20133. Each module of NRPS consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a thiolation (T) domain (also as a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain), and a condensation (C) domain. The A domain recognizes and activates the target amino acids at the expense of ATP. The adenylated intermediate is transferred to the phosphopantetheinyl arm tethered to a T domain. The C domain catalyzes peptide bond formation between sequential amino acids. Last, the additional thioesterase (TE) domain releases the mature peptide product via hydrolysis or cyclization3,4.", "Nonribosomal lipopeptides have fatty acyl chains at the N-terminus, which are introduced by a starter condensation (Cs) domain5\u20137 or a fatty acyl ligase8,9 frequently located at the initiation module of NRPS, and the fatty acyl chains of lipopeptides show significant effects on their biological activities and toxicities10,11. Interestingly, nonacylated products were found in some lipopeptide NRPS gene clusters12\u201315, mainly from the deacylation of lipopeptides mediated by acylases or peptidases16. The typical acylase PvdQ from pyoverdine biosynthesis belonging to the Ntn-hydrolase family was characterized, which was responsible for the cleavage of the myristate or myristoleate moiety from the N-terminal amino acid12. To date, the reported acylases PvdQ play vital roles in siderophore maturation and quorum sensing, as well as detoxification, by cleaving acyl chains in different bacterial taxa12,14,15.", "In addition to the well-known diverse acyl units at the N-terminus of nonribosomal lipopeptides, they also possess unusual moieties assembled at the C-terminus beyond the prediction of biosynthetic assembly lines. The additional C-terminal moieties include the amino acid residues that might be mediated by the TE domain, such as bacillothiazols17 and a threonine-tagged lipopeptide family18\u201322, and diverse terminal amines, such as diamine putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spe), agmatine (Agm), phenylethylamine (Pea), tryptamine (Tra), and tyramine (Tya)14,23\u201331. Putrescine is ubiquitously and abundantly distributed in living organisms32 and is used as a precursor of other polyamines, surfactants, siderophores, and agrochemicals33,34. Putrescine is fully protonated at physiological pH and is usually detected in the unmodified form, although Put is also modified for purposes of metabolic regulation and catabolism, such as N-acetylation and N-glutamylation, or for incorporation into specialized metabolites, such as N-methylation and N-hydroxylation35. Furthermore, the direct incorporation of unmodified Put into the C-terminus of several natural products was prevalent in some NRPs, which was widespread in Burkholderiales14,23\u201325. However, the biosynthetic mechanism of the Put moiety participating in the C-terminus of these NRPs remains elusive and controversial. At present, two speculations have been proposed based on the features of their NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs): one was that the C-terminal C domain might catalyze nascent peptide chain condensation with Put, such as malleobactins24 and bicornutin A28, and the other was that a VibH-like protein elsewhere in the chromosome involved in the condensation of putrescine, such as crochelin14.", "Genome sequencing reveals that the microbial genome is a massive and untapped trove of new metabolites36,37. Efficient strategies for the genome-driven discovery of novel natural products by awakening silent BGCs have been developed, such as functional promoter insertion in native producers and heterologous expression38,39. In our previous study, we successfully activated several silent/cryptic NRP BGCs in Burkholderiales strains by in-situ promoter insertion using the efficient recombineering system Red\u03b1\u03b27029 from Schlegelella brevitalea DSM 702919,40\u201342, a potential chassis for gram-negative bacterial natural products39,43. Herein, we identified a class of linear dodecapeptides, glidonins A-L (1-12), by triggering an NRPS BGC11 in the DSM 7029 strain40. The glidonins feature diverse modifications at the N-terminus and a putrescine moiety at the C-terminus. The biosynthetic pathway of glidonins was elucidated via in vivo genetic manipulation and in vitro biochemical assays. Moreover, the putrescine moiety could be added into potential peptides to generate novel and improved non-natural NRPs by bioengineering the termination module of NRPSs."]
