["Introduction", "Trimethoprim (TMP) is a bacteriostatic antibiotic of the diaminopyrimidine class. Of synthetic origin, as opposed to naturally derived antibiotics such as penicillins, it inhibits the growth of a range of aerobic bacteria including several Gram-positive and -negative pathogens [1]. First introduced in the 1960s [2], TMP is mainly employed in the treatment of urinary tract infections [3] as a single medication or in combination with sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. In susceptible bacteria, TMP inhibits the enzymatic reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by the bacterial FolA dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) [1]. This in turn disrupts DNA synthesis through the suppression of purine and pyrimidine production [4], thus abrogating microbial proliferation. TMP and co-trimoxazole are included in the recent list of essential medicines maintained by the World Health Organization [5].", "According to recent studies, TMP resistance is common in urinary tract infections caused by, for example, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. [6]. The observed prevalence of resistance may reflect the selective pressure due to frequent TMP administration [7]. However, other factors can promote the prevalence of TMP resistance, such as co-selection [8] in cases where resistance genes targeted at other antibiotics are found on the same genetic element such as transposons [9] or multi-resistance plasmids [2]. An increase in the abundance of TMP resistance in clinically relevant pathogens has been identified by several studies [10, 11] and a reversal of resistance through the sole reduction of TMP administration is unlikely to be achievable [12].", "At the mechanistic level, resistance may be due to mutations in the primary folA gene resulting in reduced TMP susceptibility [13], overproduction of such enzymes, selection toward a limited uptake or binding of TMP [14], or the action of efflux pumps [15]. The most important mechanism, however, appears to be the acquisition of type A dihydrofolate reductases (DfrA) which represent TMP-resistant variants of FolA [16, 17]. Unlike the primary FolA enzyme found in wild-type populations, DfrA variants allow bacterial cells to sustain DNA synthesis in the presence of moderate TMP levels [18]. Genes coding for DfrA were found on mobile genetic elements as early as the 1970s [9, 19, 20] and the clinical relevance of horizontal transmission of dfrA has been confirmed by case reports [21]. The dfrA genes emerged from both recent mutations in TMP-sensitive folA genes and pre-existing TMP-resistant folA genes, followed by mobilization in the resistome [17]. The CARD database [22] currently lists 57 members of the dfr gene family coding for TMP-resistant dihydrofolate reductases, many of which have been found on plasmids and within integron gene cassettes [23\u201325]. Most of these genes fall into the dfrA sub-family.", "The family of type B dihydrofolate reductases (DfrB) provides an alternative mechanism for TMP resistance. The dfrB genes share no significant sequence nor structural similarities with FolA and DfrA, indicative of a distinct evolutionary origin for this family [26, 27]. Although dfrB were originally identified in clinical samples [28, 29], their prevalence is currently unknown, as they have not been routinely searched for whether by PCR methods in earlier decades or more recently by genomic identification [6]. Hence, the limited amount of available data on the distribution of dfrB genes has impeded our understanding of their emergence.", "Only recently, two new variants of the dfrB family, dfrB10 and dfrB11 have been discovered and confirmed in their provision of high-level phenotypic TMP resistance [28]. Since then, ten additional variants labeled dfrB12 to dfrB21 have been identified in genome sequences of isolates and metagenomes based on homology, followed by experimental validation [30]. Some of these dfrB sequences originate from environmental samples where TMP exposure is supposed to be marginal. This gave rise to the hypothesis that the original selective advantage conferred by dfrB genes may be unrelated to TMP resistance [30]. However, this hypothesis was based on identification of dfrB sequences in few samples, which is why the possibility of contamination effects [31\u201333] cannot be excluded. Verification of the hypothesis was further hampered by data heterogeneity with regard to the origin of samples, the source of DNA (isolates vs. metagenomes), and sparse metainformation.", "In this study, we provide the first large-scale, statistically verified analysis of the prevalence of this emerging source of high TMP resistance by evaluating shotgun metagenomic sequences of both freshwater and wastewater environments (324 samples, 7 \u00d7109 high-quality sequences). We provide quantitative estimates on the abundance of dfrB genes in aquatic environments with and without strong human impact along with indicators of gene mobility. By comparing the distribution of particular gene variants across contrasting environments, our work contributes to the identification of the origin of dfrB which is a key to understanding the epidemiology of novel TMP resistance. In particular, our study highlights the possible role of environmental bacteria in the emergence of resistance to synthetic antimicrobials where evolutionary adaptation to naturally produced analogues did not take place."]
