["1. Introduction", "With the increasing number of drug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial resistance has become a global health threat [1]. As the number of approved drugs have been decreasing over the past few decades, finding new compounds to feed the antibiotic discovery pipeline has become a crucial task [2]. Most of the antibiotics are derived from secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by fungal and bacterial organisms [3]. Many of these so-called natural products were found by labor-intensive methods such as screening biological samples for desired bioactivities. However, these traditional methods have been losing their efficiency, due to their high rediscovery rates [4]. Ever since the cost of DNA sequencing technologies has decreased substantially, in silico methods such as genome mining have gained an increased amount of popularity among researchers [5,6]. As a result, a number of computational tools such as antiSMASH [7] and PRISM [8] have been developed, in order to detect gene clusters encoding for natural products. The main approach of these tools is the identification of locally clustered groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are in conjunction responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites [9]. Using those BGC prediction tools, a large number of BGCs have been deposited in public databases. The newest version of Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) [10], the largest database containing predicted BGCs, contains roughly 400,000 clusters, from which less than 1% have been experimentally verified. This large discrepancy emphasizes the need for new and updated tools as well as the importance of prioritization of predicted BGCs for downstream processes. In order to address this issue, in 2017, Alanjary et al. developed the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) [11] to detect most promising BGCs with potential new modes of action by automating the resistance based genome mining technique also called target directed genome mining. This approach is based on the notion that the antibiotic-producing bacteria have to be resistant to their own products [12]. Resistance genes can be encoded within the BGC of the respective compound. Additionally, in case of a resistance mechanism that is provided by a resistant target, this kind of genome mining method not only provides insights into the mode of action of the encoded antibiotics, but in turn also allows screening BGCs for natural products with promising and putatively novel targets [13]. ARTS links essential housekeeping genes to evolution driven events such as duplication, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), or co-localization within the BGC, which have been extensively shown to be the key processes in target-based strategies [14,15,16]. Although ARTS rapidly screens essential genes of an entire genome, the number of potential resistant targets can become quite large, especially when the BGC boundaries are set too far. In such cases, the distinction of a resistance gene and a regular housekeeping gene is hard to make. As stated by O\u2019Neill and his colleagues, inferring such distinctions may be possible, by comparing gene ortholog neighbors of the putative resistance genes and the context of the clusters they lie within in related organisms. Regular housekeeping genes often show synteny in their cluster structure, whereas the resistant target genes within antibiotic gene clusters are often only randomly present in closely related taxa [17]. Following up on this hypothesis, we analyzed the novobiocin producer Streptomyces niveus NCIMB 11891, with duplicated gyrB gene as known self-resistance mechanism, yielding a large number of false positives by an initial ARTS search shown in the first ARTS paper [11]. Visualized in Figure 1, the comparison of the neighborhoods of gene of interest (NGIs) to the NGIs from closely related organisms, clearly shows that the neighborhood of the housekeeping gene is almost identical, whereas the resistant target gene shows no orthologous genes in the neighborhood.", "While the housekeeping genes play an important role in target-directed genome mining approaches and BGC prioritization, the context of the gene neighborhood has not yet been focused on. In order to address this issue, here we introduce SYN-view, for further improvement of prioritization of the BGCs, based on a self-resistance approach. With the aid of phylogenetic methods such as autoMLST [18], which provides a high-resolution species tree of a strain of interest, SYN-view compares NGIs, based on user-provided target genes to homologous NGIs from closest relatives. Unlike other tools such as MultiGeneBlast [19], which blasts a complete cluster to a specific database to find similar clusters, our pipeline aims to distinguish a potential target resistance gene from regular housekeeping genes, by rapidly comparing NGIs from closely related taxa."]
