["1. Introduction", "Starting with the discovery of penicillin [1], humanity has been involved in a never-ending arms race between life-threatening bacterial pathogens and antibiotics, either natural, semisynthetic or completely synthetic. An estimation made by the United Nations Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance in 2014 predicted that the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will cause up to 10 million deaths per year by 2050 [2]. However, recent events might make this number even more grim: the worldwide health crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to an increase in antibiotic use and misuse, which, in turn, is likely to further accelerate AMR diffusion [3]. AMR has rendered many previously successful groups of antibiotics non-functional, leaving us hiding behind the \u201cthin red line\u201d of last-resort drugs, capable to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are a class of non-ribosomally synthesized, highly cross-linked, halogenated and glycosylated natural products, which are considered frontline drugs against Gram-positive MDR pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Clostridioides difficile, etc. [4].", "GPAs are produced by high G-C content soil-dwelling actinobacteria and could be divided into five types according to their chemical structures and molecular targets [5]. Types I\u2013IV are compounds having a cross-linked heptapeptide core highly glycosylated and/or lipidated; their molecular target in pathogens is lipid II [6], a highly conserved macromolecule among bacteria that is essential for cell-wall biosynthesis [7]. Types I\u2013IV GPAs form five hydrogen bonds with the d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) terminus of the lipid II pentapeptide stem (Figure 1a) [8,9,10,11]. Such binding terminates upstream transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions, preventing the formation of mature peptidoglycan (PG). An old term describes Types I\u2013IV GPAs very precisely: dalbaheptides [12], meaning d-Ala-d-Ala-binding antibiotics with heptapeptide structures. Lipid II is obviously involved in the cell wall biosynthesis of dalbaheptide producers as well. Thus, to avoid suicide during GPA production, producing strains need self-resistance mechanisms. This topic was recently revised in detail [13,14]. In brief, two main mechanisms of cell-wall remodeling exist in dalbaheptide-producers as well as in the resistant pathogens [15,16]. The first involves three genes\u2014vanHAX\u2014coding for: (i) an \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase, VanH, which stereospecifically reduces pyruvate to d-lactate (d-Lac); (ii) a d-Ala-d-Lac ligase, VanA; and (iii) a d,d-dipeptidase, VanX. VanX removes the d-Ala-d-Ala termini of lipid II pentapeptide stems, while VanA prepares a pool of d-Ala-d-Lac dipeptides, which MurF, a UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide ligase, installs instead of the terminal d-Ala-d-Ala. As a result, GPAs form four instead of five hydrogen bonds with such d-Ala-d-Lac termini, and the repulsion of lone electron pairs between oxygen atoms contributes to make these GPA-lipid II complexes unstable (Figure 1b). The second resistance mechanism requires the expression of a d,d-carboxypeptidase VanY, which cleaves the terminal d-Ala residues of lipid II pentapeptide stems, hampering GPA complex formation with such truncated lipid II derivatives (Figure 1c). So, the formed tetrapeptide-carrying lipid II molecules are still able to enter the transpeptidation and transglycosylation steps, yielding a 3-3 crosslinked mature peptidoglycan [17]. Expression of either vanHAX or vanY (known overall as van genes) is often inducible and regulated by a VanRS two-component regulatory pair. There, a sensor histidine kinase VanS (de)phosphorylates transcriptional regulator VanR in response to the extracellular presence of GPAs, and phosphorylated VanR activates the expression of the van genes involved in cell-wall remodeling. In dalbaheptide producers, van genes are always localized inside the borders of GPA biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which group genes devoted to antibiotic biosynthesis, transport and regulation, guaranteeing co-regulation of self-resistance with antibiotic production. The only exception is the chloroeremomycin BGC in Kibdelosporangium aridum A82846, which apparently does not include van genes [18].", "Type V GPAs are not glycopeptides sensu stricto, since they are not glycosylated; moreover, they are not dalbaheptides, since they include also nonapeptide antibiotics (such as corbomycin and GP6738 [19,20]), and they target autolysins (named also murein hydrolases) instead of lipid II. Autolysins are enzymes breaking the bonds within the peptidoglycan to allow bacterial growth and cell division [21]; thus, type V GPAs block cell-wall remodeling, arresting cell division. Consistently, type V GPA BGCs lack the cluster-situated van genes needed to remodel lipid II termini [19,22]. van genes are also missed in the related BGC of the uncrosslinked non-glycosylated peptide antibiotic known as feglymycin [23], which inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis targeting MurA (the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, catalyzing phosphoenolpyruvate transfer to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and MurB (the UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase, catalyzing the last step of the formation of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid), both acting at the cytoplasmic step of cell-wall biosynthesis. However, type V GPA and feglymycin BGCs carry genes for a two-component regulatory pair, consisting of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator, which remind VanS and VanR of dalbaheptide BGCs, but whose functions remains unclear.", "Intriguingly, functional van genes are also found in non-producing actinobacteria such as in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [24], as well as in various other environmental non-infectious low G-C content bacteria (such as Paenibacillus popilliae [25] or Bacillus circulans [26]). As a consequence, different hypotheses have been proposed to explain van gene distribution and evolution in bacteria. The most accredited one is that pathogens such as enterococci (and the GPA non-producing environmental bacteria) might have acquired van genes from dalbaheptide producers through a series of horizontal gene transfer events, likely promoted by the selective pressure exerted by antibiotic environmental contamination [27]. An alternative hypothesis suggests that pathogens received van genes from low G-C soil Gram-positives (Firmicutes phylum), as the above-mentioned Pnb. popilliae and Bac. circulans [28], implying that in these bacteria van genes evolved independently.", "To get an insight into the phylogeny of van genes, in this work we analyze their distribution and arrangement within the different orders belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum, using the genomic data available in public databases. We have investigated more than 7000 actinobacterial genomes and found van-like genes (defined hereafter vlgs) in more than one tenth of them. Thus, we can confirm that the presence of vlgs is not limited to the dalbaheptide producers, since these genes are also widely distributed among genomes of Type V GPA producers and in non-producing actinobacterial taxa, which do not need them for self-resistance. In addition, phylogenetic reconstructions made for VanY-like proteins as well as for the VanHAX triads and for the two-component VanS/VanR regulatory system, highlight the evolutionary independent stories of the corresponding gene acquisitions. Thanks to this comparative genomic analysis, novel transposon-like mobile elements carrying vlgs are here for the first time described, originating from poorly investigated orders such as Eggerthellales and Coriobacteriales. Finally, as a control, the same bioinformatic analysis was applied to more than 2000 Bacillales complete genome assemblies, which yielded only a few vlgs, often adjacent to transposase-like open reading frames (ORFs). Taken altogether, these data reveal that the phylum Actinobacteria is an incredibly vast source of variable GPA resistance determinants, which might potentially continue to move towards pathogens, contributing to the alarming diffusion of AMR. Their study might help the surveillance of AMR spread in compliance with the One-Health approach [29]."]
