["1. Introduction", "Biofilm formation in food processing industries can lead to health risks and financial losses for consumers, leading to unproductive resource consumption. Biofilms are well-organized microbial aggregates embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix and adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces [1,2,3]. Biofilms are generally defined as a cluster of microbes that thrive on biotic and abiotic systems and surfaces [4]. However, they are not simply a part of a \u201cgathering\u201d, but are instead very active, 3D, dynamic, and possess complex functionalities. Although the term \u201cbiofilm\u201d itself does not have a widely accepted definition, according to Lewandowski et al. [3], it can be defined as follows: \u201ca biofilm is considered to be an aggregate of microorganisms embedded in a matrix composed of microbially produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and attached to a surface\u201d. As a result of evolution, by exhibiting homeostatic responses and gene regulations, the biofilms help microorganisms to proliferate in extreme environments [5].", "1.1. Stages of Biofilm Formation", "Microorganisms undertake multiple steps to form biofilms, such as initial attachment, microcolony formation, maturation, and dispersion [1], as shown in Figure 1. The initial contact of the bacteria with a substrate is reversible. Multiple physical and chemical forces, such as electrostatic and cohesive forces, play a vital role at this stage. The appendage structures, like the fimbria and pili, present on the cell membrane strengthen the bacteria\u2013surface attachment. After getting attached to the surface, the bacteria start to divide and multiply. During this developmental stage, extracellular matrix formation takes place [6]. This matrix encompasses an extracellular polysaccharide substance (EPS) and structural proteins, among other components, which keep the colony safe from external variables, and this phase is called \u201cirreversible attachment\u201d [1]. Microcolonies form during this irreversible stage of attachment. Microcolony formation gives rise to cell\u2013cell communication (quorum sensing) [6,7]. Bacteria in the microcolonies use \u201cquorum sensing\u201d to exchange information among themselves, and this enables the EPS to modify in response to and withstand any changes in the environment (such as pH, temperature, pressure, concentration and shear stresses). Based on this communication, the bacterial behavior can become more cooperative, competitive, or mutually beneficial [8]. The formation of small channels within the microcolonies facilitates nutrient distribution among the bacteria in biofilms [5]. The last stage of biofilm formation is characterized by the natural dispersion of bacteria from existing microcolonies. When the bacteria become naturally detached from their biofilm, either as single cells or as a cluster, they seek to colonize their environment, thereby acquiring new sites in the system, and this gives rise to an even further increase in biofilm formation [9].", "1.2. Social Dynamics: Cooperative and Competitive Interactions in Biofilm Consortia", "As mentioned earlier, biofilms have been involved in the evolutionary biology of bacteria competing for nutrients, co-evolving with other organisms via either inter-dependency or by opportunistically exploiting other bacterial species, allowing them to evolve and sustain in nature. When multiple bacteria exist in a consortium and form a biofilm, they engage in social behaviors such as quorum sensing, and metabolic competitive or cooperative interactions [10]. By taking the form of such a group, these bacteria make multiple survival decisions based on external stressors such as UV light, temperature, pH, pressure, and antimicrobial agents. The definitions of these behaviors are often confounding because an advantageous behavior for one species can be detrimental for the other; so, it can be confusing whether to define a specific behavior as cooperative, because one of the species is flourishing, or as competitive (antagonistic), because the other species is on the verge of being removed from that environment. Cooperative interactions can lead to the formation of desirable spatial organizations that enhance the supply of nutrients throughout biofilms [11]. Besides this, coaggregation plays a vital role in biofilm formation via the involvement of specific surface structure such as pili and flagella. Cooperative interactions can also protect the biofilms from antimicrobial agents by producing strong EPS. A study by Lee et al. [12] discovered this behavior when using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas protegens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to form multi-species biofilms. The spatial structures of the multi-species biofilms were different, but they were also more resistant to antimicrobials than single-species biofilms. More importantly, Bridier et al. [13] reported that Pseudomonas biofilms could alter their exopolymer matrix to increase their resistance against antimicrobials, such as chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, or triclosan. While spatial distribution is an inherent morphological attribute of biofilms, it is strongly influenced by chemical stressors.", "Competitive interactions in multi-species generally arise due to the limited availability of nutrients [14]. It can be debated as to whether biofilms prefer competitive or cooperative behaviors. Nonetheless, these behaviors lead to the expression of virulence factors, antibacterial proteins, and gene expressions. For example, competition can alter the quorum-sensing response of the bacterial species in biofilms [15]. In multi-species biofilms of P. aeruginosa and E. coli, the sustenance of E. coli is determined by the production of indole by the E. coli bacteria. However, when the E. coli mutates, its mutants may not synthesize indole, which should result in the abundant growth of P. aeruginosa with subsequent reduction in E. coli populations. However, indole blocks the toxins and quorum sensing phenotypes of P. aeruginosa, thus benefitting E. coli survival [16]. Table 1 summarizes some of the recent studies related to the social behavior of biofilms.", "1.3. Influence of Fluid Dynamics on Biofilm Formation", "Irrespective of the bacterial strains, some of the common factors such as equipment surfaces, environmental conditions, and hydrodynamic shear forces involved in the movement of foods at the food processing plants, as well as water/chemical use during cleaning and sanitation could influence biofilm formation. Biofilms show a very peculiar response to these external factors, including temperature, humidity, pH, and flow conditions such as static flow, rotary flow and circulatory flows, as well as the sanitation regime. Under laminar flow, the biofilms take the form of mound-shaped microcolonies, whereas under turbulent flows, their structure is more filamentous and somewhat streamlined, with a defined \u201chead\u201d and \u201ctail\u201d [25]. Moreira et al. [26] reported the effects of shear stress on biofilm formation. In their study, an increase in E. coli biofilm formation was observed at the lowest shear stress of 0.183 Pa compared to a higher shear stress of 0.365 Pa. However, contrary results regarding the biofilm and shear stress relationship were also reported [27,28]. This study compared shear stress values of 0.007 (laminar), 0.02 (transition) and 0.07 N/m2 (turbulent), and observed higher biofilm development under turbulent flow. These observations suggest that the formation of biofilms under laminar or turbulent flows may also depend on the fluid dynamics involved in the biofilm equipment used to evaluate the effects of the hydrodynamic shear stresses applied.", "Fluid flow conditions are commonly classified into laminar, transition or turbulent regions using the Reynolds number [29], which is a dimensionless number that was developed in 1883 by Osborne Reynold [30]. For a smooth circular pipe, the flow is considered to be laminar if Re < 2100, transient if 2100 < Re < 10,000, and fully turbulent if Re > 10,000 [29]. The exact values used for classifying the flow depend on the conduit\u2019s geometry, the surface roughness, the fluid viscosity and other flow parameters. Typically, laminar flows are classified by a constant local velocity with respect to time, transition flows with intermittent bursts of turbulence or mixtures of flow streams, and turbulent flows with random fluctuations among the flow streams.", "Fysun et al. [31] reported the effects of flow hydrodynamics on biofilm development using Pseudomonas fragi and pasteurized milk containing Streptococcus spp., Bacillus spp., and Micrococcus spp. They confirmed that laminar flow contributed more significantly to biomass (mg/cm2) formation than turbulent flow. The authors noted that in the laminar flow region, biofilm development was primarily influenced by mass transport, and in the turbulent flow region, it was heavily influenced by shear stress. Furthermore, the flow conditions in the bioreactor itself were frequently simplified. However, certain details of the study, such as the locations of the coupons, the attachment mechanisms of the coupon to the pipe, the length of the pipe, the bacteria\u2019s residence time, as well as results of flow analysis, were unavailable. It is crucial to know the coupon location, the coupon size, and the effects of coupon placement on flow disturbances (flushed/non-flushed), if any. Such knowledge will help in avoiding flow separations, bubble formations and local eddies that might occur at the site [32]. Also, the strategic positioning of the coupons is required to ensure that the samples are collected from different locations of the tube, instead of placing them in the same positions around the circumference [33]. It is equally important to investigate whether the probability of biofilm formation is uniform throughout the flow channel and to ensure the recirculation of flow in the tubes [34]. The presence of gradients can induce variability in the environment of biofilm formation [34,35], which requires investigation, specifically in the flow path and nutrient reservoir.", "Similarly, a study by Oder et al. [36] highlighted the behavior of biofilm formation using E. coli under different hydrodynamic shear stresses (static, laminar and turbulent). The study traced the advances in cell multiplication over periods of 24, 48, and 72 h. The initial inoculum was 7 log CFU/mL, and nutrient broth was used as a growth medium with no subsequent addition of nutrients to the system. During the first 24 h, higher E. coli populations were recovered from biofilms under turbulent flow than static and laminar flow conditions. However, this trend was reversed after 72 h of exposure to the flow conditions, with the lowest E. coli populations seen under turbulent flows. The lower cell multiplication rate under turbulent flows was attributed to the numerous bacterial presence, leading to increased competition for nutrient consumption. Overall, the biomass of biofilms under laminar flow increased, whereas under turbulent flow, it decreased over time on the stainless-steel surfaces.", "Another significant aspect of flow hydrodynamics affecting biofilm development was investigated by Lemos et al. [37] using Bacillus cereus for biofilm formation under turbulent flow conditions. The shear stresses used for this study were approximately 0.02, 0.12, and 0.17 Pa, and the Reynolds numbers of agitation were 1000, 3200, and 4000, respectively, under the turbulent flow regime. In this study, the biomass content was the lowest for biofilms formed under low shear stress. Similarly, cell density and the extracellular polysaccharide content were also lower under low shear stress. Further, the biofilm density increased, while its thickness decreased, under turbulent flow. Biofilms subjected to turbulent flow not only showed an increased cell density (bacterial population per cm2), but also showed an increased volumetric density (mg/cm3) and biofilm mass (mg/cm2). Vieira [38] investigated the effects of laminar and turbulent flow at Re values of 2000 and 5200, respectively, on Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm formation. The findings of this study resonate with the findings derived by Lemos et al. [37], who reported that the biofilms showed a higher cellular density and increased mass per cm2 under turbulent flows. The use of a rotating cylindrical reactor (RCR) in simulating the flows in elbows or pockets used in a specific industry might require the correlation of the flow specifics of these devices. Pipe fittings such as elbows or dead ends are involved in the back-mixing of the fluid. Rotating annular cylinders might induce the development of vortices on their surfaces. Also, the presence of multiple cylinders in the RCR might result in vortices interfering in the section between the two cylinders, leading to laminar flow with eddies or turbulence, especially when the desired flow is laminar. This specific area of correlation between the bioreactors and the pipe fittings\u2019 actual dimensions has been overlooked in studies [37].", "Several authors have recognized the effects of different flow conditions on biofilm formation. One of the flow patterns involves the \u201cmixing\u201d of different liquids or semi-solid foods, which is a ubiquitous operation in the food processing industry. To promote fluid motion in a homogenized mixture of bacterial cultures, the selection of a suitable size and type of impeller, as well as the blade number and blade curvature, are all essential. Usually, two-blade impellers are used for the smooth mixing of fluid in the industrial setting [39]. At the bottom of the tank, eddies may form where the impeller blade almost touches the surface but with no friction, and this could reduce the flow velocity near the bottom of the tank. Similar observations were also made by Ismadi et al. [40]. According to their study, a region with higher shear stress developed at the base of the spinner flask bioreactor, and a recirculation structure formed in the bioreactor. However, the impeller\u2019s position did not directly impact the bioreactor\u2019s shear stress.", "In continuous-stirring tank reactors (CSTRs), different impellers can be used based on various factors, such as fluid viscosity and desired flow patterns. A unique feature of CSTRs is that the fluid flows in and out of the reactor continuously. Therefore, the environment inside the bioreactor can become unstable. According to Kadic et al. [41], maintaining residence time of bacteria is important in order to achieve a uniform environment throughout the batch process. Reactor geometry and material \u201cin flow\u2013out flow\u201d play essential roles in maintaining the residence time. Stirred tank reactors (STRs) can display significant levels of back-mixing of fluids. If the eddies generated in the STRs are the same size as the bacterial cells, then the reactor\u2019s hydrodynamics can damage the bacterial cell wall. Thus, STRs are suitable for use with shear-resistive microorganisms. Furthermore, Csapai et al. [42] compared the effects of flow and electric field on biofilm formation in a microfluidic device, and found that biofilms grown under static conditions were well defined compared to biofilms subjected to the low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min (Reynold\u2019s number of 1.49 and flow velocity of 0.69 mm/s). The fluid flow conditions and flow parameters used in some biofilm studies are summarized in Table 2.", "1.4. Influence of Surface Material on Biofilm Formation", "Existing studies in the broader literature offer a wide-ranging perspective on the effects of abiotic surfaces on microbial attachment [53,54,55]. Some of the factors reasoned to impact biofilm formation include surface roughness, hydrophobicity, material properties, surface charge and surface finish. De-la-Pinta et al. [56] studied the effects of polycarbonate, silicone, titanium, borosilicate, and Teflon on the biofilm-forming abilities of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and a C. albicans. In their study, the surface materials were machine-finished to alter their surface roughness using silicon carbide grinding papers with grit numbers 320, 800, 1200, and 4000. They observed that modifying the surface roughness affected the wettability of the surface. Surface hydrophobicity is not an inherent physical property of a material, and it can be altered via changes in surface roughness. Teflon, silicone, and polycarbonates are classified as more hydrophobic, and overall, E. coli biofilm formation was higher on these materials. This is a noteworthy observation because of the conventional and acceptable use of Teflon on the coatings of cookware. In general, if the diameters of the bacteria were greater than the degree of surface roughness of the material, staphylococcal biofilms were found to be sparse. This observation was contradicted when the untreated surface was compared with a surface polished with a 4000-grit smoother. The results of this study imply that the degree of symmetry of surface heights on the mean plane (Ssk) might play an essential role in determining the degree of microbial attachment to the surface. According to this study, the prevalence of peaks on a surface promoted microbial attachment irrespective of the surface roughness. Goulter-Thorsen et al. [57] indicated that E. coli O157 cells attached in higher numbers to the smoother stainless steel surface (#8 finish) when compared to the rough surface (#2 finish). While De-la-Pinta et al. [56] observed that modifying the surface roughness affected the contact angle, Goulter-Thorsen et al. [57] did not see a significant difference in the contact areas of SS with different surface finishes. On the contrary, other studies have suggested that neither surface hydrophobicity nor surface irregularities influenced bacterial attachment [58].", "Cheng et al. [59] utilized a fermenter bioreactor to cultivate Acetobacter xylinum biofilms on plastic composite support materials used for cellulose production. The cellulose obtained from the support material in the bioreactor exhibited superior mechanical strength when compared to cellulose produced in an agitated culture. Roveto et al. [60] evaluated the impacts of nitrifying biofilms on PDMS-Methyl, PDMS-Ester, and PDMS-Amine surfaces in annular batch-type bioreactors using Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira bacteria. In their study, the higher surface energy of the amine surface resulted in the increased adhesion of these bacteria compared to the degree of attachment to hydroxyl and methyl surfaces. In contrast, the uncharged hydrophilic surfaces lacked a diverse range of species in their biofilms, and were primarily dominated by Acinetobacter biofilms. Vongkampang et al. [61] investigated biofilm formation using Caldicellulosiruptor kronotskyensis and Caldicellulosiruptor owensensis in a continuous flow process applied to jacketed glass using acrylic fibers and chitosan. The combination of acrylic fibers and chitosan contributed to stable biofilm formation due to the production of t\u0101pirin proteins by the bacteria, which facilitated greater attachment to lignocellulosic substrates. Recently, Yang et al. [62] investigated the biofilm formation of Salmonella Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 in static bioreactors containing stainless-steel coupons. The degree of attachment of these pathogens varied with the bacteria used, and they attached more efficiently to surfaces compared to other bacteria used in meat processing.", "Stoodley et al. [25] have reported on the effects of hydrodynamic forces on bacterial biofilm detachment. They studied the mechanical properties of P. aeruginosa biofilms formed using an in-vitro flow cell under various hydrodynamic conditions, and subsequent biofilm deformation and detachment. The two sets of experiments undertaken focused on biofilm formation under laminar flow with a Reynolds number of 8, 0.002 m/s flow velocity, and 0.03 N/m2 shear stress, and under turbulent flow with a Reynolds number of 3600, 1 m/s flow velocity, and 5.09 N/m2 shear stress. Even though the authors intended to study deformation under shearing forces, the biofilms\u2019 irregular structures gave rise to complex local flow patterns. The forces acting on the biofilms were a combination of shear and normal forces. Interestingly, the biofilms formed under laminar flow showed isotropic surface patterns compared to the biofilms formed under turbulent flow (Figure 2). The turbulent flow biofilms had a structure with a pronounced \u201chead\u201d and \u201ctail\u201d. Biofilms formed under turbulent flows featured filamentous streamers oriented in the downstream direction. These biofilms showed \u201cnecking\u201d (a peculiar phenomenon specific to ductile materials) during their failure under externally applied shear stress [25]. Most importantly, this research deduced a relationship between the shear force used for biofilm growth and the applied shear force required to detach the biofilm. According to this study, the cells started to detach when the applied external shear stress increased to approximately twice the shear stress under which the biofilm formation occurred. Moreover, they observed that the P. aeruginosa behaved like a viscoelastic fluid when attached to the substrate.", "Another significant study on biofilm detachment undertaken by Stewart [63] mentioned that the biofilms would detach if the applied external stress exceeded its failure strength (the applied force per unit area required for the biofilm to break). Also, this author recognized that biofilms are inherently heterogeneous. Paul et al. [64] provided a rare insight into the biofilm detachment mechanism, showing that the biofilm resists detachment at increasing shear stresses when undergoing compaction caused by the applied external forces. By conducting a 2D image analysis, they also observed a \u201cbasal layer\u201d, where the biofilm was more cohesive and denser than in the outer layers.", "Biofilms exist on biotic and abiotic surfaces in nature. In industrial settings, microbial biofilms are found on various surfaces in food processing plants, such as on dispensing tubing, heat exchangers, silos, pipelines, conveyor belts, tables, pallet jacks, walls, water pump exteriors, employees\u2019 gloves, contact surfaces, as well as packing materials [31,65]. Generally, equipment employed in the food industry is made of materials such as stainless-steel, Teflon, glass, silicone, polycarbonate and synthetic rubber. Previous studies have shown that the formation of biofilms on these surfaces depends on factors including surface properties, such as hydrophobicity and topography, fluid flow conditions, as well as the physicochemical properties of the bacteria, such as the activation of genetic cascades, the age of bacteria and the presence of exopolymeric substances [66,67]. The influence of surface properties, such as hydrophobicity and surface topography, on the biofilm formation capacity of E. coli is not well understood. While some studies have concluded that abiotic surface roughness determines the outcome of biofilm development [57,68], other studies have found that a substrate\u2019s hydrophobicity plays a vital role in biofilm formation [56]. Thus, biofilms\u2019 abundance on a given abiotic surface might depend on multiple factors, such as the substrates present and the physicochemical properties of the bacteria. Further research is needed to understand the fundamental factors that may determine harmful biofilm formation in food processing industries. Investigations seeking new biofilm removal techniques should replicate the bacterial strains, substrate materials, flow hydrodynamics and overall environment encountered in the food processing context to ensure effective intervention. To ensure these experimental parameters, it is imperative to select bioreactors to be used in biofilm studies that simulate industrial or processing conditions. Bioreactors offer a controlled environment that helps investigators to study the multiple variables affecting biofilm formation. These variables include the surface characteristics of materials, nutrient composition and availability, bacterial characteristics and their interactions, fluid flow conditions, and environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and OR potential. Further, biofilm studies can be undertaken to develop subsequent intervention strategies to be used in the removal of biofilms from surfaces. Multiple types of bioreactors that are available for investigation in terms of operational mode, with static or dynamic principles, are discussed here."]
