["Introduction", "ABC-F ATPases are members of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily. Unlike other ABC proteins, the ABC-Fs are translation factors and some of them, termed antibiotic resistance ABC-Fs (ARE ABC-Fs), confer resistance to clinically important antibiotics that target the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and/or the nascent peptide exit tunnel (NPET)1\u20137. ABC-F proteins are composed of two ABC domains joined by a linker domain called P-site tRNA-interaction motif (PtIM)8,9, also termed antibiotic resistance determinant (ARD) for ARE ABC-Fs1\u20133. The two ABC domains dimerize upon binding of two ATP molecules and in this conformation the factor can bind to the ribosomal E site9, where the PtIM adopts an \u03b1-helical hairpin conformation that directly interacts with the peptidyl-tRNA and extends toward the PTC/NPET. Three antibiotic resistance phenotypes are associated with ARE ABC-Fs: (i) Macrolides, Ketolides, Streptogramins group B (MKSB); (ii) Pleuromutilins, Lincosamides, Streptogramins group A (PLSA); (iii) Phenicols, Oxazolidinones (PhO)10,11. However, despite structural investigations1\u20133,5,7, some questions remain about the exact molecular mechanism of action of ARE ABC-Fs.", "Over the last 40 years, biochemical and structural investigations demonstrated that the nascent chains (NC,) which elongate into the ribosomal tunnel, can interact with metabolites or antibiotics, thus adapting protein synthesis to environmental cues12\u201316. In human pathogens, antibiotic-dependent formation of stalled ribosome complexes (SRCs) on regulatory ORFs, named leader peptides, can subsequently allow the regulation of downstream resistance genes in response to antibiotic exposure17\u201320.", "The ARE ABC-F gene msrD is a member of the msr (macrolide and streptogramin B resistant) gene group previously referred to as mel21,22. This gene is generally found in operon with a macrolide efflux facilitator (mefA or mefE) gene and the two corresponding proteins act synergistically to confer macrolide resistance23\u201326. This operon is a part of the Macrolide Efflux Genetic Assembly (MEGA)27,28 that disseminates in human pathogens on numerous mobile genetic elements: conjugative transposons (tn916-type)29 and conjugative prophages (\u03a61207.3)30 among Streptococci; conjugative plasmids (pMUR050)31 among Enterobacteria. In Streptococci, the operon is transcribed in the presence of erythromycin (ERY) as a polycistronic mRNA from a single promoter located \u223c350\u2009bp upstream of the mefA32,33 gene (Fig.\u00a01a). It is also regulated by ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation via the MefAL leader peptide (MTASMRLR), which is closely related to the ErmDL leader peptide (MTHSMRLRFPTLNQ), both polypeptides harboring the characteristic macrolide-arrest motif Arg/Lys-X-Arg/Lys, so called \u201c+x\u2009+\u2009\u201d motif14,33\u201335.Fig. 1Translation factor MsrD alleviates erythromycin effects upon translation in vivo.a Organization of mefA/msrD macrolide resistance operon.

The presence of ERY induces ribosomal stalling on the previously identified msrDL leader peptide (encoding MYLIFM)34, allowing RNA polymerase (RNAP) to bypass an intrinsic terminator. Our findings demonstrate that the stalling occurs due to hampered translation termination on the UAA stop codon, and inhibition of action of both release factors 1 and 2 (RF1 and RF2). Our results are supported by the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of MsrDL-SRC that provides molecular insights on how the PTC precludes productive accommodation of RF1/RF2 and how the NC discriminates tunnel-bound cladinose-containing macrolides. The path of the NC within the tunnel greatly differs from previously described leader peptides12\u201316 with the NC latching into a ribosomal crevice, that was shown to be conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. This crevice is delimited by the 23\u2009S rRNA nucleotides U2584, U2586, G2608 and C2610 that may form a ribosomal functional site. Finally, our results demonstrate that the two ATPase sites of MsrD are functionally asymmetric and the protein can negatively self-regulate its own synthesis in the presence of ERY."]
