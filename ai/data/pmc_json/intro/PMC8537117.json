["1. Introduction", "Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) is a transmissible, uncultivable fungus responsible for severe pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) remains the most frequent AIDS defining infection in HIV-infected patients in developed countries. In France, PCP represents 30% of the annually reported 1200 AIDS cases [1]. PCP also affects immunosuppressed patients not infected with HIV [2,3]. PCP occurs in 5\u201315% of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in the absence of prophylaxis, with a mortality rate up to 49% [4,5]. The frequency of PCP seems to increase in SOT recipients, specifically in renal transplant recipients (RTR), particularly when the transplantation is not recent, when the patients are no longer subjected to PCP prophylaxis and when the acquisition of P. jirovecii is nosocomial [6].", "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a widely used anti-rejection treatment included in immunosuppressive regimens for SOT recipients. It targets the inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme involved in de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. MPA specifically inhibits the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes, since these cells synthesize de novo purines while other human cells can use alternate pathways for this synthesis [7]. Therefore, MPA is a powerful immunosuppressive drug. The resulting immunosuppression leads to opportunistic infection occurrence [8]. Nevertheless, data on the occurrence of PCP in patients treated with MPA are contradictory. MPA may have an antifungal activity on Pneumocystis. Oz and Hughes used a rat model which demonstrated that none of the animals treated with MPA alone or in association with dexamethasone developed PCP whereas 90% of rats treated with dexamethasone or tacrolimus alone developed PCP after 4 weeks of treatment [9]. Husain and Singh showed that PCP frequency in RTR treated with MPA was significantly lower than in RTRs without MPA treatment (0/1068 vs. 10/563, p = 0.00006) [8]. On the other hand, we have published three series of PCP case clusters in RTR and heart transplant recipients (HTR) and noted the occurrence of 38 PCP cases in patients effectively treated with MPA [10,11,12]. Considering these aforementioned observations, the putative antifungal activity of MPA on P. jirovecii remains a subject of debate. Conversely, MPA is known to have an in vitro antifungal activity on other fungal species which is useful in fundamental mycology [13].", "The emergence of pathogen strains under selection pressure is widespread in microbiology and also observed for P. jirovecii [11,14]. In this context, the hypothesis of the emergence of particular genotypes/phenotypes of P. jirovecii under MPA selection pressure is relevant. The objective of the present study was to investigate this field and we retrospectively sequenced the impdh gene of P. jirovecii isolates from SOT recipients treated with MPA and a control group of non-SOT recipients with no prior exposure to MPA."]
