["1. Introduction", "Antibiotics have been widely used in disease prevention and treatment for animals and humans. In the mid-1950s, scientists obtained multidrug-resistant bacteria through isolation and culture [1]. At that time, people were aware of the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and drug resistance genes, and they attracted widespread attention. A report published by the WHO states that antibiotic resistance has become increasingly serious and will seriously threaten human health, and it suggests that this topic should receive increasing attention [2]. In current research, ARGs are emerging environmental pollutants and are widely distributed in soil, air, and water, while human activities have promoted the spread of ARGs [3].", "Due to the increasing use of antibiotics in agricultural production and livestock breeding, antibiotic resistance has become increasingly severe [4]. Antimicrobials constitute more than 6% of all prescriptions in human medicine, and more than 70% of all consumed pharmaceuticals in veterinary medicine [5]. For example, it is reported that in Turkey, antibacterial drugs used to treat diseased animals and used as a prophylactic or to promote the growth of the undiseased animals account for 33% of the total veterinary pharmaceutical consumption [6]. In Denmark, consumption of antibiotics in 1997 exceeded more than 150 t, out of which >100 t were used as growth promoters [7], while there was an increase of nearly 80-fold in antibiotic usage for growth promotion within a span of four decades in the US [8]. A similar increase in antibiotic usage has been observed in several other countries (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, the EU) [9]. In particular, China uses more than 46% of the world\u2019s antibiotics to ensure growth augmentation and disease control in livestock industries [10,11]. However, only a small concentration of consumed antibiotics can be absorbed because most antibiotics are excreted into the environment through excrement, and manure is considered an important reservoir for environmental antibiotic contamination [12,13]. Therefore, in the environmental microbiota, unprocessed manure contains large amounts of ARGs and antibiotic residues [14,15]. To increase animal immunity and yield, antibiotics (especially tetracyclines (TCs), sulfonamides (SAs), and fluoroquinolones (FLQs)) are widely used as veterinary drugs and growth promoters in the farming industry [16,17]. TCs, SAs, and FLQs have been detected in liquid manure and dung samples at up to 46, 91, and 8.3 mg kg\u22121, respectively [18]. Repeated fertilization of agricultural soils with animal manure can lead to a nonpoint source contamination of the terrestrial environment with these substances, and in turn, accumulation of them in agricultural soils. Studies of the occurrence of various antimicrobials in different soils fertilized with animal manure reported the maximum concentrations of 0.3 mg kg\u22121, 0.015 mg kg\u22121, and 0.37 mg kg\u22121 for TCs, SAs, and FLQs, respectively [18,19,20]. Of all antibiotics, 22% of SAs and 66% of TCs are used in the animal industry. For swine, the frequency of ARGs carried by bacteria seems to be especially high compared to that of other livestock due to the extensive use of antibiotics in these animals. In addition, the concentration of TC reached as high as 300 mg kg\u22121 soil, which demonstrates that repeated fertilization with liquid manure from intensive pig farming leads to the accumulation of this antibiotic [21]. When soil received raw or digested manure, vegetables may be contaminated by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The misuse and overuse of continuous emissions into the environment of antibiotics has raised concerns over the risk of promoting antibiotic resistance [22,23,24].", "In Shandong Province, approximately 30% of the annual agricultural product income comes from the livestock breeding industry, and it trends upward year by year. By the end of 2018, the number of live pigs in livestock farms in Shandong Province was 46.6 million, and studies have found that antibiotics that can be completely absorbed by animals account for less than 70% of the total antibiotics used and that most are excreted [25,26]. In addition, antibiotics affect cell functions, change the expression of virulence factors, and result in the transfer of antibiotic resistance at subinhibitory concentrations. However, resistance to antibiotics is a highly complex process that is not completely understood, even in clinical environments. Therefore, although direct sunlight drying, indoor air drying, composting, and other bioconversion treatments have been used for the utilization and treatment of manure in large livestock and poultry farms [27], livestock manure is widely used in agricultural production and current processes do not have sufficient capacity to address emerging environmental contaminants such as antibiotics, resistant bacteria and ARGs (The 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Modern Animal Husbandry in Shandong Province (2016\u20132020)).", "In this work, four livestock manures were studied. Changes in physicochemical properties (pH, C, N, NH4+-N, and NO3\u2212-N) and antibiotic residues (sulfadiazine (SDZ), oxytocin (OTC), sulfamethazine (SMZ), chlortetracycline (CTC), sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMN), TC, ofloxacin (Oflox), doxycycline (Dox), and enrofloxacin (Enroflox)) before and after composting were determined. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate changes in bacterial community characteristics; high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) targeting 285 ARGs, 10 mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and 16S rRNA marker genes was used to characterize the ARGs in organic fertilizers before and after compositing. Bipartite network analysis was used to reveal the ARGs shared between uncomposted organic fertilizers and compost-treated organic fertilizers. To explore how antibiotic resistance in organic fertilizers changes before and after composting, the effect of composting on organic fertilizers and the relationships of physicochemical properties, microbial community and ARGs were analyzed. The outcome will provide important theoretical support for the rational utilization of organic fertilizer in agriculture and the effective disposal of wastes."]
