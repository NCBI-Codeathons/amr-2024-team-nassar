["1. Introduction", "Natural products (NPs), which are produced by bacteria, plants, fungi, animals, and other living cells, have been an inspiration for pharmaceutics and other biological agents such as herbicides and insecticides. In theory, NPs are structurally optimized to interact with biological targets after several hundred millennia of evolution [1] and, therefore, have a higher chance of being bioavailable than traditional small molecule drugs [2]. NPs are often categorized into primary and secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites include nutrients and building blocks for cellular maintenance, whereas secondary metabolites endow their producers with selective advantages in ecological niches and help them survive under dynamic environments [3]. For instance, some secondary metabolites function as antibiotics, pigments, and growth hormones [4]. Thus, secondary metabolite NPs have been targeted as novel drug leads with potent bioactivities, with more than 30% of approved small molecule drugs being bacterial secondary metabolites [5].", "The synthesis of these compounds is catalyzed by enzymes. For bacterial and fungal secondary metabolites that had their genetic basis elucidated, the genes encoding such enzymes tended to cluster close together in the genome. These clusters are termed biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [6]. Other relevant genes, such as those involved in the regulation, transport, and resistance to the self-produced compounds, can be found in or alongside the BGCs [7]. Biosynthesis enzymes of secondary metabolites have been extensively studied because of the unprecedented chemical transformations they can catalyze in different compound scaffolds [8]. Bacterial secondary metabolites can be classified according to their chemical scaffolds and signature biosynthesis enzymes that synthesize their core structures. Classes of secondary metabolites include polyketides, peptide-derived NPs, isoprenoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, nucleotide-based NPs, phenylpropanoids, and glycosylated NPs [9], which can be further divided into subclasses according to their additional features or chemical modifications.", "Traditionally, the discovery of novel secondary metabolites with potent bioactivities from the pool of NPs produced by a bacterium or a microbial consortium involves a culture-first process. In this approach, the NP production occurs chronologically as follows: isolation of microorganism(s) of interest, culturing the microbe(s) under different conditions to induce NP production, and purification of desired products through chemical extraction. To test the presence of NPs with desirable bioactivities, bioassays are conducted on bacterial culture, extracted fractions, or purified products to study their effects on various organisms or human disease models, a process known as bioactivity-guided screening [10]. This traditional NP discovery pipeline does not require prior knowledge of a producer\u2019s genome nor its biosynthesis capability, and, thus, it is termed the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach [11]. Although the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach has facilitated the discovery of numerous therapeutic NPs, it suffers from several pitfalls. For instance, it leads to the re-isolation or rediscovery of known compounds produced by different bacterial species, because multiple species can produce the same NP [12,13]. Moreover, some secondary metabolites are difficult to be detected, purified, and examined through bioassays because they are produced at trace concentrations. Cultivation under laboratory conditions may not provide all the environmental stimuli required to produce the desired secondary metabolites. A significant percentage of microflora have been nonculturable in the laboratory, making it difficult to identify their NPs [14].", "An alternative to the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach mentioned above is to search bacterial genomes for the NP biosynthesis machineries [15]. This genome-mining-based approach, known as the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach, leverages the abundance and availability of genomic data, bioinformatics analysis, and genetic manipulation tools to search for BGCs encoding novel NPs [11]. These data-mining approaches often utilize signature genes and conserved protein domains of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of different types of NPs in their search. These enzymes have highly conserved amino acid sequences, despite their ability to generate diverse families of compounds; hence, they can be used as seeds or reference sequences for identifying gene homologs and, therefore, novel BGCs [16]. Before cheap and fast genome sequencing techniques became available, detecting such conserved sequences of target NPs in genomic libraries was achieved by using probes in Southern hybridization experiments or degenerate primers for PCR-based detection [17]. Today, gene homologs can be detected through in silico approaches [18], many of which utilize BLAST searches [19] or profile-based analyses such as HMMER searches to characterize the target NP BGCs and search for novel BGCs in genomic data [20]. The genomic approach also allows for the genetic manipulation of biosynthesis pathways to improve yield, activation of silent BGCs, and heterologous expression of BGCs in a host; it also provides a direct link between a metabolite and its genetic origins [21]."]
