["1. Introduction", "Functionalized interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels have piqued the interest of researchers as potential materials in a wide range of medical and environmental applications, including affinity chromatography, immobilization technologies, drug-delivery systems and organic dyes and heavy metal ion removal applications, such as ion exchangers, adsorbents, and so on [1,2,3,4,5]. The importance of IPNs is growing due to the numerous opportunities to modify their physico-chemical properties [6]. Natural polymers have successfully replaced a number of synthetic materials, either because the latter were high in cost or because the biodegradable and biocompatible properties of natural polymers outperformed those of synthetic materials [7]. The success of natural polymer hydrogels as biomaterials is mostly due to their resemblance to biological tissues and transformation processes, which allow them to be easily manufactured in a variety of forms and sizes at low manufacturing costs [8]. Natural polymers, on the other hand, have high biocompatibility but poor mechanical qualities; the necessity to preserve biological properties hampers their processing. Hence, to improve the physico-mechanical properties of natural polymer-based hydrogels, they are blended, grafted and embedded with compatible additives [8].", "Recently, natural-polymer-based IPN-type hydrogels have been successfully developed for drug delivery, anti-microbial, wound healing, tissue engineering applications [6,7,8]. Banthia et al. developed pH-sensitive polyacrylamide-grafted pectin-based hydrogels for use in the controlled release of salicylic acid. Salicylic drug release was observed to be 86% within 7 h. [9]. Krishna Rao et al. developed pH- and temperature-responsive semi-IPN hydrogel based on pectin and poly(2-dimethylamin)ethyl methacrylate for the controlled drug delivery of 5-fluorouracil. These hydrogels enhanced drug release in various stimuli-responsive environments; finally, 100% drug release was observed within 80 h. These hydrogels could be used for colon-specific drug delivery applications [10]. Gautam Sen et al. developed sesbania gum based on a hydrogel prepared by a microwave-assisted method using acrylamide as a monomer for sustained release applications of 5-flurouracil. These hydrogels enhanced the drug release in alkaline medium [11]. Baljit sing et al. developed poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and Azadirachta indica gum-based hydrogels for the drug delivery of methyl prednisolone. These hydrogels enhanced drug release in phosphate buffer, i.e., 45% prednisolone released in 24 h [12].", "Tamarind gum (TMG) is a natural polysaccharide; it is a derivative of seeds of Tamarindus indica linn, which is a widely available plant in India and Southeast Asia. TG consists of \u2018(1-4)-\u03b2-D-glucan residues substituted with \u03b1-D-xylopyranose and \u03b2-D-galactopyranosyl (1-2)-\u03b1-D-xylopyranose linked (1-6) to glucose moieties [13]. TMG is more pH tolerant as well, as it shows significant bioadhesive properties; due to this promising feature, TMG-based materials have been used for drug delivery applications. pH-responsive TMG polysaccharide and sodium alginate blend beads were developed for biotechnology applications [14]. Functionalized carbon-nanotube-incorporated TMG hydrogels were developed for the controlled release of tigecycline [15]. Graphene-oxide-based viscoelastic composite films were developed from blends of poly(vinyl alcohol) and carboxy methyl TMG for the controlled release of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride. The results of these studies indicate that they have anti-microbial characteristics, which helps in human skin keratinocytes [16]. Floating beads of sodium alginate blended with TMG and magnesium stearate were fabricated by the ionotropic gelation technique for the controlled release of risperidone [17]. Simvastatin-based nanoparticles were formulated from polyelectrolyte complexes of chitosan and TMG for anti-cancer applications [18].", "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug used to treat a variety of cancers, including hematological malignancies and soft tissue sarcomas [19,20,21,22]. It is obtained from a streptomyces species and belongs to the anthracycline family, which has potential antibacterial and anticancer action [23,24]. It is an amphiphilic compound comprising a water insoluble aglycone and water-soluble amino sugar functional moiety. DOX\u2019s specific method of action is unknown, although it is thought to bind with DNA via intercalation and block topoisomerase. DOX\u2019s therapeutic applicability is limited due to numerous drug resistance and server-side effects. Furthermore, high dosages of DOX recommended to improve efficiency may have negative side effects on normal tissue cells, particularly those in the kidney and heart. Hence, to overcome the shortcomings of DOX, it was encapsulated or conjugated with polymeric systems [25,26,27].", "In the continuation of research on natural-polymer-based functional materials for biomedical applications [28] and based on the above facts, in this study, tamarind gum-co-poly(acrylamidoglycolic acid)-based copolymeric semi-IPN hydrogels were composed using bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] phosphate as a potential crosslinker by simple free radical polymerization. These hydrogels were studied via FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM and were employed for the in vitro controlled release of DOX, a chemotherapeutic drug. These hydrogels were employed to study the in vitro cell viability and cell cycle analysis of HCT116 cells. Furthermore, these hydrogels were utilized in the green manufacture of silver nanocomposites, employing aqueous leaf extract of Teminalia bellirica."]
