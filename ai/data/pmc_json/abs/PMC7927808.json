Its production by the commensal Staphylococcus lugdunensis eliminates the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus from human nasal microbiomes. The cycloheptapeptide lugdunin is the founding member of the new class of fibupeptide antibiotics, which have a novel mode of action and represent promising new antimicrobial agents. How S. lugdunensis releases and achieves producer self-resistance to lugdunin has remained unknown. We report that two ABC transporters encoded upstream of the lugdunin-biosynthetic operon have distinct yet overlapping roles in lugdunin secretion and self-resistance. While deletion of the lugEF transporter genes abrogated most of the lugdunin secretion, the lugGH transporter genes had a dominant role in resistance. Yet all four genes were required for full-level lugdunin resistance. The small accessory putative membrane protein LugI further contributed to lugdunin release and resistance levels conferred by the ABC transporters. Whereas LugIEFGH also conferred resistance to lugdunin congeners with inverse structures or with amino acid exchange at position 6, they neither affected the susceptibility to a lugdunin variant with an exchange at position 2 nor to other cyclic peptide antimicrobials such as daptomycin or gramicidin S. The obvious selectivity of the resistance mechanism raises hopes that it will not confer cross-resistance to other antimicrobials or to optimized lugdunin derivatives to be used for the prevention and treatment of S. aureus infections."]
