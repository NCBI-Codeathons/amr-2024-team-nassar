However, rates of discovery have decreased as the biosynthetic capacity of the culturable biosphere has been continuously mined for many decades. The as-yet-uncultured biosphere is likely to hold far greater biosynthetic potential, especially where ecological niches favor the selection of therapeutically useful bioactivities. I outline here how metagenomics and other systems biology approaches can be used to gain insight into small-molecule biosynthesis and the selective forces which shape it. I also argue that we need a greater understanding of the function of small molecules in complex microbiomes and rational synthetic biology methods to functionally reconstruct large biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts."]
