["Kinases are annotated in many nucleoside biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) but generally are considered responsible only for self-resistance. Here, we report an unexpected 2\u2019-phosphorylation of nucleoside biosynthetic intermediates in the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways. This phosphorylation is a unique cryptic modification as it is introduced in the third of seven steps during aminohexuronic acid (AHA) nucleoside biosynthesis, retained throughout the pathway\u2019s duration, and is removed in the last step of the pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of reported nucleoside BGCs suggests the presence of cryptic phosphorylation in other pathways and the importance of functional characterization of kinases in nucleoside biosynthetic pathways in general. This study also functionally characterized all of the enzymes responsible for AHA biosynthesis and revealed that AHA is constructed via a unique oxidative C-C bond cleavage reaction. The results suggest a divergent biosynthetic mechanism for three classes of antifungal nucleoside natural products."]
