["", "Assembly-line polyketide synthases (PKSs) are among the\nmost complex\nprotein machineries known in nature, responsible for the biosynthesis\nof numerous compounds used in the clinic. Their present-day diversity\nis the result of an evolutionary path that has involved the emergence\nof a multimodular architecture and further diversification of assembly-line\nPKSs. In this review, we provide an overview of previous studies that\ninvestigated PKS evolution and propose a model that challenges the\ncurrently prevailing view that gene duplication has played a major\nrole in the emergence of multimodularity. We also analyze the ensemble\nof orphan PKS clusters sequenced so far to evaluate how large the\nentire diversity of assembly-line PKS clusters and their chemical\nproducts could be. Finally, we examine the existing techniques to\naccess the natural PKS diversity in natural and heterologous hosts\nand describe approaches to further expand this diversity through engineering."]
