["ABSTRACT", "Plant-based secondary metabolite production system is well established. However, host\u2013endophyte interaction in the production of secondary metabolite is a new less exploited area that is overcoming barriers and evolving as one of the prospective fields. Endophytes such as bacteria or fungi have the ability to produce some of the secondary metabolites that mimic the plant metabolites therefore escaping the host defence system. Coumarin is one such metabolite with immense biological functions. Most of the studies have demonstrated coumarin production from fungal endophytes but not bacterial endophytes. Herein, we present an overview of all the coumarin derivatives produced from endophytic sources and their biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, the review also throws light on the isolation of these coumarins and different derivatives with respect to their biological activity. The biotransformation of coumarin derivatives by the action of endophytic fungi is also elaborated. The present review provides an insight on the challenges faced in the coumarin production through fungal endophytes."]
