["", "The bleomycin (BLM) family of glycopeptide-derived\nantitumor antibiotics\nconsists of BLMs, tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycins (PLMs), and zorbamycin\n(ZBM). The self-resistant elements BlmB and TlmB, discovered from\nthe BLM- and TLM-producing organisms Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94\nATCC31158, respectively, are N-acetyltransferases\nthat provide resistance to the producers by disrupting the metal-binding\ndomain of the antibiotics required for activity. Although each member\nof the BLM family of antibiotics possesses a conserved metal-binding\ndomain, the structural differences between each member, namely, the\nbithiazole moiety and C-terminal amine of BLMs, have been suggested\nto instill substrate specificity within BlmB. Here we report that\nBlmB and TlmB readily accept and acetylate BLMs, TLMs, PLMs, and ZBM in vitro but only in the metal-free forms. Kinetic analysis\nof BlmB and TlmB reveals there is no strong preference or rate enhancement\nfor specific substrates, indicating that the structural differences\nbetween each member of the BLM family play a negligible role in substrate\nrecognition, binding, or catalysis. Intriguingly, the zbm gene cluster from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892\ndoes not contain an N-acetyltransferase, yet ZBM\nis readily acetylated by BlmB and TlmB. We subsequently established\nthat S. flavoviridis lacks the homologue of BlmB\nand TlmB, and ZbmA, the ZBM-binding protein, alone is sufficient to\nprovide ZBM resistance. We further confirmed that BlmB can indeed\nconfer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases the level of resistance."]
