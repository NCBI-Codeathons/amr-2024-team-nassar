["", "The rapid development\nof antibiotic resistance, especially among\ndifficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria, is recognized as a serious\nand urgent threat to public health. The detection and characterization\nof novel resistance mechanisms are essential to better predict the\nspread and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Corramycin is a novel\nand modified peptidic antibiotic with activity against several Gram-negative\npathogens. We demonstrate that the kinase ComG, part of the corramycin\nbiosynthetic gene cluster, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates\ncorramycin, leading to the resistance of the host. Remarkably, we\nfound that the closest structural homologues of ComG are aminoglycoside\nphosphotransferases; however, ComG shows no activity toward this class\nof antibiotics. The crystal structure of ComG in complex with corramycin\nreveals that corramycin adopts a \u03b2-hairpin-like structure and\nallowed us to define the changes leading to a switch in substrate\nfrom sugar to peptide. Bioinformatic analyses suggest a limited occurrence\nof ComG-like proteins, which along with the absence of cross-resistance\nto clinically used drugs positions corramycin as an attractive antibiotic\nfor further development."]
