["In this study, TMT (tandem mass tag)-labeled quantitative protein technology combined with LC\u2013MS/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) was used to isolate and identify the proteins of the hybrid bamboo (Bambusa pervariabilis\u2009\u00d7\u2009Dendrocalamopsis grandis) and the bamboo inoculated with the pathogenic fungi Arthrinium phaeospermum. A total of 3320 unique peptide fragments were identified after inoculation with either A. phaeospermum or sterile water, and 1791 proteins were quantified. A total of 102 differentially expressed proteins were obtained, of which 66 differential proteins were upregulated and 36 downregulated in the treatment group. Annotation and enrichment analysis of these peptides and proteins using the GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) databases with bioinformatics software showed that the differentially expressed protein functional annotation items were mainly concentrated on biological processes and cell components. The LC\u2013PRM/MS (liquid chromatography-parallel reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry) quantitative analysis technique was used to quantitatively analyze 11 differential candidate proteins obtained by TMT combined with LC\u2013MS/MS. The up\u2013down trend of 10 differential proteins in the PRM results was consistent with that of the TMT quantitative analysis. The coincidence rate of the two results was 91%, which confirmed the reliability of the proteomic results. Therefore, the differentially expressed proteins and signaling pathways discovered here may be the further concern for the bamboo-pathogen interaction studies."]
