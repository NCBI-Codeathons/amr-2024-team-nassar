["The bioinsecticidal action of Pseudomonas protegens has so far been reported against some target insects, and the mode of action remains unclear. In this study, the pathogenicity potential of a recently isolated strain of this bacterial species against fly larvae of medical and veterinary interest was determined. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the biocidal action by ingestion against Musca domestica and Lucilia caesar larvae, which highlighted a concentration-dependent effect, with LC50 values of 3.6 and 2.5 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL, respectively. Bacterial septicaemia was observed in the body of insects assuming bacterial cells by ingestion. Such rapid bacterial reproduction in the hemolymph supports a toxin-mediated mechanism of action involving the intestinal barrier overcoming. In order to gain more information on the interaction with the host, the relative time-course expression of selected P. protegens genes associated with virulence and pathogenicity, was determined by qPCR at the gut level during the first infection stage. Among target genes, chitinase D was the most expressed, followed by pesticin and the fluorescent insecticidal toxin fitD. According to our observations and to the diversity of metabolites P. protegens produces, the pathogenic interaction this bacterium can establish with different targets appears to be complex and multifactorial."]
