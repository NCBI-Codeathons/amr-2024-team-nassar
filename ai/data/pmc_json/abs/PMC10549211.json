["Abstract", "", "Actinobacteria are a large and diverse group of bacteria that are known to produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, many of which have important biological activities, including antibiotics, anti-cancer agents, and immunosuppressants. The biosynthesis of these compounds is often highly regulated with many natural products (NPs) being produced at very low levels in laboratory settings. Environmental factors, such as small molecule elicitors, can induce the production of secondary metabolites. Specifically, they can increase titers of known NPs as well as enabling discovery of novel NPs typically produced at undetectable levels. These elicitors can be NPs, including antibiotics or hormones, or synthetic compounds. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of small molecule elicitors to induce the production of secondary metabolites from actinobacteria, especially for the discovery of NPs from \u201csilent\u201d biosynthetic gene clusters. This review aims to highlight classes of molecules that induce secondary metabolite production in actinobacteria and to describe the potential mechanisms of induction.", "One-Sentence Summary", "This review describes chemical elicitors of actinobacteria natural products described to date and the proposed mechanisms of induction.", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical AbstractChemicals, including natural product antibiotics and hormones, are capable of inducing production of natural products in actinobacteria.", "Graphical AbstractChemicals, including natural product antibiotics and hormones, are capable of inducing production of natural products in actinobacteria.", "Chemicals, including natural product antibiotics and hormones, are capable of inducing production of natural products in actinobacteria."]
