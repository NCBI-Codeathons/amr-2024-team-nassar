["The biosynthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites, specifically antibiotics, is of great scientific and economic importance. The control of antibiotic production typically involves different processes and molecular mechanism. Despite numerous efforts to improve antibiotic yields, joint engineering strategies for combining genetic manipulation with fermentation optimization remain finite. Lincomycin A (Lin-A), a lincosamide antibiotic, is industrially fermented by Streptomyces lincolnensis. Herein, the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp)-type regulator SLCG_4846 was confirmed to directly inhibit the lincomycin biosynthesis, whereas indirectly controlled the transcription of SLCG_2919, the first reported repressor in S. lincolnensis. Inactivation of SLCG_4846 in the high-yield S. lincolnensis LA219X (LA219X\u03944846) increases the Lin-A production and deletion of SLCG_2919 in LA219X\u03944846 exhibits superimposed yield increment. Given the effect of the double deletion on cellular primary metabolism of S. lincolnensis, Plackett-Burman design, steepest ascent and response surface methodologies were utilized and employed to optimize the seed medium of this double mutant in shake flask, and Lin-A yield using optimal seed medium was significantly increased over the control. Above strategies were performed in a 15-L fermenter. The maximal yield of Lin-A in LA219X\u03944846-2919 reached 6.56\u00a0g/L at 216\u00a0h, 55.1 % higher than that in LA219X at the parental cultivation (4.23\u00a0g/L). This study not only showcases the potential of this strategy to boost lincomycin production, but also could empower the development of high-performance actinomycetes for other antibiotics."]
