["Abstract", "A better understanding of the genetic regulation of the biosynthesis of microbial compounds could accelerate the discovery of new biologically active molecules and facilitate their production. To this end, we have investigated the time course of genome\u2010wide transcription in the myxobacterium Sorangium sp. So ce836 in relation to its production of natural compounds. Time\u2010resolved RNA sequencing revealed that core biosynthesis genes from 48 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs; 92% of all BGCs encoded in the genome) were actively transcribed at specific time points in a batch culture. The majority (80%) of polyketide synthase and non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase genes displayed distinct peaks of transcription during exponential bacterial growth. Strikingly, these bursts in BGC transcriptional activity were associated with surges in the net production rates of known natural compounds, indicating that their biosynthesis was critically regulated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, BGC read counts from single time points had limited predictive value about biosynthetic activity, since transcription levels varied >100\u2010fold among BGCs with detected natural products. Taken together, our time\u2010course data provide unique insights into the dynamics of natural compound biosynthesis and its regulation in a wild\u2010type myxobacterium, challenging the commonly cited notion of preferential BGC expression under nutrient\u2010limited conditions. The close association observed between BGC transcription and compound production warrants additional efforts to develop genetic engineering tools for boosting compound yields from myxobacterial producer strains.", "We have investigated the time course of genome\u2010wide transcription in the myxobacterium Sorangium sp.
