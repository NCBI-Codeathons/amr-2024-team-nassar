["Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most successful human pathogens with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. MRSA has acquired resistance to almost all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, including the new-generation cephalosporins, and is often also resistant to multiple other antibiotic classes. The expression of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) is the primary basis for \u03b2-lactams resistance by MRSA, but it is coupled with other resistance mechanisms, conferring resistance to non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotics. The multiplicity of resistance mechanisms includes target modification, enzymatic drug inactivation, and decreased antibiotic uptake or efflux. This review highlights the molecular basis of resistance to non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotics recommended to treat MRSA infections such as macrolides, lincosamides, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, lipopeptides, and others. A thorough understanding of the molecular and biochemical basis of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates could help in developing promising therapies and molecular detection methods of antibiotic resistance."]
