["Abstract", "To identify the potential role of the 3\u2010hydroxyl group of the pyridine ring in nosiheptide (NOS) for its antibacterial activity against Gram\u2010positive pathogens, enzymatic glycosylation was utilized to regio\u2010selectively create a monoglycosyl NOS derivative, NOS\u2010G. For this purpose, we selected OleD, a UDP glycosyltransferase from Streptomyces antibioticus that has a low productivity for NOS\u2010G. Activity of the enzyme was increased by swapping domains derived from OleI, both single and in combination. Activity enhancement was best in mutant OleD\u201010 that contained four OleI domains. This chimer was engineered by site\u2010directed mutagenesis (single and in combination) to increase its activity further, whereby variants were screened using a newly\u2010established colorimetric assay. OleD\u201010 with I117F and T118G substitutions (FG) had an increased NOS\u2010G productivity of 56%, approximately 70 times higher than that of wild\u2010type OleD. The reason for improved activity of FG towards NOS was structurally attributed to a closer distance (<3\u2009\u00c5) between NOS/sugar donor and the catalytic amino acid H25. The engineered enzyme allowed sufficient activity to demonstrate that the produced NOS\u2010G had enhanced stability and aqueous solubility compared to NOS. Using a murine MRSA infection model, it was established that NOS\u2010G resulted in partial protection within 20\u2009h of administration and delayed the death of infected mice. We conclude that 3\u2010hydroxypyridine is a promising site for structural modification of NOS, which may pave the way for producing nosiheptide derivatives as a potential antibiotic for application in clinical treatment.", "A monoglycosyl nosiheptide, which exhibit improved solubility and stability compared to nosiheptide, was created by enzymatic glycosylation. By enzyme engineering coupled with a new colorimetric method, a chimeric enzyme with approximately 70 times higher activity was constructed. These findings suggest the potential for structural modifications at the 3\u2010hydroxypyridine site of nosiheptide to develop novel nosiheptide derivatives with improved properties for clinical treatment."]
