["Abstract", "By limiting the nitrogen source to glutamic acid, we isolated cyclic peptides from Euglena gracilis containing asparagine and non\u2010proteinogenic amino acids. Structure elucidation was accomplished through spectroscopic methods, mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. The euglenatides potently inhibit pathogenic fungi and cancer cell lines e.g., euglenatide B exhibiting IC50 values of 4.3\u2005\u03bcM in Aspergillus fumigatus and 0.29\u2005\u03bcM in MCF\u20107 breast cancer cells. In an unprecedented convergence of non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase assembly\u2010line biosynthesis between unicellular species and the metazoan kingdom, euglenatides bear resemblance to nemamides from Caenorhabditis elegans and inhibited both producing organisms E.\u2005gracilis and C.\u2005elegans. By molecular network analysis, we detected over forty euglenatide\u2010like metabolites in E.\u2005gracilis, E.\u2005sanguinea and E.\u2005mutabilis, suggesting an important biological role for these natural products.", "Light and glutamic acid induced E.\u2005gracilis to produce euglenatides with antifungal and anticancer activity. Euglenatides were also detected in E.\u2005sanguinea and E.\u2005mutabilis. They resemble the nemamides isolated from C.\u2005elegans, inhibited both producing species, and represent uniquely convergent assembly\u2010line biosynthesis between unicellular organisms and metazoans."]
