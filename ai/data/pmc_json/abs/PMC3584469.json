["Objective:", "The clavulanic acid regulatory gene (claR) is in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic\ngene cluster that encodes ClaR. This protein is a putative regulator of the late steps of\nclavulanic acid biosynthesis. The aim of this research is the molecular cloning of claR,\nisolated from the Iranian strain of Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus).", "Materials and Methods:", "In this experimental study, two different strains of S. clavuligerus\nwere used (PTCC 1705 and DSM 738), of which there is no claR sequence record for\nstrain PTCC 1705 in all three main gene banks. The specific designed primers were subjected\nto a few base modifications for introduction of the recognition sites of BamHI and\nClaI. The claR gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using DNA isolated\nfrom S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705. Nested-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism\n(PCR-RFLP), and sequencing were used for molecular analysis of the claR gene.\nThe confirmed claR was subjected to double digestion with BamHI and ClaI. The cut claR\nwas ligated into a pBluescript (pBs) vector and transformed into E. coli.", "Results:", "The entire sequence of the isolated claR (Iranian strain) was identified. The\npresence of the recombinant vector in the transformed colonies was confirmed by the\ncolony-PCR procedure. The correct structure of the recombinant vector, isolated from the\ntransformed E. coli, was confirmed using gel electrophoresis, PCR, and double digestion\nwith restriction enzymes.", "Conclusion:", "The constructed recombinant cassette, named pZSclaR, can be regarded\nas an appropriate tool for site directed mutagenesis and sub-cloning. At this time, claR\nhas been cloned accompanied with its precisely selected promoter so it could be used in\nexpression vectors. Hence the ClaR is known as a putative regulatory protein. The overproduced\nprotein could also be used for other related investigations, such as a mobility\nshift assay."]
