["In this study, the transcriptome profiles of tissue\u2013cultured grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. \u00d7 Vitis labrusca L.: Rose Honey) seedlings inoculated with fungal endophytes Epicoccum layuense R2-21 (Epi R2-21) and Alternaria alternata XHYN2 (Alt XHYN2), were analyzed at three different time points (6 h, 6 d, and 15 d). A total of 4783 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was found, of which 1853 (6 h), 3878 (6 d), and 4732 (15 d) were differentially expressed relative to those of the control in endophyte Epi R2-21 treatments, while a total of 5898 DEGs, of which 2726 (6 h), 4610 (6 d), and 3938 (15 d) were differentially expressed in endophyte Alt XHYN2 treatments. DEGs enriched in secondary metabolic pathways, plant\u2013pathogen interaction, and hormone signalling were further analysed. The upregulated DEGs in the Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 treatments, both enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were mainly involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and circadian rhythms\u2013plant and plant\u2013pathogen interactions, similar to the trend observed in our previous study conducted on the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019 (Vitis vinifera L.). Taken together with the results obtained from the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019, it was found that tissue-cultured seedlings of the cultivar \u2018Rose Honey\u2019 induced a stronger defence response to fungal endophyte infection than that of the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019, and inoculation with the endophyte Alt XHYN2 triggered a stronger response than inoculation with the endophyte Epi R2-21. In addition, the protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network revealed that the genes VIT_16s0100g00910, encoding CHS, and VIT_11s0065g00350, encoding CYP73A, were involved in secondary metabolism and thus mediated in the resistance mechanism of grapevine on both the cultivars. The results showed that inoculation with the endophytes Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 had a great ability to induce defence responses and reprogram the gene expression profiles in different grapevine cultivars, which deepens our knowledge of the interaction between fungal endophytes and grapevine and gives hints for grape quality management in viticulture using candidate fungal endophytes."]
