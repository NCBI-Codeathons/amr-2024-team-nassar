["We have previously reported the draft genome sequences of 59 endospore-forming Gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from Vietnamese crop plants due to their ability to suppress plant pathogens. Based on their draft genome sequence, eleven of them were assigned to the Brevibacillus and one to the Lysinibacillus genus. Further analysis including full genome sequencing revealed that several of these strains represent novel genomospecies. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated their ability to promote plant growth, as well as the strong biocontrol potential of Brevibacilli directed against phytopathogenic bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Genome mining identified 157 natural product biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs), including 36 novel BGCs not present in the MIBiG data bank. Our findings indicate that plant-associated Brevibacilli are a rich source of putative antimicrobial compounds and might serve as a valuable starting point for the development of novel biocontrol agents."]
