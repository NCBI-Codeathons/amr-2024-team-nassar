["Due to its acetate content, the pyrolytic aqueous condensate (PAC) formed during the fast pyrolysis of wheat straw could provide an inexpensive substrate for microbial fermentation. However, PAC also contains several inhibitors that make its detoxification inevitable. In our study, we examined the transcriptional response of Aspergillus oryzae to cultivation on 20% detoxified PAC, pure acetate and glucose using RNA-seq analysis. Functional enrichment analysis of 3463 significantly differentially expressed (log2FC >2 & FDR < 0.05) genes revealed similar metabolic tendencies for both acetate and PAC, as upregulated genes in these cultures were mainly associated with ribosomes and RNA processing, whereas transmembrane transport was downregulated. Unsurprisingly, metabolic pathway analysis revealed that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and starch and sucrose metabolism were upregulated for glucose, whereas glyoxylate and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were important carbon utilization pathways for acetate and PAC, respectively. Moreover, genes involved in the biosynthesis of various amino acids such as arginine, serine, cysteine and tryptophan showed higher expression in the acetate-containing cultures. Direct comparison of the transcriptome profiles of acetate and PAC revealed that pyruvate metabolism was the only significantly different metabolic pathway and was overexpressed in the PAC cultures. Upregulated genes included those for methylglyoxal degradation and alcohol dehydrogenases, which thus represent potential targets for the further improvement of fungal PAC tolerance."]
