["Filamentous fungi are one of the most important producers of secondary metabolites. Some of them can have a toxic effect on the human body, leading to diseases. On the other hand, they are widely used as pharmaceutically significant drugs, such as antibiotics, statins, and immunosuppressants. A single fungus species in response to various signals can produce 100 or more secondary metabolites. Such signaling is possible due to the coordinated regulation of several dozen biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are mosaically localized in different regions of fungal chromosomes. Their regulation includes several levels, from pathway-specific regulators, whose genes are localized inside BGCs, to global regulators of the cell (taking into account changes in pH, carbon consumption, etc.) and global regulators of secondary metabolism (affecting epigenetic changes driven by velvet family proteins, LaeA, etc.). In addition, various low-molecular-weight substances can have a mediating effect on such regulatory processes. This review is devoted to a critical analysis of the available data on the \u201cturning on\u201d and \u201coff\u201d of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in response to signals in filamentous fungi. To describe the ongoing processes, the model of \u201cpiano regulation\u201d is proposed, whereby pressing a certain key (signal) leads to the extraction of a certain sound from the \u201cmusical instrument of the fungus cell\u201d, which is expressed in the production of a specific secondary metabolite."]
