["ABSTRACT", "Plant pathogenic fungi cause serious diseases, which result in the loss of crop yields and reduce the quality of crops worldwide. To counteract the escalating risks of chemical fungicides, interest in biological control agents to manage plant diseases has significantly increased. In this study, we comprehensively screened microbial culture filtrates using a yeast screening system to find microbes exhibiting respiratory inhibition activity. Consequently, we found a soil-borne microbe Brevibacillus brevis HK544 strain exhibiting a respiration inhibitory activity and identified edeine B1 (EB1) from the culture filtrate of HK544 as the active compound of the respiration inhibition activity. Furthermore, against a plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum, our results showed that EB1 has effects on multiple aspects of respiration with the downregulation of most of the mitochondrial-related genes based on transcriptome analysis, differential EB1-sensitivity from targeted mutagenesis, and the synergistic effects of EB1 with electron transport chain complex inhibitors. With the promising plant disease control efficacy of B. brevis HK544 producing EB1, our results suggest that B. brevis HK544 has potential as a biocontrol agent for Fusarium head blight.", "IMPORTANCE", "As a necrotrophic fungus, Fusarium graminearum is a highly destructive pathogen causing severe diseases in cereal crops and mycotoxin contamination in grains. Although chemical control is considered the primary approach to control plant disease caused by F. graminearum, fungicide-resistant strains have been detected in the field after long-term continuous application of fungicides. Moreover, applying chemical fungicides that trigger mycotoxin biosynthesis is a great concern for many researchers. Biocontrol of Fusarium head blight (FHB) by biological control agents (BCAs) represents an alternative approach and could be used as part of the integrated management of FHB and mycotoxin production. The most extensive studies on bacterial BCAs-fungal communications in agroecosystems have focused on antibiosis. Although many BCAs in agricultural ecology have already been used for fungal disease control, the molecular mechanisms of antibiotics produced by BCAs remain to be elucidated. Here, we found a potential BCA (Brevibacillus brevis HK544) with a strong antifungal activity based on the respiration inhibition activity with its active compound edeine B1 (EB1). Furthermore, our results showed that EB1 secreted by HK544 suppresses the expression of the mitochondria-related genes of F. graminearum, subsequently suppressing fungal development and the virulence of F. graminearum. In addition, EB1 exhibited a synergism with complex I inhibitors such as rotenone and fenazaquin. Our work extends our understanding of how B. brevis HK544 exhibits antifungal activity and suggests that the B. brevis HK544 strain could be a valuable source for developing new crop protectants to control F. graminearum."]
