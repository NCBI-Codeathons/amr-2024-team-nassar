["Abstract", "The ongoing arms race between bacteria and phages has forced bacteria to evolve a sophisticated set of antiphage defense mechanisms that constitute the bacterial immune system. In our previous study, we highlighted the antiphage properties of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are naturally secreted by Streptomyces. Successful inhibition of phage infection was achieved by addition of pure compounds and supernatants from a natural producer strain emphasizing the potential for community-wide antiphage defense. However, given the dual functionality of these compounds, neighboring bacterial cells require resistance to the antibacterial activity of aminoglycosides to benefit from the protection they confer against phages. In this study, we tested a variety of different aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms acting via drug or target (16S rRNA) modification and demonstrated that they do not interfere with the antiphage properties of the molecules. Furthermore, we confirmed the antiphage impact of aminoglycosides in a community context by coculturing phage-susceptible, apramycin-resistant Streptomyces venezuelae with the apramycin-producing strain Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. Given the prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance among natural bacterial isolates, this study highlights the ecological relevance of chemical defense via aminoglycosides at the community level.", "In this study, we showed that various aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms do not affect the antiphage properties of these molecules and highlighted the ecological relevance of aminoglycoside-mediated defense in bacterial communities by coculturing phage-susceptible, apramycin-resistant Streptomyces venezuelae with apramycin-producing Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius."]
