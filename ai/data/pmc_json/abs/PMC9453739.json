["", "The pairing of analytical chemistry with genomic techniques\nrepresents\na new wave in natural product chemistry. With an increase in the availability\nof sequencing and assembly of microbial genomes, interrogation into\nthe biosynthetic capability of producers with valuable secondary metabolites\nis possible. However, without the development of robust, accessible,\nand medium to high throughput tools, the bottleneck in pairing metabolic\npotential and compound isolation will continue. Several innovative\napproaches have proven useful in the nascent stages of microbial genome-informed\ndrug discovery. Here, we consider a number of these approaches which\nhave led to prioritization of strain targets and have mitigated rediscovery\nrates. Likewise, we discuss integration of principles of comparative\nevolutionary studies and retrobiosynthetic predictions to better understand\nbiosynthetic mechanistic details and link genome sequence to structure.\nLastly, we discuss advances in engineering, chemistry, and molecular\nnetworking and other computational approaches that are accelerating\nprogress in the field of omic-informed natural product drug discovery.\nTogether, these strategies enhance the synergy between cutting edge\nomics, chemical characterization, and computational technologies that\npitch the discovery of natural products with pharmaceutical and other\npotential applications to the crest of the wave where progress is\nripe for rapid advances."]
