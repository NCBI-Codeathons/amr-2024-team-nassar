["Summary", "Intracellular microorganisms, like viruses, bacteria, and fungi, pose challenges in detection due to their non-culturable forms. Transcriptomic analysis at cellular level enables exploration of distributions and the impact of these microorganisms on host cells, a domain that remains underexplored because of methodological limitations. Single-cell technology shows promise in addressing this by capturing polyadenine-tailed transcripts, because recent studies confirmed polyadenylation in microbial transcriptomes. We utilized single-cell RNA-seq from PBMCs to probe intracellular microbes in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-positive, and recovered individuals. Among 76 bacterial species detected, 16 showed significant abundance differences. Buchnera aphidicola, Streptomyces clavuligerus, and Ehrlichia canis emerged significantly in memory-B, Na\u00efve-T, and Treg cells. Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma mycoides, Leptospira interrogans, and others displayed elevated levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, suggesting possible disease association.\u00a0This highlights the strength of single-cell technology in revealing potential microorganism\u2019s cell-specific functions. Further research is essential for functional understanding of their cell-specific abundance across physiological states.", "Graphical abstract", "", "Highlights", "\u202276 bacterial species of 15 genera across healthy, COVID-19-positive, and recovered individuals\u2022Higher abundance of opportunistic intracellular bacteria in recovered group\u2022Higher microbial abundance within antigen-presenting cells of COVID-19 patients\u2022Differential microbial abundance in Treg, memory T, and platelets in COVID-19", "76 bacterial species of 15 genera across healthy, COVID-19-positive, and recovered individuals", "Higher abundance of opportunistic intracellular bacteria in recovered group", "Higher microbial abundance within antigen-presenting cells of COVID-19 patients", "Differential microbial abundance in Treg, memory T, and platelets in COVID-19", "Immunology; Virology"]
