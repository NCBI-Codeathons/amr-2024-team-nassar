["ABSTRACT", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common, biofilm-forming pathogen that exhibits complex pathways of redox metabolism. It produces four different types of terminal oxidases for aerobic respiration, and for one of these, the cbb3-type terminal oxidases, it has the capacity to produce at least 16 isoforms encoded by partially redundant operons. It also produces small-molecule virulence factors that interact with the respiratory chain, including the poison cyanide. Previous studies had indicated a role for cyanide in activating expression of an \u201corphan\u201d terminal oxidase subunit gene called ccoN4 and that the product contributes to P. aeruginosa cyanide resistance, fitness in biofilms, and virulence, but the mechanisms underlying this process had not been elucidated. Here, we show that the regulatory protein MpaR, which is predicted to be a pyridoxal phosphate-binding transcription factor and is encoded just upstream of ccoN4, controls ccoN4 expression in response to endogenous cyanide. Paradoxically, we find that cyanide production is required to support CcoN4\u2019s contribution to respiration in biofilms. We identify a palindromic motif required for cyanide- and MpaR-dependent expression of ccoN4 and co-expressed adjacent loci. We also characterize the regulatory logic of this region of the chromosome. Finally, we identify residues in the putative cofactor-binding pocket of MpaR, which are required for ccoN4 expression. Together, our findings illustrate a novel scenario in which the respiratory toxin cyanide acts as a signal to control gene expression in a bacterium that produces the compound endogenously.", "IMPORTANCE", "Cyanide is an inhibitor of heme-copper oxidases, which are required for aerobic respiration in all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes. This fast-acting poison can arise from diverse sources, but mechanisms by which bacteria sense it are poorly understood. We investigated the regulatory response to cyanide in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which produces cyanide as a virulence factor. Although P. aeruginosa has the capacity to produce a cyanide-resistant oxidase, it relies primarily on heme-copper oxidases and even makes additional heme-copper oxidase proteins specifically under cyanide-producing conditions. We found that the protein MpaR controls expression of cyanide-inducible genes in P. aeruginosa and elucidated the molecular details of this regulation. MpaR contains a DNA-binding domain and a domain predicted to bind pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6), a compound that is known to react spontaneously with cyanide. These observations provide insight into the understudied phenomenon of cyanide-dependent regulation of gene expression in bacteria."]
