["Background", "A key focus of synthetic biology is to develop microbial or cell-free based biobased routes to value-added chemicals such as fragrances. Originally, we developed the EcoFlex system, a Golden Gate toolkit, to study genes/pathways flexibly using\u00a0Escherichia coli\u00a0heterologous expression. In this current work, we sought to use EcoFlex to optimise a synthetic raspberry ketone biosynthetic pathway.\u00a0Raspberry ketone is a high-value (~\u2009\u00a320,000\u00a0kg\u22121) fine chemical farmed from raspberry (Rubeus rubrum) fruit.", "Results", "By applying a synthetic biology led design-build-test-learn cycle approach, we refactor the raspberry ketone pathway from a low level of productivity (0.2\u00a0mg/L), to achieve a 65-fold (12.9\u00a0mg/L) improvement in production.\u00a0We perform this optimisation at the prototype level (using microtiter plate cultures) with E. coli DH10\u03b2, as a routine cloning host. The use of E. coli DH10\u03b2 facilitates the Golden Gate cloning process for the screening of combinatorial libraries. In addition, we also newly establish a novel colour-based phenotypic screen to identify productive clones quickly from solid/liquid culture.", "Conclusions", "Our findings provide a stable raspberry ketone pathway that relies upon a natural feedstock (L-tyrosine) and uses only constitutive promoters to control gene expression. In conclusion we demonstrate the capability of EcoFlex for fine-tuning a model fine chemical pathway and provide a range of newly characterised promoter tools gene expression in\u00a0E. coli.", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12934-021-01604-4."]
