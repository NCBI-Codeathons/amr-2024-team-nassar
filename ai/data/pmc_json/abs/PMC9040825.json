["ABSTRACT", "The bacterial response to antibiotics eliciting resistance is one of the key challenges in global health. Despite many attempts to understand intrinsic antibiotic resistance, many of the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In this study, we found that iron supplementation promoted antibiotic resistance in Streptomyces coelicolor. Iron-promoted resistance occurred specifically against bactericidal antibiotics, irrespective of the primary target of antibiotics. Transcriptome profiling revealed that some genes in the central metabolism and respiration were upregulated under iron-replete conditions. Iron supported the growth of S. coelicolor even under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of potassium cyanide, which reduces aerobic respiration of cells, iron still promoted respiration and antibiotic resistance. This suggests the involvement of a KCN-insensitive type of respiration in the iron effect. This phenomenon was also observed in another actinobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis. Taken together, these findings provide insight into a bacterial resistance strategy that mitigates the activity of bactericidal antibiotics whose efficacy accompanies oxidative damage by switching the respiration mode."]
