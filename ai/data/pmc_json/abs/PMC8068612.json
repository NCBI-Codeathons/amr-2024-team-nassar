["", "Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases.\nUnfortunately, the development of antibiotic resistance threatens\nour current therapeutic arsenal, which has necessitated the discovery\nand development of novel antibiotics against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Cyclomarin\nA and rufomycin I are structurally related cyclic heptapeptides assembled\nby nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which show potent anti-Mtb activity with a new cellular target, the caseinolytic\nprotein ClpC1. An NRPS adenylation domain survey using DNA extracted\nfrom \u223c2000 ecologically diverse soils found low cyclomarin/rufomycin\nbiosynthetic diversity. In this survey, a family of cyclomarin/rufomycin-like\nbiosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) that encode metamarin, an uncommon\ncyclomarin congener with potent activity against both Mtb H37Rv and multidrug-resistant Mtb clinical isolates\nwas identified. Metamarin effectively inhibits Mtb growth in murine macrophages and increases the activities of ClpC1\nATPase and the associated ClpC1/P1/P2 protease complex, thus causing\ncell death by uncontrolled protein degradation."]
