["Summary", "Blue\u2010pigmented exudates arise as droplets on sporulated lawns of Streptomyces coelicolor M110 grown on agar plates. Our electron microscopical and biochemical studies suggest that droplets contain densely packed vesicles with large assemblies of different protein types and/or the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin. Frozen\u2010hydrated vesicles were unilamellar with a typical bilayer membrane, and ranged from 80 to 400\u2003nm in diameter with a preferred width of 150\u2013300\u2003nm. By means of cryo\u2010electron tomography, three types were reconstructed three\u2010dimensionally: vesicles that were filled with particulate material, likely protein assemblies, those that contained membrane\u2010bound particles, and a vesicle that showed a higher contrast inside, but lacked particles. Our LC/MS analyses of generated tryptic peptides led to the identification of distinct proteins that carry often a predicted N\u2010terminal signal peptide with a twin\u2010arginine motif or lack a canonical signal sequence. The proteins are required for a range of processes: the acquisition of inorganic as well as organic phosphate, iron ions, and of distinct carbon sources, energy metabolism and redox balance, defence against oxidants and tellurites, the tailoring of actinorhodin, folding and assembly of proteins, establishment of turgor, and different signalling cascades. Our novel findings have immense implications for understanding new avenues of environmental biology of streptomycetes and for biotechnological applications."]
