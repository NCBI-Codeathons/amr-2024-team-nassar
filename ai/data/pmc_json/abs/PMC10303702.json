["A close relationship exists between the intestinal microbiota and the circadian rhythm, which is mainly regulated by the central-biological-clock system and the peripheral-biological-clock system. At the same time, the intestinal flora also reflects a certain rhythmic oscillation. A poor diet and sedentary lifestyle will lead to immune and metabolic diseases. A large number of studies have shown that the human body can be influenced in its immune regulation, energy metabolism and expression of biological-clock genes through diet, including fasting, and exercise, with intestinal flora as the vector, thereby reducing the incidence rates of diseases. This article mainly discusses the effects of diet and exercise on the intestinal flora and the immune and metabolic systems from the perspective of the circadian rhythm, which provides a more effective way to prevent immune and metabolic diseases by modulating intestinal microbiota."]
