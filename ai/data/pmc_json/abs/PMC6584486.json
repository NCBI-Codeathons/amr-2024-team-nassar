["Bullfrog saxiphilin:STX complex defines a toxin \u201cmolecular sponge\u201d blueprint for STX recognition and toxin resistance.", "Dinoflagelates and cyanobacteria produce saxitoxin (STX), a lethal bis-guanidinium neurotoxin causing paralytic shellfish poisoning. A number of metazoans have soluble STX-binding proteins that may prevent STX intoxication. However, their STX molecular recognition mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we present structures of saxiphilin (Sxph), a bullfrog high-affinity STX-binding protein, alone and bound to STX. The structures reveal a novel high-affinity STX-binding site built from a \u201cproto-pocket\u201d on a transferrin scaffold that also bears thyroglobulin domain protease inhibitor repeats. Comparison of Sxph and voltage-gated sodium channel STX-binding sites reveals a convergent toxin recognition strategy comprising a largely rigid binding site where acidic side chains and a cation-\u03c0 interaction engage STX. These studies reveal molecular rules for STX recognition, outline how a toxin-binding site can be built on a na\u00efve scaffold, and open a path to developing protein sensors for environmental STX monitoring and new biologics for STX intoxication mitigation."]
