["", "Natural products\nprovide a rich source of potential antimicrobials\nfor treating infectious diseases for which drug resistance has emerged.\nForemost among these diseases is tuberculosis. Assessment of the antimycobacterial\nactivity of nargenicin, a natural product that targets the replicative\nDNA polymerase of Staphylococcus aureus, revealed that it is a bactericidal genotoxin that induces a DNA\ndamage response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and inhibits growth by blocking the replicative\nDNA polymerase, DnaE1. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that binding\nof nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate\nsuch that nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and\nthe polymerase and occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide\nand templating base. Comparative analysis across three bacterial species\nsuggests that the activity of nargenicin is partly attributable to\nthe DNA binding affinity of the replicative polymerase. This work\nhas laid the foundation for target-led drug discovery efforts focused\non Mtb DnaE1."]
