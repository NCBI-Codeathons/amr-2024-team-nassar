["Abstract", "Microbial genome mining for drug discovery and development has been accelerating in recent years, driven by technical advancements in genome sequencing, bioinformatics, metabolomics/metabologenomics, and synthetic biology. Microbial genome mining is a multistep process that starts with the sequencing of microbes that encode multiple secondary metabolites and identifying new and novel secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to pursue. The initial steps in the process are critical for the overall success, and they encompass the most innovative new technologies to revitalize natural product discovery. As microbial genome mining has matured in recent years, unvalidated conjectures about what microbes to pursue, how to identify legitimate secondary metabolite BGCs, and how to sequence DNA to satisfactory levels of completion have been identified. The solutions to correct the misconceptions around these topics are beginning to be implemented."]
