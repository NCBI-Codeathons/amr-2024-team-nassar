["", "Calicheamicin \u03b31I (1)\nis an enediyne antitumor compound produced by Micromonospora\nechinospora spp. calichensis, and its biosynthetic gene cluster\nhas been previously reported. Despite extensive analysis and biochemical\nstudy, several genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 remain functionally unassigned. Using a structural genomics approach\nand biochemical characterization, two proteins encoded by genes from\nthe 1 biosynthetic gene cluster assigned as \u201cunknowns\u201d,\nCalU16 and CalU19, were characterized. Structure analysis revealed\nthat they possess the STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein related\nlipid Transfer (START) domain known mainly to bind and transport lipids\nand previously identified as the structural signature of the enediyne\nself-resistance protein CalC. Subsequent study revealed calU16 and calU19 to confer resistance to 1, and reminiscent of the prototype CalC, both CalU16 and CalU19 were\ncleaved by 1in vitro. Through site-directed\nmutagenesis and mass spectrometry, we identified the site of cleavage\nin each protein and characterized their function in conferring resistance\nagainst 1. This report emphasizes the importance of structural\ngenomics as a powerful tool for the functional annotation of unknown\nproteins."]
