["Abstract", "The introduction of \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b1-amino acids (\u03b2HAAs) into organic molecules has received considerable attention as these molecules have often found widespread applications in bioorganic chemistry, medicinal chemistry and biomaterial science. Despite innovation of asymmetric synthesis of \u03b2HAAs, stereoselective synthesis to control the two chiral centres at C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 positions is still challenging, with poor atomic economy and multi protection and deprotection steps. These syntheses are often operated under harsh conditions. Therefore, a biotransformation approach using biocatalysts is needed to selectively introduce these two chiral centres into structurally diverse molecules. Yet, there are few ways that enable one-step synthesis of \u03b2HAAs. One is to extend the substrate scope of the existing enzyme inventory. Threonine aldolases have been explored to produce \u03b2HAAs. However, the enzymes have poor controlled installation at C\u03b2 position, often resulting in a mixture of diastereoisomers which are difficult to be separated. In this respect, l-threonine transaldolases (LTTAs) offer an excellent potential as the enzymes often provide controlled stereochemistry at C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 positions. Another is to mine LTTA homologues and engineer the enzymes using directed evolution with the aim of finding engineered biocatalysts to accept broad substrates with enhanced conversion and stereoselectivity. Here, we review the development of LTTAs that incorporate various aldehyde acceptors to generate structurally diverse \u03b2HAAs and highlight areas for future developments.", "Key points", "\u2022 The general mechanism of the transaldolation reaction catalysed by LTTAs", "\u2022 Recent advances in LTTAs from different biosynthetic pathways", "\u2022 Applications of LTTAs as biocatalysts for production of \u03b2HAAs"]
