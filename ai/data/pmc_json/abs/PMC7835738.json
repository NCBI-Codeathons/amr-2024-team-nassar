["Pseudouridimycin (PUM) was recently discovered from Streptomyces sp. DSM26212 as a novel bacterial nucleoside analog that competes with UTP for access to the RNA polymerase (RNAP) active site, thereby inhibiting bacterial RNAP by blocking transcription. This represents a novel antibacterial mode of action and it is known that PUM inhibits bacterial RNAP in vitro, inhibits bacterial growth in vitro, and was active in vivo in a mouse infection model of Streptococcus pyogenes peritonitis. The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was previously identified and characterized by knockout experiments. However, the minimal set of genes necessary for PUM production was not proposed. To identify the minimal BGC and to create a plug-and-play production platform for PUM and its biosynthetic precursors, several versions of a redesigned PUM BGC were generated and expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M1146 under control of strong promotors. Heterologous expression allowed identification of the putative serine/threonine kinase PumF as an enzyme essential for heterologous PUM production and thus corroboration of the PUM minimal BGC."]
