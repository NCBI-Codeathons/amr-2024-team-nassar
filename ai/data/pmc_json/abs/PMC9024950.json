["Alexandriumpacificum is a typical toxic bloom-forming dinoflagellate, causing serious damage to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Many bacteria have been isolated, having algicidal effects on harmful algal species, while few algicidal bacteria have been found to be able to lyse A. pacificum. Herein, an algicidal bacterium, Shewanella Y1, with algicidal activity to the toxic dinoflagellate A. pacificum, was isolated from Jiaozhou Bay, China, and the physiological responses to oxidative stress in A. pacificum were further investigated to elucidate the mechanism involved in Shewanella Y1. Y1 exhibited a significant algicidal effect (86.64 \u00b1 5.04% at 24 h) and algicidal activity in an indirect manner. The significant declines of the maximal photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), initial slope of the light limited region (alpha), and maximum relative photosynthetic electron transfer rate (rETRmax) indicated that the Y1 filtrate inhibited photosynthetic activities of A. pacificum. Impaired photosynthesis induced the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused strong oxidative damage in A. pacificum, ultimately inducing cell death. These findings provide a better understanding of the biological basis of complex algicidal bacterium-harmful algae interactions, providing a potential source of bacterial agent to control harmful algal blooms."]
