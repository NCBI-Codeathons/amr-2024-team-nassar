["", "Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide\ntranslocase\n(MraYAA) from Aquifex aeolicus is the binding target for the nucleotide antibiotic muraymycin D2\n(MD2). MraYAA in the presence of the MD2 ligand has been\ncrystallized and released, while the interactions between the ligand\nand active-site residues remain less quantitatively and qualitatively\ndefined. We characterized theoretically the key residues involved\nin noncovalent interactions with MD2 in the MraYAA active\nsite. We applied the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural\nbond orbital analyses based on the density functional theory method\non the solved crystal structure of MraY with the MD2 to quantitatively\nestimate the intermolecular interactions. The obtained results revealed\nthe presence of multiple hydrogen bonds in the investigated active\nsite with strength ranging from van der Waals to covalent limits.\nLys70, Asp193, Gly194, Asp196, Gly264, Ala321, Gln305, and His325\nare key active-site residues interacting with MD2. Conventional and\nunconventional hydrogen bonds in addition with charge\u2013dipole\nand dipole\u2013dipole interactions contribute significantly to\nstabilize the MD2 binding to the MraYAA active site. It\nwas also found that water molecules inside the active site have substantial\neffects on its structure stability through hydrogen-bonding interactions\nwith MD2 and the interacting residues."]
