["Fungal specialized metabolites play an important role in the environment and have impacted human health and survival significantly. These specialized metabolites are often the end product of a series of sequential and collaborating biosynthetic enzymes that reside within different subcellular compartments. A wide variety of methods have been developed to understand fungal specialized metabolite biosynthesis in terms of the chemical conversions and the biosynthetic enzymes required, however there are far fewer studies elucidating the compartmentalization of the same enzymes. This review illustrates the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites where the localization of all, or some, of the biosynthetic enzymes have been determined and describes the methods used to identify the sub-cellular localization."]
