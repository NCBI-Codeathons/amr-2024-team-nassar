["Grafting can overcome problems with soil sensitivity, enhance plant stress tolerance, improve product quality, and increase crop yield and value. This paper reviews the various mechanisms of vegetable grafting, the graft survival process and its influencing factors, the practical applications of grafting, and the molecular regulation of grafting in vegetables. The importance of germplasm and rootstock interactions, the mechanization of vegetable grafting, and future aspects, including intelligence and digitalization, are discussed."]
