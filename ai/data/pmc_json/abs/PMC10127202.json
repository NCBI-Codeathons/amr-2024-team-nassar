["", "In\nthis study, an unprecedented myxobacterial siderophore\ntermed\nsorangibactin was discovered by heterologous expression of a coelibactin-like\nnonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster from the Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622. De novo structure elucidation\nuncovered a linear polycyclic structure consisting of an N-terminal\nphenol group, an oxazole, tandem N-methyl-thiazolidines,\nand an unusual C-terminal \u03b3-thiolactone moiety. Except for the\nunprecedented oxazoline dehydrogenation to form an oxazole, which\nwe show to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, other\ntailoring steps were found necessary for efficient downstream processing.\nThe unusual thioesterase (TE) domain is proposed to select homocysteine\nor methionine for offloading involving an intramolecular \u03b3-thiolactone\nformation. Its active site comprises a rare cysteine, which was found\nessential for product formation by point mutation to alanine or serine,\nwhich both abolished its activity. This unusual release mechanism\nand the resulting rare thiolactone structure can serve as a starting\npoint for detailed biochemical investigations."]
