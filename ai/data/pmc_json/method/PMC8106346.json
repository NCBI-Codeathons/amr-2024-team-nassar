The fungal strains were routinely transferred every 3 to 4 d into fresh reduced liquid medium with 0.1 g of 4 mm milled reed canary grass as growth substrate. P. finnis was cultivated in Medium C (67).

The antiSMASH library was queried against the SM Clusters library with the \u2212gapopen and \u2212gapextend options set to the maximum values (32767) to ensure gap-free alignments.

Thresholds for hits were as follows: minimum E-value 10\u22128, minimum qcovhsp 25%, and minimum identity 30%. The top hit for each query was considered to be the hit with the highest bitscore within these thresholds. The biosynthetic core gene in the reading frame with the most predicted domains was queried, except in cases where ClusterFinder (20) predicted multiple genes. In this case, all biosynthetic genes were searched. If the top hit for all genes was from the same taxonomic phylum, the result was counted once (e.g., cluster 3 on scaffold 152 of N. californiae).

Additionally, BLAST analysis was performed against fungal proteins from MycoCosm database (26), excluding sequences belonging to Neocallimastigomycota clade. For each ketosynthase domain, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on selected homologs. We selected up to 10 best hits from 1) prokaryota, 2) nonfungal eukaryotes, and 3) non-Neocallimastigomycota fungal proteins, such that the maximum number of sequences used for each tree was 31. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) (70) with subsequent removal of nonreliable aligned positions using trimAl (71). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using FastTree (72) and RAxML (73). We considered as potential nonfungal HGT events the cases when a given Neocallimastigomycota domain was nested within a prokaryotae or nonfungal eukaryota clade, and all branches of the tree had at least a 70% of bootstrap support values.

Proteins were not identified in A. robustus, P. finnis, and N. californiae by Pfam domain search. To further expand the search, we used vosA from A. nidulans to query the other genomes by a protein BLAST+ search against all protein models in the remaining three strains of anaerobic gut fungi.

The advantages of OrthoFinder include the ability to remove sequence length bias from sequence similarity scores as well as the ability to define orthogroup similarity limits (56). Further details about the OrthoFinder algorithm can be found in ref. 56. The OrthoFinder algorithm can be downloaded from www.stevekellylab.com/software/orthofinder.

A protein BLAST was performed locally using Blast2GO (78) with the respective transcriptome as the subject sequences (78). The biosynthetic genes were considered transcribed if hits were returned with E-value cutoff 0.001, similarity greater than 95%, and Hsp/Query greater than 95%.

A network was then created with the following criteria used for the edges: 1) cosine score above 0.7 and 2) greater than six matched peaks. Furthermore, edges between nodes were only considered in the network if and only if each of the consensus spectra represented by the nodes were part of other node\u2019s top 10 most similar nodes.
