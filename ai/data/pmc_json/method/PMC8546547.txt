MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions. The strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table S2. Streptomyces strains were grown at 30°C on solid MS medium (59) (mannitol soya flour medium), DNA (2.3% Difco nutrient agar), and MH agar (1.5% agar in Mueller-Hinton broth, purchased from Oxoid) or in liquid YPM2 (0.4% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 1% malt extract [pH 7.2]) or AVM (60) media. The spore suspensions of S. lincolnensis were prepared and germinated for 3 h in 2× GM (1% yeast extract, 1% Casamino Acids, 0.01 M CaCl2), and the spore suspensions of S. coelicolor were germinated for 6 h in 2× YT (1.6% Bacto tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) according to protocols published in Practical Streptomyces Genetics (61). For the selection of exconjugants, antibiotics were added to the cultivation media at the following concentrations: apramycin, 50 mg liter−1; kanamycin, 50 mg liter−1; carbenicillin, 100 mg liter−1; chloramphenicol, 25 mg liter−1; nalidixic acid, 25 mg liter−1; and hygromycin at 100 mg liter−1 (E. coli) or 40 mg liter−1 (Streptomyces) in agar plates or at 80 mg liter−1 (E. coli) or 40 mg liter−1 (Streptomyces) in liquid media.

(i) For antibiotic production, proteomic analysis and RT-PCR, S. lincolnensis and its derived mutants or S. caelestis spores were germinated and inoculated into 50 ml of YPM2 (to reach optical density at 450 nm [OD450] 0.03) in 250-ml baffled flasks and cultivated on an orbital shaker for 40 to 42 h at 30°C and 200 rpm. A total of 2.5 ml of the YPM2 seed culture was used to inoculate 47.5 ml of fresh AVM broth (60), followed by cultivation in 250-ml baffled flasks for 120 h at 30°C and 200 rpm (see Fig. S7b). (ii) For the qPCR analyses and Western blot analyses of S. lincolnensis, spores were germinated, inoculated into 50-ml Falcon tubes containing 20 ml of YPM2 media (to reach OD450 0.03), and grown on an orbital shaker (8 h, 30°C, 200 rpm) prior to induction. The cultures were then induced with the antibiotic indicated, and the cultivation continued for an additional 8 h (see Fig. S7b). (iii) For the Western blot analysis of S. coelicolor, spores were germinated, transferred into 50 ml of YEME (0.3% yeast extract, 0.05% peptone, 0.03% malt extract, 1% glucose, 34% sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2) in 250-ml flasks with springs, and cultivated on an orbital shaker for 48 h at 30°C and 200 rpm. The cultures were then induced with clindamycin (0.03 mg/liter) and cultivated for 2 h (see Fig. S7c). Construction of knockout strains. The S. lincolnensis ΔA (BN3024), S. lincolnensis ΔB (BN3002), and S. lincolnensis ΔC (BN3001) mutants were constructed by replacing the entire coding sequence of the target gene with a cassette (773 or 775 [62]) carrying the apramycin resistance gene [aac(3)IV] and oriT of RK2 using the PCR-targeting method (63). Oligonucleotides used for gene deletion and verification of the deletion are listed in Table S2. PCR targeting was applied to the cosmid LK6 (23), which contained the entire lincomycin biosynthetic cluster. After conjugation of mutated cosmids into S. lincolnensis, kanamycin-sensitive (Kans) and apramycin-resistant (Aprr) double-crossover mutants with target genes replaced by the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette were confirmed by PCR amplification. For the construction of S. lincolnensis ΔAB (BN3021), S. lincolnensis ΔAC (BN3018), and S. lincolnensis ΔBC (BN3008) double mutants, the inactivation cassettes 773 in S. lincolnensis ΔB (BN3002) and S. lincolnensis ΔC (BN3001) single mutants were replaced by an unmarked in-frame deletion obtained by FLP-mediated excision of the disruption cassette (62). The second gene to be deleted was replaced with cassette 775 according to the same protocol as used for single-knockout strains. Knockout strains were verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. The scheme of the orientation of inactivation cassettes in all knockout strains is available in Fig. S1. Construction of vectors for natural, constitutive, or inducible expression. Details on the preparation of vectors and oligonucleotides used are listed in Table S2. The vectors An (bearing lmrA with its 1,330-bp upstream sequence), Bn (bearing lmrB gene with an 86-bp upstream region), and Cn (bearing lmrC gene and its 1,281-bp upstream region) were used to express resistance genes under its natural promoter. For constitutive expression, lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC were PCR amplified from ligated under the ermEp promoter of pIJ10257 (64), yielding plasmids AC, BC, and CC. For the coexpression of lmrA or lmrB with lmrC in the heterologous host, lmrC with the ermEp promoter was cloned into PtipA expression vector pIJ6902 (65) (construct Cc2). All the above-mentioned vectors were prepared by restriction enzyme cloning. Constructs CC-mCh, C-U-mCh, U-mCh, UC-mCh, 5′C-mCh, and C-mCh were prepared by using the SLICE cloning method (66) (for details, see Table S2). Inducible expression in vectors Ci and CEQ12i were achieved by introducing the theophylline-dependent riboswitch (67) via the whole plasmid PCR (details in Table S2). All the constructs described were verified by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis. To introduce mutations, the QuikChange protocol (Agilent) was used. In plasmid CEQ12, for expression of the lmrCEQ12 mutant, two mutations were introduced into the lmrC coding sequence: glutamate 167 was replaced with a codon for glutamine, and the parallel codon for glutamate 495 was replaced with a codon for glutamine. To test the putative terminator structure, a series of G-to-C and C-to-G point mutations were introduced into the lmrC upstream region in C-mCh vector, yielding plasmids pGBN120, pGBN121, and pGBN124. To test the function of uORFs 1 to 4, their START codons were mutated in C-mCh, yielding plasmids pGBN070 (uORF 1), pGBN106 (uORF 2), pGBN117 (uORF 3), and pGBN119 (uORF 4). All used oligonucleotides are listed in Table S2. All the constructs described were verified by sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility tests. The MIC values were determined on MH agar with a serial 2-fold dilution of antibiotics. Frozen spores (see Fig. S7a) or mycelia from 42-h seed culture or 120-h production culture (see Fig. S7b) were diluted in 2 ml of sterile water to optical density OD450 0.2 to 0.3, and 5 μl was spotted on MH agar with antibiotic and incubated at 30°C for 5 days. Extraction of lincomycin and celesticetin. A total of 1 ml of supernatant from 42-h seed culture or 160-h production culture (see Fig. S7b) was used for solid-phase extraction as follows: an Oasis HLB 3-ml 60-mg cartridge (hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced sorbent; Waters, USA) was conditioned with 3 ml of methanol and equilibrated with 3 ml of water, and then 1 ml of the supernatant of cultivation broth (for lincomycin extraction pH adjusted to 9.0 with ammonium hydroxide) was loaded. The cartridge was washed with 3 ml of water, and absorbed substances were eluted with 1.5 ml of 80% methanol. The eluent was evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in 150 μl of 50% methanol, and centrifuged at 12,045 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The extract was then diluted 10× with methanol-water (1:1 [vol/vol]) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as described below. LC-MS analysis of lincomycin and celesticetin. LC analyses of the samples depicted in Fig. 1 and in Fig. 3a were performed on an Acquity UPLC system equipped with a 2996 DAD detector and LCT premier XE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters). Five microliters of each sample was loaded onto an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 LC column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, inner diameter [ID]; particle size, 1.7 μm; Waters) kept at 40°C and eluted with a two-component mobile phase. For phases A and B, the A solution was 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 9) for lincomycin detection (prepared by titration of formic acid 98 to 100% [Merck, Germany] with ammonium hydroxide 28 to 30% [Sigma-Aldrich, Germany]), the A solution was 0.1% formic acid for celesticetin detection, and the B solution was acetonitrile (LC-MS grade; Biosolve, Netherlands). The analyses were performed with a linear gradient program (min/%B): 0/5, 1.5/5, and 12.5/58, followed by a 1.5-min column cleanup (100% B) and 1.5-min equilibration (5% B) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1. The DAD detector monitored the column effluent in the range 194 to 600 nm; the mass spectrometer operated in the “W” mode with its capillary voltage set at +2,800 V, its cone voltage at +40 V, its desolvation gas temperature at 350°C, an ion source block temperature at 120°C, cone gas flow at 50 liters h−1, desolvation gas flow at 800 liters h−1, a scan time at 0.15 s, and an interscan delay at 0.01 s. The data were processed by MassLynx V4.1 (Waters). UV chromatograms monitored at 194 nm were used for lincomycin quantitation based on a five-point linear calibration curve, which was constructed from peak areas corresponding to lincomycin. Calibration solutions were prepared by spiking lincomycin authentic standard at the required concentration into lincomycin-free cultivation broth, extracted and preconcentrated as described above. The quantitation parameters were as follows: concentrations used for the calibration curve were 3.78, 7.56, 15.125, 31.250, 62.5, and 125 mg liter−1, the correlation coefficient was r2 = 0.995, and the limit of quantification was 7.56 mg liter−1 (determined as the lowest point of the calibration curve with precision within 10%). Samples from 42 h of cultivation with lincomycin concentrations below the limit of quantitation were examined by MS detection: extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 407.2 were evaluated for the presence of lincomycin. The 160-h samples for celesticetin production were also examined using MS detection: extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 528.6 were evaluated for the presence of celesticetin. The LC-MS analyses depicted in Fig. 2b and Fig. S2 were performed on a 6546 LC/Q-TOF (Agilent Technologies, USA) connected to a 1290 Infinity II LC system. One microliter of the sample was loaded on a UPLC CSH C18 Premier column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, ID; particle size, 1.7 μm) kept at 30°C. The analytes were eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1 with a two-component mobile phase consisting of 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 9) (A) and acetonitrile (B) using a linear gradient program min/%B: 0/5, 1.5/5, 15/65, 15.1/100, 16/100, 16.1/5, and 17.5/5. The mass spectrometer operated in ESI+ mode (jet stream technology) with the following settings: capillary voltage, 3,500 V; nozzle voltage, 200 V; gas temperature, 250°C; drying gas, 8 liters min−1; nebulizer, 35 lb/in2; sheath gas temperature, 400°C; sheath gas flow, 12 liters min−1; fragmentor, 140 V; and skimmer, 65 V. The ions of m/z 80 to 1,200 were monitored with scan rates of 4 spectra s−1 and 250 ms/spectrum. The identity of the analytes was confirmed by the comparison of retention times with an authentic standard, accurate mass, and collision-induced dissociation fragmentation at a collision energy of 20 eV. The data were processed using Quantitative 10.1 software within a MassHunter workstation (Agilent). Lincomycin quantitation was performed using a standard calibration curve of the lincomycin standard (2-fold serial dilutions from 0.0097 to 40 mg liter−1) dissolved in the solid-phase extract of a lincomycin nonproducing Streptomyces lincolnensis
lmbD deletion mutant strain. The LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) was determined as the lowest analyte concentration determined with sufficient precision (relative standard deviation of 20%) and accuracy (80 to 120%) using a calibration curve with its lowest point being equal to LLOQ. Protein digestion for proteomic analysis. Mycelia (0.1 g) of 40-h seed culture inoculated from fresh spores (see Fig. S7b) were lysed in 0.5 ml of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 2% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 40 mM chloroacetamide and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo), and 20 μg of protein per sample was used for MS sample preparation. Samples were digested with trypsin (at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1/20) at 37°C overnight. After digestion, the samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 1%. Sodium deoxycholate was removed by extraction to ethyl acetate (68), and peptides were desalted on a Michrom C18 column. nLC-MS2 analysis. Nanoreversed-phase columns (EASY-Spray column, 50 cm by 75 μm, ID; PepMap C18; 2-μm particles, 100-Å pore size) were used for LC-MS analysis. Mobile-phase buffer A was composed of water and 0.1% formic acid. Mobile-phase buffer B was composed of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Samples were loaded onto the trap column (Acclaim PepMap300; C18, 5 μm; 300-Å Wide Pore; 300 μm × 5 mm; five cartridges) for 4 min at 17.5 μl min−1 loading buffer composed of water, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted with a mobile-phase B gradient from 4 to 35% B in 60 min. Eluting peptide cations were converted to gas-phase ions by electrospray ionization and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion (Q-OT-qIT; Thermo). Survey scans of peptide precursors from 350 to 1,400 m/z were performed at 120 K resolution (at 200 m/z) with a 5 × 105 ion count target. Tandem MS was performed by isolation at 1.5 m/z with the quadrupole, higher-energy C-trap dissociation fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 30, and rapid scan MS analysis in the ion trap. The MS2 ion count target was set to 104, and the maximum injection time was 35 ms. Only those precursors with charge states of 2 to 6 were sampled for MS2. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 45 s with a 10-ppm tolerance around the selected precursor and its isotopes. Monoisotopic precursor selection was turned on. The instrument was run in the top speed mode with 2-s cycles (69). Proteomic data analysis and interpretation. All data were analyzed and quantified with MaxQuant software (version 1.6.1.0) (70). The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% for both proteins and peptides, and we specified a minimum peptide length of seven amino acids. The Andromeda search engine was used for the MS/MS spectra search against the Streptomyces lincolnensis database (downloaded from the NCBI on July 2018). Enzyme specificity was set with the C terminus as Arg and Lys, also allowing cleavage at proline bonds and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification, and N-terminal protein acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. The “match between runs” feature of MaxQuant was used to transfer identifications to other LC-MS/MS runs based on their masses and retention time (maximum deviation, 0.7 min), and this was also used in quantification experiments. Quantifications were performed with the label-free algorithms described recently. The obtained normalized data were imported to Perseus 1.6.1.3 software (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Munich, Germany) (71). All numeric values corresponding to protein intensity were transformed to a logarithmic scale, and all samples were grouped using categorical annotation. Missing values were then replaced by random numbers drawn from a normal distribution of 1.8 standard deviations (SD) downshift and with a width of 0.3 of each sample. Heat maps of the relative abundance of selected proteins were generated from the matrix of protein intensities without imputation of missing values in Microsoft Excel. Proteomic analysis at 40 h was assessed in five biological (four for ΔC without clindamycin) replicates for each sample/treatment. RT-PCR. Mycelia from 16-h seed cultures were uninduced or induced by clindamycin (0.5 mg liter−1) (see Fig. S7c), and 5-ml portions the culture were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the analysis, samples were defrosted and incubated in 1 ml of RNAprotect cell reagent (Qiagen; 5 min, 25°C). Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged (4,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), and the pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of TE buffer. The suspension was mixed with glass beads (0.1-mm diameter) in a 2:1 ratio and disrupted using a Fast-Prep (MP Biomedicals) program for 1 × 60 s at a speed of 6 ms−1. Immediately after cell lysis, total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (T9424, 100 ml; Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated total RNA, resuspended in 100 μl of water, was treated with Turbo DNase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by an additional step of total RNA isolation using TRI Reagent. The integrity of RNA was controlled by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The purity and concentration of RNA were controlled by using NanoDrop.cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One microliter of reverse transcription reaction mix or total RNA was added to 20 μl of PCR mix using the primers indicated (sequences in Table S2). PCR was performed using Taq-Purple DNA polymerase (T107). The following PCR program was used: 96°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 96°C for 10 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 1 min. Quantitative RT-PCR. The 16-h clindamycin-induced and uninduced seed cultures were cultivated and incubated in 1 ml of Protect RNA in the same manner as for RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The isolated RNA was treated with DNase I (0.1 U μl−1, 30 min, 37°C) and repurified with an RNeasy RNA isolation kit. The RNA quantity and quality were checked with a NanoDrop instrument (DeNovix). The RNA quantities were normalized to the lowest concentration of RNA in the samples. The quantities of lmrC, lmbU, lmbN, and 16S rRNA transcripts were measured by one-step qRT-PCR (SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit) using the following oligonucleotides (10 μM): lmrCf+lmrCr, lmbUf+lmbUr, lmbNf+lmbNr, and 16SrRNAf+16SrRNAr. The following real-time PCR program was used: 60°C for 3 min, 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 65°C (lmbU, lmbN, and 16S rRNA) or 63°C (lmrC) for 20 s. CT values of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN transcripts, based on the standard curves, were normalized to CT values of 16S rRNA. The relative expression was calculated as 2–ΔCT. Western blotting and immunodetection. For S. lincolnensis, 20-ml seed cultures inoculated with germinated spores were induced with lincomycin (4 mg liter−1), clindamycin (0.5 mg liter−1), pristinamycin IIA (4 mg liter−1), tiamulin (0.125 mg liter−1), erythromycin (0.5 mg liter−1), pristinamycin IA (4 mg liter−1), chloramphenicol (4 mg liter−1), and carbenicillin (4 mg liter−1) at 8 h, and cultivation continued until the indicated time points (see Fig. S7c). Mycelia were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4°C, 4,000 × g), washed with buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]; pH 8.0). After sonication (3 × 40 s; UP200S Hielscher Ultrasonic GmbH), cell lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue to test the load of whole protein volume. Next, 8% SDS-PAGE with adjusted whole protein volumes was run, and samples were Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (semidry transfer, 15 V, 45 min, Trans-blot; Bio-Rad). A control SDS-PAGE was run in parallel. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking solution 5% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad) in PBS-Tween buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), followed by incubation for an additional 1 h with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-LmrC or rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dried milk in PBS-Tween buffer. Membranes were washed for three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG 1:2,000 in 1% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker in PBS-Tween buffer, and washed three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer. Antibody complexes were detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Merck) on a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). For S. coelicolor, the method was adapted as follows: 50-ml seed cultures inoculated with germinated spores were induced with clindamycin (0.03 mg liter−1) at 24 h, and cultivation continued for 2 h. Mycelia were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4°C, 4,000 × g) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche], 1% SDS [pH 8.0]). After lysis on Fast prep (four times for 20 s each time, with 4-min pauses on ice), cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (wet transfer, 30 V, 0.09 mA, 18 h). The membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking solution composed of 5% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad) in PBS-Tween buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and for 1 h with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody [Invitrogen] or mouse polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody [AB Clonal]) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dried milk in PBS-Tween buffer. Membranes were washed three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer, incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG 1:2,000 in 1% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker in PBS-Tween buffer, and washed three times for 15 min each time in PBS-Tween buffer. Antibody complexes were detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Merck) on a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). After immunodetection, the membrane was washed with PBS-Tween buffer and then stained with 0.1% Coomassie R-250 in methanol/water (1:1) for 5 min, destained twice for 10 min each time in acetic acid-ethanol-water (1:5:4), washed with water, and air dried. The dry membrane was recorded on ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad) at 600 dpi, and the staining density for each complete lane was analyzed in ImageLab (Bio-Rad) or ImageJ software with an area outside the protein lanes defining the background. The signal intensities were normalized to the signal intensity of the induced BN3038 strain (for S. coelicolor) or BN3511 (for S. lincolnensis) transferred to the same membrane. Statistical analysis. The MIC, Western blot, and qRT-PCR results are expressed as the means ± the SD. Differences between two groups were analyzed using a two-sample t test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; and P > 0.05 if not indicated). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate unless otherwise stated. Antibodies. The anti-LmrC(2) antibody was generated by GenScript USA, Inc., by inoculating a New Zealand rabbit host strain with a peptide-KLH conjugate containing the LmrC peptide CLQRQAQESAGRAAS. The specificity of the LmrC antibody was validated using S. lincolnensis WT and ΔC mycelium from 16-h seed cultures (see Fig. S7c) grown in the absence or presence of lincomycin (LIN; 4 mg liter−1) or clindamycin (CLI; 0.5 mg liter−1) (see Fig. S5a). The anti-m-Cherry antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Cat PA5-34974) and AB Clonal. The ribosomal protein S7-specific antibody was obtained from Mee-Ngan F. Yap (72). Data availability.
