Methods for cloning and protein purification are provided in the Supporting Information (Text S1 and Table S2).", "Modification Assay of His6-VenA with His6-VenL Analogues", "His6-VenA was incubated with His6-VenL, His6-VenL-\u0394C, His6-VenL-\u0394LC, or both His6-VenL-\u0394LC and His6-VenL-\u0394KC (final concentration: 2 \u00b5M each for His6-VenL and His6-VenL-\u0394C, 4 \u00b5M each for His6-VenL-\u0394LC and His6-VenL-\u0394KC) in a reaction buffer that contained (final concentrations) 50 mM HEPES\u00b7Na buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM ATP, 1 mM TCEP, 25 \u00b5M His6-VenA, and 5% DMSO. The reactions with His6-VenL and His6-VenL-\u0394C were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 3 h and the assays with His6-VenL-\u0394LC or His6-VenL-\u0394KC were incubated for 15 h. For mass spectrometric analysis, 10 \u00b5L of each reaction mixture was desalted using ZipTipC18 (Millipore), eluted with 1 \u00b5L of a 75% MeCN/25% water solution containing 0.1% TFA and saturated sinapinic acid, and spotted onto the target plate for analysis by using a Voyager-DE-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems).", "IAA Modification Assay of Modified His6-VenA", "After incubation of His6-VenA with His6-VenL in 20 \u00b5L of modification assay buffer, 6 \u00b5L of IAA reaction buffer (330 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5, 33 mM IAA, 6.7 mM TCEP) was added. The solution was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15 h, desalted using ZipTipC18, and subjected to MALDI-ToF MS.", "LC-ESI-Q/ToF MS Analysis of Cyclized VenA Analogs", "After treatment of each His6-VenA analog with His6-VenL, 0.3 U of endoproteinase Glu-C (Fluka) was added to 20 \u00b5L of assay solution. The solution was further incubated at 25\u00b0C for 18 h. An aliquot of 10 \u00b5L of the resulting sample was fractionated on an Acquity UPLC (Waters) equipped with a C8 column (100 mm\u00d71 mm) using a gradient of 3%\u201397% B over 12 min (A\u200a=\u200a water containing 0.1% formic acid, B\u200a=\u200a methanol containing 0.1% formic acid), and directly subjected to ESI-Q/ToF MS (Synapt MS system, Waters). Nitrogen was used as cone gas (150 L/min) and desolvation gas (600 L/min). The capillary voltage was set to 3.5 kV. The ionization source and desolvation gas were heated to 120\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C, respectively. The ions having m/z\u200a=\u200a1,104.34 (trivalent ion of VenA) or 1,093.65 (trivalent ions for the VenA mutants) were fragmented with a trap collision energy of 20\u201340 V. The acquired spectrum was converted to a deconvoluted spectrum by using the MaxEnt3 program (Waters)."]
