Cells were harvested and washed twice with equal volume of distilled water, then transferred into sucrose minimal medium and fermented at 18\u2009\u00b0C for 72\u2009hours for PHTs producing. In the feeding experiments, 0.5\u2009mM authentic oligopeptides were fed in the fermentation process of phtU- and phtQ- mutants respectively.", "PHT biosynthesis related genes in-frame deletion and complementation", "PHTs native producer P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A genome Fosmid library was constructed with CopyControl\u2122 Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre\u00ae Biotechnologies products) according to standard protocols36. Fosmid 7C6 with a 33.6\u2009kb DNA insert which covers the complete PHT biosynthetic gene cluster and flanking sequence of 5.5\u2009kb upstream and 3.3\u2009kb downstream was screened out by PCR. Gene phtU of Fosmid 7C6 was replaced by Apramycin resistant gene aac(3)IV from plasmid pIJ773 by PCR targeting with primer pair DUF1/DUR2 (Table S1)37. Gene aac(3)IV was eliminated by FLP-recombinase mediated excision in E.coli DH5\u03b1/BT340 to generate a disruption cassette pWHU2001. Plasmids pWHU2001 were transferred into P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A cells by electroporation and single crossover recombinant strains resistant to chloramphenicol were picked up. The phtU gene in-frame deletion mutant strains CL001 resulted from double crossover were selected out by rounds of relaxation and chloramphenicol sensitivity tests and then validated by PCR with primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Figure S2A, S2B, Table S1). Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ and phtL in-frame deletion. Primer pair DQF1/DQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ PCR targeting and primer pair VQF1/VQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ- mutant strain CL002 PCR validation (Figure S2C, S2D). Primer pair DLF1/DLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL PCR targeting and primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL- mutant strain CL003 PCR validation (Figure S2E, S2F).", "To the gene complementation of phtU and phtQ in CL001 and CL002 strains, the constitutive promotor of gene phtA was employed to construct infusion genes PphtA-ORFphtU and PphtA-ORFphtQ. A 227\u2009bp DNA fragment containing PphtA was amplified by PCR with primer pair PphtAF1/PphtAR2 (Table S1). The ORF region of gene phtU was amplified by PCR with primer pair PhtUF1/PhtUR2 (Table S1). These two fragments were insert into the BamHI site of a RK2-derived plasmid pRKaraRED to give recombinant plasmid pWHU2004. Transformation of pWHU2004 into phtU- mutant strain CL001 gave phtU gene complementation strain CL004. Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ complementation strain CL005 construction with the exception of that phtQ was amplified with primer pair PhtQF1/PhtQR2 (Table S1) and the recombinant plasmid was defined as pWHU2005.", "ArgK over-expression and enzyme assay", "Gene argK was amplified by PCR with primer pair OKF1/OKR2 (Table S1) and inserted into the BamHI/XhoI locus of vector pET28a. His\u00b7tag-ArgK fusion proteins were over-expressed and purified with standard protocol36. Authentic standards of L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg were purchased from Life Tein L.T.D.

PHTs samples from the culture supernatants of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A were used to build the MS fragmentation fingerprint of PHTs and desulfonated PHTs by selected ion reaction (SIR) method. Daughter ions with m/z ratio at 189 and 374 were recognized to be the characteristic fragments of PHTs. To screen for PHTs biosynthetic intermediates, PIS was performed in a positive mode on a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Access MAX instrument (monitoring m/z ratio at 189 and 374) equipped with a Thermo Scientific Accela 600 pump.
