Methods Strains, Materials,
and General Methods All primers
(Integrated DNA Technology) and strains used in this study are summarized
in Supporting Information Tables S3 and S4, respectively. M. echinospora strain LL6000 and
calicheamicin γ1I were graciously provided
by Pfizer. Dynemicin and esperamicin A1 were generously
provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. All other reagents and chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated. All protein
structures were illustrated using PyMOL.58 Gene alignments and analyses were performed using Geneious Pro 5.0.3.59 Parental Plasmids for Protein Production For biochemical
characterization, genomic DNA was extracted from M. echinospora LL6000 using the InstaGene Matrix Kit (BioRad) following manufacturer’s
protocol. Primers CalU16-NdeI-F/CalU16-HindIII-R,
CalU17-NdeI-F/CalU17-HindIII-R, and CalU19-NdeI-F/CalU19-HindIII-R (Supporting Information Table
S3) were used to amplify each of calU16, calU17, and calU19, respectively. Amplification
was performed using the Advantage GC2 polymerase enzyme (Clontech)
and the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C
for 3 min; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65–62 °C
for 30 s, 68 °C for 35 s; final extension temperature at 68 °C
for 5 min. Each PCR product was gel purified using the QIAquick gel
extraction kit (Qiagen). Restriction digestion with NdeI/HindIII (New Englands Biolabs, NEB) followed by ligation using T4 DNA
ligase (NEB) into a linearized dephosphorylated pET28a (Novagen) yielded
pSECalU16, pSECalU17, and pSECalU19 for calU16, calU17, and calU19, respectively. Each
plasmid was transformed into NEB DH5α chemically competent cells
(NEB). Plasmids were purified using QIAprep Minispin kit (Qiagen).
Each plasmid was verified by sequencing and subsequently transformed
into the expression host BL21 (DE3) competent cells (NEB) to yield
pSECalU16-E. coli, pSECalU17-E. coli, and pSECalU19-E. coli, respectively. For structural
studies, plasmid preparation, overproduction, and purification were
conducted following standard protocols of the Northeast Structural
Genomics Consortium (NESG) to produce a uniformly 15N/13C-enriched and 5% biosynthetically directed 13C (NC5)-labeled protein samples for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine
(Se-Met) labeled samples for X-ray crystallography and details can
be found in Supporting Information Methods.60,61 In brief, calU16 was PCR
amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET15
expression vector (NESG Clone ID MiR12–15.1; PSI:Biology Materials
Repository clone ID MeCD000597015, see http://psimr.asu.edu/) to encode for the corresponding N-terminally tagged (MGHHHHHHSHM)
fusion protein. The plasmid was transformed into codon-enhanced E. coli BL21 (DE3) pMGK cells for protein production. Additional
plasmids and protocols employed for protein overproduction and purification
for biochemical studies are described in the Supporting
Information Methods. Structure Determination of CalU16 by X-ray
Crystallography Initial crystallization conditions for Se-Met
labeled CalU16 were
identified at the Hauptmann-Woodward Institute high-throughput screening
facility62 and further optimized manually
by microbatch methods at 18 °C. The protein was mixed in a 1:1
ratio with the precipitant containing 2.9 M sodium malonate pH 6.5.
The crystals were cryo-protected by 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and
2.6 M sodium malonate pH 6.5 prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen
for data collection at 100 K. A single crystal of Se-Met labeled protein
was used for data collection at a wavelength of 0.978 Å and diffracted
to 2.5 Å resolution. The data was collected at beamline X4A at
the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory,
and further processed and scaled using HKL-2000 (Table 1).63 Eight of the ten selenium
sites in the asymmetric unit were successfully located by the SHELXD64 program for initial phasing. RESOLVE65 was utilized for automated model building and
the model was further built by manual refitting with the program Coot.66 The data were twinned, and a twin refinement
was performed. The refinement involved iterations of manual model-building
in Coot and Refmac.67 The quality of the
final structure was validated by PROCHECK.68 The diffraction images illustrate diffuse scattering perpendicular
to the 61 screw axis indicative of order/disorder (Supporting Information Figure S24). The effects
of the disorder are also evident in the data anisotropy where the
B-factor component along the 61 axis is less than half
of the B-factor in the perpendicular direction. The unmodeled disorder
leads to higher than expected R-factors and is likely contributing
to the lower percentage of residues in the Ramachandran favored regions
(Table 1). The atomic coordinates and structure
factors have been deposited in the PDB (4FPW). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure
Determination of CalU16 NMR data were collected at 25 °C
on [U-13C, 15N]- and U-15N,
5% biosynthetically directed 13C (NC5)-labeled samples
in 300 μL buffered solution (0.9 mM CalU16, 0.02% NaN3, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM CaCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1× proteinase
inhibitors, 20 mM MES pH 6.5) in 5 mm Shigemi NMR tubes on a 600 MHz
Varian Inova spectrometer with a 5 mm HCN cold probe and a 850 MHz
Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer equipped with a conventional 5
mm HCN probe. A description of NMR experiments and methods for structure
determination and refinement can be found in Supporting
Information Methods. The protein was monomeric under the conditions
used in the NMR experiments based on analytical static light scattering
in-line with gel filtration chromatography and correlation time estimates
based on one-dimensional 15N T1 and T2 relaxation data (estimated τc 12.1 ns, Supporting Information Figure
S1). The assigned 1H–15N HSQC
spectrum is provided as Supporting Information
Figure S2. Chemical shifts, NOESY peak lists, and raw FIDS
were deposited in the BioMagResDB (BMRB accession number 18547). The
final ensemble of 20 models and NMR resonance assignments were deposited
to the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 2LUZ). Resistance Assays In vivo resistance
assays were performed using overnight cultures of the tested strain
diluted to OD600 ∼ 0.1 in molten LB agar supplemented
with final concentration of 30 μg mL–1 kanamycin
and 100 μM of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). The mixture was poured into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify.
A stock solution of 1 was prepared in methanol at a concentration
of 1 mg mL–1 and serial dilutions were prepared
such that the final concentrations tested ranged from 0.1 to 10 μg
μL–1. These were applied to sterile discs
such that the final quantities of 1 on the discs were
1 ng, 10 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, 1 μg, and 10 μg. The disks
were allowed to air-dry, and applied aseptically to the plates. All
plates were incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. Protein Cleavage Assay Final concentration of 1 μM
of each protein in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 in the presence of 1 mol equiv
of 1 with and without 0.2 mM DTT in a final volume of
500 μL was allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions
were lyophilized and resuspended in 25 μL of 50 mM Tris, pH
8.0. Cleavage was analyzed by mixing with equal volume of 2×
sample buffer. A volume of 30 μL was analyzed by NuPAGE 4–12%
Bis-Tris Gels (Life technologies) using protein ladder (Bio-Rad) as
size indicator. Trypsin Digestion and Mass Analysis A total of 4 μM
of each of CalU16 and CalU19 were added to 2 mol equiv of 1 in the presence of 0.2 mM DTT. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C
for 30 min. A fraction of each reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE
to confirm completion of the reaction. For proteolytic digestion,
the protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gel, washed with 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide
(IAA), and subjected to trypsin (for CalU16) or chymotrypsin (for
CalU19) digestion at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides resulting from
the proteolytic digestion were extracted from gel pieces and analyzed
by LC-MS/MS as previously described.69 Briefly,
the information-dependent acquisition of LC-MS/MS data were acquired
using an LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) coupled with a Nano-LC Ultra/cHiPLC-nanoflex HPLC system
(Eksigent, Dublin, CA) through a nano-electrospray ionization source.70 The results were subjected using ProteomeDiscoverer
1.3 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and MASCOT server.
The cleavage sites were deduced from nonenzymatic peptides ending
with an amine group (−NH2) from the Gly residue
attached to a nontrypsin or nonchymotrypsin digestion site. Determination
of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) Fourteen strains
created in this study (Supporting
Information Table S4, strains 2–15) were grown overnight
in LB supplemented with kanamycin 30 mg L–1. Each
overnight culture was diluted to OD600 ∼ 0.1 using
an Overnight Express Autoinduction System 1 (Novagen) supplemented
with kanamycin 30 mg L–1. Enediyne 1 was serially diluted 1:2 in DMSO such that the final concentrations
ranged from 2.4 μM to 4.5 nM for pSE28a-E. coli and from 12 μM to 22 nM for all other strains. Ampicillin
and kanamycin were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
All plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm. The residual
metabolic activity was monitored based on the irreversible reduction
of resazurin (7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one-10-oxide, blue) to resorufin
(7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, pink). For this assay, 10 μL
of resazurin (final concentration 100 μM) was added to each
well and allowed to incubate at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm
for 1 h to allow viable cells to convert resazurin to resorufin. The
well with the minimum concentration of 1 that did not
display bacterial growth but did display a red color after incubation
with resazurin was recorded as the MIC of that strain (Supporting Information Figure S9; Table 3).
