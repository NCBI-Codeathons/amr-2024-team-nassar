["Methods", "cDNA library construction and sequencing", "The A. fumigatus strain CEA17KU80 strain was used for all experiments. The CEA17KU80 strain was derived from the CEA17 wild-type strain [28].", "Total RNA was isolated from wild-type and \u0394mpkA strains cultured in Aspergillus minimal medium (AMM) for 16\u2009h at 37\u00b0C [8], using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Three biological replicates for each strain were collected. Total RNA was used for Illumina next-generation sequencing [29]. For library preparation 5\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA per sample were processed using Illumina mRNA-Seq sample prep kit (RS-100-0801) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The cDNA libraries were sequenced using a Genome Analyser (GAIIx) in a paired-end approach with 2\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u2009cycles resulting in paired reads with a length of 36 nucleotides per read. Each library was sequenced on a single lane and ended up with around 30\u201340 million reads per sample. Sequence data were extracted in FastQ format and used for further analysis.", "Mapping and normalising of transcriptome reads", "All reads were mapped using TopHat 1.2.0 [30] against the A. fumigatus A1163 genome (which is a derivative of the A. fumigatus CEA17 strain) retrieved from Ensemble release 9. Parameters were set according to preliminary investigations, using a minimum intron length of 30 and a maximum of 4000. In agreement with the protocol used, from preliminary mapping a mean inner distance between mate pairs of 307 was found with a standard deviation of 110. To avoid multiple hits for a single read, the maximum multi-hit option was set to one.", "Transcript expression levels were normalised by counting the number of reads per kilobase of exon region per million mapped reads (RPKM) [31].", "To detect genes differentially expressed in the wild type and the \u0394mpkA mutant, we applied the R package baySeq [32] which takes advantage of the three biological replicates for each condition. RPKM and differentially expressed genes were determined using the A. fumigatus A1163 genome annotated by CADRE as a reference.", "Differentially expressed genes were categorised using GO enrichment, KEGG enrichment, and FunCat analysis using the FungiFun platform [22].", "UTRs prediction", "With the purpose of identifying putative new transcripts, we performed new gene annotation employing Augustus ab initio prediction [33] combined with hints generated from the mRNA-Seq reads. We present a new annotation including UTRs for A. fumigatus A1163. These hints consisted of intron junctions that were identified by TopHat as well as exon-parts revealed with the IRanges package which is part of the Bioconductor collection. The workflow for new gene annotation is reported in Figure 1.", "Microarray data", "The transcriptome and proteome data analysed are summarised in Table 1. The datasets were obtained in a pre-processed state i.e. background-corrected and normalised. Since the different microarray platforms and even the different A. fumigatus genomes have used different Gene-IDs (e.g. accession numbers starting with AFUB for the A1163 strain, and accession numbers starting with AFUA for the Af293 strain), all data were mapped according to the AFUA annotation, using ensemble mapping, to achieve comparability. The data were imported and analysed in the R / Bioconductor software environment employing the packages biomaRt and Biostrings.", "Real-Time PCR", "The qRT-PCR experiments to determine the amounts of selected putatively differently expressed genes were performed with StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using myTaq HS Mix 2x (Bioline) and Evagreen (Biotium). For each transcript analysed more primers were tested in tandem, in order to obtain primer efficiency close to 100% in all cases. To validate primers, efficiency standard curves were realised considering seven serial dilutions of genomic DNA of A. fumigatus in three replicates. All the primers selected for the qRT-PCR analysis are shown in Additional file 1: Table S15. The A. fumigatus actin1 gene (AFUA_6G04740) was chosen as the normalising gene. The cDNA was generated using RevertAid Premium (Fermentas). As negative controls, a vial was prepared without reverse transcriptase, and another one was prepared without cDNA.", "Assessing differential expression", "To correlate the mRNA-Seq data with the corresponding presence of proteins, the mRNA-Seq data set was compared with the proteome data published by V\u00f6disch et al.[21]. For our study, the normalised protein spot abundances on the 2D gels were reanalysed using the most recent version of the software Delta 2D 4.3 (Decodon, Germany).", "The DIGE (difference in-gel electrophoresis) technique was used to analyse protein samples of wild type and \u0394mpkA mutant mycelium cultivated in AMM for 16\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. Twelve samples (three independent biological replicates and two technical replicates for each strain as well as one mixed internal standard), were labelled with CyDye minimal dyes according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with slight modifications (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Munich Germany). We then labelled 50\u2009\u03bcg total protein of each sample with 300pmol of CyDye DIGE fluorophores (dissolved in dimethyl formamide). Samples obtained from the wild-type and from the \u0394mpkA mutant strain were labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5. A pool of all six samples (3\u2009\u00d7\u2009wt and 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u0394mpkA) was prepared, labelled with Cy2, and used as a global internal standard. We carried out 2D gel processing, spot screening and MALDI-TOF / TOF analysis with an ultrafleXtreme mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany), as previously described [34] with slight modifications. FlexControl 3.3 software was used for data collection and flexAnalysis 3.3 for spectra analysis and peak list generation (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and peptide fragmentation fingerprint (PFF) spectra were submitted to the MASCOT 2.3 server (Matrix Science, U.K.) searching the recent version of the NCPInr database but restricted to the fungi. Mascot search parameters were the following: fixed modification of cysteine thiols to S-carbamidomethyl derivatives, variable methionine oxidation, up to one missed cleavage and a peptide mass tolerance of 100\u2009ppm.", "Accession number", "The RNA-Seq data were deposited in ArrayExpress (ArrayExpress accession: E-MTAB-1236)."]
