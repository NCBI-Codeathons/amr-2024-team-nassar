["Methods", "A systematic literature search of the PubMed database was conducted on 19 October 2017 for relevant experimental, field and epidemiological studies and reports concerning chronobiology and exercise/physical activity in humans. We combined various search terms pertaining to the hypothesised human circadian system and exercise-zeitgeber relationship in addition to performance and health (table 1) and filtered the returned studies by title, abstract and main text content and findings (figure 1). We further searched the bibliographies of chronobiology and exercise relevant literature and supplemented the returned literature where appropriate (figure 1). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in table 1. Data extraction and interpretation was initially performed by PL. Interpretation of data was also provided by coauthors. Potential sources of bias in the extracted studies are discussed as our own interpretation. Synthesis of studies involved categorisation by type of zeitgeber evidence and outcome measurements (described in the following paragraphs).", "Search string and inclusion/exclusion criteria as of 19 October 2017", "Search string (\u201cChronobiology Discipline\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cCircadian Clocks\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cCircadian Rhythm\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cSleep Phase Chronotherapy\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cBiological Clocks\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cJet Lag Syndrome\u201d[Mesh] OR chrono* OR circadian OR morningness OR eveningness OR jet-lag OR time zone OR zeitgeber OR synchronizer OR \u201centraining agent\u201d) AND (\u201cSports\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cSports Medicine\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cAthletic Performance\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cTask Performance and Analysis\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cResistance Training\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cHigh-Intensity Interval Training\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cCircuit-Based Exercise\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cExercise\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cPlyometric Exercise\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cAthletes\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cExercise Tolerance\u201d[Mesh] OR sport* OR train* OR athletic OR athlete* OR exercise) AND (performance OR health).", "Inclusion criteria Original articles that must consider effects of exercise or physical activity as a potential zeitgeber on circadian rhythmicity, performance, or health in humans and be in English..", "Exclusion criteria The effects of exercise on cognitive states are well documented; thus, studies on mood, subjective exertion, non-sport-associated cognitive ability, and homeostatic drive to sleep were excluded. Furthermore, studies on children and early adolescent teenagers were excluded, as were studies of shift-workers or airline crew. The challenging 24/7 society differentially affects adults, who are the scope of this work, and the impact of shift-work or airline work may allow zeitgeber interactions with exercise that we cannot account for..", "Figure 1Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.", "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.", "To delineate exercise as a zeitgeber for humans, there are a number of criteria it must be able to fulfil as originally put forward by Aschoff in the 1950\u2019s2 and still relevant today: (i) If the zeitgeber is switched off, the biological periodicity\u2014if sustained\u2014should eventually begin to deviate from the precise 24-hour period duration; (ii) reversing a continuously periodic zeitgeber or regular changes of conditions, such as the change of light and dark, must lead to an inversion of the biological periodicity; moreover, temporal shifts of the zeitgeber must lead to phase-shifts against the external time; (iii) depending on the zeitgeber effectiveness, changes of the biological periodicity can be expected by increasing or decreasing zeitgeber frequency. We shall apply these criteria in our synthesis. Furthermore, there are confounders and effect modifiers that we need to be aware of. For instance, when addressing the effectiveness of zeitgebers, Aschoff emphasised that\u2014in most settings\u2014several zeitgebers compete. Moreover, within any given zeitgeber multiplicity, entrainment is determined by both external intensity and internal susceptibility.2 Determinants of the strength of zeitgebers include intensity, duration, phase timing and periodic frequency while the susceptibility of the receiving organism to such information can be assessed by the phase of internal time (indicating a phase response curve),23 and potentially by circadian system robustness.24 In effect, multiple zeitgebers such as light, noise, meals or social contacts may act synergistically or antagonistically, that is, they interact in terms of their \u2018push\u2019 or \u2018pull\u2019 on circadian rhythm phase.2 Best evidence supporting the hypothesis would include an entraining ability of the exercise zeitgeber with circadian phase drifting after removal of that zeitgeber. Additional support for the hypothesis would include evidence for an exercise phase response curve in phase-shifting a biological rhythm. Time-of-day dependent effects of exercise, which support the existence of a phase response curve, will also be discussed as potential evidence.", "Overall, support for the \u2018exercise is a zeitgeber for humans\u2019 hypothesis should include a sufficiently strong and timed exercise stimulus being able to phase-shift the circadian rhythm of the SCN in accordance with Aschoff\u2019s blueprint.2 If there are no data to this effect, other biological processes co-governed with circadian rhythmicity must be assessed as proxies for SCN output for example, body temperature (BT), melatonin rhythm, exercise performance rhythm or sleep rhythm. Relevant chronotype information, that is, cases wherein it may be used as a proxy for circadian phase, will also be considered. While proxies are not without limitations,25 they are frequently necessary in human circadian biology research. Diminishing effects on rhythm amplitudes may result from an exercise stimulus representing conflicting zeitgeber information or differential speeds of rhythms entraining to the exercise stimulus phase and period. Additionally, the zeitgeber may or may not affect individual rhythm amplitudes. A \u2018washout\u2019 period may be required to delineate specific effects on the circadian system from more immediate \u2018masking\u2019 effects of exercise. These criteria are also reviewed in detail elsewhere.26"]
