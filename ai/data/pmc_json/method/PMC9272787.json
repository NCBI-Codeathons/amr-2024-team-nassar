["Materials and Methods", "RNA-seq and Ribo-seq Library Preparation and Analyses", "Three biological replicates of P. aeruginosa strain O1 (PAO1; Holloway et al., 1979) were grown at 37\u00b0C in 100\u2009ml Basal-Salt medium [BSM; 30.8\u2009mM K2HPO4, 19.3\u2009mM KH2PO4, 15\u2009mM (NH4)SO4, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, and 2\u2009\u03bcM FeSO4] supplemented with 5\u2009mM succinate and 40\u2009mM mannitol (Sonnleitner et al., 2009). Total RNA was prepared from each of the three biological replicates after they reached an OD600 of 0.4 [time 1 (T1)], 0.7 [time 2 (T2)], and 1.2 [time 3 (T3); Figure 1A], respectively. 10\u2009ml samples were withdrawn from each culture, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000\u2009g for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA was removed using DNAse I (Roche), followed by phenol-chloroform purification and ethanol precipitation with 1/10 volume of 3\u2009M NaOAc, pH 5.5. To deplete ribosomal RNAs, the Ribo-Zero\u2122 Magnetic Kit for Gram-negative Bacteria (Epicentre) was used. The libraries were constructed using the NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 Directional RNA Library Preparation Kit from Illumina. Around 100 base pair single end sequence reads were generated using the Illumina HiSeq V4 platform at the Vienna Biocenter Campus Science Support Facility.1 Quality control assessment, sequencing adapter removal, and mapping of the samples against the PAO1 reference genome (NCBI accession number NC_002516.2) were performed as described previously with Segemehl using default parameters (Hoffmann et al., 2009). Reads mapping to regions annotated as either rRNA or tRNA were discarded. The mapped sequencing data were prepared for visualization using the ViennaNGS tool box, and visualized with the UCSC Genome Browser (Wolfinger et al., 2015). Reads per gene were counted using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) and the Refseq annotation of P. aeruginosa (NC_002516.2). Differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010). The levels of transcripts with a fold-change (FC) greater than 2 and a multiple testing adjusted value of p below 0.05 were considered to be significant (shown in bold in Supplementary Table S1).", "Figure 1(A) Growth of strain PAO1 in Basal-Salt medium (BSM) supplemented with 5\u2009mM succinate and 40\u2009mM mannitol.

The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000\u2009g for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, the pellet was washed in 50\u2009ml ice cold lysis buffer (10\u2009mM MgOAc, 60\u2009mM NH4Cl, 10\u2009mM TRIS\u2013HCl, and pH 7.6), again pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000\u2009g for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen.

The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. About 100\u2009\u03bcl aliquots of the cleared lysates were treated with 4\u2009\u03bcl of Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase, NEB) and 6\u2009\u03bcl of the RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) for 1\u2009h at 25\u00b0C with continuous shaking at 450\u2009rpm. The lysates were layered onto 10%\u201340% linear sucrose density gradients in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 256,000\u2009g for 3\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. About 500\u2009\u03bcl gradient fractions were collected by continuously monitoring the absorbance at 260\u2009nm. The RNA was extracted from fractions containing 70S ribosomes with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and precipitated with ethanol. The samples were treated with DNase I (TURBO\u2122 DNase, Thermo Scientific) and separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8\u2009M urea. Ribosome protected mRNA fragments ranging in size from 20 to 40 nucleotides were removed and eluted from the polyacrylamide gel by overnight incubation in elution buffer (0.3\u2009M NaOAc, 1\u2009mM EDTA) at 4\u00b0C, which was followed by another phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation. The quality of the RNA samples was subsequently analyzed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and an Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies). The RNA was further processed into cDNA libraries with NEBNext\u2122 Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina\u00ae and their quality was assessed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer and a High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies). Pipin Prep\u2122 was used to purify the 140\u2013160\u2009bp cDNA products which corresponded to adapter-ligated 20\u201340 nucleotide long ribosomal footprints. RNA sequencing and data processing were performed as described above. The raw RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data were deposited in the ENA under accession number PRJEB52258.", "Extraction of Cellular Proteins", "Cellular proteins were extracted from the same 100\u2009ml cultures of two biological replicates as used for the RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses. 10\u2009ml samples were withdrawn from each culture after growth to an OD600 of 0.4 [time 1 (T1)], 0.7 [time 2 (T2)], and 1.2 [time 3 (T3); Figure 1A], respectively, transferred to new flasks and treated for 10\u2009min with chloramphenicol (300\u2009\u03bcg/ml) to stop translation. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C for 15\u2009min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were re-suspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl 1x Laemmli buffer per 0.5 OD600 unit. The cell suspensions were sonicated for 1\u2009min at 40% power for 40\u2009cycles (Bandelin Sonopuls GM70), and then boiled for 5\u2009min at 95\u00b0C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 24,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at room temperature. The samples (100\u2009\u03bcg/lane) were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel, which was stained with colloidal coomassie stain (Roth). The gel slices were cut into pieces and placed in 1.5\u2009ml microcentrifuge tubes. About 1\u2009ml of 200\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic) in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) was added to each sample followed by incubation for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C.

The solution was removed and the gels slices were incubated two times in 500\u2009\u03bcl of 100% ACN for 10\u2009min at 37\u00b0C to remove water. The dried proteins were digested with 100\u2009\u03bcl of trypsin (Thermo; 25\u2009ng/\u03bcl), re-suspended in 25\u2009mM AmBic in 10% ACN and 5\u2009mM CaCl2, and further incubated for 16\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. The peptides were extracted with 150\u2009\u03bcl of 50% ACN/1% of formic acid (FA) by sonication in a low intensity ultrasound bath for 3\u2009min, after which the supernatants were transferred to 1.5\u2009ml Eppendorf tubes. The gel was further incubated with 100\u2009\u03bcl 90% ACN/1% FA for 15\u2009min at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to the same tubes as in the previous step and dried in a vacuum concentrator.

The peptides were re-suspended in 99% of ACN and 1% of FA to a final concentration of 0.2\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcl and separated on a 50\u2009cm EASY-Spray C18 LC column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were eluted with a 120\u2009ml gradient from 2 to 40% of solvent B (90% ACN, 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300\u2009\u03bcl/min. Full scans were obtained with an Orbitrap mass analyzer.
