Amino acids used for cell cultures were from DUCHEFA Biochemie. FAcCoA was synthesized as described previously (7). An \u00c5KTA FPLC system and a HiLoad Superdex S200 column (16 \u00d7 60 cm) (GE Healthcare) were used for gel filtration purification of proteins. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Sigma). DNA sequencing was performed in the Department of Biochemistry DNA Sequencing Facility (University of Cambridge) on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA analyzer. Escherichia coli NovaBlue or DH10B cells were used for cloning, and E. coli RosettaTM (DE3)pLysS cells were used for protein expression.", "Cloning of FlK and Mutants", "The cloning of the recombinant His-tagged wild-type FlK (WtFlK) in pET28a(+) (Novagen) was described in our previous study (7). Mutants of FlK each containing a single amino acid mutation were created by PCR using the WtFlK-expressing plasmid as a template. For each mutant, two PCR amplifications were carried out using two primer pairs: T7-27/3\u2032-5\u2032 primers for PCR-1 and T7T-27/5\u2032-3\u2032 primers for PCR-2. The T7\u201327 primer (5\u2032-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAATTGT-3\u2032) and T7T-27 primer (5\u2032-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAG CGGTGGCAGCA-3\u2032) hybridize, respectively, to the upstream or downstream regions of the multicloning site in pET28a(+). Mutations were created in either the 3\u2032-5\u2032 primer or the 5\u2032-3\u2032 primer or both, depending on the specific design for each individual mutant.", "PCR was carried out using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min plus a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The resulting PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, purified by gel extraction (Qiagen), and inserted into pET28a(+) vector between the NdeI and BamHI sites.

Isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce protein overexpression overnight at 16 \u00b0C, 200 rpm. The cells were broken by sonication for 4 min (1 s on, 10 s off) to release overexpressed recombinant protein. The supernatant of the cell lysate was applied to a His-Bind\u00ae column (Novagen) charged with Co2+ ions. Nonspecific proteins were removed by washing the column with washing buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and the recombinant protein was eluted with elution buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9).

The drops comprised 1 \u03bcl of protein solution and 1 \u03bcl of crystallization solution, and the crystals appeared after 3 or 4 days. To crystallize the FlK in complex with FAc, the sodium acetate present in the crystallization solution was replaced by 0.2 m sodium fluoroacetate. The crystals for both complexes were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to perform the data collection after soaking in cryoprotectant solution composed of 25\u201330% ethylene glycol and 75\u201370% well solution.
