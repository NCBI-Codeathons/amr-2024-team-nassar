["Materials and Methods", "Strains", "Pleurotus ostreatus 389 (CCMSSC 00389), obtained from the China Center for Mushroom Spawn Standards and Control, was used in this study.", "Culture Conditions, Heat Treatment and Sample Collection", "An activated mycelial block of P. ostreatus (7 mm) was inoculated on complete yeast medium (CYM) containing 1% maltose, 2% glucose, 0.2% peptone, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.05% MgSO4\u22c57H2O, and 0.46% KH2PO4 with an initial pH of 5.5 (Wang et al., 2018). The plates were cultured at 28\u00b0C in the dark for 5 days before use.", "Heat treatment began on the sixth day at 40\u00b0C (Lei et al., 2019) for 0\u201348 h, and after heat treated 48 h, the mycelia were recovered for 6 h at 28\u00b0C. All treatments included controls at 28\u00b0C. The samples were collected in tubes after heat treatment for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 h (Wang, 2019), and 48 h + 6 h (means heat treated 48 h and then recovered 6 h) with seven repeats per group. The tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen as soon as samples were collected and finally stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use.", "Basic Growth Phenotype Measurements of P. ostreatus", "To evaluate the effect of heat stress on P. ostreatus, the mycelial fresh weight, and macroscopic and microscopic alteraons in the mycelia, contents of total carbohydrate and total protein were measured. Once the mycelia begin with heat treatment, take photos for each treated mycelium to record the growth status, and measured the fresh weight after sample collection. Microscopic changes of mycelia were detected using a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 fluorescence microscope and analyzed using Zeiss software (ZEN lite, Zeiss, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). The contents of total carbohydrate and total protein were measured using commercial kits, Total Carbohydrate Assay Kit (Solarbio Life Sciences) and Biuret Protein Assay Kit (Solarbio Life Sciences), according to manufacturer directions.", "Metabolomic Analysis of P. ostreatus Mycelia by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)", "Metabolomic analysis was performed on the samples described above by LC-MS according to previously described methods (Xue et al., 2017) with modifications. The freeze-dried samples were extracted with methanol and an internal standard at a ratio of 500:8:0.1. All samples were ground to a fine powder using a grinding mill at 65 Hz for 90 s. Then, the samples were ultrasonicated for 30 min at 40 KHz and allowed to stand for 1 h at \u221220\u00b0C. The samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 15 min, and 200 \u03bcL of supernatant was transferred to vials for LC-MS analysis.", "The analysis platform was LC-Q/TOF-MS (Agilent, 1290 Infinity LC, 6530 UHD and Accurate-Mass Q-TOF/MS, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) with a Waters column (ACQUITY UPLC@HSS T3, 2.5 \u03bcm 100\u22172.1 mm). Water with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid were used for mobile phase A and B, respectively; the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, the injection volume was 4 \u03bcL, the automatic injector temperature was 4\u00b0C, and the column temperature was 40\u00b0C. The capillary voltage was 4 and 3.5 kV in positive and negative mode, respectively; the drying gas flow was 11 L/min, and the gas temperature was 350\u00b0C. Centroid data were collected from 100 to 1000 m/z.", "Statistical Analysis and Pathway Construction", "The tests of basic growth phenotype measurements were three biological repeats at least and data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 6, Stst and Excel 2010 software.", "The data obtained from the metabolom were subjected to feature extraction and preprocessed with XCMS in R software and then normalized and edited into a two-dimensional data matrix using Excel 2010 software. SIMCA-P software was used for multivariate statistical analyses, which included principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The differential metabolites were confirmed by the combination of variable importance in the projection (VIP) value (VIP > 1) from the OPLS-DA model and the p-value (p < 0.05) from Student\u2019s t-test. The identity of differential metabolites was determined by searching online databases (Metlin) and comparing their m/z and mass. The metabolomics analysis was carried out by Shanghai Sensichip Infotech Co. (Shanghai, China).", "All metabolomic tests included seven biological repeats, and the data are presented as the mean after normalizing (Lee et al., 2017). The fold change of the different substances was the ratio of the value at 40\u00b0C to that at 28\u00b0C. The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 and Excel 2010 software. The pathway analyses of differential substances were performed with MetaboAnalyst 4.0."]
