Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 was isolated by using YIM 171 medium (raffinose, 5.0 g/L; histidine, 1.0 g/L; K2HPO4, 1.0 g/L; MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.5 g/L; agar, 15.0 g/L; water to 1 L [pH 7.2 to 7.4]) and incubation temperature of 28\u00b0C. Genomic DNA of YIM 121038 was isolated as described below and was used as a template to PCR amplify a 16S rRNA gene fragment using a previously described protocol (25). The resulting DNA fragment was sequenced, and the sequence was deposited in GenBank.", "Genome sequencing and analyses.", "For genome sequencing, chromosomal DNA was used to generate a TruSeq PCR-free library that was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system in a 2\u00d7 300-nucleotide (nt) run. A total of 559.3 Mbp of sequence materials (52.4\u00d7 coverage) was assembled using Newbler version 2.8 (Roche), resulting in 117 scaffolds containing 214 contigs. Subsequently, 400\u2009ng of genomic DNA was used to generate a second shotgun library for sequencing on the MinION system (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Using the rapid barcoding kit (SQK-RBK004), a one-dimensional (1D) sequencing library was created and sequenced on an R9.5 flow cell in a 24-h run on the MinION sequencer. Base calling and sequence material conversion were performed using Albacore version 2.1.7 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), yielding 11,928 reads with a total length of 166.6 Mbp (13,964-nt average read length, 15\u00d7 coverage). The assembly was performed with Canu version 1.6 (26). After assembly, the resulting three contigs were polished with the short Illumina reads using Pilon (27). The final assembly and polishing were done manually using Consed (28) to assemble the two contigs making up the chromosome and to resolve polishing artifacts in repetitive regions. This resulted in two contigs representing the complete linear chromosome and the complete linear plasmid pSSP121038.
