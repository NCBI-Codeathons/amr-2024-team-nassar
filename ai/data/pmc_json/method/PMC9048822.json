The insert size distribution was estimated by gel electrophoresis of the PCR products obtained by amplifying inserts using primers annealing to the vector backbone flanking the HincII site. The average insert size for the library was 1.7\u2009kb. The total size of the metagenomics library was determined by multiplying the average insert size by the number of colony-forming units (CFU) per ml (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u2009bp).

Endpoint absorbance measurements (A600nm) were taken with a plate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek) after 24 or 48\u2009h of incubation and were background-subtracted. Growth inhibition of the E. coli strains was plotted against L-lysine (chemical) concentration with a polynomial interpolation between neighboring data points using R software.1 The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the formula: 1\u2009\u2212\u2009[A600nm lysine (or chemical)/A600nm control].

The linear cassette was used as template for in vitro transcription. Capped cRNAs was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (AM1344; Thermo Fisher). The quality and quantity of the RNA were determined by Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer. For microinjection of cRNA and 13C-labeled L-lysine, we used the RoboInject (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) automatic injection system (Darbani et al., 2019).
