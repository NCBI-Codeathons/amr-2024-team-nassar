The two primer sets used to amplify the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of 71cR were: 71cR-5\u2019-F-ApaI, 71cR-5\u2019-R-ApaI and 71cR-3\u2019-F-SacI, 71cR-3\u2019-R-SacI. The PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (71cR-5\u2019 digested with ApaI; 71cR-3\u2019 digested with SacI) for cloning into the receptor plasmid pCB1636 [20]. Plasmid pCB1636 was first digested with ApaI and ligated with ApaI digested 71cR-5\u2019. Recombinant plasmids isolated from this step were selected based on the insert\u2019s correct orientation, and subsequently digested with SacI and ligated with SacI digested 71cR-3\u2019 to obtain a 71cR disruption construct.

Raptor software was also used for the ligand binding predictions. The Dali server (2/20/2014 update) [36] was used to find orthologs based on the tertiary structure similarities. The crystal structure of 71cR is not available, thus the crystal structure of the protein PFL_3262 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PDB ID: 2IMJ) (the closest ortholog with a crystal structure), was used for the Dali analysis. Predict Protein server [37] was used to identify transmembrane helices or disulphide bridges and localization predictions for 71cR.", "Conserved regions of 71cR were found by aligning 71cR with the closest 130 orthologs in S1 Table, using MUSCLE in Mesquite as described previously, and Chimera 1.10.1 [38] was used to display the degree of conservation for each residue within the conserved domain. These conserved residues were then compared with the ligand binding predictions from Raptor software.", "Assays for cercosporin modification or degradation", "To test the activity of the 71cR protein to degrade or modify cercosporin, two methods were used. To assay for possible degradation of cercosporin, 10 mg of freshly growing mycelia of wt N. crassa and two 71cR N. crassa transformants (# 379, 380) were collected and grown in 20 ml of PDB medium for 5 days in the dark at room temperature. Cercosporin was added to final concentration of 10 \u03bcM and incubated in the dark for 5 hours. To extract cercosporin from the mycelium, it was filtered and ground in liquid nitrogen, and cercosporin was extracted in acetone. The amount of cercosporin in the growth medium and in the mycelial extracts was analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 460 nm using a spectrophotometer. To assay for possible modification of cercosporin, mycelium of wt N. crassa and 71cR transformants #379 and 380 was grown in PDB, and cultures were incubated for 5 hours with cercosporin at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM. We imaged the mycelia using Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscopy with a 488 nm argon laser reflecting off a 488 nm main beam splitter. A series of images with the same field of view at different emission wavelengths (\u03bb-stack) was captured between 504 and 728 nm in 10 nm intervals. Images were analyzed offline using Zeiss ZEN software to generate the fluorescence emission spectra for the hyphae."]
