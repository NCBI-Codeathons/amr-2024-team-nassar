["Materials and Methods", "Bacterial Strains, Maintenance and Differential Growth Assessment", "The SM17 and SM18 strains were isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans (Kilkieran Bay, Galway, Ireland), as previously described (Kennedy et al., 2009). The S. albus J1074 strain was provided by Dr. Andriy Luzhetskyy (Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Germany), while S. flavogriseus/S. pratensis ATCC 33331 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Inc., United States). SM17, SM18, S. albus J1074 and S. flavogriseus/S. pratensis ATCC 33331 spores were propagated on mannitol-soya (MS) agar medium at 28\u00b0C for 8\u201310 days and stored in 20% glycerol at \u221280\u00b0C. Strains were cultivated on ISP2 and ISP2 plus artificial sea water (ASW) medium when indicated, for differential growth analysis. The ASW was obtained by adding 3% Instant Ocean\u00ae Sea Salt (Instant Ocean Inc., United States) to the medium. It is important to note that the ATCC 33331 strain, due to a more recent taxonomy classification (Rong et al., 2013), is described with two different names: in GenBank as S. pratensis ATCC 33331 (new classification), and in the ATCC\u00ae culture collection as S. flavogriseus ATCC 33331 (old classification). From now on, the ATCC 33331 isolate will be referred to as S. pratensis ATCC 33331.", "Genome Sequencing, Assembly and Annotation", "Biomass from the SM17 and SM18 strains was obtained after cultivation on TSB medium for 3 days at 28\u00b0C and 220 rpm. Genomic DNA from SM17 was isolated using the DNeasy Blood & Cell Culture DNA Midi Kit (Qiagen Inc.); and by using the phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction method for SM18 (Wilson, 2001). Genome sequencing was performed by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea), using the PacBio RSII sequencing platform.", "The PacBio raw reads were processed and quality filtered using the BamTools toolkit v2.4.1 (subread length >1000, subread quality >0.75) (Barnett et al., 2011). The genome assemblies were performed using the Canu v1.7 software (Koren et al., 2017), followed by assembly polishing using Quiver v2.1.0 (Pacific Biosciences Inc). The assembly coverage check was performed using the BBMap program v37.901. Genome assembly statistics were calculated using the QUAST v4.6.3 program (Gurevich et al., 2013). Genome annotation was performed using the Prokka v1.12 program for this study\u2019s analyses (Seemann, 2014), and with the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline for data submission on the GenBank database (Tatusova et al., 2016; Benson et al., 2018). Prediction of smBGCs was performed using the antiSMASH 4 software (Blin et al., 2017). Similarity clustering of smBGCs families was performed using the Biosynthetic Genes Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine (BiG-SCAPE, version 2018100) (Navarro-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2018) and Cytoscape (v3.7.1) (Shannon et al., 2003), with annotations based on the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) repository (v1.4) (Medema et al., 2015). Genome maps were generated using the Artemis v17.0.1 and the DNAPlotter v17.0.1 programs (Rutherford et al., 2000; Carver et al., 2009). Proteins of interest were manually annotated using the NCBI BLAST tool; the GenBank database; and the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (Johnson et al., 2008; Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015; Benson et al., 2018).", "Comparative Genomics", "The closest reference strains for the sponge-derived isolates SM17 and SM18 were determined by employing a phylogenetic analysis performed in two steps: (1) based on the 16S rRNA sequence of the SM17 and SM18 isolates, we picked the top 30 most similar Streptomyces species to each of the isolates (for a total of 60 genomes from the database), with complete genome available in GenBank (Benson et al., 2018), using the NCBI BLAST tool (Johnson et al., 2008) (2) we then performed a phylogenetic analysis employing concatenated sequences (Gadagkar et al., 2005) of the 16S rRNA and the housekeeping genes atpD (ATP synthase subunit beta), gyrB (DNA gyrase subunit B), recA (recombinase RecA), rpoB (DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta), and trpB (tryptophan synthase beta chain), of the SM17 and SM18 strains, plus the previously determined top 60 most similar Streptomyces species. Alignment of the concatenated sequences was performed using the MAFFT program (Katoh and Standley, 2013), and phylogeny was determined using the MrBayes program (Ronquist et al., 2012), applying the General Time Reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rates across sites with a proportion of invariable sites (Waddell and Steel, 1997), and an average standard deviation of split frequencies cut off of 0.01. The final condensed tree, with a posterior probability cut off of 95%, was generated using MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018) and Inkscape2. To further support genomic similarities between the SM17 and SM18 strain and their closest type-strain terrestrial relative determined with the phylogeny analysis, alignments of the individual housekeeping genes were performed and sequence similarity was determined, using the NCBI BLAST tool (Johnson et al., 2008); and whole genome nucleotide alignments were performed using the MUMmer 3.0 program (Kurtz et al., 2004). Plasmids sequences were determined by similarity searches in the GenBank database (Benson et al., 2018). Orthologous gene analysis was performed using the Roary v3.12.0 program, with an identity cut-off set to 50% (Page et al., 2015). The Roary outputs were processed using the R software environment in the RStudio IDE (Racine, 2012; RStudio Team, 2015; R Core Team, 2018), with data frame handling using the plyr package (Wickham, 2011); and Venn diagrams generated using the venn package (Dusa, 2018).", "Accession Numbers", "The complete genome sequences of SM17, SM18, and the SM17 plasmid sequences pSM17A, pSM17B, pSM17C, have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers CP029338, CP029342, CP029339, CP029340, and CP029341, respectively. The closest reference genomes used in this study for comparative purposes were S. albus J1074 (accession no. CP004370.1) and S. pratensis ATCC 33331 (accession no. CP002475.1)."]
