The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Cancer Institute, The Second Affliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.", "RT-PCR", "Primers were designed according to the Genbank sequences and were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon (Shanghai, China). The primer sequences were as follows: Cytohesin-1, 5\u2032-AGTGCATTAAAGCAGCCATCAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCAGTGTCGCTTCGTGGAG-3\u2032; cytohesin-2 (ARNO), 5\u2032-GAAACCGAACTGCTTTGAACT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAGCCGCCTGATGGACT-3\u2032; cytohesin-3 (Grp1), 5\u2032-ATG AAATCCATCAAAGCCAGTA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAATCCTT CGTTTCCTCGTT-3\u2032; cytohesin-4, 5\u2032-GTCCATCCGAGCC AGCAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGTAACGGGGAACAGCAAT-3\u2032; GAPDH (human housekeeper gene), 5\u2032-AATGTGTCCGTCGT GGATCTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGC-3\u2032. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol RNA isolation kit and cDNA was synthesized using the M-MLV RTase kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For this reaction, GAPDH acted as an inner control and was amplified in each reaction system. The reaction conditions were 95\u00b0C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, 62\u00b0C for 35 sec and 72\u00b0C for 60 sec.", "Immunofluorescence", "Aseptic slides were placed in 24-well plates and after prewarming at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, 104 cells/well from the HT-29 cell line were incubated in the plates. Cells were cultured with RPMI-1640 culture medium at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in an incubator until cell growth covered 60\u201380% of the slides. Then, the culture medium was removed and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After washing three times with PBS and 0.25% Triton X-100/TBS for 10\u201315 min at room temperature, mouse anti-cytohesins IgG were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Following repeated washing with PBS, slides were incubated with PE-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, then washed with PBS and coverslipped. Subsequently, ARNO and EGFR expression was observed using a Zeiss LSM-710 fluorescent microscope with a Spot digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Germany). For comparable analysis of the intensity levels of ARNO and EGFR expression, the same exposure conditions were maintained throughout the experiment.", "Western blot analysis", "Cells were collected and extracted by the eukaryotic cell lysis buffer according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Total protein extraction kit 2140, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Then, proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane by a wet transfer device (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Blotted membranes were blocked by 10% skimmed milk in PBS Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 h. After washing three times with Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST), membranes were incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:1,000 at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated in HRP-labeled secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing, visualization was conducted using the enhanced ehemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and cells were exposed to X-ray film (Kodak, USA). GAPDH protein was used as an inner control.", "siRNA selection", "Three pairs of ARNO siRNAs were designed and synthesized by Genepharma Company (China). The siRNA sequence pairs were as follows: siRNA-1, 5\u2032-GUUCU UGGUGGAGAAUGAATT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-UUCAUUCUCCACC AAGAACTT-3\u2032; siRNA-2, 5\u2032-AGGCCCUCAGGCAGUUU CUTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGAAACUGCCUGAGGGCCUTT-3\u2032; siRNA-3, 5\u2032-GCUGGUUUAUCCUCACAGATT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-UCUGUGAGGAUAAACCAGCTT-3\u2032. Each pair of siRNA sequences was identified in the HT-29 cell line; cells were transfected with 100 pmol of each siRNA in 5 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000/105 cells/ml, and then cultured in serum- free medium. After 24 h, cells were collected for western blot analysis.", "MTT", "HT-29 cells were plated in 96-well plates with a density of 3,000 cells/well. Cells were cultured with 1% FBS and inhibitors (20 \u03bcmol/l SecinH3 or 50 nmol/l per 5 pmol ARNO/negative siRNA in 0.25 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000) for 24, 48 and 72 h, at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then 5 mg/ml MTT (20 \u03bcl) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Then, 200 \u03bcl DMSO was added to resolve the MTT substrate and absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a SpectraMax Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad).", "Statistics", "Results are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 16.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Paired comparisons were performed using a Student\u2019s t-test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between means."]
