Strains were grown in CM medium at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm, and transformants were selected by antibiotic selections on LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics at 37\u00b0C. The \u0394cotA, \u0394skfA, and \u0394srfA mutants were constructed by transforming appropriate B. subtilis strains with chromosomal DNA isolated from B. subtilis RL50 (Donovan et al., 1987), EG165 (Liu et al., 2010), or OKB120 (Nakano et al., 1988), respectively. The amyE:P43-lacZ mutants were constructed by transforming appropriate B. subtilis strains with plasmid DNA pEM1055.", "To construct pEM1055 plasmid, carrying amyE:P43-lacZ, a constitutive promoter P43 was PCR-amplified from plasmid DNA Pkm3-p43-yfp (Stefanic et al., 2015) using the primer pair p43-F1-EcoRI/p43-R1-BamHI (Table 2). The PCR fragment was then digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pBKT2 (Meijer et al., 1995). The constructed plasmid was then transformed into competent E. coli DH5\u03b1 cells, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 \u03bcg ml\u20131 Amp after overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. Plasmids were isolated and screened by PCR using the same primer pair listed above to determine if the cells carried the amyE:P43-lacZ construct before transformation in B. subtilis strains.", "Oligonucleotides used in this study.", "Oligonucleotide name Sequence 5\u2032-3\u2032 References.", "p43-F1-EcoRI CGCGAATTCTGATAGGTGGTATGTTTTCGCTTG Stefanic et al., 2015.", "p43-R1-BamHI GCGGGATCCCCTATAATGGTACCGCTATCAC This work.", "Transformation Frequency Determination", "Overnight cultures (1%, V/V) were inoculated into the fresh CM medium, and cells were grown at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm for 6 h. After incubation, 1 ml of the culture was transferred to a glass tube and supplemented with genomic DNA of B. subtilis PS-216 amyE:Phyperspank-mKate2 carrying chloramphenicol resistance (final saturating concentration 1.4 \u03bcg ml\u20131) (Stefanic et al., 2015). Tubes were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. Fresh LB medium (0.5 ml) was then added, and samples were incubated for a further 60 min at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. Finally, 100 \u03bcl of sample dilutions (100, 10\u20131, 10\u20132) were inoculated onto LB agar containing 10 \u03bcg ml\u20131 of Cat. In addition, a control experiment without DNA added was performed. Viable cell concentration was determined by standard CFU assay on LB agar plates without antibiotics. Transformation frequency was calculated as the ratio between the number of transformants and the viable cell number.", "Transformation Frequency Determination in Co-culture", "Two B. subtilis strains carrying different antibiotic markers (cat or spec) integrated at different chromosomal loci in each strain were co-cultured. The co-culture approach enabled us to directly select for transformants with double resistance. Starting ratios of CatR strain and SpecR strain (1:1) were prepared based on OD650 estimation of overnight cultures. Co-cultures were incubated in CM medium without or with surfactin (20 \u03bcg ml\u20131) and without or with DNase I (100 U) for 8 h at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm, which allowed spontaneous integration of cat or spec antibiotic markers into SpecR or CatR strains, respectively. After incubation, 100 \u03bcl of co-culture dilutions (100, 10\u20131, 10\u20132) were plated onto LB agar plates containing two antibiotics, Cat (5 \u03bcg ml\u20131) and Spec (50 \u03bcg ml\u20131). Viable cell number in co-cultures was determined by standard CFU assay on LB agar without antibiotics. Transformation frequency in co-culture was calculated as a ratio of the number of transformants with both antibiotic markers and viable cell number.", "Influence of Surfactin on Growth and eDNA Release", "Fresh CM medium was inoculated with an overnight culture (1%, V/V) of the \u0394srfA mutant and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm for 8 h. CM medium was supplemented with different surfactin concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 \u03bcg ml\u20131). As controls, the wild-type strain and \u0394srfA mutant were grown in the same conditions without surfactin addition. After incubation, cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min, supernatants were filter sterilized, and eDNA concentration was determined. In addition, viable cell number was determined as described above.", "Time of Exposure to Surfactin", "Fresh CM medium was inoculated with an overnight culture (1%, V/V) of the wtlacZ or \u0394srfAlacZ strain, and cultures were grown to an early stationary phase at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. Cultures were then supplemented with 20 \u03bcg ml\u20131 of surfactin and incubated for a further 3 h at room temperature without shaking. At different times of exposure to surfactin (0, 20, 40, 80, and 160 min), \u03b2-galactosidase activity and eDNA concentrations were measured in filter-sterilized conditioned medium of both strains, and viable cell number was determined as described above.", "\u03b2-Galactosidase Activity Measurement", "Z-buffer (36 mM NaH2PO4, 67 mM NaHPO4, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MgSO4) (25 \u03bcl) containing 5.6% (V/V) of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 10 \u03bcl toluene was added to the conditioned media of the wtlacZ and \u0394srfAlacZ strains in a microtiter plate, and the plate was incubated on ice for 30 min. The plate was then warmed to 30\u00b0C, then 50 \u03bcl of ortho-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-galactoside (ONPG) substrate was added, and the absorbance at 420 nm was measured during incubation for 15 min at 1-min intervals at 30\u00b0C using Multiscan Spectrum (Thermo Scientific). OD650 and ONPG degradation rate was used to calculate \u03b2-galactosidase activity.", "Extracellular DNA (eDNA) Concentration Determination", "Extracellular DNA concentration in filter-sterilized conditioned media of the wild-type strain, \u0394srfA strains following addition of different surfactin concentrations, and the wtlacZ and \u0394srfAlacZ strains and co-cultures was determined using QuantiFluor\u00ae dsDNA system (Promega, United States) by measuring fluorescence intensity according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 504 and 531 nm, respectively, and the gain was set to 100. A standard curve was prepared using the Lambda DNA standard provided with the kit. eDNA concentration was calculated by subtracting fluorescence intensity of an uninoculated growth medium (containing yeast extract) from fluorescence intensity of samples of conditioned media.", "Statistical Analysis", "All data are presented as means and standard errors of biological replicates. Results were statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc comparisons tests using the p \u2264 0.05 level of significance."]
