["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Strains and culture conditions.", "All strains used in this study are listed in Table\u00a01. Escherichia coli strains were grown in liquid LB or on solid LB medium agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Media used for solid Streptomyces cultures were R2YE, SFM, and ISP7 agar plates, which were incubated at 28\u00b0C. When required, the antibiotics thiostreptone, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, and ampicillin were added in the culture media. The type strain S. lunaelactis MM109T (25) and other S. lunaelactis strains were isolated from the cave \u201cGrotte des Collemboles\u2019 Collemboles\u201d (Comblain-au-Pont, Belgium) (25\u201327). The medium compositions used and the methods associated with Streptomyces species were all as described previously (41).", "Creation of fevR knockout and overexpression mutants in S. lunaelactis MM109.", "In order to assess the effect of fevR/bagI on production of both bagremycin and ferroverdin, we first generated a S. lunaelactis MM109 knockout strain in which orf SLUN21380 was interrupted by a single-crossover event with insertion of a thiostreptone resistance cassette. A 791-bp internal fragment (starting at position nt +116\u2009and lacking the last 81 nt of SLUN21380) was amplified by PCR using primers fevR+118f_XbaI (TCTCTAGACGAACCAGGTGGTCAGCC) and fevR+909r_PstI (CGCTGCAGGTCGTTCTCCAGGCGC) (the underlined characters represent restriction sites). The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pJET1.2 (Blunt cloning vector; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the product was named pBDF027 and sequenced for verification of the amplified PCR fragment. This plasmid was then digested by XbaI and PstI-HF restriction enzymes (NEB), and the fevR insertion was subsequently cloned into pSET151 (41) digested with the same enzymes. The plasmid resulting from the ligation, named pBDF028, was introduced into the S. lunaelactis MM109 chromosome by intergeneric conjugative transfer using methylation-deficient Escherichia coli ET12567 containing the plasmid pUZ8002 (ETpUZ) as conjugation partner. After growth of E. coli ETpUZ to an optical density (OD) of 0.4 (50\u2009ml of culture in a mixture of LB plus chloramphenicol [30\u2009\u03bcg/ml] plus kanamycin [50\u2009\u03bcg/ml] plus ampicillin [100\u2009\u03bcg/ml]), cells were washed to remove antibiotics and mixed with S. lunaelactis spores for mating. Selection of exconjugants was carried out on soy flour mannitol (SFM) medium (plus 10\u2009mM MgCl2) overlaid with thiostrepton (50\u2009\u03bcg/ml) and nalidixic acid (25\u2009\u03bcg/ml) after 16\u2009h of incubation at 28\u00b0C. The single-crossover insertion of pBDF028 into the fevR locus was confirmed by PCR, and one selected clone was named \u03a9fevR (MM109BD1) for further analyses.", "To generate a S. lunaelactis strain overproducing FevR, an entire copy of fevR (slun21380) that included the 217-bp upstream and 360-bp downstream regions was amplified by PCR with primers BDF53 (GATCTAGAAAGCTTGGCTCTGTCCAGTGAGACATCC) and BDF54 (GCGAATTCGTACTCGATGTCACCCGCC) to obtain a 1,570-bp fragment flanked by EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. The PCR product was first cloned into pJET1.2, and the product was named pBDF019. Using EcoRI-HF and XbaI enzymes, the 1,570-bp fevR-containing fragment was cloned into a pSET152 (41) integrative vector, producing pBDF021. Conjugation was performed with spores (108) of S. lunaelactis MM109 on SFM (plus 10\u2009mM MgCl2) overlaid with apramycin and nalidixic acid. Integration of the plasmid was confirmed by PCR with pSET_forward (GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA) and BDF53 or pSET_reverse (CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC) and BDF54 primers. The selected MM109T derivative with pBDF021 inserted to add an additional copy of slun21380 (fevR) controlled by its native promoter was named MM109BD2 (Table\u00a02).", "For complementation of the \u03a9fevR mutant (strain MM109BD1), an entire copy of fevR was excised from pBDF019 using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites and cloned in the same sites of the intermediate-copy-number pHJL401 plasmid (\u223c10 copies) was achieved by conjugation with plasmid pBDF029, leading to production of pBDF022. To include in pBDF022 the origin of transfer required for conjugation and a resistance marker for selection of exconjugants, the apramycin resistance cassette (from pIJ773) containing both oriT (RK2) and aac(3)IV (ApraR) was amplified by PCR with primers Apra_P1 (ATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC) and Apra_P2_HindIII (AAAAAGCTTTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC) and cloned in the same sites of pBDF022, resulting in plasmid pBDF029. Conjugation of pBDF29 into spores (108) of S. lunaelactis MM109BD1 was performed as described above.", "Compound extraction and analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).", "Compound extraction and HPLC analysis were mainly performed as described previously (26). All S. lunaelactis strains were cultured for 10\u2009days on different solid media on petri dishes (90-mm diameter, 25\u2009ml of medium) and incubated at 28\u00b0C. The solid cultures were cut into small pieces (about 0.5\u2009by\u20090.5\u2009cm) and then mixed overnight with an equal volume (25\u2009ml per plate) of ethyl acetate. The mixture was centrifuged (20\u2009min at 4,000\u2009rpm) and the supernatant was evaporated (25\u00b0C at 210\u2009rpm) on a rotary evaporator (IKA RV10 digital; VWR, Radnor, PA, USA). The dried crude extract was resuspended in 1\u2009ml of acetonitrile for further analyses. The full extract was then fractionated by HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) using a Waters 2695 Separations Module (Alliance) with a Waters 2998 photodiode array detector coupled to a Waters Fraction Collector (model WFC III). The extracts were analyzed on a Luna Omega PS C18 column (Phenomenex) (2.1\u2009mm by 150\u2009mm, 5-\u03bcm particle size, 100-\u00c5 pore size) at a column temperature of 40\u00b0C. Extract separation was achieved by increasing the ratio of acetonitrile (Barker; HPLC Far UV grade) to water (MilliQ filtration using a pore size of 0.22\u2009\u03bcm)\u20130.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA; sequencing grade) (from 0% to 100% acetonitrile during 80\u2009min) at a flow rate of 450\u2009\u03bcl/min. Online UV absorption measurement was performed from 190 to 800\u2009nm. Data were analyzed using Empower 3 software (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and Xcalibur v2.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Fractions were subsequently tested for antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) by disk diffusion assay as described previously (26).", "Compound identification by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).", "UV light-visible light absorbance spectra were obtained by analytical HPLC RP-C18 analyses. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) data were acquired on a Q Exactive Plus hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Briefly, compounds were separated by reverse-phase chromatography using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC I-Class; Waters) and a Nucleodur C18ec column (Macherey-Nagel) (2.0\u2009mm by 150\u2009mm, 5-\u03bcm particle size).

On-line UV absorption measurement was performed at 210 and 265\u2009nm, and the chromatography system was finally coupled to a Q Exactive Plus hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA), operated in positive-ion mode (for bagremycins) and in negative mode (for ferroverdins and bagremycins), and programmed for data-dependent acquisitions. Survey scans were acquired at a mass-resolving power level of 140,000 FWHM (full width at half-maximum) and at 100 to 1,500\u2009m/z (accumulation target, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 ion). The five ions showing the greatest intensity were then selected for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments by the use of higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentations and stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) (21,2; 25; 28) within 2-atomic-mass-unit (amu) isolation windows (resolution, 17,500; accumulation target, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 ions).
