Phylogenetic classification using TYGS is based on a genome database that contains the genomic, taxonomic, and nomenclatural data of all currently available type strains. The database is constantly updated (https://tygs.dsmz.de/). The TYGS platform allows phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome sequence of the strain of interest, which is compared with a database of type strain genomes. Thereby, TYGS provides information on the similarity of the strain to its nearest related type strain with the help of digital DNA:DNA hybridization (dDDH) values calculated by the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) 2.1 (http://ggdc.dsmz.de) (36) and determines differences in genomic G\u00a0+\u00a0C contents.", "ARTS analysis", "The Antibiotic Resistance Target Seeker (ARTS) web tool v. 2.0 (21) was used to screen for potential self-resistance genes in genome sequences of natural compound producers.

In addition, the shortest alignment must encompass\u00a0>25% of the sequence. If all genes of a known cluster can be found in the query cluster, the sequence similarity is 100%. Similarity decreases if fewer genes of the known cluster can be found in the query cluster (37). Default settings were used for all analyses.", "In vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay", "The in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay was performed as reported previously (31). Briefly, an S12 extract was prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and mixed with nucleotides and amino acids as substrates for the transcription and translation process.

In total, 85 \u03bcl of 2.5\u00d7 ivTT buffer, 60 \u03bcl of the S12 extract, 20 \u03bcl of an amino acid mixture (2 mM each of all 20 proteinogenic amino acids), and 20 \u03bcl of an energy mixture (1.2 mM AMP, 0.85 mM each of CMP, GMP, and UMP, 0.5 mM IPTG, 34 mg/ml l-5-formyl-THF\u00a0and 33 mM fructose-1,6- bisphosphate) served as the master mix for one sample of the ivTT assay (31). To test the actinomycetes culture extracts for translation inhibition, 30 \u03bcl of methanolic extracts were added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C to evaporate the methanolic solvent. The master mix and 10 \u03bcl of the reporter plasmid pET28-egfp (300 ng/\u03bcl) were added to each well to a final volume of 100 \u03bcl, thereby starting the reaction. All measurements were performed in triplicate using the same preparation of E. coli S12 extract. As positive controls, 5 \u03bcl of tetracycline (15 mg/ml; Sigma) or 5 \u03bcl of apramycin (50 mg/ml; Sigma) were used. The assay was incubated for approximately 2 h at 37\u00b0C.

For this purpose, the peaks in the HPLC chromatogram were individually analyzed by comparing the chromatogram with an in-house HPLC\u2013UV\u2013Vis database (39). Peaks showing a coincident UV\u2013Vis entry with a possible PSI substance were followed up. The masses of the possible PSI compounds were compared with the Dictionary of Natural Products as an external database (40).
