["Materials and methods", "Patients and control subjects", "Serum samples expressing high titers of antibodies against the extracellular proteins of A. fumigatus were obtained from six non-neutropenic-proven IA patients with different underlying diseases. All serum samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis. Two-to-four samples were obtained sequentially per patient. Sera from 20 ICU patients without clinical or microbiological evidence of IA, including 8 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 6 patients with chronic renal disease, 3 patients with renal transplantation, and 3 patients with acute pancreatitis (age range, 33-75 years), were used as negative controls. Two samples were obtained per control patient (one during early admission and one before leaving the hospital). Aspergillus-specific IgG antibodies in the sera of all patients were determined by an indirect ELISA using filtrate proteins of A. fumigatus (1 \u03bcg/ml) as the coating antigen (sera diluted 1:1000). All sera were stored at -70\u00b0C. Sera of IA patients and controls were pooled separately for immunoproteomics analysis. According to EORTC-MSG criteria, proven IA refers to histopathologic evidence of tissue invasion by septated, acutely-branching filamentous fungi, together with a positive culture (sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage) [39]. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital and informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study.", "Preparation of extracellular proteins", "A. fumigatus (strain CMCC (f) A1a) was obtained from the Microbial Culture Collection Management Committee of China, Medical Mycology Center. The fungus was first grown on Sabouraud agar plates at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. The conidia were collected and incubated in yeast-extract-peptone-glucose (YEPG) broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) in a 500-ml flask on a shaker at 37\u00b0C for 14 days. Then, the culture supernatant was collected by filtration. The proteins were recovered by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, as described previously [40]. Finally, the precipitates were resuspended in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE; 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% [w/v] CHAPS, 1% [w/v] DTT, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail [v/v], and 2% [v/v] IPG buffer [pH 3-10]) lysis buffer, and stored at -70\u00b0C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as the standard.", "Two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blot analysis", "Samples containing 150 \u03bcg of filtrate protein were separated by 2-DE, as described elsewhere [41], using immobilized, non-linear pH 3-10 gradient strips (24 cm; Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for isoelectric focusing, and 12.5% sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gels for the second dimension separation. All gels were silver-stained according to published procedures [42] or electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes [43]. Three replicates were run for each sample.", "Western blot was performed as described previously [44]. Briefly, the membranes were probed with primary antibody (pooled sera of patients with proven IA and pooled control sera [1:1000 dilution in each case]) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, the membranes were thrice washed with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST) for 10 min and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:2000 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed with TBST and the signal was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The autoradiographs were developed using Kodak imaging films according to the instrument of the manufactorer. Three replicates were performed for each sample.", "Protein identification and database searches", "The specific immunoreactive protein spots were matched through overlapping images of the blot and gel. The Western blots were matched first with their own Ponceau stain images, then were compared with the silver-stained gel. Subsequently, the spots of interest were excised from the 2DE gels for tryptic in-gel digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) on a time-of-flight Ultraflex II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The peak lists of each protein spot were searched against the NCBI database using Mascot (v2.1.03; Matrix Sciences, London, UK). The following search parameter criteria were used: significant protein MOWSE score at a p < 0.05; minimum mass accuracy, 100 ppm; 1 missed cleavage site allowed (cysteine carbamidomethylation, acrylamide-modified cysteine, and methionine oxidation); similarity of pI and relative molecular mass specified; and minimum sequence coverage of 15%.", "Bioinformatics analysis of TR", "The signal peptide and the probability of TR were predicted using SignalP software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Another subcellular localization prediction tool, WoLF PSORT (http://www.wolfpsort.org), was used to analyze the amino acid sequences of proteins for prediction of cellular localization. Homology analysis was performed using the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLASTp and http://www.uniprot.org).", "Expression, purification, and Western blot analysis of recombinant thioredoxin reductase GliT", "For RNA preparation, 100 mg of frozen mycelium was ground under nitrogen and the whole RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA). cDNA was generated using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The TR gene was amplified using the following primers: 5'-CACACATATGTCGATCGGCAAACTAC-3' and 5'-ACTGAATTCCTATAGCTCCTGATCGAGACG-3'. The resulting 1005-bp fragments were cloned into the pET-28a (+) expression vector (Novagen, Germany). The TR sequence was 100% identical to the gene of A. fumigatus strain Af293. Then, the recombinant His6-TR was expressed in E. coli BL21 competent cells, and purified using a TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech, Japan). Fractions containing the purified TR were pooled, dialyzed against 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2), and stored at -70\u00b0C. Protein identity of the recombinant TR was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS.", "Western blot of the purified recombinant proteins was carried out as described earlier. Monoclonal mouse anti-HIS antibody (diluted 1:4000), the serum samples from six patients with proven IA, and pooled sera from healthy individuals (diluted 1:1000) were used as primary antibodies. HRP-rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) and HRP-goat anti-human IgG (diluted 1:2000) were used as secondary antibodies. The antibody-bound proteins were then visualized using the DAB kit (Maixin_Bio, China)."]
