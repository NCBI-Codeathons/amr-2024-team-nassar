In the first step the upstream sequence of Walker A including the cesP promoter (PcesP) and the cesC sequence upstream of Walker A was amplified, while the downstream sequence of Walker A together with cesD and the terminator was amplified in the second PCR. Both PCR products were fused using DJ PCR and cloned into the E. coli/B. subtilis shuttle plasmid pAD123 (59). The new plasmid was designated pAD123cesC\u0394WalkerA. In a similar manner, K40M and V29T/F30Y mutations were inserted by PCR in the reversed primers of the upstream sequences as well as the forward primers of the downstream sequences. As described above, the fragments were joined using DJ PCR and cloned into the pAD123 plasmid, resulting in pAD123cesCK40M and pAD123cesCV29T/F30Y, respectively. Subsequently, plasmids were introduced into B. cereus by electroporation and the new strains were designated F48\u0394cesCDcesCD\u0394WalkerA, F48\u0394cesCDcesCD_K40M, and F48\u0394cesCDcesCD_V29T/F30Y.", "Heterologous expression of BerA in F48\u0394cesCD.", "To generate a berAB overexpression strain, the promoterless berAB gene (GenBank accession no.

The plasmid pWH1520berAB(Bt) was introduced into B. cereus F48\u0394cesCD by electroporation using tetracycline selection, resulting in F48\u0394cesCDberAB. Overexpression of BerAB was induced by the addition of 0.1% d-xylose to LB cultures containing 103 CFU/ml of F48\u0394cesCDberAB.", "Bacterial two-hybrid system and \u03b2-galactosidase assay.", "cesC (NCBI accession no. ABK00528.1), cesD (ABK00530.1), and selected domains of cesA (YP_001967170.1) and cesB (ACJ82785.1) were amplified from the emetic reference strain B. cereus F4810/72 (3) and cloned into pKT25, pKNT25, pUT18, and pUTC18C BACTH expression vectors (catalog no. EUK001; Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France). The respective plasmids were introduced into the E. coli BTH101 cya-deficient host strain by heat shock transformation. The procedure is based on functional complementation of two subunits of the adenylate cyclase (T18 and T25) fused with the tested interacting partners as previously described (32, 61). For each putative interaction, several combinations were tested as follows: every protein was tagged on the N and C termini as well as by both subunits of adenylate cyclase (T18 and T25; for a detailed description of the cloned domains, the reader is referred to Table\u00a0S1). Respective combinations were cotransformed in E. coli BTH101 cells and plated on LB X-Gal/IPTG agar or LB IPTG for \u03b2-galactosidase assay. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 30\u00b0C. Thereafter, the cells were moved to room temperature (RT) for 20 h, transferred to 18\u00b0C, and incubated for 20 h. For the \u03b2-galactosidase assay, the cells were harvested from the LB-IPTG plates and resuspended in 1\u2009ml of Z buffer (10\u2009mM KCl, 100\u2009mM MgSO4, 0.27% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, sodium phosphate buffer [pH 7.0]). Optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was adjusted to 0.4 to 0.7, cells were permeabilized using \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, SDS, and chloroform, and the enzymatic reaction (at 28\u00b0C) was induced by addition of 4\u2009mg/ml of o-nitrophenol-\u03b2-galactoside (ONPG) in sodium phosphate buffer. The time at which each sample turned yellow was recorded, and the reaction was stopped with 1 M Na2CO3. OD420 and OD550 values were measured using a BioSpectrometer basic (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The \u03b2-galactosidase activity was determined according to the method of Miller (61) and expressed in Miller units [MU]. The mean values of \u03b2-galactosidase activity from each experiment were normalized by the mean value of the respective negative control (BTH101 cells coexpressing only T18 and T25 subunits of adenylate cyclase). Thus, the indicated positive interactions are expressed as fold change compared to the respective negative control.", "Pulldown assay.", "CesC was C-terminally labeled with S tag, while C* domains of CesA were tagged on the C terminus with 6\u00d7His tag. Thus, the cesC gene and the C* domain of cesA were amplified and cloned directly into the pET Duet expression vector in frame with the S and 6\u00d7His tags, respectively. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 or Tuner. Due to problems with solubility and stability of the recombinant proteins, two different expression strains of E. coli were used. CesC-S tag was expressed in the E. coli Tuner strain, while BL21 cells were used for expression of CesA_C*-6\u00d7His. Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.3, induced with 0.125\u2009mM IPTG at 18\u00b0C overnight, and harvested by centrifugation (20\u2009min and 5,000 rpm). The bacterial pellet from a 100-ml culture of CesA_C*_6\u00d7His tag cells (BL21) was resuspended in 2\u2009ml of high-salt solubilization buffer (20\u2009mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 500\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM AEBSF, a protease inhibitor including aprotinin, bestatin, E64, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA), and the bacterial pellet from a 50-ml culture of CesC-S tag cells (Tuner) was resuspended in 1\u2009ml of the same buffer. The suspensions were pooled and the mixture was lysed by sonication (15.000\u2009kHz, 25 times for 9\u2009s with a 1-min break and constant cooling), followed by centrifugation for 30\u2009min at 30,000 rpm. The supernatant was used for the pulldown assay and thus applied onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). The column was washed 9 times with sonication buffer supplemented with 40\u2009mM imidazole, and the captured proteins were eluted with 1 M imidazole. One-milliliter fractions of the column efflux were collected. A total of 100\u2009\u03bcl of each fraction was boiled with the equal amount of 2\u00d7 sample Laemmli buffer, followed by loading of 20\u2009\u03bcl of each sample onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were labeled with 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (Sigma, MO) and visualized in a 300-nm UV transilluminator (51). Subsequently, proteins were analyzed by multiplex Western blotting using the Penta-His horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for detection of CesA_C*_6\u00d7His tag by chemiluminescence as well as an S tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and the StarBright Blue 700 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, CA) for detection of CesC-S tag by fluorescence. Protein sizes were determined using a prestained protein marker detected by colorimetry. Signals from the different channels were recorded simultaneously using a multichannel ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA). To test the unspecific binding of CesC-S tag to the HisTrap HP column, bacterial pellets from a 50-ml culture of CesC-S tag cells (Tuner) were resuspended in 1\u2009ml of high-salt solubilization buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was loaded onto the column and treated as described above.", "Colocalization experiments.", "The promoter of cesP and the C* domain of cesA were amplified from the reference B. cereus strain F4810/72, while mNeon Green (mNG) was amplified from pET14b_mNeonGreen (a plasmid kindly provided by M. Leake, University of York, UK). All three PCR fragments were merged in DJ PCR with mNG adjusted to the C terminus (36). The fragment containing PcesP-cesA_C*-mNG-T7terminator was cloned into the pDG1664 B. subtilis suicide vector in the region flanked by thrC upstream and downstream complementary sequences and comprising the Ermr cassette. Similarly, PcesP, cesC, and cesD were amplified from the reference B. cereus strain F4810/72, while mScarlet was amplified from pET14b_mScarlet. All PCR products were joined in three-step DJ PCR. The fragment containing PcesP-cesC-mScarletstop-cesD-T7terminator was cloned in the region flanked by amyE upstream and downstream complementary sequences as well as comprising the Sprr cassette in the pKAM241 B. subtilis suicide vector (62). Both suicide plasmids pDG1664 PcesP-cesA_C*-mNG-T7terminator and pKAM241 PcesP-cesC-mScarletstop-cesD-T7terminator were transformed in B. subtilis 168 by natural competence transformation.

The strains were spotted on MYP agar (mannitol-egg yolk-polymyxin) and incubated for 20 h at 30\u00b0C. Bacterial colonies were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and pelleted by centrifugation for 3\u2009min at 5,000 rpm. The cells were resuspended in PBS, applied to poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and analyzed using an Olympus BX63 fluorescence microscope, with cubes U-FBWA for detection of mNeon Green and U-FYW for detection of mScarlet.

Cereulide was extracted as described previously (30). In brief, bacteria were pelletized by centrifugation (8,000 \u00d7 g, 23\u00b0C, and 10\u2009min), and 50\u2009mg of bacterial biomass was resuspended in 1\u2009ml of acetonitrile (99%, high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] grade; Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), followed by incubation for 16 h at RT on a rocking table. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were put through Phenex HPLC syringe filters (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and directly transferred to the HPLC vials. Cereulide concentrations were determined using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based multianalyte method (64). In brief, a QTrap 5500 LC-MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a Turbo Ion Spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source was coupled to a 1290 series HPLC System (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany).

Since the results from in vitro and in vivo interaction studies revealed that the ATPase CesC of the putative ABC transporter CesCD interacts with NRPS CesAB, the MIBiG Database was employed to search for CesC-homologous ABC proteins encoded in other NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters. The Ces cluster nucleotide sequence was therefore submitted to the antiSMASH database (65) and the retrieved CesC protein sequence was subsequently used to search the MIBiG database (38) for NRPS clusters comprising ABC transporters related to CesC. The cutoff for sequence identity between CesC and homologous proteins in NRPS clusters was set to 32%."]
