["Materials and methods", "Fourteen high-quality eukaryotic plant genomes covering major plant taxa (clade Viridiplantae) within phyla Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, as listed in \nTable\u00a01\n were chosen and downloaded from the public database (Genbank/IMG) for downstream analyses. Identification of horizontally transferred genes in the genomes of plant genomes was conducted through the Integrated Microbial Genomes Annotation Pipeline (IMGAP) v.5.0 (Markowitz et\u00a0al., 2010), which defined genes in tested plant genomes as having been horizontally transferred from a distant lineage with the principle: genes that have the best BLASTP hits (highest bit scores) or >90% of the best hits found outside the taxonomic lineage of the tested genome (i.e., from distant phylum, class, etc.) and with lower-scoring hits or no hits within the lineage.", "The phylogeny of different kinds of abiotic resistance gene was constructed based on gene-translating protein sequences using PhyML program (Guindon et\u00a0al., 2010) at http://www.phylogeny.fr/simple_phylogeny.cgi with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method and 1,000 bootstrap replicates (with bootstrap values in red showing on respective branches) and visualized with iTOL (Letunic and Bork, 2021) at https://itol.embl.de/. Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) and trimmed with Gblocks (Talavera and Castresana, 2007) prior to tree construction.", "AlphaFold2 (Jumper et\u00a0al., 2021) and RoseTTAFold (Baek et\u00a0al., 2021) were applied to generate the full-length 3D structure of proteins encoded by targeted HGT genes in plant genomes and their suggested donors, following guidance from https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold and https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold. Docking of ligands into respective protein structure was conducted with AutoDock Vina v.1.2.0 (Trott and Olson, 2010). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the targeted protein-ligand complex were performed using the Desmond Molecular Dynamics System, version 3.6, (D. E. Shaw Research, New York, NY, 2008) with OPLS_2005 force field (with default parameters) and visualized by Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software v.1.9.4 and LigPlot+ (Laskowski and Swindells, 2011). DeepFRI (Gligorijevi\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2021) was further applied for reliable structure-based functional annotation verify recognizable functional folds in the proteins encoded by the HGT genes related to abiotic pressure resistance in plant genomes.", "Codon adaption index (CAI) was used as a numerical estimator of gene expression level (Hiraoka et\u00a0al., 2009; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2013), and correspondingly, the webserver CAIcal (Puigb\u00f2 et\u00a0al., 2008) (http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/calc.php) was applied to calculate respective CAI values of HGT genes in plant genomes participating in resistance of diverse abiotic pressures with the EF-Tu gene (the elongation factors) as refence, which is supposed to be highly expressed across most organisms (Puigb\u00f2 et\u00a0al., 2008), as conducted previously (Li et\u00a0al., 2019). Besides, the Origin Pro 2020 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) was used for data analysis and figure creation."]
