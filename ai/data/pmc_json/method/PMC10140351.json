["Materials and methods", "Site description and sample collection", "The field experiment 8\u2009years\u2019 fertilization was conducted at an experimental station located in Dali City (100\u00b010\u2032E, 25\u00b053\u2032N), Yunnan Province, China. The experimental plot has maintained a fixed paddy-upland rotation mode of the rice-garlic and rice-broad bean rotation cycles. The rice used was Oryza sativa L. (japonica hybrid early-maturing varieties), the garlic planted was Allium sativum L (medium-maturing varieties), and the broad bean is Vicia faba L (medium-maturing varieties), which are highly suitable for planting in Yunnan Province. Initial physical and chemical properties (mean values) of soil in experimental area were as follows: total nitrogen (TN), 3.3\u2009g/kg; total phosphorus (TP), 0.97\u2009g/kg; total potassium, 19.3\u2009g/kg; pH, 7.1; organic matter (OM), 57.3\u2009g/kg.", "The experimental field was designed in random block design with 8 treatments: no fertilization (CK); conventional fertilizer treatment (CF); conventional fertilizer reduction 20% treatment (T1); conventional fertilization replaced by 100% organic fertilizer replacement in terms of nitrogen (T2); conventional fertilization replaced by 100% organic fertilizer replacement in terms of phosphorus (T3); conventional fertilization replaced by 100% organic fertilizer replacement in terms of nitrogen under considering 25% organic fertilizer mineralization rate (T4); conventional fertilization replaced by 100% organic fertilizer replacement in terms of phosphorus under considering 25% organic fertilizer mineralization rate (T5); slow release fertilizer instead of chemical fertilizer (T6). Fertilizer application amount of each treatment is shown in Supplementary Table S1. The commercial organic fertilizer used in this experiment consists of 80% cow manure and 20% other animal manure. There were three plots for each treatment, and a total of 24 plots for 8 fertilization modes. The area of each experimental plot is 30 m2 (6\u2009m\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009m), and the ridge of field between plots was built with cement (the width is 0.24\u2009m, the height is 0.20\u2009m, and 1\u2009m is built below the ground surface). Soil samples were collected from different depths of 0\u201320\u2009cm, 20\u201350\u2009cm and 50\u201380\u2009cm after garlic harvest in May. Each plot was sampled at 5 points and mixed evenly, and then about 1\u2009kg of the samples were placed in the refrigerator at \u221220\u00b0C by quartering method for DNA extraction.", "DNA extraction", "Soil samples DNA was extracted from 0.5\u2009g (dry weight) soil samples collected at different soil depths using FastDNA\u00ae Soil Rotation kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, United States) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The concentration and purity of DNA extracted from soil samples were measured on a NanoVue Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, United States) and the concentration of ARGs were recalculated based on the weight of the soil used for DNA extraction. Finally, DNA samples extracted from soils with different fertilization modes were stored at\u221220\u00b0C for subsequent measurement.", "High-throughput quantitative PCR", "High-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) reactions adopted Wafergen SmartChip Real-time PCR system (MicroAnaly Genetech Co., Ltd., China), which qualified 134 ARGs, 7 transpoase genes, 2 integrase genes and 16S rRNA. Details of the primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2, and the design of the primers used followed previous studies (Zhu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016). The reaction system contained 2\u2009ng/\u03bcL DNA template, 500\u2009nM each primer, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix and 0.1\u2009mg/ml albumin from bovine serum. The procedure steps were set as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, followed by 40\u2009cycles, including denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30\u2009s (Chen et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018).", "Quantification detection of ARGs", "Real-time quantification PCR (qPCR) reactions were conducted on a 7,500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biological) using the DNA/RNA/RNase-free 96-well reaction plates. The total abundance of bacteria was evaluated by analyzing 16S rRNA genes of bacteria, and the variation of ARGs abundance caused by differences in background bacterial levels and DNA extraction efficiency was corrected. The qPCR reaction mixtures (20\u2009\u03bcl) consists of 6.8\u2009\u03bcl RNAase-free water, 0.4\u2009\u03bcl ROX Reference DyeII, 10\u2009\u03bcl SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq TM II (Tli RNase H Plus, Takara), 0.4\u2009\u03bcl each primer and 2\u2009\u03bcl DNA extract with a suitable concentration or standard plasmid. The qPCR amplification conditions were set as follows: initial denaturation (95\u00b0C, 30\u2009s), then 40\u2009cycles of 5\u2009s at 95\u00b0C and 34\u2009s at 60\u00b0C. Melting curves were analyzed at temperatures ranging from 60\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C, with 1\u00b0C/read to ensure specificity, and the method of calibration curves for each target gene was shown in previous studies (Yang et al., 2019). Each DNA sample was amplified in three replicates, and RNAase-free water was used as a negative control, a threshold cycle of 31 was used as the detection limit (Ouyang et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2016). The specificity was detected by melting curve, while the fold change, relative abundance of each target gene and the normalized copy numbers of ARGs per bacterial cell (normalized abundance) were calculated according to previous studies (Su et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017).", "16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing", "Soil bacterial communities were analyzed by next-generation amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. PCR was used to amplify the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene in bacteria and archaea with primer 515F (5\u2032-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3\u2032) and the reverse primer 806R (5\u2032-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3\u2032).

The PCR system was finally kept at 72\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. PCR products were purified and subjected on Illumina HiSeq4000 platform of GUHE INFO (Hangzhou, China). High-quality clean reads were obtained by qualitative filtering of the original reads, with sequences with a similarity of 97% clustered into the same Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) (Edgar, 2013).", "Physicochemical analysis of soils", "The content of organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and pH of the soil samples were determined according to the previous studies and the national standard methods (Han et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2019; Mu et al., 2022). The OM in paddy soil was determined by dichromate oxidation and titration with ferrous sulfate solution. The TN and TP in soil were determined by Semi-micro Kjeldahl Method and spectrophotometry. pH was determined with a pH meter (in a 1:5 soil-water ratio suspension).", "Statistical analysis", "The abundance and standard deviation of all genes were calculated by Microsoft Excel 2010. SPSS 22.0 was used for correlation analysis and ANOVA analysis, and p\u2009< 0.05 was taken as the significant difference level. Histogram, heat map and boxplot plots were drawn using Origin 2021 software, and RDA analysis was performed using Canoco5. Structural equation models (SEMs) was established using R 4.2.2 with the \u201cpiecewiseSEM\u201d package to describe the relationship among fertilization treatment, soil properties, bacterial community, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and the abundance of ARGs in paddy-upland soil (Lefcheck, 2016). We used the Fisher\u2019s C test to judge the goodness of the modeling results. The models were modified stepwise according to the pathway significance (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and the goodness of the model (0\u2009\u2264\u2009Fisher\u2019s C/df\u2009\u2264\u20092 and 0.05\u2009<\u2009p\u2009\u2264\u20091.00)."]
