Gene replacement constructs for laeA, rsmA, and gliZ were made using double-joint PCR [35], [37]. Briefly, approximately 1-kb flanking regions were PCR amplified from gDNA of AF293 and fused to either the A. fumigatus argB gene from pJMP4 or the A. parasiticus pyrG gene from pJMP7 (primers are listed in Table 3). The laeA gene was disrupted with A. fumigatus argB in the AF293.6 (pyrG1, argB1) background to create TJMP19.2 (\u0394laeA, pyrG1) and TJMP19.2 was subsequently transformed with pJMP7 to create the prototrophic TJMP36.2 (\u0394laeA) strain. These strains were confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Deletion of rsmA was achieved by replacement with the A. parasiticus pyrG gene in AF293.1 (pyrG1) to generate TRSR1.2 which was confirmed by Southern blot (Figure S1B). Over expression of rsmA (OErsmA) was achieved by transformation of pRS1 into AF293.1, TJMP19.2, and AF293.6, which created TJMP54.16 (OErsmA), TJMP52.2 (\u0394laeA, OErsmA), and TJMP56.6 (OErsmA, argB1) respectively (Figure S1A). To create a double OErsmA\u0394gliZ strain, gliZ was replaced with the A. fumigatus argB gene in TJMP56.6 resulting in TRSR40.4 (Figure S1C).", "Gene Expression Analysis", "107 fungal spores/ml were grown in liquid GMM at either 37\u00b0C, 250 rpm for 48 h or 25\u00b0C, 280 RPM for 72 h and total RNA was extracted via Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent (5 Prime) as previously described [36].

The TLC plates were then visualized at 366 nm and 254 nm.", "HPLC-MS Profiling of Compounds 1\u201313 in Wild Type and OErsmA Cultures", "(a) Liquid culture preparation: 107 fungal spores/ml were grown in triplicates in liquid GMM (50 mL) at 25\u00b0C, 280 rpm for 72 h. Three 50 mL liquid culture supernatant samples of both wild type and OErsmA were frozen and lyophilized. To each of the lyophilized samples, 50 mL of a mixture consisting of 80% acetonitrile, 15% ethyl acetate, and 5% H2O was added. After stirring for 2 h, the mixtures were filtered over extraction solvent-washed cotton. The extraction process was repeated twice more using 10 mL of the extraction solvent. The solvent was removed using rotary evaporation. (b) Liquid culture analysis: The evaporated samples were dissolved in 250 \u00b5L of 10% water in acetonitrile, and 2 \u00b5L of the resulting solution was injected into an Agilent 1100 series HPLC. The HPLC system, equipped with an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6\u00d7150 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle diameter), running a water-acetonitrile gradient (2 mL/min) starting with 5% acetonitrile for 5 min, followed by a linear increase to 36% acetonitrile over 25 min, followed by a rapid linear increase to 100% over 10 min, and ending with 10 min at 100% acetonitrile. The eluent of the HPLC was split (1\u223610) into a Quattro II electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer operated in ESI positive (ESI+) ionization mode. Single ion monitoring (SIM) was used to increase sensitivity by monitoring the major ions produced by each analyte. Enriched samples of 1\u201313 served as standards to determine retention time and ionization/fragmentation for each analyte (enriched standards were obtained as described [38]). (c) Data processing: Ion chromatogram peak areas were measured for each analyte and used to assess the relative amounts in OErsmA compared to wild type.", "Oxidative Stress Tolerance Assays", "For studying the relative sensitivities of wild type and mutant strains to oxidative stress, 105 conidia in 5 \u00b5l were inoculated on GMM with 20, 30 and 40 \u00b5M menadione. Menadione was filter sterilized and added to agar medium at \u223c50\u00b0C before solidification. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. GMM without menadione served as a control.", "Neutrophil Recruitment", "Neutrophil recruitment assays were performed using a microfluidic chemotaxis platform developed and described in more detail elsewhere [39]. In brief, the device is able to generate a linear gradient of soluble factors between a source channel containing the compounds to be tested and a sink channel containing the neutrophils. The gradient is generated in a thin cross-channel in which neutrophils from the sink channel can invade. The quantification was performed using software developed in-house (source code and software can be obtained upon request). The neutrophil purification was performed with a gradient centrifugation process using Polymorphprep solution, according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Nycomed, Sheldon, UK). The neutrophils were re-suspended to a concentration of 4 million per mL in PBS, and kept no more than 2 h at 4 degrees Celsius. The microfluidic devices were prepared by filling them with modified HBSS (HBSS solution containing 2% HEPES buffer and 0.1% HAS), after which 4 \u00b5L of neutrophil suspension was added in each sink channel of each device, and finally 3 \u00b5L of the crude supernatants was inserted into each source channel of each device. The negative control was performed by adding blank GMM (the fungal growth medium) to the source channel, and the positive control was performed by adding a solution of 100 nM fMLP (F3506, Sigma Aldrich) in GMM.", "Animal Model of Aspergillus Infection", "(a)\nA. fumigatus wild type and OErsmA strains were assessed in a lung infection model of invasive aspergillosis. Briefly, female Swiss ICR mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley) weighing about 18\u201320 g were immunosuppressed via administration of cyclophosphamide by separate intraperitoneal injections, one at 4 days (200 mg/kg of body weight) and the other at 1 day (200 mg/kg) before infection. The treatment included administration of cortisone acetate at a dose of 250 mg/kg by separate intraperitoneal injection at 1 day before infection. Anesthetized mice (10 mice/fungal strain) were infected by nasal instillation of 50 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7107 conidia/ml (day 1) and monitored three times daily for 7 days postinfection. The control group was inoculated with saline (0.85% NaCl). All surviving mice were sacrificed at day 7. Health and comfort of animals was assessed twice a day by monitoring feeding and water intake. Animals were housed in the Microbial Science Building Vivarium. If animals were ill (decreased activity, difficulty moving, ruffled fur, decreased movement with stimulation) they were euthanized via CO2 inhalation. (b) Assessment of presence or absence of compounds 1\u201313 in the lungs of mice infected with wild type and OErsmA: Seven mice were infected per A. fumigatus strain as described above. Dissected lungs were lyophilized, and powdered using a metal spatula. Lung samples were extracted with 50 mL of acetonitrile and filtered over acetonitrile-washed cotton. Solvent was removed using rotary evaporation. Samples were redissolved in 20 \u00b5l acetonitrile, and 2 \u00b5L was injected into the HPLC-ESI+-SIMMS system described above. The chromatographic gradient consisted of water-acetonitrile starting with 5 min 5% acetonitrile, followed by a linear increase to 20% acetonitrile over 15 min, followed by a linear increase to 100% acetonitrile over 10 min, ending with 10 min at 100% acetonitrile. Enriched samples of 1\u201313 served as retention time and ionization standards.", "Statistical Analysis", "Statistical differences were analyzed using the JMP software package version 3.2.6 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Multiple comparisons of results for all strains were calculated for growth diameter and sporulation.
