Expression of ast genes in Aspergillus nidulans for cDNA isolation Plasmids pYTU, pYTP, pYTR digested with PacI and SwaI were used as vectors to insert genes31. A gpda promoter was generated by PCR amplification using primers Gpda-pYTU-F and Gpda-R with pYTR serving as template. Genes to be expressed were amplified through PCR using the genomic DNA of Aspergillus terreus NIH2624 as a template. A 4.5 kb fragment obtained using primers AstD-pYTU-recomb-F and AstA-pYTU-recomb-R was cloned into pYTU together with a gpda promoter by yeast homologous recombination to obtain pAstD+AstA-pYTU. Yeast transformation was performed using Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit™ (Zymo Research). A 2.4 kb fragment obtained using primers AstB-pYTR-recomb-F and AstB-pYTR-recomb-R was cloned into pYTR by yeast homologous recombination to obtain pAstB-pYTR. Similarly, a 2.3 kb fragment obtained using primers AstC-pYTP-recomb-F and AstC-pYTP-recomb-R was cloned into pYTP by yeast homologous recombination to obtain pAstC-pYTP. All three plasmids (pAstD+AstA-pYTU, pAstB-pYTR and pAstC-pYTP) were transformed into A. nidulans following standard protocols to result in the A. nidulans strain TY0131. TY01 was cultured in liquid CD-ST medium (20 g/L starch, 20 g/L peptone, 50 mL/L nitrate salts and 1 mL/L trace elements) at 28°C for 3 days. Total RNA of TY01 was extracted with the Invitrogen Ribopure™ kit, and total cDNA of TY01 was obtained using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cDNA fragment of astA was PCR amplified using primers AstA-xw55-recomb-F and AstA-xw55-recomb-R. The cDNA fragment of astB was PCR amplified using primers AstB-xw06-recomb-F and AstB-xw06-recomb-R.

All the introns were confirmed to be correctly removed by sequencing. Construction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains Plasmid pXW55 (URA3 marker) digested with NdeI and PmeI was used to introduce the astA gene23. A 1.3 kb fragment containing astA obtained from PCR using primers AstA-xw55-recomb-F and AstA-xw55-recomb-R was cloned into pXW55 using yeast homologous recombination to afford pAstA-xw55. The plasmid pAstA-xw55 was then transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae RC01 to generate strain TY0223. Plasmid pXW06 (TRP1 marker) digested with NdeI and PmeI was used to introduce the astB gene23. A 1.6 kb fragment containing astB obtained from PCR using primers AstB-xw06-recomb-F and AstB-xw06-recomb-R were cloned into pXW06 using yeast homologous recombination to afford pAstB-xw06. The plasmid pAstB-xw06 was then transformed into TY02 to generate strain TY03. Plasmid pXW06 (LEU2 marker) digested with NdeI and PmeI was used to introduce the astC gene23. A 1.6 kb fragment containing astC obtained from PCR using primers AstC-xw02-recomb-F and AstC-xw02-recomb-R were cloned into pXW02 using yeast homologous recombination to afford pAstC-xw02. The plasmid pAstC-xw02 was then transformed into TY03 to generate strain TY04. URA3 gene was inserted into ilv3 locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DHY ΔURA3 strain to generate UB01. A 879 bp homologous recombination donor fragment with 35–40 bp homologous regions flanking ilv3 ORF was amplified using primers ILV3p-URA3-F and ILV3t-URA3-R using yeast gDNA as template. The PCR product was gel purified and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae DHY ΔURA3, and selected on uracil dropout media to give UB01. The resulting strain was subjected to verification by colony PCR with primers ILV3KO-ck-F and ILV3KO-ck-R and the amplified fragment was sequence confirmed. The URA3 gene inserted into ilv3 locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DHY ΔURA3 was deleted from UB01 using homologous recombination to generate UB02. A 150 bp homologous recombination donor fragment with 75 bp homologous regions flanking ilv3 ORF was amplified using primers ILV3KO-F and ILV3KO-R, gel purified and transformed into UB01, and counterselected on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FoA) containing media to give UB02. The resulting strain was subjected to verification by colony PCR with primers ILV3KO-ck-F and ILV3KO-ck-R and the amplified fragment was sequenced confirmed. The empty plasmid pXP318 (URA3 marker) was transformed into UB02 to generate TY0532. Plasmid pXP318 digested with SpeI and XhoI was used as vector to introduce gene encoding fDHAD32. The cDNA of Aspergillus terreus NIH 2624 served as template for PCR amplification. A 1.7 kb fragment obtained using primers fDHAD-pXP318-F and fDHAD-pXP318-R were cloned into pXP318 using yeast homologous recombination to afford fDHAD-pXP318. Then, fDHAD-pXP318 was transformed into UB02 to generate TY06. fDHAD was driven by a constitutive promoter TEF1. Plasmid pXP318 digested with SpeI and XhoI was used as vector to introduce astD gene32. The cDNA isolated from TY01 served as the template for PCR amplification. A 1.8 kb fragment obtained using primers AstD-pXP318-F and AstD-pXP318-R were cloned into pXP318 using yeast homologous recombination to give AstD-pXP318. A FLAG-tag was also add to the N-terminal of AstD. Then, AstD-pXP318 was transformed into UB02 to generate TY07. AstD was driven by a constitutive promoter TEF1. Fermentation and compound analyses and isolation A seed culture of S. cerevisiae strain was grown in 40 mL of synthetic dropout medium for 2 d at 28°C, 250 rpm. Fermentation of the yeast was carried out using YPD (yeast extract 10 g/L, peptone 20 g/L) supplement with 2% dextrose for 3 d at 28°C, 250 rpm. HPLC-MS analyses were performed using a Shimadzu 2020 EVLC-MS (Phenomenex® Luna, 5μ, 2.0 × 100 mm, C-18 column) using positive and negative mode electrospray ionization. The elution method was a linear gradient of 5–95% (v/v) acetonitrile/water in 15 min, followed by 95% (v/v) acetonitrile/water for 3 min with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The HPLC buffers were supplemented with 0.05% formic acid (v/v). HPLC purifications were performed using a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Phenomenex® Kinetex, 5μ, 10.0 × 250 mm, C-18 column). The elution method was a linear gradient of 65–100% (v/v) acetonitrile/water in 25 min, with a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min. GC-MS analyses were performed using Agilent Technologies GC-MS 6890/5973 equipped with a DB-FFAP column. An inlet temperature of 240°C and constant pressure of 4.2 psi were used. The oven temperature was initially at 60°C and then ramped at 10°C/min for 20 min, followed by a hold at 240°C for 5 min. To isolate compound 1, the fermentation broth of TY02 was centrifuged (5000 rpm, 10 min), and cell pellet was harvested and soaked in acetone.

Protein expression, purification and biochemical assay To express and purify pDHAD, primers pDHAD-pET-F and pDHAD-pET-R were used to amplify a 1.7 kb DNA fragment containing pdhad (AT3G23940). The PCR product was cloned into pET28a using NheI and NotI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid pDHAD-pET was transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3) to give TY08. To express and purify fDHAD (XP_001208445.1), primers fDHAD-pET-F and fDHAD-pET-R were used to amplify a 1.6 kb DNA fragment containing fdhad. The PCR product was cloned into pET28a using NdeI and NotI restriction sites. The resulted plasmid fDHAD-pET was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to obtain TY09. To express and purify AstD (XP_001213593.1), primers AstD-pET-F and AstD-pET-R were used to amplify a 1.6 kb DNA fragment containing astD. The PCR product was cloned into pET28a using NdeI and NotI restriction sites. The resulted plasmid AstD-pET was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to obtain TY10. All DHADs fused a 6×His-tag with a molecular weight ~62 kD were expressed at 16°C 220 rpm for 20 h after 100 μM IPTG induction (IPTG was added when OD600 = 0.8). Cells of 1 L culture were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4°C. Cell pellet was resuspended in 15 mL Buffer A10 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 8% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 16000 rpm at 4°C. The protein supernatant was then incubated with 3 mL Ni-NTA for 4 h with slow, constant rotation at 4°C. Subsequently the Ni-NTA resin was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A50 (Buffer A + 50 mM imidazole). For elution of the target protein, the Ni-NTA resin was incubated for 10 min with 6 mL Buffer A300 (Buffer A + 300 mM imidazole). The supernatant from the elution step was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE together with the supernatants from the other purification steps. The elution fraction containing the recombinant protein was buffer exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM GSH). In vitro activity assays were carried out in 50 μL reaction mixture containing storage buffer, 10 mM (±)-sodium α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate hydrate (4) and 0.5 μM of purified DHAD enzyme. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme. After 0.5 h incubation at 30°C, the reactions were stopped by adding equal volume of ethanol. Approximately 0.1 volume of 100 mM phenylhydrazine (PHH) was added to derivatize the product 3-methyl-2-oxo-butanoic acid (5) into 6 at room temperature for 30 min. 20 μL of the reaction mixture was subject to LC-MS analysis. The area of the HPLC peak with UV absorption at 350 nm were used to quantify the amount of 6. (Extended Data Fig. 2). The inhibition percentage of AA on DHADs determined using in vitro biochemical assays are calculated by following equation: 
inhibitionpercentage=1-initialreactionratewithAAinitialreactionratewithoutAA Growth inhibition assay of S. cerevisiae on plates or in the tubes S. cerevisiae was grown in isoleucine, leucine and valine (ILV) dropout media (20 g/L glucose, 0.67 g/L Difco™ Yeast Nitrogen Base w/o amino acids, 18 mg/L adenine, arginine 76 mg/L, asparagine 76 mg/L, aspartic acid 76 mg/L, glutamic acid 76 mg/L, histidine 76 mg/L, lysine 76 mg/L, methionine 76 mg/L, phenylalanine 76 mg/L, serine 76 mg/L, threonine 76 mg/L, tryptophan 76 mg/L, tyrosine 76 mg/L) to test growth inhibition of AA on S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae was incubated at 28°C until OD600 of the control strain without AA treatment reached about 0.8. The ratio of yeast OD600 in media with AA treatment to yeast OD600 in media without AA was calculated as the percentage of growth inhibition. The inhibition curve was plotted as percentage of inhibition versus AA concentrations. To further prove AA affects BCAA biosynthesis, isoleucine, leucine and valine was also complemented to the media with or without treatment of AA. The growth curves of TY05, TY06 and TY07 were also plotted in Extended Data Fig. 4. The OD600 was recorded for every 20 min over a total of 50 h. Percent inhibition. The growth inhibition percentage of AA on S. cerevisiae strain is calculated by dividing the cell density (OD600) of the AA-treated strain to the corresponding untreated strains when OD600 reaches ~ 0.8 using following equation: 
growthinhibitionpercentage=1-OD600ofAAtreatedstrain0.8 in which 0.8 is the OD600 of untreated strain. Growth inhibition assay of plants on plates or in the tubes MS (2.16 g/L Murashige and Skoog basal medium, 8 g/L sucrose, 8 g/L agar) media was used to test the growth inhibition of AA on A. thaliana, Solanum lycopersicum, and Zea mays. A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum, and Z. mays were grown under long day condition (16/8 h light/dark) using cool-white fluorescence bulbs as the light resource at 23°C. AA was dissolved in ethanol and added to the media before inoculating strains or growing plants. The media of control treatment contains the same amount of ethanol, but without AA. Plant growth inhibition assay by spraying AA was firstly dissolved in ethanol and then added to solvent (0.06 g/L Finale® Bayer Inc. + 20 g/L EtOH). The control plants were treated with solvent containing ethanol only. A. thaliana that are resistant to glufosinate (containing the bar gene) were grown under long day condition (16/8 h light/dark) using cool-white fluorescence bulbs as the light resource at 23°C. Spraying treatments began upon the seed germination, and was repeated once every two days with approximately 0.4 mL AA solution per time per pot. Structure determination of holo-pDHAD The gene encoding pDHAD (residues 35–608) was cloned into pET21a derivative vector pSJ2 with an eight histidine (8×His) tag and a TEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminus. The following primers were used for cloning: the forward primer DHAD-F and the reverse primer DHAD-R. The double mutant K559A/K560A for efficient crystallization was designed using the surface entropy reduction prediction (SERp) server34. Mutations were generated by PCR using the forward primer K559AK560A-F and reverse primer K559AK560A-R. All constructed plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. pDHAD purified under aerobic conditions was found to contain no iron-sulfur cluster (apo form). Hence we performed [2Fe-2S] Cluster reconstitution under the atmosphere of nitrogen in an anaerobic box. The protein was incubated with FeCl3 at the ratio of 1:10 for 1 h on ice and then 10 equivalents of Na2S per protein was added drop-wise every 30 min for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then incubated overnight. Excess FeCl3 and Na2S were removed using a SephadexTM G-25 Fine column (GE Healthcare)26. The reconstituted holo-pDHAD was crystallized in an anaerobic box. The proteins (at 10 mg/mL) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution in a 50 μL volume of 2 μL and equilibrated against the reservoir solution, using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 16°C. Crystals for diffraction were observed in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate after 5 d. All crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after cryo-protected with solution containing 25% glycerol, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0. The data were collected at 100K and at the Beam Line 19U1 in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Diffraction data of holo-pDHAD was collected at the wavelength of 0.97774 Å. The best crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.11 Å. The Ramachandran plot favored (%), allowed (%) and outlier (%) are 98.05, 1.60, and 0.36 respectively. All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL3000 package35. The crystals belonged to space group P42212. The statistics of the data collection are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The holo-pDHAD structure was solved by the molecular replacement method Phaser embedded in the CCP4i suite and the L-arabinonate dehydratase crystal structure (PDB_ID: 5J83) as the search model. All the side chains were removed during the molecular replacement process36,37. The resulting model were refined against the diffraction data using the REFMAC5 program of CCP4i38. Based on the improved electron density, the side chains of holo-pDHAD protein, iron sulfur cluster, water molecule, acetate ion, sulfate ions, and magnesium ion were manually built using the program WinCoot39. The Rwork and Rfree values of the structure are 17.67% and 22.15%, respectively. The detailed refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The geometry of the model was validated by WinCoot. Structural factor and coordinate of holo-pDHAD have been deposited in the Protein Bank (PDB code: 5ZE4). Homology modelling of AstD and docking of substrate or AA into active site of holo-pDHAD The structure of holo-pDHAD was prepared in Schrodinger suite software under OPLS3 force field40. Hydrogen atoms were added to reconstituted crystal structures according to the physiological pH (7.0) with the PROPKA tool in Protein Preparation tool in Maestro to optimize the hydrogen bond network26,41. Constrained energy minimizations were conducted on the full-atomic models, with heavy atom coverage to 0.5 Å. The homology model was performed in Modeller 9.1842, using the crystal structure of holo-pDHAD solved in this work as a template. Sequence alignment in Modeller indicated that AstD and pDHAD shared 56.8% sequence identity and 75.0% sequence similarity (Extended Data Fig. 6). All the highly conserved residues and motifs were properly aligned. A total of 2000 models were generated for each target in Modeller with the fully annealed protocol. The optimal models were chosen for docking studies according to DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score. All ligand structures were built in Schrodinger Maestro software26. The LigPrep module in Schrodinger software was introduced for geometric optimization by using OPLS3 force field40. The ionization state of ligands were calculated with Epik tool employing Hammett and Taft methods in conjunction with ionization and tautomerization tools43. The docking of a ligand to the receptor was performed using Glide44. We included cofactors observed in crystal structure during the docking. Since both water and SO42− occupied the catalytic site, they were excluded prior to docking. Cubic boxes centered on the ligand mass center with a radius 8 Å for all ligands defined the docking binding regions. Flexible ligand docking was executed for all structures. Ten poses per ligand out of 20,000 were included in the post-docking energy minimization. The best scored pose for the ligand was chosen as the initial structure for further study. The MM/GBSA method was introduced to evaluate the ligand binding affinity based on the best scored docking pose in Schrodinger software. Figures are prepared in PyMOL and Inkscape45,46. Both of native substrate α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate and AA were docked into the catalytic site of pDHAD. The cross-section electrostatic surface map shows this unique catalytic pocket has a positively charged internal and a hydrophobic entrance, which binds to negatively charged “head” and hydrophobic “tail” of substrate or AA respectively. Thus the negatively charged “head” can lead both of the substrate and AA into the catalytic chamber. The bulky hydrophobic tricyclic moiety of AA, however, provides stronger hydrophobic interactions to the entrance and blocks the entrance of active site due to the hydrophobic residues at the entrance, including G68, A71, I72, I134, A133, M141, V212, F215, M498 and P501. In contrast, the smaller “tail” of native substrate provides less interactions to entrance because the smaller size limits efficient hydrophobic contact to nearby residues. This implies that once AA binds to pDHAD, it can prevent substrate approaching the active site. We also introduced molecular mechanics generalized Born and surface area (MM/GBSA) continuum solvation method, an widely used approach for relative binding energy calculation, to evaluate the relative binding affinity for both ligands47. The MM/GBSA calculations had been done in Prime48 (Schrödinger 2015 suite). The MM/GBSA energy was calculated using following equation: 
ΔGbind=Ecomplex-Eprotein-Eligand E denotes energy and includes terms such as protein–ligand van der Waals contacts, electrostatic interactions, ligand desolvation, and internal strain (ligand and protein) energies, using VSGB2.0 implicit solvent model with the OPLS2005 force field. The solvent entropy is also included in the VSGB2.0 energy model, as it is for other Generalized Born (GB) and Poison–Boltzmann (PB) continuum solvent models. MM/GBSA calculation shows that the relative binding energy for AA and α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate is −18.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol and −13.3 ± 0.2 kcal/mol respectively, which shows the binding constant of AA to active site is about 6000 times greater than α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate. This further confirms that AA is a competitive inhibitor of pDHAD. Cytotoxicity assay of AA Cell proliferation experiments were performed in a 96-well format (five replicates per sample) using melanoma cell line A375 and SK-MEL-1. AA treatments were initiated 24 h postseeding for 72 h, and cell survival was quantified using CellTiter-GLO assay (Promega). Cross experiment of A. thaliana To make male sterile A. thaliana, AA was added to chemical hybridization agent (CHA) formulation (250 μM AA, 2% ethanol, 0.1% Tween-80, 1% corn oil in water), which has less inhibition effect on the growth of A. thaliana. Flowers of the AA treated col-0 were selected as the female parent. The non-treated A. thaliana containing a glufosinate resistant gene were used as male parent to donate pollen. 2-week old F1 progeny resulting from the cross were treated by Finale (11.3% glufosinate-ammonium) at 1:2000 dilution. The results are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 9. Construction of the transgenic plants The coding sequence of AstD was codon optimized for A. thaliana. A chloroplast localization signal (CLS) of 35-amino acid residues derived from the N-terminal of A. thaliana DHAD (MQATIFSPRATLFPCKPLLPSHNVNSRRPSIISCS) was fused to N-terminus of the codon optimized AstD. A 3×FLAG-tag was inserted between the CLS and the codon optimized AstD (Supplementary Table 6). The gene block containing CLS, FLAG-tag and astD was synthesized and then cloned into pEG202 vector using Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (ThermoFisher scientific). The original CaMV 35S promoter of pEG202 was substituted by Ubiquitin-10 promoter to drive the expression of AstD. The construct was electro-transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain Agl0 followed by A. thaliana transformation using the standard floral dip method49. The A. thaliana Col-0 ecotype was transformed. Positive transgenic plants were selected using the glufosinate resistance marker, and were tested for survival in presence of AA. Protein expression verification with western blot Approximately 0.5 gram of leaf tissue of transgenic A. thaliana was grounded in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were homogenized in 2× SDS buffer followed by 5-min centrifuge at 21,000 g to remove undissolved debris. The supernatant containing resolved proteins were loaded onto a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel, and separated using MOPS running buffer. Transfer was conducted using iBlot2 dry transfer device and PVDF membrane. The total proteins were stained with Ponceau to demonstrate equal loading. Western blotting was performed using Sigma monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-Peroxidase antibody, followed by detection using Amersham ECL Prime detection reagent.
