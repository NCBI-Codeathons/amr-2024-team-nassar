["2. Methods of the Synthesis of Quinoxaline 1,4-Dioxides", "Synthetic approaches to the formation of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides are significantly limited (Figure 4). Prior to 1965, the primary method for their synthesis was the direct oxidation of quinoxaline derivatives. Additionally, benzene-unsubstituted quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides can be obtained by the condensation of o-benzoquinone dioxime with 1,2-dicarbonyl derivatives. However, currently, a more efficient method for obtaining quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide derivatives has become the heterocyclization of benzofuroxans with enols or enamines by the Beirut reaction.", "The oxidation of quinoxalines with peroxy acids or hydrogen peroxide does not result in a preparative yield of the desired quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides. This limitation arises from the deactivation of the heterocyclic core, preventing further electrophilic attack due to the formation of an N-oxide fragment following the oxidation of one of the nitrogen atoms [37]. In 2006, M. Carmeli and S. Rozen developed a method based on the application of a complex of hypofluorous acid with acetonitrile. This approach allows oxidizing of quinoxalines to quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides with quantitative yields, even for derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents and sterically hindered 5-substituted derivatives. For instance, quinoxaline 9 can be oxidized to derivative 10 with a substituent at position 5, which is otherwise challenging to access using alternative methods (Scheme 1) [37,38].", "Several examples of the formation of a fragment of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide via cyclization of o-benzoquinone dioxime with 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds are known. In 1970, E. Abushanab [39] described the interaction of 1,2-diketones with o-benzoquinone dioxime (11), leading to 2,3-disubstituted derivatives (compound 12, Scheme 2) in low yields. However, the formation of 2-hydroxyquinoxaline 1,4-dioxides as the main products, such as compound 13, was observed in good yields when \u03b1-ketoaldehydes were used for this condensation (Scheme 2) [39].", "The most significant preparative method for the synthesis of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides is the cyclization of benzofuroxans by the Beirut reaction, developed by M.J. Haddadin and C.H. Issidorides in 1965 [40].", "Initially, quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides were obtained by the condensation of benzofuroxans with enamines. Thus, the interaction of benzofuroxan (14a) with morpholinylcyclohexene gives 2,3-tetramethylenequinoxaline 1,4-dioxide (15) in moderate yield (Scheme 3) [41]. Later, the synthetic possibilities of the Beirut reaction were expanded by using a large number of starting substrates. In 1972, M.J. Haddadin and C.H. Issidorides used this method to synthesize phenazine 5,10-dioxides, analogs of the antibiotic Iodinin. The authors found that cyclization of benzofuroxan (14a) with hydroquinone in the presence of a base gives 2-hydroxyphenazine 5,10-dioxide (16) (Scheme 3) [42]. In the same year, A. Tanaka et al. showed the possibility of using alkynes in the Beirut reaction for the synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides. Thus, the derivative 17 was obtained from benzofuroxan (14a) and 2-(furan-2-ylethynyl)-5-nitrofuran in the presence of methylamine, although in low yield (Scheme 3) [43]. Cyclization of benzofuroxan (14a) with aryl- and heteroaryl ethylenes (Scheme 3) was proposed for the synthesis of 2-substituted quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides (for example, derivative 18) by J. Li et al. [44].", "Several possible variants of the Beirut reaction mechanism have been described [27,41,45,46]. The first stage of the proposed mechanism includes the nucleophilic attack of the formed enolate ion on the electrophilic nitrogen atom of benzofuroxan 14a, leading to intermediate a [27]. Based on the mechanism of the Beirut reaction (Figure 5), the opening of benzofuroxan 14a in one of the transition states is accompanied by an attack of the oxime nitrogen atom on the electrophilic carbonyl group of intermediate b, which causes the formation of dihydroxyquinoxaline c. Further elimination of water from intermediate c leads to the formation of the quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide (d).", "In 1995, A. Monge et al. described the synthesis of 3-aminoquinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-dioxide 19a by the Beirut reaction from malononitrile and benzofuroxan 14a (Scheme 4) when developing antiparasitic agents [47]. A similar cyclization with malonic ester in the presence of sodium hydride leading to 2-hydroxyquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide 20 in high yield was reported by Y. Xu et al. (Scheme 4) [48].", "Cyclization of benzofuroxans with 1,3-diketones, \u03b2-ketoesters, or \u03b2-ketoamides has been proposed to obtain 2-acyl derivatives of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide [49]. Thus, the interaction of 5,6-difluorobenzofuroxan (14b) with acetylacetone, acetoacetic ester, or N-phenylacetoacetamide in triethylamine at 0\u201310 \u00b0C gives 6,7-difluoroquinoxaline 1,4-dioxides 21\u201322a, 23, respectively, with yields of 65\u201383% (Scheme 5) [50].", "T. Lima et al. evaluated the effect of acid-base catalysts in the Beirut reaction on the yield of 2-carboethoxyquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide during the study of the condensation of benzofuroxan (14a) with benzoylacetic esters [51]. Thus, the target products were obtained in the presence of organic bases in less than 7% yields. In the case of acid catalysis, the key derivatives formed slightly higher yields (~13%). Catalysis with potassium fluoride on alumina in the absence of an organic solvent leads to the formation of desired products in acceptable yields (31\u201340%). A higher yield (50\u201364%) of derivatives of 3-phenylquinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid 1,4-dioxide was achieved using K2CO3 as a catalyst in acetone or DMF.", "T. Sun et al. carried out the heterocyclization of benzofuroxan 14a and carbonyl compounds to substituted quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides via supramolecular catalysis by \u03b2-cyclodextrin in water [52]. A similar procedure was used to obtain conjugates of 6(7)-haloquinoxaline 1,4-dioxides with primaquine [53] or with N-aryl-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles [54], which have antimalarial and antimycobacterial activity.", "In some cases, the Beirut reaction between monosubstituted benzofuroxans and CH-acids leads to a mixture of 7- and 6-substituted quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides [55,56,57], which is explained by the presence of tautomeric equilibrium in benzofuroxans [58,59]. A study of the regioselectivity of the Beirut reaction between monosubstituted benzofuroxans 14c\u2013i and benzoylacetonitrile revealed that, along with the 7-isomers 24a\u2013g, their 6-substituted analogs 25c\u2013g [60] are formed in the reaction (Scheme 6). It is shown that the yield of the 6-isomer increases with the growth of electron-withdrawing properties of the substituent in the starting benzofuroxan and correlates well with the Hammett constant. Thus, the 6-isomer is not formed in the case of derivatives with electron-donating groups, while the 6-substituted compounds 25f,g with CO2Me- and CF3-groups are the main products of the reaction. The structure of the isomers was accurately confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray analysis. Compounds 24a\u2013g and 25f,g showed high antiproliferative activity against breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, the structural isomers 24c\u2013g and 25c\u2013g had considerable differences in properties.", "The reaction of aminobenzofuroxans 14j,k with benzoylacetonitrile in chloroform in the presence of Et3N also yields 7-amino-substituted quinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-dioxides 26a,b (Scheme 7) [61]. This method of heterocyclization was later used to synthesize 7-(piperazin-1-yl)-3-trifluoromethylquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide 27a (Scheme 7) [62]. The 7-amino derivatives of 26a,b have high aqueous solubility and downregulate the expression of HIF1\u03b1, BCL2, and ER\u03b1 and induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells at submicromolar concentrations.", "In summary, the Beirut cyclization is currently the main preparative method for the synthesis of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides with various substituents at positions 2, 3, 6, and 7. Ongoing research is focused on studying regioselectivity and exploring the possibilities of varying starting compounds, catalysts, and conditions to increase the yield of target quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides."]
