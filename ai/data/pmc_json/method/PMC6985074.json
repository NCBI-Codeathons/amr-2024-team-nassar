All recombinant plasmids were transferred individually into the non-methylating E. coli ET12567 pUZ8002 and the resulting derivatives used as donor strains for intergeneric conjugation. To prepare fresh vegetative mycelium of N. gerenzanensis prior to conjugal transfer, one vial of WCB was inoculated into 50 ml of VSP medium (250 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 10 \u00f85 mm glass beads) and incubated for 48 h on the orbital shaker at 220 rpm and at 30\u00b0C.

Chromogenic conversion of X-Gluc into the blue-colored 5,5\u2032-dibromo-4,4\u2032-dichloro-indigo was monitored after 1 h of incubation. For the quantitative measurements of GusA activity, Nonomuraea strains were grown in liquid media. One WCB vial of each of the strains was inoculated into a baffled 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of E26 (N. gerenzanensis strains) or of VSP (N. coxensis strains). After 72 h of cultivation, 10% v/v of this preculture was transferred into a baffled 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of FM2 (N. gerenzanensis strains) or ISP2 (N. coxensis strains). To induce P21-cmt-driven gusA-expression, cumate was added at the final concentration of 50 \u03bcM to cultures carrying pGCymRP21 24 h after inoculation. After 120 h of cultivation, mycelial lysates were prepared as previously reported by Horbal et al., 2013. Glucuronidase activity was measured as previously described (Myronovskyi et al., 2011; Horbal et al., 2013) using a spectrophotometric assay following the conversion of the colorless p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-glucuronide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) into the colored p-nitrophenol at 415 nm using an Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland).

Cultivations in FM2 in shake-flasks were conducted at 30\u00b0C and 220 rpm. Bioreactor fermentations were conducted at 30\u00b0C, with stirring at 450 rpm (corresponding to 1.17 m/s of tip speed) and 2 l/min aeration rate. Dissolved oxygen (measured as % pO2) was monitored using an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode. The pH values of culture broths were monitored using a pH meter. Foam production was controlled by adding Hodag antifoam (Hodag Chemical Corporation, Chicago, IL, United States) through an antifoam sensor.
