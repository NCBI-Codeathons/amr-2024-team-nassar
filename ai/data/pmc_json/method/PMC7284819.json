["2.1. Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions and Routine Procedures", "Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A and Rhodococcus sp. IB201691-2A2 were isolated during this work. Streptomyces albus J1074 was used as a host for the heterologous expression of the baikalomycin biosynthetic gene cluster [32]. For the routine cloning, Escherichia coli XL1Blue (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) has been used and intergenic conjugation was carried out with E. coli ET12567 (pUB307) [33]. S. cerevisiae BY4742 was used for transformation-associated recombination cloning [34]. E. coli strains were grown in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) broth. Actinobacteria strains were cultured on soya flour mannitol agar (MS) medium and in liquid tryptic soy broth medium (TSB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). If necessary, the following antibiotics have been added: apramycin (50 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121), spectinomycin (100 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121), phosphomycin (100 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121) and carbenicillin (100 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The chromogenic substrate X-gluc with 100 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 concentration was used to detect the GUS (\u03b2-glucuronidase) activity.", "Plasmid and total DNA isolation, E. coli transformation and E. coli/Streptomyces intergeneric conjugation were performed according to standard protocols [35,36]. S. cerevisiae BY4742 was transformed with the standard LiAc protocol [36]. Enzymes, including restriction endonucleases, ligase, Taq DNA polymerase, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, were used according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA)."]
