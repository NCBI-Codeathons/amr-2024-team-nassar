["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Fungal strains.", "All Trichoderma wild-isolate strains described in this study are listed in Table\u00a0S1. FT-101 and FT-333 were isolated by Ruey-Shyang Chen (National Chia-Yi University). CBS1-1, CBS1-2, Gv29-8, and P1 were provided by Monika Schmoll (Austrian Institute of Technology, Austria).", "Whole-genome DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and whole-genome gene prediction.", "Isolation of genomic DNA and RNA, as well as PacBio single-molecular real-time (SMRT) genome sequencing and assembly, were carried out as described previously (21, 38, 88). Oxford Nanopore direct DNA library preparation and sequencing were performed at the Genomic Core Lab of the Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica. In brief, small fragments of purified genomic DNA were removed by using the Ampure cleanup kit (Beckman Coulter). High-quality DNA quantification was conducted using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The average length of genomic DNA was scaled using Femto Pulse (Agilent). We used 1\u2009\u03bcg of genomic DNA for library construction. The library contained three or four DNA samples barcoded using the EXP-NBD104 Rapid barcoding kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), and adaptors were added with the SQK-LSK109 ligation sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The library was loaded onto a R9.4.1 Flow Cell system (FLO-MIN106) and processed for 48 h on the MinION platform. The sequencing process was controlled using the MinKNOW software (version 3.6.5; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). All experimental procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. FAST5 data files were generated upon completion of sequencing. These files were converted into FASTQ files in Guppy (v3.6.0). All reads were split into separate FASTQ files based on their barcode by means of the qcat tool (v1.1.0), and then Canu (v2.1.1) (89) was used to perform whole-genome assembly on the corresponding FASTQ files for each sample. The parameter of corOutCoverage was set to 60 based on sequencing read depth. Finally, we used medaka (v1.2.0) to polish the assemblies with the raw reads. Because Canu generated expected numbers of contigs for each sample, and a comparison of the genome to wild-type QM6a indicated no broken contigs, we did not perform any manual finishing or validation. The completeness of genome assemblies was evaluated in BUSCO (v4.0.6) (90) against the database of fungi_odb10 (OrthoDB; https://www.orthodb.org). All other experimental procedures have been described previously in detail (38), including PacBio SMRT genome sequencing, NGS-based RNA sequencing, as well as genome-wide gene prediction in Funannotate (91). BUSCO was also used to quantitatively measure the completeness of genome assemblies and gene predictions. We selected evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content based on the Ascomycota odb9 database from OrthoDB (https://www.orthodb.org). Genome or protein matrix scores >95% for model organisms are generally deemed complete reference genomes (92).", "Analysis of genome-wide synteny.", "For comparative genome analyses and to identify duplicated regions, we identified orthologous gene pairs using the annotation results generated in Funannotate v1.8 (91). Alignments were performed using BLASTP with an expect value (E)\u2009\u2264\u20091e-20. CIRCOS (48) was used to display sequence similarity and conservation. The inner ribbon track of CIRCOS outputs is used to show synteny, whereas the exterior tracks quantify the degree of sequence conservation between the T. reesei CBS1-2 genome and those of the three other Trichoderma species.", "Comparative genomic analysis.", "Funannotate (91) not only parses the protein-coding models from the annotation, but also identifies numbers and classes of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), proteases, transcriptional factors, secreted proteins, polyketide synthases (PKSs), and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). To predict secreted proteins, we downloaded the SignalP 4.1 (93), TMHMM 2.0 (94), and big-PI Fungal Predictor (95) programs into \u201cFunannotate\u201d and then applied them with default settings. In this study, effector candidate proteins were defined as predicted secreted proteins (with a signal peptide present, but no transmembrane domains or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors) having lengths of <300 amino acids. To assess if effector candidates presented similarity to known proteins, we performed BLASTP analysis (cutoff E-value 10\u22125) using the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded October 22, 2016).", "CAZymes were reannotated using the dbCAN2 meta server (http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2) (96). We have developed a software tool \u201cIBM-CAZ\u201d to predict potential CAZyme gene clusters (CAZ-GCs) with the following requirements: a potential CAZ-GC must contain \u22653 CAZyme genes or \u22652 CAZyme genes with \u22651 other specific signature genes (namely, transporters or transcription factors), and be present within \u22642 intergenic distances. Although the prediction requirements in IMB-CAZ are more stringent than those of dbCAN2 (96) and dbCAN-PUL (97), IBM-CAZ was able to identify all four previously identified CAZ-GCs in Trichoderma reesei QM6a, the ancestor of all currently used cellulase-producing mutants (32).", "Proteomics analysis of secreted proteins.", "To identify proteins secreted by different Trichoderma strains, we germinated 1\u2009mL of conidia (OD600nm = 0.3) and cultured it at 25\u00b0C in 250\u2009mL potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium in shake flasks at 120\u2009rpm for 24 h. The vegetative mycelia and conidia were removed from culture medium by filtering through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The proteins in the culture filtrate (CF) were precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate (AS) to 80% saturation at 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, the AS precipitates were recovered and then resuspended in 500\u2009\u03bcL of 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich).", "For in-solution trypsin digestion, the target proteins (20\u2009\u03bcg) were reconstituted in 100\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5% acetonitrile, mixed with 1/10 volume of 100\u2009mM 1,4-dithiothreitol in 100\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Then, 1/10 volume of 550\u2009mM iodoacetamide in 100\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to the mixture, gently vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Promega Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin was added to give a final substrate:trypsin ratio of 50:1. The digestion reaction was carried out overnight at 37\u00b0C and then the reaction was stopped by adding 5% formic acid to adjust the pH of the solution to below pH 6.0. We determined pH by placing 1-\u03bcL aliquots onto pH paper. The peptide digestion products were desalted using C18 Zip-Tips (Millipore, ZTC 18M 096). The peptide solutions were dried down in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C before undergoing mass spectrometric analysis.", "Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was applied to analyze trypsin-digested peptides. LC-MS analysis was performed by Shu-Yu Lin (Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica) using an EASY-nLC 1200 system linked to a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer equipped with a Nanospray Flex ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) located at the Academia Sinica Common Mass Spectrometry Facilities (https://www.ibc.sinica.edu.tw/facilities/mass-spectrometry-facilities/). All related experimental procedures were described previously in detail (98). Proteomic data were searched against our whole-genome annotation data sets (see below) using the Mascot search engine (v.2.6.2; Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) in Proteome Discoverer (v 2.2.0.388; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). We used the search criterion trypsin digestion. The fixed modification was set as carbamidomethyl (C), and variable modifications were set as oxidation (M), acetylation (protein N-terminal) allowing up to two missed cleavages, and mass accuracy of 10\u2009ppm for the parent ion and 0.6\u2009Da for the fragment ions. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated with the Proteome Discoverer Percolator function, and identifications with an FDR\u2009>\u20091% were rejected.", "Data availability.", "The complete genome sequences, annotation, and raw data sets have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/) under accession number PRJNA700774 (Table\u00a0S1).
