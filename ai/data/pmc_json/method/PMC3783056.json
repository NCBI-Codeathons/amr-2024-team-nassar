(Tokyo, Japan, formerly Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K. (Tokyo, Japan). SN-38, J-107088, camptothecin and Ko143 were resuspended with Me2SO as stock solutions and stored at \u221220\u00baC. Verapamil was resuspended with water and stored at \u221220\u00baC. Rabbit anti-Top1 antibody was purchased from TopoGEN, Inc. (Columbus, OH, USA), and mouse anti-DNA topoisomerase II \u03b1 (Top2\u03b1) antibody was purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan).", "Establishment of highly camptothecin-resistant colon cancer cell sublines", "The DLD-1 human colon cancer cell line was provided by the Cell Resource Center for Biochemical Research of Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). We previously established the DLDSNR6 cell line from parental DLD-1 cells through the continuous exposure to stepwise increases in SN-38 concentrations (7). In this study, DLDSNR6 cells were exposed to stepwise increases in camptothecin concentrations (up to 2 \u03bcM) over a period of 4 months and then SNRA23F and SNRA311E sublines were established by the limiting dilution technique. The camptothecin-resistant cell pool was again exposed to camptothecin with concentrations up to 10 \u03bcM for 3 months, and SNRD16F and SNRD38F sublines were obtained (Fig. 1A). These cell lines were cultured at 37\u00baC in RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies Japan, Tokyo, Japan) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Yokohama, Japan) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic Mixed Solution (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.", "Cell growth, viability and cytotoxicity assays", "DLD-1, DLDSNR6, SNRA23F, SNRA311E, SNRD16F and SNRD38F cells (5.0\u00d7105/ml) were cultured in 6-cm culture dishes for 48\u201372 h. The number of viable cells was counted by the trypan blue dye exclusion method with a hemocytometer. The cytotoxicity of Top1-targeting drugs was measured by an MTS assay (Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA) with minor technical modifications. Three to ten thousand cells were incubated in a 96-well tissue culture plate for 96 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of camptothecin, SN-38, and J-107088, after which the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.", "Detection of Top1 mutations", "Total RNA was extracted from each cell line and reverse transcription was performed. The full-length Top1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting fragments were inserted into the cloning vector. The entire Top1 open reading frame was sequenced with the BigDye Terminator Version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life Technologies Japan) and the ABI 3700 DNA Analyzer (7,10).", "Preparation of protein samples and immunoblotting analysis", "Crude cell extracts were prepared by suspending the cells in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer containing 1 \u03bcM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protein concentrations of each sample were measured by the Bradford method. Protein samples were separated by 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting was performed with antibodies for Top1 and Top2\u03b1.", "Top1-mediated DNA relaxation assay", "The Top1 catalytic activities of the nuclear extracts from each cell line were determined by measuring the relaxation of the supercoiled pHOT1 plasmid (TopoGEN, Inc.), which contained a Top1-cleavage site that was derived from the tetrahymena ribosomal gene repeat (11). The supercoiled pHOT1 plasmid (0.25 \u03bcg) was incubated with the indicated amounts of nuclear extracts in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37\u00baC for 60 min in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl (7). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 \u03bcl of 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate and the samples were loaded onto 1% agarose gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Tris-borate EDTA buffer (89 mM Tris-borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 0.5 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by transillumination with UV light. Relaxation activity was identified by the disappearance of the supercoiled DNA.", "Quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR array analysis of ATP-binding cassette transporters", "To assess the relative expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters in each cell line, we used the TaqMan\u2122 Array Gene Signature 96-well plates (human ABC transporters; Life Technologies Japan). After 2 months of passage in drug-free medium, the cells were harvested, and the total RNA was extracted with ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's directions with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies Japan). As a measure of the relative levels of expression between the parental DLD-1 and the resistant cell lines, \u0394\u0394Ct values were calculated and converted to fold-change values (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct).", "Flow cytometry", "The effects of J-107088 on cell cycle distribution in each cell line were determined with propidium iodide staining and analyzed with flow cytometry. Each cell line was either treated with vehicle alone [Me2SO (0.2%)], J-107088 (5 \u03bcM), J-107088 (5 \u03bcM) plus verapamil (10 \u03bcM), or J-107088 (5 \u03bcM) plus Ko143 (0.3 \u03bcM) for 48 h. Cells were harvested, fixed in 70% precooled ethanol, and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 \u03bcg/ml propidium iodide and 10 \u03bcg/ml RNase for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescence (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 585/42 nm) of 2\u00d7104 cells from each sample was analyzed with FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) flow cytometry, and the cell population at each cell cycle phase was determined with ModiFit software (Becton-Dickinson)."]
