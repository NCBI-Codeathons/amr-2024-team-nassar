["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Bacterial strains, isogenic mutants, and cultures.", "The E.\u00a0coli strains used in this study were DH10B hosting the pBACpks or the vector (pBeloBAC11) (1). The clbA and clbP mutants, and the mutants complemented with the corresponding plasmids pClbA and pClbP, were described previously (23, 28). The clbH and clbQ mutants were constructed by using the lambda Red recombinase method, with primers AS149 and AS150, and primers IHAPJPN57 and IHAPJPN58. The corresponding complementation plasmids were constructed by cloning into pASK75 (SacI/PstI) the PCR products with primers CPTPNG14 and CPTPNG15 and primers CPTPNG20 and CPTPNG21. The primer sequences can be requested from the corresponding author. The wild-type clinical enterobacterial isolates were E.\u00a0coli strain SP15 (28), C.\u00a0koseri strain BAA 895, K.\u00a0pneumoniae strain CF1, and E.\u00a0aerogenes strain 64 (2). Bacteria were grown at 37\u00b0C in 5\u00a0ml of Lennox L broth (LB; Invitrogen) or on LB agar plates. Carbenicillin (50\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0ml\u22121), kanamycin (50\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0ml\u22121), or chloramphenicol (25\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0ml\u22121) was added as required. For DNA cross-linking and HeLa cell infection experiments, bacteria were grown overnight in LB and then diluted 1/20 in prewarmed Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)\u201325\u00a0mM HEPES (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 240-rpm agitation to reach the exponential phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD600], 0.4 to 0.5).", "In vitro DNA cross-linking assay.", "Plasmid pUC19 DNA linearized with BamHI (TaKaRa) and purified with a QIAquick PCR kit (Qiagen) was stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Calf thymus DNA (Sigma) solubilized in 10\u00a0mM Tris\u20131\u00a0mM EDTA (pH\u00a08) was sonicated to reduce the average DNA fragment size to ~1,000\u00a0bp and was stored at +4\u00b0C. Plasmid or thymus DNA was exposed to bacteria as follows: in a 96-well plate or in 1.5-ml Eppendorf microtubes, 400\u00a0ng (or the indicated amount) of DNA was added to 100\u00a0\u00b5l DMEM\u201325\u00a0mM HEPES (Invitrogen) inoculated with 3 \u00d7 106 bacteria pregrown to the exponential phase or in the population numbers given in the text.

Following 4\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C, bacteria were pelleted and the DNA was purified from the supernatant using a Qiagen QIAquick PCR kit. For wild-type enterobacterial strains that release nucleases, the bacteria were grown in DMEM\u201325\u00a0mM HEPES without the target DNA for 3.5\u00a0h, and then EDTA (1\u00a0mM) and target DNA were added and the mixture was incubated for 40\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C.", "Denaturing gel DNA electrophoresis.", "The protocol was adapted from reference 55.

Following neutralization in 150\u00a0mM NaCl\u2013100\u00a0mM Tris (pH\u00a07.4), DNA was stained with Gel Red (Biotium) and visualized with flat-fielding while avoiding charge-coupled-device (CCD) pixel saturation in a Bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS system.", "Denaturation-renaturation assay.", "The experiment was performed as previously described (35). Briefly, 100\u00a0ng of DNA was added to a mixture of 250\u00a0\u00b5l of 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma), 0.4\u00a0mM EDTA, and 20mM potassium phosphate (pH\u00a011.7). The fluorescence was measured with a Tecan Infinite Pro microplate reader (excitation wavelength, 525\u00a0nm; emission wavelength, 600\u00a0nm), and then the samples were heated for 3\u00a0min at 96\u00b0C and immediately cooled to 22\u00b0C, and the fluorescence was measured again. The percentage of DNA renaturation was calculated as the value corresponding to the level of fluorescence measured after denaturation and renaturation divided by the value corresponding to the level of fluorescence measured before denaturation.", "HeLa cell culture, infection, and in cellulo cross-linking assay.", "HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were cultivated in DMEM Glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator and were maintained by serial passage.

Briefly, following fixation with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilization, and blocking, cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-S139-phosphorylated H2AX antibodies (Cell Signaling catalog no. 9718). An infrared fluorescent (800-nm-wavelength) secondary antibody (Rockland) was used to detect p-H2AX. DNA was counterstained with RedDot2 (Biotium). DNA and p-H2AX were visualized with an Odyssey infrared imaging scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences). The values representing relative levels of fluorescent units for p-H2AX per cell (as determined by dividing the p-H2AX signal by the DNA signal) were divided by the control values to determine the genotoxic index values.", "Immunofluorescence analyses for RPA, 53BP1, FANCD2, and S139-phosphorylated H2AX were performed as previously described (56). Briefly, following preextraction with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-0.1% Triton X-100, fixation with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100, the cells were stained with the following primary antibodies: 53BP1 (NB100-304) and FANCD2 (NB100-182) antibodies from Novus Biologicals, Inc., p-H2AX (JBW301) from Merck/Millipore, and RPA32 (NA18) from Calbiochem.
