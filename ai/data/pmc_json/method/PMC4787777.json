["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Biochemical assays", "In vitro mRNA translation (driven by 027IF2Cp(A) mRNA) and tests of individual translational steps (e.g. Phe-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A site, fMet-puromycin formation and dipeptide (fMet-Phe) formation) were carried out as described (27,28). In\nsitu probing of the 23S rRNA by hydroxyl radical cleavage was carried out as described (29). EF-Tu-dependent A-site binding of proflavine-labeled Phe-tRNA to MFmRNA-programmed 70S ribosomes carrying P-site bound fMet-tRNA (70S IC), was carried out in the absence or presence of 20 \u03bcM HygA as described (30).", "X-ray crystallography", "Crystals of the 50S ribosomal subunit from Deinococcus radiodurans were prepared as previously described (31,32), soaked overnight in a stabilizing solution with or without 20 \u03bcM HygA and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected with a PILATUS detector at the X06SA beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland), and processed to 2.9 \u00c5 and 3.0 \u00c5 for the complex and apo structures, respectively, using the XDS (33) and CCP4 (34) program packages. A previously reported structure of the D. radiodurans 50S subunit (PDB accession code: 2ZJR) (35) was fully refined against the newly collected data set for the native 50S subunit, and the resulting model was used to phase the 50S\u2013HygA complex with Phenix (36). The same set (\u223c5%) of the reflections data was omitted during refinement for the free R factor calculation. The binding position of the drug was determined based on \u03c3A-weighted difference maps (37). Electron density indicating the presence of HygA and alterations in nearby nucleotides was unambiguously observed in the A site of the PTC in the initial unbiased electron density maps obtained with G2061, A2451-C2452, A2503-C2507, A2572-C2573, G2583-U2585 and A2602 excluded from calculation (Supplementary Figure S2). Although the positions of the phenol-, alkene- and peptide moieties within the HygA structure suggest a conjugated system, with a preferential continuous planarity in solution along the C1\u2032\u2013C4\u2032 backbone of HygA, during model refinement three separate planarity restraints for each of these moieties were created. This resulted in small violations (<10\u00b0) in the planarity of the system, possibly due to the specific chemical environment of the ribosome, which can affect the mesomerism of the conjugated system (i.e. along the C1\u2032\u2013C4\u2032 atoms, Supplementary Figure S1). Concerning the aminocyclitol moiety, during refinement either no torsion restraints for this moiety were active or torsion restraints were present to support either a chair or twisted boat conformation; the aminocyclitol moiety of HygA has been reported to acquire a twisted boat conformation in solution (38). Independently from the applied setup the models always converged to the same final model with a chair like conformation. Compared to the twisted boat conformations, the chair like conformation also fits best the density of the unbiased map or the 2Fo\u2013Fc map obtained imposing the twisted boat conformation through out the refinement. Modeling and refinement were carried out using Coot (39) and Phenix (36). rRNA nucleotide suites were thoroughly corrected using ERRASER (40) and RCrane (41). Chemical structures of HygA and relevant compounds were depicted using MarvinSketch (ChemAxon: http://www.chemaxon.com). Coordinates and restraints of the drug suitable for refinement were obtained using the GRADE server (42) and eLBOW (43). rRNA residues were numbered according to the Escherichia coli scheme and helices indicated using the standard nomenclature."]
