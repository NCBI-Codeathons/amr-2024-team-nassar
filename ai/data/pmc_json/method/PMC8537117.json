["2. Methods", "2.1. Hospital Settings", "Brest University hospital is a 2500-bed healthcare facility, characterized by 460,000 outpatient visits and 120,000 inpatients monitored per year. Specialized care is provided for about 550 renal transplant recipients.", "2.2. Patients and P. jirovecii Specimens", "Twenty-six P. jirovecii specimens from 26 patients diagnosed with PCP, between 2010 and 2020, were retrospectively examined. They consisted of one group of 10 SOT recipients (T1 to T10) (sex ratio M/F 7/3; median age 65 years (55\u201378 years)) and another group of 16 patients who were not transplant recipients (C1 to C16) (sex ratio M/F 12/4; median age 60 years (30\u201389 years)). The first group had undergone MPA treatment since the day of transplantation, with a median duration of exposure of 51 months (range: 8\u2013216 months) conversely to the second group who did not have any prior exposure to MPA (control group). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. Biological diagnoses of PCP were initially based on microscopic detection of P. jirovecii and/or DNA amplification using a qPCR assay targeting the gene encoding the mitochondrial large subunit of ribosomal RNA which was performed after DNA extraction using NucliSens easyMag (bio-M\u00e9rieux, France) as we previously described [15]. P. jirovecii DNA specimens were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further analysis. The study was non-interventional and did not require inform consents and ethical approval according to French laws and regulations (CSP Art L1121e1.1). Specimen collection was registered with the French Ministry of Research (No. DC-2008-214).", "2.3. P. jirovecii IMPDH Gene Analysis", "The IMPDH protein of Pneumocystis carinii (the rat-derived Pneumocystis species) (NCBI accession number AAA97462.1) [16] was used as the query sequence in a BLASTp search against P. jirovecii proteomes at https://www.uniprot.org/blast/ (accessed on 14 September 2021). A single putative ortholog was detected in each proteome available, i.e., one ortholog (UniProt identifier A0A0W4ZU90) in the proteome from Ma and colleagues (BioProject PRJNA223510) [17] and one ortholog (UniProt identifier L0P7N3) in the proteome from Cisse and colleagues (BioProject PRJEA68827) [18]. The P. jirovecii gene sequences encoding the IMPDH protein were then retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena, accessed on 14 September 2021). The impdh gene corresponds to the T551_00631 locus in the P.jirovecii genome assembly version Pneu-jiro_RU7_V2 (BioProject PRJNA223510) [17] and to the PNEJI1_002926 locus in the P.jirovecii genome assembly version ASM33397v2 (BioProject PRJEA68827) [18].", "Six primer pairs were designed using PrimerQuest\u00a9 software (Integrated DNA Technology, https://www.idtdna.com/Primerquest/Home/Index, accessed on 14 September 2021) in order to sequence the whole IMPDH gene, which is 2070 bp long. Primer specificity was checked using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi, accessed on 14 September 2021). Each primer pair amplifies a DNA fragment from 376 to 915 bp in size (Table S1). Each fragment partially spanned at least one other fragment (Figure S1). The six fragments of the impdh gene were amplified under the same PCR conditions. PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 \u00b5L containing 0.5 \u00b5M of reverse and forward primers, 3 mM MgCl2, 200 \u00b5M dNTPs (dNTP set, Eurogentec, Belgium) and 2 U of polymerase (HotGoldStar Diamond Taq\u00ae, Eurogentec, Belgium). Amplification was carried out with activation step at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles including denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 45 s and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. To avoid contamination, reagent preparations and amplification procedures were performed in separate rooms with different sets of micropipettes. Negative control was included in each PCR. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide to visualize the expected band sizes (Table S1). PCR products were purified and sequenced from the two strands with the dideoxy chain termination method on the ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (BigDye\u00ae terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit, Applied Biosystem, USA). Electropherograms were analysed using PreGap and Gap software (Staden package version 2.0.0b11-2016, Staden Group). The six fragments were assembled to create the consensus sequence of the impdh gene from each specimen. Nucleotide and protein sequences were aligned with the reference sequences retrieved from complete P. jirovecii genomes as described above using BioEdit software (Version 7.0.0, Thomas Hall, Ibis Biosciences, USA) with the Clustal\u00aeW program. The identification of putative IMPDH alleles was based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).", "Sequence logos were created using Weblogo application (https://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi, accessed on 14 September 2021) [19].", "The deduced IMPDH protein sequences of P. jirovecii were aligned with available IMPDH protein sequences of Pneumocystis carinii (Uniprot identifier A0A0W4ZEI8), Pneumocystis murina (Uniprot identifier M7NKD5), Candida albicans (Uniprot identifier Q59Q46 and GenBank accession number AAW65379.1), Meyerozyma guilliermondii (Uniprot identifiers A5DL50 and A5DLR4), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Uniprot identifiers P38697 and P50095), Penicillium brevicompactum (Uniprot identifier G4WT15) and Aspergillus nidulans (Aspergillus Genome Database identifier AN12478) using T-coffee [20]. These protein sequences were retrieved from Uniprot, GenBank and Aspergillus Genome databases (Table S2).", "2.4. Statistical Analysis", "Frequencies of P. jirovecii IMPDH alleles and potential mixed infections, which were defined by the presence of more than one allele in the same specimen, were compared in the two patient groups using Fisher\u2019s exact test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.", "2.5. Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number", "The nucleotide sequences of the impdh gene obtained in the present study have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers from MZ272376 to MZ272401."]
