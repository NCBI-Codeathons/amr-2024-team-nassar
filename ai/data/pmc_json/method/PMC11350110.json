["Materials and methods", "Sequences and BLAST", "The distributions of 12 antibiotic BGCs identified in Pantoea were assessed: agglomerin, andrimid, AGA, dapdiamide, herbicolin, PNP-1, PNP-2, PNP-3, PNP-4, PNP-5, pantocin A, and pantocin B (Table 1). BGCs were BLASTed against the non-redundant (nr) and whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) databases at NCBI1 using default blastn parameters (Supplementary Table 1). Standalone BLAST was also used for some incomplete and draft genomes using a word size of 11 with all other parameters set to default. Candidate BGCs that did not contain all of the genes found in the query cluster, or whose genes were not entirely syntenic relative to the query cluster were excluded. Also excluded were candidate BGCs that diverged by more than 60% nucleotide identity across the length of the query cluster. BGCs that met our thresholds, but were found across contigs in draft genomes were included in our analyses. The 5\u2009kb flanking each end of each cluster was also extracted and ORFs were predicted using GeneMark.hmm with Heuristic Models (Besemer and Borodovsky, 1999). Clinker (Gilchrist and Chooi, 2021) was used to visualize clusters, and to identify homologs between clusters. Parameters were set to default, with a 30% amino acid identity cut-off for this analysis.", "Reference antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters surveyed in this study.", "Cluster Strain Length (bp) Number of open reading frames References Accession number.", "Agglomerin P. agglomerans PB-6042 8,009 7 Kanchanabanca et al.
