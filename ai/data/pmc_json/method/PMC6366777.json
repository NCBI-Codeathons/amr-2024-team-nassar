["Materials and methods", "Mice", "C57BL/6 mice and B6.Rag2-GFP mice [30] were bred and maintained at the animal facility of the University Hospital Jena. At the end of the experiments mice were killed by cervical dislocation under CO2 anaesthesia. All animal experiments were approved by the appropriate governmental authority (Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz; Bad Langensalza, Germany; registration number 02\u2013007/14) and conducted in accordance with institutional and state guidelines: Efforts to alleviate suffering included regular inspection of the mice and the definition of humane enpoints according to institutional and state guidelines.", "Sepsis\u2013induction and treatment", "Sepsis was induced in mice by peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) as described previously [16,29]. Briefly, human stool samples from three healthy non-vegetarian donors were collected, prepared and stored at -80\u00b0C Composition and number of CFUs for the different pertinent strains after storage were determined by microbiologic analysis as described in detail in [29]. Animals were randomly allocated to the sepsis or sham group. Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 1.75 ml/kg body weight stool suspension, diluted (1:4) in saline. Control mice received the same volume of saline i.p. (sham group). Beginning at 7 hours after sepsis induction, the infected mice were treated with meropenem (12 mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.) twice daily for 3 days. They were evaluated for conjunctivitis, diarrhea, weakness and lack of movement. As expected [29], approximately 40\u201350% of the mice died within the acute phase (d1-5 post sepsis-induction) [16]. The following endpoints were defined and approved by the relevant authorities (Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz; Bad Langensalza, Germany registration number 02\u2013007/14): Lack of movement (even after touching), ascites, minimal signs of respiratory distress, severe conjunctivitis, severe diarrhea, cutaneous abscess (injection abscess). Once a mouse reached one of the defined endpoints it was immediately euthanized. No animals died before meeting criteria for euthanasia. Animal health and behavior was monitored at day of sepsis induction every 4 hours, the following 2 days every 6 hours and at all other days at least once a day. All people handling mice have had special training, either as professional animal care takers or\u2013upon successful completion of a mandatory training course\u2013a certification approved by the appropriate governmental authority (Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz; Bad Langensalza, Germany) registration number 02\u2013007/14). In total around 580 animals were used, 186 were euthanized, no found dead. Cause of death was always consequences of sepsis.", "On d5 the surviving mice were randomly allocated to receive IL-7 or no further treatment. Recombinant human IL-7 (R&D Systems), which is known to bind and signal via the mouse IL-7 receptor [31], was subcutaneously injected (2.5 \u03bcg/mouse/day) from d5 post sepsis induction for the following 6 days. In order to stabilize the cytokine, IL-7 was precipitated with a ten-fold higher concentration of an anti-human IL-7 antibody (clone M25; BioXCell) [32].", "Immunization with Aspergillus antigen", "The Aspergillus antigen gliotoxin sulfhydryl oxidase (GliT) was produced as described [33] and kindly provided by D.H. Scharf and O. Kniemeyer (Hans Kn\u00f6ll Institute, Jena). GliT is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin gliotoxin by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The protein was dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) / 50% glycerol. Mice were immunized subcutaneously with GliT in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA Sigma) at d30 after sepsis induction. One week later the mice were sacrificed, the spleens were harvested and the antigen-specific T cells analyzed.", "Cell culture and flow cytometry", "Spleens were isolated and single cell suspensions were obtained by passing through strainers (BD Falcon). Erythrocytes were lysed using ammonium chloride solution. Cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber. Absolute numbers of cell populations were calculated by multiplying the total spleen cell count with the frequency of the respective population as determined by flow cytometry.", "For flow-cytometric analyses, cells were stained with live/dead fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells were incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2, in house production) and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies directed against surface antigens, CD3 (clone 145-2C11, in house production), CD4 (clone GK1.5; eBioscience); CD8 (clone YTS169.4, in house production); CD62L (clone MEL14, in house production); CD154 (clone MR, Miltenyi Biotec) CD44 (clone IM7, BioLegend).", "GLiT-specific T cells were analyzed following stimulation of 1 x 107/ mL lymph node or spleen cells with 3\u03bcg/ml anti-mouse CD28 (clone 37.51) and 200\u03bcg/ml aspergillus antigen GLiT for 6 hours in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5%CO2. After 2 hours of incubation 1\u03bcl Brefeldin A (5\u03bcg/ml AppliChem A2138.0025) was added to each sample for the final 4 hours. GLiT-specific T cells were fixed in buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with buffer containing 0.5% saponin and stained with fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (MP6-XT22l; eBioscience), IL-17 (TC11-18H10.1; BioLegend), IFN\u03b3 (clone XMG1.2, Bio X Cell), IL-10 (clone JES5-16E3, BioLegend) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (MP1-22E9, eBioscience).", "Data from the samples were collected with a LSR II (BD Bioschiences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.). Cytokine-expressing cells were identified by hierarchical gating for living, living CD4+, and living CD4+CD154+ cells. Cytokine patterns among cells were analyzed by boolean gating on either TNF\u03b1 -positive cells or NOT-TNF\u03b1-positive cells and subsequent analysis of quadrant gating on IFN\u03b3 +IL-17-, IFN\u03b3 +IL-17+, IFN\u03b3 -IL-17+, or IFN\u03b3 -IL-17- cells.", "T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity analysis", "Mice were sacrificed and spleens were harvested. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Ambiom) from 107 unsorted spleen cells of every septic and sham mouse. mRNA was purified with Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep (ZymoResearch). Complementary (c)DNA synthesis was performed with M-MLV reverse Transcriptase (Affymetrix), RNasin Plus (Promega) and reverse transcriptase Primer (C1 segment of \u03b2-chain, Biotez) according to the manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. To generate templates for the High-throughput (HT) sequencing, the cDNA was amplified with primers spanning the whole complementarity-determining region (CDR)3 starting from 5\u00b4 V\u03b2 1,2,3,5,9,12\u20132,13\u20131,13\u20132,13\u20133,14,16,17,19,20,26 and from 3\u00b4 with the C1 segment of the \u03b2-chain (all primers were purchased from Biotez). Multiplex PCR was performed using a Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) and finally purified with agarose gel electrophoresis and a Gel DNA-Recovery Kit (Zymoresearch). Subsequently, the Nextera XT library preparation kit (Illumina) was used to generate a sequence ready library according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The library was run on a MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina) with a 300 cycle MiSeq reagent kit v2 (Illumina). Obtained sequences were annotated by IMMUNOGENETICS (IMGT). All downstream data analysis was done using in-house bash and R scripts (version 3.2.2), which are available upon request. First, only productive amino acid sequences were taken for further analysis. Clones were identified based on identical CDR3 sequences. In addition, all results were represented as percentages of productive reads to normalize between samples. For further calculations, samples were normalized to 50000 reads and analyzed using the library vegan (cran.r-project). Trimmed fastq-data and the products of R-script were uploaded to ArrayExpress (E-MTAB-7483).", "Statistic evaluation and graphs", "All data were statistically evaluated using SPSS. Comparisons involving multiple groups were analyzed in a two-stage procedure by one-way ANOVA. If the ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the groups (P < 0.05), all groups were further compared pairwise by Tukey's multiple comparison test. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM as indicated in the figure legends. All graphs were created by using SigmaPlot."]
