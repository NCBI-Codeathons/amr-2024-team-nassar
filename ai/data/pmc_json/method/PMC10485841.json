PEM was designed as a biomimetic medium to represent nutrient conditions during pea seed germination and was made as follows. Early Onward variety Pisum sativum seeds (approx. 100\u2009g) were washed three times with deionised water, and then suspended in ultrapure water made up to 500\u2009mL. Seeds were incubated in the dark with agitation (40\u2009rpm on a rocking platform) for 2 d at 22\u00b0C. After incubation, seed exudate was removed and filtered twice. First with a Whatman\u00ae glass microfibre GF/D grade filter to remove seed coat material, and second with a Whatman\u00ae glass microfibre GF/A grade filter to obtain a clear seed exudate.

In brief, bacterial strains were streaked onto 20\u2009mL BSMG or PEM agar plates in duplicate, and incubated for 3 d at 22\u00b0C. Following incubation bacterial growth was removed from the agar surface, and a 20\u2009mm diameter disc cut from the centre of the plate. The agar disc was placed into a 30\u2009mL wide-mouth amber glass bottle with 0.5\u2009mL dichloromethane and agitated on a rocking platform (40\u2009rpm) for 2\u2009h.

Detection of compounds was by absorbance at 210\u2013400 by a photo-diode array detector (PDA). Mobile phases consisted of (A) water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid with a flow rate of 1.5\u2009mL/min.

In brief, polyyne-producing bacterial strains were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in TSB, spotted (2.0\u2009\u03bcL bacteria) onto BSMG or PEM agar plates and incubated at 22\u00b0C for 3 d. Polyyne-producing bacteria were then killed by chloroform exposure for 3\u2009min, overlaid with susceptibility organism-seeded (0.4% [v/v] bacteria) half-strength iso-sensitest agar (Oxoid\u2122) and the overlay plate incubated at 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 24\u2009h.

After 24\u2009h incubation, a 5.0\u2009mm diameter plug of leading-edge growth of G. ultimum was placed in the centre of the four bacterial spots and the plates incubated again at 22\u00b0C for a further 48\u2009h.

Briefly, a fresh PDA plate (90\u2009mm diameter) was inoculated with a 5.0\u2009mm diameter PDA plug of G. ultimum, and incubated at 22\u00b0C for 3 d. The agar was cut into 1.0\u2009cm2 squares, added to 120\u2009g potting mix composed of 5-parts generic compost (Levington Advance Pot and Bedding M2; ICL UK) and 1-part sand (Horticultural Sharp Sand, Melcourt Industries Ltd), and incubated at 22\u00b0C for 3 d. The G. ultimum infested potting mix was combined with fresh potting mix to achieve a 0.25% (w/w) infested soil. Pisum sativum seeds were either planted in G. ultimum infested soil or control un-infested potting mix contained within recycled pipette tip boxes (Starlab (UK), Ltd.). Each treatment consisted of 16 pea seeds split between two boxes with 200\u2009g potting mix per box.", "Polyyne-producing bacterial seed coats were prepared by growing overnight liquid cultures in TSB at 30\u00b0C. Bacterial cultures were washed, resuspended, and concentrated in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). The concentrated bacterial suspension was diluted to allow optical density measurement on a spectrophotometer (Jenway 6300 Visible Spectrophotometer) and then adjusted to 5.0 OD600 nm, equivalent to approx. 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 cfu (colony forming units) mL\u22121. Seeds were submerged in the bacterial suspension resulting in a standardised coating of approximately 107 cfu\u2009ml\u22121 per seed (as demonstrated in Mullins et al., 2019), immediately planted, and watered with 30\u2009mL deionised water. Plants were grown at 22\u00b0C in propagators to maintain high humidity and placed in a Fitotron\u00ae plant growth chamber set at 16:8\u2009h photoperiod and 40% relative humidity for 14 d. All bacterial strains were assayed for biocontrol potential in a minimum of 2 experiments (at least 2\u2009\u00d7\u200916 seeds per treatment), along with uninoculated seeds (PBS only) and Burkholderia ambifaria BCC0191 coated seeds as controls in every experiment.

Following 7 d of growth, the seedlings were removed and the first 2\u2009cm segment of root from the seed was excised. This root section was macerated with a pestle in a 1.5\u2009mL Eppendorf tube with 1\u2009mL PBS and serially diluted in PBS.

P. sativum seeds were coated with B. ambifaria and grown in potting mix as described above or on Whatman\u00ae filter paper grade 1 soaked in ultrapure water. Following 3 d of growth the seedlings were removed and 1\u2009cm of root was excised, macerated, and pooled from three seedlings per treatment. Total RNA was extracted from the pooled samples using the FastRNA\u2122 Pro Soil-Direct Kit (MP Biomedicals) and DNase I (RNase-free; New England Biolabs) treated according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RT-PCR was performed using the OneTaq\u00ae One-Step RT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols.

RNA extracted from B. ambifaria BCC0191 grown on BSMG and molecular grade water (Severn Biotech Ltd.) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively."]
