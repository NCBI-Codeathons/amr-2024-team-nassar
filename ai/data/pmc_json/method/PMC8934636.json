["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Reagents", "Expression vector pBG102 (Supplementary Table S1) was obtained from the Vanderbilt University Center for Structural Biology. DNA oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S2) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. AlkA, AlkC, AlkD, AlkZ\u00a0and YcaQ were purified as previously described (28,29,38\u201340). E. coli EndoIV was purchased from New England BioLabs. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TXNA and LLD were isolated from S. bottropensis NRRL 12051 and S. vinaceusdrappus NRRL 15735, respectively, as described below.", "Sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis", "The 15,119 homologous proteins of AlkZ were obtained from the InterPro website (41) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence-search) by using AlkZ as the query. Sequences were then clustered by CD-HIT Suite (42) on the website (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi?cmd=cd-hit) with 53% sequence identity threshold. The representatives of the resulting clusters and TxnU2, TxnU4, LldU1, LldU5, AlkZ were used for construction of SSN by the online Enzyme Function Initiative-Enzyme Similarity Tool (43) with an alignment score threshold of 110. Cytoscape software was used to view the sequence similarity networks.", "Fermentation and isolation of TXNA and LLD", "For TXNA production, Streptomyces bottropensis NRRL 12051 and its relative mutant strains were cultivated as previously reported (44).

The fermentation and isolation of LLD was similar to TXNA (46). S. vinaceusdrappus NRRL 15735 and those mutants were cultivated in SYG medium for 10 days, and then isolated and detected by HPLC. HPLC analysis was performed on an Acclaim 120 C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250 mm) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and a linear gradient program: 0\u20135 min, 10% phase B (0.1% formic acid in CH3CN); 5\u201324 min, solvent B gradient from 10 to 90% followed with 90% B at 24\u201326 min; 26\u201327 min, gradient from 90 to 10% B; 27\u201331 min, constant 10% B.

The overnight cultures were then transferred to fresh LB medium supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/ml Kan and incubated at 30\u00b0C. When the OD600 reached 0.6, 0.1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce protein expression. After growing at 16\u00b0C for 2 h, cells were diluted to 0.01 OD600 in 2 ml fresh LB supplemented with Kan and IPTG. The dilutions were treated with various concentrations of TXNA for 12 h\u00a0at 30\u00b0C and cell density was measured by OD600. The surviving fraction (%) was calculated as (OD600(treated)/OD600(untreated))\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100.

Single- and multiple-turnover kinetics reactions shown in Figure 4G were performed with 50 nM (single turnover) or 5 nM (multiple turnover) TxnU4 and 50 nM Cy5-labeled TXNA-DNA. Thermal depurination controls shown in Figure 5A were conducted at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. Enzyme and mock reactions involving TXNA, LLD\u00a0and 7mG monoadducts were quenched by adding 1 \u03bcl of 1 M NaOH to a 4-\u03bcl reaction aliquot and heating at 70\u00b0C for 2 min.

Gels were imaged on a Typhoon Trio variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) for Cy5 fluorescence (633 nm excitation, 670 nm emission), and bands were quantified with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). Percent product was calculated as the percent of both \u03b2- and \u03b4-elimination bands divided by the total intensity of substrate and \u03b2/\u03b4-elimination bands. Unreacted DNA in LLD-DNA reactions was not included in the calculation of percent product. NM-ICLs reactions were performed the same as monoadducts, but were quenched and denatured at 55\u00b0C prior to electrophoresis.
