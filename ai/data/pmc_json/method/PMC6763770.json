["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Media.", "ISP2 medium (sporulation agar) consists of 0.4% yeast extract, 0.4% glucose, 1% malt extract, and 2% agar. T1 medium contains 1% glucose, 2% starch, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, and 0.4% CaCO3. JM medium consists of 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% MgCl2 (6H2O), 0.3% Tryptone Soya, and 10% sucrose. In all cases, the pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 prior to autoclaving. Luria-Bertani medium was used for the growth of Escherichia coli strains utilized for propagation of plasmids and for the preparation of ribosomes and cell extracts.", "Culture conditions of Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504.", "For the production and isolation of spores, Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 was grown in ISP2 medium for 7 to 10\u2009days at 28\u00b0C. The white aerial mycelium, consisting of spores, was stripped from the upper layer of the plate using a spatula and dispersed into 1\u2009ml of sterile water. The spore suspension was filtered through a wad of absorbent cotton, and the spores were concentrated by centrifugation at 4,000\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min.

Cells were collected by centrifugation, and genomic DNA was extracted using the Invisorb spin plant minikit (Invitek).", "DNA amplification and sequence of rpsL from Streptomyces sp.", "Oligonucleotide primers GSF1 and GSR1 (Table\u00a01), designed to cover the coding region of the rpsL gene from Streptomyces, were used to amplify by PCR the target gene using genomic DNA as the template. The DNA sequence of the amplicon, covering approximately 95% of the coding region, was analyzed to identify the amino acid variants carried by the antibiotic producer strain.", "Oligonucleotide primers used in this study", "Primer DNA sequence (5\u2032\u21923\u2032)a Target.", "Forward mutagenic primer CCGCAAAAACGTGGCACATGTACTCGTG Amino acid substitution Val32\u2192Thr32.", "Reverse mutagenic primer CACGAGTACATGTGCCACGTTTTTGCGG Amino acid substitution Val32\u2192Thr32.", "Forward mutagenic primer GTATGCCGTGTTAAACTGACTAACGGTTTCG Amino acid substitution Arg55\u2192Lys55.", "Reverse mutagenic primer CGAAACCGTTAGTCAGTTTAACACGGCATAC Amino acid substitution Arg55\u2192Lys55.", "Forward mutagenic primer CAGGAGCACTCCATAATCCTGATCCGTG Amino acid substitution Val78\u2192Ile78.", "Reverse mutagenic primer CACGGATCAGGATTATGGAGTGCTCCTG Amino acid substitution Val78\u2192Ile78.", "rpsL-specific forward primer (GSF1) GTGCCTACGATCCAGCAGCTG Streptomyces rpsL gene.", "rpsL-specific reverse primer (GSR1) TTACTTCTCCTTCTTGGCGCCG Streptomyces rpsL gene.", "The underlined nucleotides are the mutant triplet introduced by site-directed mutagenesis.", "Site-directed mutagenesis.", "Mutations in the E. coli\nrpsL gene were obtained using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) and, as the template for the PCR, the plasmid vector pET11a carrying the coding sequence of S12, derived from E. coli MC4100 (rpsL150 [Strr]). The DNA sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to introduce codon variants are indicated in Table\u00a01. E. coli DH5 cells were transformed with the mutagenized plasmids, and Sanger DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of mutated nucleotides.", "Preparation of E. coli and Streptomyces S30 cell extracts.", "E. coli MRE600 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in LB medium until they reached mid-log phase, while Streptomyces cells were grown at 28\u00b0C in T1 medium for 45\u2009h. Both cell types were disrupted by grinding with precooled alumina in a chilled mortar and processed following a previously described protocol (45). Both S30 extracts were extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 10\u2009mM Mg acetate, 60\u2009mM NH4Cl, and 0.5\u2009mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and stored in small aliquots at \u201380\u00b0C.", "Isolation of ribosomes and ribosomal subunits.", "The crude extract S30 was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 17 h at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant, called S100, was stored at \u201380\u00b0C, while the pellet, consisting of 70S ribosomes, was resuspended and split in two aliquots, one for in vitro assays and one for preparation of 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits. 70S ribosomes were dissociated into subunits at 1\u2009mM Mg2+ concentration by ultracentrifugation at 25,000\u2009rpm for 17h at 4\u00b0C in a swing bucket rotor (SW28), on a 10% to 30% sucrose density gradient (45).", "In vitro translation assays.", "Cell-free systems programmed with either poly(U) or 027 model mRNA were used to investigate the effect of dityromycin on the bacterial translational apparatus.

S100 extracts and 70S ribosomes (46).", "Ribosome pulldown assay.", "The binding of dityromycin to either Streptomyces or E. coli 30S ribosomal subunits was monitored by an ultracentrifugation-based assay.
