Materials and Methods Fermentation for PHTs producing Seed cells of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A and gene in-frame deletion mutants were cultured by LB medium at 28 °C. Cells were harvested and washed twice with equal volume of distilled water, then transferred into sucrose minimal medium and fermented at 18 °C for 72 hours for PHTs producing. In the feeding experiments, 0.5 mM authentic oligopeptides were fed in the fermentation process of phtU- and phtQ- mutants respectively. PHT biosynthesis related genes in-frame deletion and complementation PHTs native producer P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A genome Fosmid library was constructed with CopyControl™ Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre® Biotechnologies products) according to standard protocols36. Fosmid 7C6 with a 33.6 kb DNA insert which covers the complete PHT biosynthetic gene cluster and flanking sequence of 5.5 kb upstream and 3.3 kb downstream was screened out by PCR. Gene phtU of Fosmid 7C6 was replaced by Apramycin resistant gene aac(3)IV from plasmid pIJ773 by PCR targeting with primer pair DUF1/DUR2 (Table S1)37. Gene aac(3)IV was eliminated by FLP-recombinase mediated excision in E.coli DH5α/BT340 to generate a disruption cassette pWHU2001. Plasmids pWHU2001 were transferred into P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A cells by electroporation and single crossover recombinant strains resistant to chloramphenicol were picked up. The phtU gene in-frame deletion mutant strains CL001 resulted from double crossover were selected out by rounds of relaxation and chloramphenicol sensitivity tests and then validated by PCR with primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Figure S2A, S2B, Table S1). Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ and phtL in-frame deletion. Primer pair DQF1/DQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ PCR targeting and primer pair VQF1/VQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ- mutant strain CL002 PCR validation (Figure S2C, S2D). Primer pair DLF1/DLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL PCR targeting and primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL- mutant strain CL003 PCR validation (Figure S2E, S2F). To the gene complementation of phtU and phtQ in CL001 and CL002 strains, the constitutive promotor of gene phtA was employed to construct infusion genes PphtA-ORFphtU and PphtA-ORFphtQ. A 227 bp DNA fragment containing PphtA was amplified by PCR with primer pair PphtAF1/PphtAR2 (Table S1). The ORF region of gene phtU was amplified by PCR with primer pair PhtUF1/PhtUR2 (Table S1). These two fragments were insert into the BamHI site of a RK2-derived plasmid pRKaraRED to give recombinant plasmid pWHU2004. Transformation of pWHU2004 into phtU- mutant strain CL001 gave phtU gene complementation strain CL004. Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ complementation strain CL005 construction with the exception of that phtQ was amplified with primer pair PhtQF1/PhtQR2 (Table S1) and the recombinant plasmid was defined as pWHU2005. ArgK over-expression and enzyme assay Gene argK was amplified by PCR with primer pair OKF1/OKR2 (Table S1) and inserted into the BamHI/XhoI locus of vector pET28a. His·tag-ArgK fusion proteins were over-expressed and purified with standard protocol36. Authentic standards of L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg were purchased from Life Tein L.T.D. Company (Beijing) (Figure S3). Transcarbamylase enzyme assay were performed in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes with a system as 0.2 mg purified ArgK, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Lithium carbamoyphosphate dibasic hydrate, 1 mM L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg, 2 mM MgSO4 and 0.5 mM ATP, 200 μL in total. ArgK was absent in the negative control reactions while the other factors remained identical. The enzyme was removed from the reaction system with a 10 KDa centrifugal filter at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The residual sections were diluted to ten times volume of the original reaction system before injected into the HPLC-MS analyzer. HPLC-MS analysis Culture supernatants for PHTs and biosynthetic intermediates discovery were thirty times concentrated by rotovaping at room temperature and then cut by methanol with a final concentration of 90%. Samples were dried out by rotovaping and re-suspended in ddH2O for HPLC-MS analysis. A Thermo hypercarb column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, column temperature 30 °C) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min was employed in the HPLC section. The HPLC gradient was 0% solvent B (4 min), 0–40% solvent B (12 min), 40–100% solvent B (3 min), 100% solvent B (3 min), 100–0% solvent B (3 min), 0% solvent B (5 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in H2O and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN. High resolution MS analysis was carried out in a positive mode on a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL Orbitrap mass spectrometer as described previously38. PHTs samples from the culture supernatants of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A were used to build the MS fragmentation fingerprint of PHTs and desulfonated PHTs by selected ion reaction (SIR) method. Daughter ions with m/z ratio at 189 and 374 were recognized to be the characteristic fragments of PHTs. To screen for PHTs biosynthetic intermediates, PIS was performed in a positive mode on a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Access MAX instrument (monitoring m/z ratio at 189 and 374) equipped with a Thermo Scientific Accela 600 pump. Target ions were selected out for HR tandem MS analysis as described above to figure out the elemental compositions. Enzyme assay samples were analyzed on the TSQ instrument with a selected ion monitoring (SIM) scan mode with a range from m/z ratio at 360 to 430. Reaction products were double checked by HR tandem MS analysis on the Orbitrap instrument. NMR analysis 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of tripeptides L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg (20 mg) and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg (20 mg) were recorded on Agilent 400 MHz instrument in D2O, respectively (Figure S3). Culture supernatants of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A were cut by methanol and dried out as described above. Residues were re-suspended in ddH2O with 10% D2O and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on Agilent 400 MHz instrument. Bioassay of P. syringae 1448A against L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg To evaluate the toxicity of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg to PHT producers P. syringae 1448A, authentic tripeptide L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg was added to the culture media of 1448A. Two kinds of media, LB (Tryptone 10.0 g, Yeast extract 5.0 g and NaCl 5.0 g for 1 liter, pH 7.2) and MM (Sucrose 5.0 g, KH2PO4 2.0 g, (NH4)2HPO4 2.0 g, MgSO4·7H2O 1.0 g, FeSO4·7H2O 0.01 g and MnSO4 0.01 g for 1 liter, pH 7.2), were employed in the assay. Two kinds of compound concentrations, 1 mM and 10 mM, were tested respectively. The OD600 value of bacterial cultures at different time points was monitored by a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer.
