["Materials and methods", "Bioinformatics tools", "BLAST searches were performed using the standard BlastP (RRID:SCR_001010) program with the JadL amino acid sequence as input (GenBank: CCA59275.1). Searches excluded environmental and non-cultured strains. BlastP searches were also conducted against the data set from the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB, RRID:SCR_004490). Predictions for transmembrane domains were performed using the constrained consensus TOPology prediction server (CCTOP, http://cctop.enzim.ttk.mta.hu).", "Strain maintenance and growth", "Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 (ATCC10712) spores were maintained as solutions in 25% glycerol at \u221270\u00b0C (Kieser et al., 2000). For natural product productions, S. venezuelae strains were maintained at 30\u00b0C on maltose yeast malt extract (MYM, maltose 0.4% w/v, yeast extract, 0.4% w/v, malt extract 1% w/v, pH 7.0) agar for 1\u20132 weeks before inoculation in MYM broth. Media was supplemented with 50 \u03bcgmL\u22121 apramycin for disruption strains.", "Construction of the jadL disruption mutant: S. venezuelae VS678 (\u0394jadL::aac(3)IV)", "A 4 kb DNA fragment containing jadL, a SacI digest product from lambda clone LH7 (Han et al., 1994), was ligated into SacI linearized pHJL400 (Larson and Hershberger, 1986) to give pJV105A and pJV105B, in which inserts are oppositely oriented. pJV105A was digested with NcoI, situated 722 bp after the jadL start codon, and ligated with an apramycin resistance cassette bearing flanking NcoI sites to produce the disruption (jadL::aaa(3)IV) vector pJV106. S. venezuelae ISP5230 protoplasts, prepared as described elsewhere (Yang et al., 1995; Kieser et al., 2000), were transformed with pJV106, regenerated on R5N agar (Aidoo et al., 1990) and overlaid with soft nutrient agar containing thiostrepton (25 \u03bcgmL\u22121) after 10 h. Transformants were patched to MYM agar containing thiostrepton (25 \u03bcgmL\u22121) then replica plated to MYM containing apramycin (50 \u03bcgmL\u22121). Single crossover mutants, resistant to both thiostrepton and apramycin, were patched to MYM containing apramycin and carried through three rounds of sporulation. After this time, colonies with the appropriate phenotype for double crossover mutants, i.e., resistance to apramycin and sensitivity to thiostrepton, were screened by PCR. PCR screening to confirm insertion of the apramycin disruption cassette used a primer pair flanking jadL: PL-for 5\u2032-ACCTTCGCCGAGTACGAGTC-3\u2032 and PL-rev 5\u2032-TGTGCGACAGCGAGAAG-3\u2032. Primers used to determine the orientation of the apramycin resistance gene were PApr-for 5\u2032-TGCTGGTCCACAGCTCCTTC -3\u2032 and PApr-rev5\u2032-GAGCGGCATCGCATTCTTC-3\u2032. All PCR reactions were performed using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biosciences) and were supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide with reaction conditions following manufacturer protocols. Template genomic DNA was isolated from overnight S. venezuelae cultures (MYM, 30\u00b0C, 250 rpm) using standard commercial kits.", "Culture conditions for jadomycin DS (JdDS) production", "Standard jadomycin production protocols were followed (Jakeman et al., 2006) with d-serine as sole amino acid in the production medium ensuring biosynthesis of JdDS. A 1 cm2 patch of cells was harvested from 1 to 2 week old MYM-agar plates, with 50 \u03bcgmL\u22121 apramycin for disruption strains, and used to inoculate MYM without antibiotics. The inoculum was shaken (250 rpm) at 30\u00b0C for 18\u201320 h. The cells were then harvested (5,000 rpm), the supernatant decanted, and the cells washed with minimal salt media [MSM, MgSO4 0.4 g/L, MOPS 1.9 g/L, salt solution (1% w/v NaCl, 1% w/v CaCl2) 9 mL/L, FeSO4-7H2O (0.2% w/v stock solution) 4.5 ml/L, trace mineral solution (ZnSO4\u00b77H2O 880 mg/L, CuSO4\u00b75H2O 39 mg/L, MnSO4\u00b74H2O 6.1 mg/L, H3BO3 5.7 mg/L, and (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O 3.7 mg/L) 4.5 ml/L, pH 7.5] twice. Cells suspended in MSM were used to inoculate fresh MSM supplemented with d-serine (60 mM), dextrose (33 mM), and phosphate (50 \u03bcM) to an initial OD600 ~0.6. Ethanol was added to the culture media to a final concentration of 30 \u03bcL per 1 mL media. Ethanol shocked cultures were shaken (250 rpm) at 30\u00b0C for 52 h. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the OD600 at the indicated time intervals by withdrawing 600 \u03bcL aliquots from each of triplicate cultures; A526 measurements were recorded using the corresponding clarified aliquots. Absorbance data was plotted with GraphPad Prism 6.02 software.", "Isolation of JdDS and analysis of natural product profile", "All solvents used for natural product purification were high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade. After incubation for 52 h, jadomycin production cultures (50 mL) were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 rpm). The supernatant was passed through 0.22 \u03bcM Millipore filters. Clarified culture media was passed through a 2 g Silica-phenyl column (Si-Ph, Silicycle) to which the jadomycins bind tightly. The column was washed with water, until the flow through was colorless, and HPLC-grade methanol was used to elute compounds bound to the column. After concentration by evaporation (Genevac EZ-Bio personal evaporator), the mass of the crude extract was determined. Analysis of the natural products produced by each strain was performed by analytical HPLC, using a previously described method (Robertson et al., 2016), and by thin layer chromatography (TLC), using glass-backed silica plates plates (SiliCycle, 250 \u03bcM, F254 silica) and 5:5:1 ethyl acetate: acetonitrile:water as the eluent. Crude material was solubilized in methanol for TLC analysis. Visualization reagents were not required as jadomycins are deeply colored.", "Quantification of JdDS by LCMS2", "The concentration of JdDS produced by each of the wildtype and S. venezuelae VS678 strains was quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (LCMS). A purified sample of JdDS was used to construct a calibration curve. Electrospray ionization in positive mode (ESI+) LCMS experiments were run using an HPLC (Agilent 1100) equipped with a reversed phase column (Phenomenex Kinetic 2.6 \u03bcM Hilic, 150 \u00d7 2.1 mm) coupled to a hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, 2,000 Qtrap). LCMS instrumentation and running conditions have been described elsewhere (Robertson et al., 2016). The following settings were applied for the acquisition of enhanced product ion scan (EPI) experiments: capillary voltage +4,500 kV, declustering potential +80 V, and curtain gas 10 (arbitrary units). To construct the standard curve, EPI experiments with 5 \u03bcL injections of purified JdDS at 2, 5, 10, and 15 \u03bcM in methanol were collected with m/z [M+H]+ m/z 524 as the parent ion. In the resulting spectra, the area beneath the peak for the parent ion at m/z 524 and for the fragment ion at m/z 394 were determined by integration using the LCMS software (Applied Biosystems, Analyst version 1.4.1). The relationship between JdDS concentration (\u03bcM) and area (unitless) was solved using linear regression. Crude samples (from the Si-Ph column methanol extract) were taken up in 1 mL methanol, then diluted 200-fold by serial dilution. After LCMS2 analysis, the intensities under the m/z 524 and 394 peaks were used to determine the concentration of JdDS using the linear relationship described above. An average of the values obtained from each curve was used to calculate the total amount of JdDS per 50 mL bacterial culture."]
