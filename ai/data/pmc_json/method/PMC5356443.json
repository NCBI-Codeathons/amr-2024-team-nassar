["Material and methods", "Protein expression", "Expression plasmids pEX-N-GST-GtmA (OriGene) and pET19 m-GtmA (modified pET19b, Novagen) were freshly transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and subsequently used for pre-culture inoculation in lysogenic broth (LB) supplemented with 100 mg l\u22121 ampicillin. Large-scale production of the native protein was carried out in terrific broth including the required antibiotics. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 120 rpm until optical density reached 0.6\u20130.8 followed by a temperature reduction to 20\u00b0C. The induction of heterologous gene expression was performed by incubating with 500 \u00b5M IPTG for another 20 h.

After an additional 15 min incubation 60 mg l\u22121\nl-seleno-methionine and 500 \u00b5M IPTG were added to the cells and the culture was further incubated at 20\u00b0C for 20 h.", "Protein purification", "The cells were diluted with lysis buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4 pH 8.0; 300 mM NaCl; 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 1 \u00b5g ml\u22121 pepstatin A and 300 \u00b5M lysozyme), subsequently lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (AVESTIN) and centrifuged for 30 min at 30 000g and 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was applied onto a HisTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare Life Science) loaded with 100 mM nickel sulfate equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Na2HPO4 pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole). Contaminating proteins were washed from the column with buffer A until absorption at 280 nm reached the baseline. Elution of GtmA was performed by using a linear gradient over 20 column volumes (CV) to a final concentration of 100% buffer B (buffer A with 200 mM imidazole). To remove the affinity tag, TEV-protease cleavage was carried out with a 1 : 40 molar ratio (protease to protein) overnight at 4\u00b0C during dialysis against buffer C (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4; 50 mM NaCl). The cleaved GtmA was separated from the protease and the affinity tag with a second nickel-loaded HisTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare Life Science) using buffer C and buffer D (buffer C with 200 mM imidazole). The flow through was collected, concentrated and applied to an S200 26/60 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare Life Science) equilibrated with buffer C.

An additional ion exchange chromatography step using a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare Life Science) equilibrated in buffer \u2018low salt\u2019 (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.5, 20 mM NaCl) was used to separate the TEV protease and residual GST from GtmA.

The samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h prior to RP-HPLC analysis. For GtmA activity analysis under SAM limiting conditions, a range of SAM concentrations between 100 and 400 \u00b5M were used. For these experiments, reaction mixtures were directly injected onto the RP-HPLC column without quenching in order to ensure that enzyme-bound gliotoxin-ligands were not released. For Km determination, substrates (either dithiol gliotoxin or MmGT) from 31.25\u2013750 \u00b5M were separately combined with SAM (1.5 mM) and mixed at 37\u00b0C, in duplicate. GtmA (10 \u00b5M final) was added and mixed rapidly, and reactions were stopped after 15 s by addition of TCA to 15% (w/v).

All diffraction data were indexed and integrated with XDS [41] and scaled with AIMLESS from the CCP4 package [42]. For the Se-SAD data, the AUTOSOL [43,44] routine of the PHENIX software suite [43] was used to generate experimental phases and to build the structure. The resulting model was used for rigid body refinement in phenix.refine to solve the structure of native GtmA. The SAM complex structure was solved with MR-Yb-SAD by using the apo structure as model in PHASER [43,45], built with AUTOBUILD [43,46] and finally used to solve the SAH complex with PHASER [45].

In order to determine KD-values for GtmA and SAM under oxidizing and reducing conditions, 10 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG; oxidizing conditions) or 10 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, reducing conditions) was added to the labelling buffer. The experiments were performed using a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument with standard (for non-binding molecules) capillaries at 22\u00b0C, 20% LED power and 40% MST power. For KD determination, experiments were executed in triplicate. The response value was averaged and plotted against the concentration of the ligands.
