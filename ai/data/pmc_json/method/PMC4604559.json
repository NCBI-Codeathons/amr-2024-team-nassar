["Methods", "Lichen studies", "Lichen (Heterodermia obscurata (Nyl.) trevis) was collected from Yunnan province, People\u2019s Republic of China. The lichen thallus was sterilised and cut transversely or longitudinally into sections for CLSM observation. Longitudinal z-stack observations were acquired using 30 confocal sections that covered the entire depth of the lichen. PQs produced by the endolichenic fungus identified as Phaeosphaeria sp25. were excited by 488\u2009nm lasers and recorded in an emission spectrum of 400\u2013603\u2009nm for yellow fluorescence and 603\u2013700\u2009nm for red fluorescence. Fixed maximum-intensity projections and stacks of images were generated with Zeiss 2010 software. Phaeosphaeria sp. was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates in dark or under light irradiation. Each day, the growth of the colonies was recorded by imaging. After 7 days, a sample of the organisms was scraped from the colonies under light irradiation and suspended in PBS solution for CLSM observation with a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. The samples were also stained with BODIPY at a final concentration of 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml for confocal microscopic observations. BODIPY and PQs were excited by 488\u2009nm and 555\u2009nm lasers, respectively, and recorded in an emission spectrum of 490\u2013550\u2009nm for green fluorescence and 570\u2013700\u2009nm for red fluorescence.", "Measurement of singlet oxygen production generated by HA in different solvents", "The amount of 1O2 was measured using 9,10-diphenylanthracene, which specifically reacts with 1O2 to form an endoperoxide accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 355\u2009nm, indicating the production of 1O247. Briefly, HA was dissolved in petroleum ether, liquid paraffin and n-heptane (3:1), n-heptane, dichloromethane, chloroform or acetone, at a final concentration of 4\u2009\u03bcg/ml and separated into two groups.
