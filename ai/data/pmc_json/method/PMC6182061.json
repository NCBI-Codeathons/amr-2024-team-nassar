The cultures were sub-cultured every 3 days.", "Isolation of SfTop1 gene", "Total RNA was extracted from Sf9 cells using the total RNA isolation system kit (Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated RNA was reversely transcribed to first-strand cDNA with reverse transcriptase M-MLV (TaKaRa, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was used as a template for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) following a general protocol. The forward prime (5\u2032-ATGAGTGTCGAAAATCCC-3\u2032) and the reverse prime (5\u2032-TTAGAAGATATATTCCGGACC-3\u2032) were designed according to the transcriptome sequencing data (Shu et al., 2017) and applied to the amplification of the entire coding region of the Sf 9Top1 gene. The gene targeting was carried out using Primerstar HS DNA Polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China), with an initial denaturation step of 98\u00b0C for 3 min and followed by 35 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 55\u00b0C for 5 s and 72\u00b0C for 3 min. A final step for 10 min at 72\u00b0C was used to extend the amplicons fully. The PCR products were checked on a 1.2% agarose gel and purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Omega, Norcross, GA).

The exponentially grown Sf9 cells were collected and then diluted with fresh culture medium.

The homology modeling module in Discovery Studio 2017 (DS 2017) (Dassault Syst\u00e8mes BIOVIA, 2016) was employed to build the Sf Top1 structure. The sequence of Sf Top1 was first aligned to the template protein based on their structural similarity using the structure alignment method in the MODELER program (Sali and Blundell, 1993). The nucleic acid chains and ligand were copied from the template structure, and the number of models with a high optimization level was set to 20. Other parameters were set to the default value. Furthermore, the structure that had the lowest probability density function (PDF) energy (Sali and Blundell, 1993) and DOPE score (Shen and Sali, 2006) was selected as the candidate model and optimized by conjugate gradient (Press et al., 1987) to remove the steric overlap that produces bad contacts. The final model was further assessed using the Verify Protein (Profiles-3D) and Ramachandran Plot protocol (Lovell et al., 2003).", "Molecular simulations", "The Sf Top1-DNA structure model was prepared using the Prepare Protein protocol. The binding site was defined from the current ligand. The target compounds were minimized using the CHARMm forcefield with 2000 steps of the steepest descent algorithm at an RMS gradient of 0.1 kcal/(mol \u00d7 \u00c5) and followed by using 2000 steps of the conjugate gradient at an RMS gradient of 0.01 kcal/(mol \u00d7 \u00c5). All of the minimized compounds were docked into the binding site using a CHARMm-based CDOCKER protocol (Wu et al., 2003) in DS 2017. In this process, 30 random conformations were generated in high temperature (1000 K) with a dynamics step of 1000 and translated into the binding site. The docking results were then displayed as non-bond interactions between the receptor and ligands. The best scoring pose was selected for further analysis. The binding free energy (Tirado-Rives and Jorgensen, 2006) was estimated between each ligand and receptor by using CHARMm based implicit solvation models. The pharmacophore model was also constructed based on the binding model of camptothecin under the Pharmacophore Generation protocol in DS2017.", "The best-scoring configuration of Sf Top1-DNA in complex with the ligand 4j was selected for molecular dynamics simulation (MDs). The AMBER ff03 force field (Duan et al., 2003) implemented by Sorin and Pande (2005) in the GROMACS MD package (Pronk et al., 2013) version 2016.4 was used as the parameters for proteins and ions. Meanwhile, the general AMBER force field (GAFF) (Wang et al., 2004) and AMBER ff03 force field were used as the parameters for the ligand and nonstandard residues using parmchk2 program in AmberTools18 (Case et al., 2018). In order to obtain the partial atomic charges of the compound and nonstandard residues, the stable structure was determined through the geometry optimization at the HF/6-31g(d) level of theory with Gaussian09 program (Frisch et al., 2009). Subsequently, the electrostatic potential (ESP) charges were calculated with the same method and basis set, followed by the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting (Cieplak et al., 1995). The topologies have been created using tleap with the AMBER ff03 force field, and have been then converted in the GROMACS format using Acpype (Sousa da Silva and Vranken, 2012). The complex have been immersed in a rhombic dodecahedron box and further solvated with TIP3P water molecules (Jorgensen et al., 1983), and then neutralized by adding Na+ counter-ions via the genion tool of the GROMACS package. The final super script system being composed by 154,134 atoms. The simulations have been then carried out using Gromacs. Electrostatic interactions have been taken into account by means of the Particle Mesh Ewald method (Cheatham et al., 1995) and the bond lengths and angles have been constrained using the LINCS algorithm (Ryckaert et al., 1977). The system has then been simulated for 50 ns with a time step of 2.0 fs at a constant temperature of 300 K using the Berendsen's method (Berendsen et al., 1984) with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps during sampling, while pressure was kept constant at 1 bar using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (Parrinello and Rahman, 1981) with a coupling constant of 1.0 ps during sampling. Standard analyses, as root mean square deviations (RMSD) and fluctuations (RMSF) evaluations were calculated using tools of GROMACS package.

An acetone: water solution containing DMSO (0.2%) was used as the negative control. Fifteen fresh taro dishes (2 cm in diameter) were dipped in the target solution for 10 s, followed by air-drying and were then transferred into a Petri dish containing 20 starved larvae.
