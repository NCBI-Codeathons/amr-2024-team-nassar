["Methods", "Bacterial Strains and Growth", "S. pneumoniae R6 (ATCC number, BAA-255), which was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, was used as a source of chromosomal DNA. S. pneumoniae was grown in brain heart infusion (BHI, Difco) at 37\u00b0C for 16 hr\u223c24 hr without shaking. E. coli KAM32 (\u0394acrB, \u0394ydhE) [32], a drug-hypersusceptible strain, was used as a cloning host. E. coli was grown aerobically in LB broth at 37\u00b0C.", "Cloning of the pdrM Gene", "Chromosomal DNA was prepared from S. pneumoniae R6 by the method of Berns and Thomas [36]. Chromosomal DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI, and fragments ranging in size from 3 to 10 kbp were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Plasmid pHY300PLK (Takara Co.) was digested with BamHI, dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics K.K.), and then ligated to chromosomal DNA fragments with a Ligation-Convenience Kit (Nippon Gene Co.). Competent E. coli KAM32 cells were transformed with recombinant plasmids and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h on LB plates containing an antimicrobial agent. We also used 10 \u00b5g/ml erythromycin and 10 \u00b5g/ml tetraphenylphosphonium chloride to clone drug efflux pump genes, but could not isolate any candidates. We isolated eight candidates from a plate containing 5 \u00b5g/ml acriflavine. Single colonies were isolated on the same medium as the selection medium, and plasmids were extracted from cells. E. coli KAM32 was re-transformed with the plasmids to confirm that it was responsible for the observed resistance to the antimicrobial agent used for the selection. Subsequently, restriction maps of candidate plasmids were determined.", "PCR Cloning of Putative MATE Efflux Pump Genes", "The pdrM gene was also cloned by PCR to compare its activity with the products of spr1756 and spr1877 under the same promoter. A DNA fragment containing the pdrM, spr1756, or spr1877 gene was amplified by PCR using S. pneumoniae R6 chromosomal DNA as a template. Primers used for gene cloning are listed in Table S1. The amplified DNA fragment containing each gene was ligated into BamHI sites of pSTV29 (Takara Co.) or pUC19.", "Drug Susceptibility Test", "The MICs of various antimicrobial agents were determined by the microdilution method according to the recommendations of the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, 1990). Briefly, MICs were determined in Mueller\u2013Hinton broth (Difco) containing each compound in a twofold serial dilution series. About 104 cells were inoculated in each well of a microtiter plate, incubated in the test medium at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, and growth was examined visually. The MIC of each compound was defined as the lowest concentration that prevented visible growth.", "Energy Starvation and Loading Fluorescent Substance", "E. coli KAM32 harboring the recombinant plasmid was grown in LB medium at 37\u00b0C until OD650\u22480.8. Cells were harvested and washed twice with modified Tanaka buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2 mM MgSO4\n[37]. Cells were resuspended in this buffer containing acriflavine (final concentration: 4.2 \u00b5M) or 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, final concentration: 5 \u00b5M). Then, in order to load fluorescent dye into the cells, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2.5 hr in the presence of 100 \u00b5M carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Control cells and pdrM-possessing cells were normalized according to cell density and fluorescent intensity. By initially adjusting the cell density of control and sample cells, the fluorescent intensity was roughly adjusted. Then the fluorescent intensity was slightly adjusted last before the assay.", "Efflux of Fluorescent Substance", "Efflux of acriflavine or DAPI was carried out as previously described [32], [38]. Energy starved and fluorescent dye -loaded cells were washed three times with 0.1 M 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (MOPS)- tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) (pH 7.0) containing 2 mM MgSO4 and the appropriate concentration of fluorescent dye (4.2 \u00b5M acriflavine or 5 \u00b5M DAPI), and were resuspended in the same buffer. Fluorometric measurements were performed at 37\u00b0C with a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths used for the acriflavine efflux assay were 468 nm and 499 nm, respectively, whilst 332 nm and 462 nm were used for the DAPI efflux assay. After preincubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 min, lactate-TMAH (pH 7.0) (final concentration 20 mM) was added to energize the cells, and then NaCl, LiCl, or KCl (final concentration 10 mM) was added to the assay mixture.", "Acriflavine Efflux from Cells Induced by an Artificial Inward Na+ Gradient", "Based on our previous report, accelerated acriflavine efflux was measured by generating a transient Na+ gradient [30]. Energy-starved and fluorescent dye -loaded cells were washed three times with 0.1 M MOPS-TMAH (pH 7.0) containing 2 mM MgSO4 and 4.2 \u00b5M acriflavine, and were resuspended in the same buffer. Buffer containing NaCl or KCl (final concentration 100 mM) was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 min to draw a base line. Then, prepared cells were added to the incubating buffer to make cells impose an inward Na+ gradient and acriflavine fluorescence at 499 nm was monitored with excitation at 468 nm.", "Efflux of Na+ Induced by Addition of Acriflavine", "Na+ efflux by the addition of acriflavine was observed as previously described [30]. Briefly, E. coli KAM32 harboring recombinant plasmids were grown in modified Tanaka medium [37] supplemented with 1% tryptone, 5 mM MgSO4, and 10 mM melibiose at 30\u00b0C [39]. Cells were harvested at the late-exponential phase of growth, and washed three times with 0.1 M MOPS-TMAH (pH 7.0) containing 5 mM MgSO4, and were resuspended in the same buffer. A portion of this suspension was diluted to approximately 9 mg protein/ml in the same buffer containing 250 \u00b5M NaCl.", "Cells were incubated at 25\u00b0C in a plastic vessel with rapid stirring, and N2 gas was blown continuously to maintain anaerobic conditions. A Na+-electrode (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) and reference electrode were put into the vessel [40]. Methyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (M\u03b2gal), a substrate of the melibiose transporter, which is coupled to Na+ efflux [41], was added (final concentration of 5 mM) to induce Na+ uptake into cells. Thereafter, acriflavine was added to the assay mixture (final concentration, 200 \u00b5M). Changes in the Na+ concentration of the assay medium were monitored with a Na+ electrode. Calibration was carried out by the addition of known amounts of NaCl.", "Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis", "Total RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc.) from S. pneumoniae R6 cultures grown in BHI broth until the exponential phase. For efficient RNA extraction, cells were broken well with a QIA shredder (QIAGEN Inc.) prior to RNA extraction. The extracted total RNA was applied to RT-PCR with the QIAGEN One-Step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Table S1. PCR without the reverse-transcriptase reaction was performed to confirm no detectable DNA contamination. RT-PCR products were analyzed by 3% Agarose X (Nippon Gene Co.) gel electrophoresis.", "Gene Disruption in Bacillus subtilis", "Bacillus subtilis 168, RIK356, RIK482, and RIK483 were kind gifts from Prof. Kawamura in Rikkyo University, College of Science. B. subtilis strains were cultured aerobically in LB broth at 37\u00b0C. A GMM agar plate (0.6% KH2PO4, 1.4% K2HPO4, 0.2% (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Na citrate 2 H2O, 0.5% glucose, 0.02% MgSO4, 1.5% agar) was used to select a strain using the auxotrophic phenotype [42]. The following concentrations of antibiotics were added when needed: kanamycin (final concentration 5 \u00b5g/ml), erythromycin (final concentration 0.5 \u00b5g/ml), chloramphenicol (final concentration 10 \u00b5g/ml), and tetracycline (final concentration 10 \u00b5g/ml). Gene disruption on B. subtilis was performed according to the method by Ochi et al [43]. Primers used for gene disruption were shown in Table S1."]
