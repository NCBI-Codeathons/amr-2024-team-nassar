["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Protein expression and purification", "The gene for North American bullfrog, R. catesbeiana, Sxph (GenBank: U05246.1), including its N-terminal secretory sequence, was codon-optimized and synthesized by GenScript. The Sxph gene was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII multiple cloning sites of pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) in frame with a C-terminal 3C protease cleavage site, followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a His10 tag. Bacmids and baculovirus were generated following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Bac-to-Bac, Invitrogen). P2 baculovirus was used for transduction at dilution of 1:40 into Sf9 cells at cell density of 2 \u00d7 106 cells ml\u22121 in ESF921 media (Expression Systems). Cells were grown for 72 hours after transduction, and the expressed Sxph-GFP fusion protein was secreted into the growth media. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was adjusted to pH 8.0 with a final concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCl and treated with 1 mM NiCl2 and 5 mM CaCl2 to precipitate contaminants. Precipitants were removed by centrifugation, and the clarified supernatant was incubated with anti-GFP nanobody-conjugated sepharose beads (55, 56) for 5 hours at room temperature. Beads were washed with 20 column volumes of a buffer containing 300 mM NaCl and 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). On-column cleavage of the GFP-His tag was achieved by incubating with 3C protease (0.1 mg ml\u22121) (57) overnight at 4\u00b0C.Cleaved sample was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4).", "Crystallization and structure determination", "Purified Sxph was exchanged into a buffer of 10 mM NaCl and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and then concentrated to 65 mg ml\u22121 using a 50-kDa molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore) for crystallization screening by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4\u00b0C using a 2:1 ratio of protein to screening solution. Apo-Sxph was crystallized from solution containing 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 5% PEG 8000, and 40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Addition of 0.5% \u03b2-dodecyl maltoside or 10 mM sodium bromide to the crystallization solution further improved crystal quality of apo-Sxph. Crystals of the Sxph:STX complex were obtained by soaking STX (final concentration, 1 mM) into apo crystals for 5 hours before freezing. For cocrystallization, STX was added to Sxph in a molar ratio of 1.1:1 STX:Sxph. The sample was then incubated on ice for 1 hour before setting up crystallization. X-ray datasets for apo-Sxph and the Sxph:STX complex were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1 (Berkeley, CA) processed with XDS (58) and scaled and merged with Aimless (59). The apo-Sxph structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser from PHENIX (60) and the N-lobe of human serum transferrin (PDB: 1D4N) (61) as a search model. The resulting electron density map was further improved by rigid body refinement using phenix.refine and density modification using RESOLVE (62). The placed starting model was then subjected to model morphing in PHENIX using the prime-and-switch map generated from density modification (63). The morphed model thus allowed subsequent manual model building into the prime-and-switch map in COOT (64). Iterative model building, refinement, density modification, and model morphing allowed the apo-Sxph N-lobe and C1 domain to be built and refined (R-free of 31.7%) but left poor-quality electron density for the entire C2 domain. The feature-enhanced map (FEM) option (65) was applied in PHENIX to aid model building of the Sxph C2 domain. The C2 domain of rabbit serum transferrin (PDB: 1JNF) (41) was used as a starting model and placed into the FEM by rigid-body fitting. Subsequent model rebuilding and refinement were performed in COOT (64) and phenix.refine (60). The structure of the Sxph:STX complex was determined by molecular replacement using apo-Sxph as the search model in Phaser (60). Model building and refinement were carried out using COOT (64) and phenix.refine (60).", "STX synthesis", "STX was synthesized, purified, and validated as described in (66)."]
