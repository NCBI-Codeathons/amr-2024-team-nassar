["Materials and methods", "Strains, plasmids, and growth conditions", "Streptomyces sp. CB03234-S [11] was used in this study. The strains and plasmids used or constructed in this study, as well as all designed primers, are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (Supplementary Material). CB03234-S and related mutants were grown on Gauze\u2019s medium (G1) at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for sporulation. Tryptic soy broth (TSB) was used as the seed medium. Optimal production (OP) medium (15\u00a0g/L soluble starch, 15\u00a0g/L yeast extract, 2\u00a0g/L CaCO3, 0.1\u00a0g/L CuSO4\u20225H2O, 5\u00a0mg/L NaI, 1% w/w Diaion HP20 resins) was used for liquid fermentation. E. coil DH5\u03b1 was used for cloning and S17-1 was used for intergeneric conjugation with CB03234-S. Mannitol soya flour solid medium was used for intergeneric conjugation. Antibiotics (40\u00a0mg/L nalidixic acid, 50\u00a0mg/L apramycin, 60\u00a0mg/L streptomycin, 25\u00a0mg/L thiostrepton, or 50\u00a0mg/L kanamycin) were added as required. All common biological and chemical reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources.", "Genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of CB03234-S", "CB03234-S was cultivated in TSB medium at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 36\u00a0h. Mycelia were collected, washed with ddH2O, and sent to Biomarker Technologies Corporation (Beijing, China) for genome sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. High-quality clean reads were mapped onto the CB03234 reference genome (NCBI accession Number: NZ_LIYH00000000). The annotation of secondary metabolite BGCs in the sequenced genome of CB03234-S (Table S3) was performed using antiSMASH 5.0 software [28]. RNA sequencing data of CB03234 and CB03234-S from our previous study [29] were analyzed herein, and the raw sequencing reads were uploaded to the sequencing read archive (NCBI accession: PRJNA530700). Gene expression was normalized as fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The expression level of the internal housekeeping gene hrdB (encoding the principal sigma factor of RNA polymerase) was used as a reference to normalize the expression of target genes from different competitive BGCs, and heat maps were drawn using Log2 (target gene/hrdB) transformed data.", "Inactivation of competitive BGCs in CB03234-S", "Genetic manipulation of CB03234-S was carried out according to previously described procedures [30]. The core genes of seven competitive BGCs (Table S4) were deleted individually via homologous recombination. To construct a gene-knockout plasmid, regions approximately 2\u00a0kb upstream and downstream of the target gene, as well as the 810\u00a0bp thiostrepton resistance gene (tsr), were amplified using the high-fidelity Golden PCR Mix TSE101 (Tsingke Biotech. Co., Changsha, China). These DNA fragments were fused together and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pOJ260 using the Trelief SoSoo Cloning Kit (Tsingke). The resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing (Tsingke) and then introduced into CB03234-S via conjugation. The thiostrepton-resistant (TsrR) and apramycin-sensitive (AprS) exconjugants were verified using PCR amplification (Fig. S1) to obtain the BGC inactivation mutants, S1001\u2012S1007 (Table S1).", "The same procedure was used to construct the double inactivation plasmids, but tsr was replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene (kan). The resulting plasmids were introduced into S1004 (\u03948-BGC) to generate S1008 (\u03942/8-BGCs) and S1009 (\u039415/\u03948-BGCs), which were both AprS, KanR, and TsrR. The genotypes of the S1008 and S1009 mutants were confirmed using PCR verification (Fig. S1).", "Overexpression of target genes in CB03234-S and derivative mutants", "The core genes tnmE3/E4/E5/E/E10, post-modification genes tnmL/H, and putative self-resistance genes tnmB/T1/S3 were overexpressed in CB03234-S. Each target gene or gene combination was amplified and cloned into linearized pSET152 using HindIII/NdeI sites via seamless cloning. The constructed overexpression plasmids were respectively introduced into CB03234-S to generate mutants S1011\u2012S1018 (Table S1). The S1010 mutant carrying null pSET152 was also obtained as the negative control. Finally, tnmE10, tnmE, or tnmE/E10 were further introduced into S1009 to generate mutants S1019\u2012S1021 (Table S1).", "Evaluating TNM-A tolerance of selected strains", "To test the tolerance of each target strain to TNM-A, 1\u00a0mg/mL TNM-A stock solution was added to the medium to obtain G1 solid plates with different concentrations of TNM-A (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0\u00a0mg/L). The spore suspension of each strain was adjusted to 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009108/mL, and then 100 \u00b5L spores were spread onto each G1 solid plates. After incubation at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u20124 days, growth of each strain was observed and the number of single colonies was counted.", "Fermentation production and HPLC analysis of TNMs", "Briefly, 50 \u00b5L of spore suspension was inoculated into 50 mL TSB medium and cultivated at 220\u00a0rpm and 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 36\u00a0h. Then, 3 mL (6% v/v) of each suspension was transferred into 50 mL of OP medium and cultivated under the same conditions for seven days. The collected mycelia and resins were ultrasonically treated with a total of 50 mL methanol. The combined extracts were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis on a Waters E2695 HPLC system equipped with a PDA detector and a Welch Ultimate AQ-C18 column (5\u00a0\u03bcm, 250\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6\u00a0mm, Welch Materials Inc., Shanghai, China). The mobile phase consisted of A (H2O) and B (CH3CN) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A gradient program (90% A for 1\u00a0min; 90% A to 5% A for 17\u00a0min; 5% A for 2\u00a0min; 5% A to 90% A for 3\u00a0min, followed by 90% A for 2\u00a0min) was applied to detect TNM-A and TNM-D at 540\u00a0nm.", "Scaled-up production of TNMs in a 30\u00a0L fermenter", "Scaled-up production of TNMs was performed in a T&J C-type 30\u00a0L fermenter (T&J Bioengineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Briefly, 50 \u00b5L spore suspension was inoculated into 50\u00a0ml TSB medium and cultured at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 36\u00a0h. Subsequently, 5 mL primary seeds were inoculated into 500 mL TSB medium and cultured at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for an additional 24\u00a0h. Then 1.5\u00a0L of seeds was transferred into a 30-L fermenter containing 25\u00a0L of OP medium for the fermentation. The stirrer speed (100\u2012300\u00a0rpm), aeration rate (350\u00a0L/h), and air pressure (0.02\u20120.04\u00a0MPa) were coordinated to maintain 40%\u223c60% dissolved oxygen (DO) in the fermentation broth. At the end of the exponential growth phase, the pH of the broth was adjusted to approximately 8.0 automatically by adding 50\u00a0g/L of acidic soluble starch solution (pH 1.0, adjusted using HCl). Samples were periodically collected and analyzed to monitor the yield of TNMs until the end of fermentation.", "Isolation, structural characterization, and cytotoxicity evaluation of TNM-W", "The resins were recovered from 25\u00a0L fermentation broth containing S1021 using a 60-mesh stainless sieve filter (diameter 0.125\u00a0mm) and then ultrasonically extracted with 1\u00a0L methanol four times (10\u00a0min each). The combined extracts were concentrated to obtain a brown-black crude extract, which was then resuspended in 500 mL pure H2O and extracted again with 500 mL ethyl acetate (EA) three times. The EA extracts were evaporated, redissolved in 5 mL methanol, and purified using a CombiFlash RF200 preparative chromatography system (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a Welch AQ-C18 flash column (20\u201340\u00a0\u03bcm, 80\u00a0g). Using a linear gradient from 10% methanol in H2O to 90% methanol in H2O at a flow rate of 10 mL/min, the fractions containing the target product TNM-W were combined and dried in vacuo. The resulting crude product was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography by eluting with methanol. The collected fractions were further purified using semipreparative HPLC to yield 4.7\u00a0mg of pure TNM-W. The structure of TNM-W was characterized by spectral analyses, including high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared spectroscopy (IR).", "To assess the cytotoxicity of TNM-W, the A549, KPL-4, Jurkat, and Caco-2 tumor cell lines were selected using TNM-A as a reference. Briefly, A549 and KPL-4 cells were cultured in DMEM, whereas Jurkat and Caco-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640. Each cell line was seeded in 96-well plates (4\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells per well), cultivated for 24\u00a0h, and then treated with different concentrations (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, or 50 nM) of TNM-W or TNM-A (100 \u00b5L media per well).
