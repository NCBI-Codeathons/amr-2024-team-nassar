["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Construction of plasmids for protein expression.", "Plasmids for the expression of clp, clgR, and popR genes of S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 were obtained by ligating PCR-amplified gene sequences with linearized pET11a or pET22b vectors (Merck-Novagen), respectively. All bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material (see also references 72\u201377), including a detailed description of templates and restriction enzymes used. As PCR template, genomic DNA of S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 (NCBI GenBank accession number CP021978.1) was used to amplify shclpP1 (orf CEB94_14110), shclpP2 (orf CEB94_14105), shClpX (orf CEB94_14100), shclpC1 (orf CEB94_23085), shclpC2 (orf CEB94_33910), shclgR (orf CEB94_30145), and shpopR (MT943519). Since clpP2 encodes an internal XhoI restriction site, the vector pET22b*NcoI was created, in which the XhoI restriction site was exchanged for an NcoI restriction site (19). In addition, both shclpP1 and shclpP2 genes were cloned into the pETDUET-1 vector (Merck-Novagen), yielding the plasmid pETDUETshclpP1ATG2clpP2-His, in which the simultaneous expression of the clp genes is regulated by two distinct T7 promoters. Additionally, side-directed mutagenesis was performed, yielding the constructs pET22bshclpP1S113A, pET22bshclpP2S131A, pET11ashclpP1hp, pET11ashclpP1Y76S, pET22bshclpP2hp, and pET22bshclpP2S94Y. Therefore, primers were designed according to the protocol of the QuikChange II Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) and as listed in Table\u00a0S2. To verify the correct nucleotide sequence of the respective gene, Sanger sequencing was performed by LGC Genomics, Germany. Of note, both ClpP1 and ClpP2 were used as unprocessed proteins in all assays unless mentioned otherwise. However, during sequence analysis of ClpP2, a second putative start codon was detected, which would give rise to a shortened protein (ClpP2ATG2). To ensure that ClpP2ATG2 would behave similarly compared to full-length ClpP2, we also cloned and purified ClpP2ATG2, determined its processing site, and performed degradation experiments using ClpP2 and ClpP2ATG2 side by side. Here, no differences were observed for ClpP2ATG2 compared to using ClpP2 (Fig.\u00a0S7). Of note, due to solubility issues, ClpP2 proteins with mutations in the hydrophobic pocket (i.e., ClpP2hp, ClpP2S94Y) were produced from ATG2 and were then compared to ClpP2ATG2 in respective assays (Fig.\u00a02B to D; Fig.\u00a03B and 3F; Fig.\u00a05A to D; Fig.\u00a0S2H, S3A, and S7).", "Intact protein mass spectrometry and processing analysis of Clp2ATG2, as well as peptidase/protease activities of Clp2ATG1 versus Clp2ATG2 and hydrophobic pocket mutants. (A and B) Intact protein mass spectrometry of ClpP2ATG2 (A) and ClpP1\u2009+\u2009ClpP2ATG2 (B). In principle, ClpP2 may also be expressed from a putative second start codon (here indicated by ClpP2ATG2). We therefore cloned and expressed ClpP2ATG2 using the putative second start codon and tested its processing behavior using intact protein mass spectrometry compared to ClpP2. Our data show that the putative second start codon of ClpP2 results in the same processed mature protein compared to expression from the first start codon, as it is shown in Fig.\u00a0S4. (C) Amino acid sequence of full-length ClpP2 highlighting the first and putative second start codon (gray dots) as well as the resulting processing site deduced from intact protein mass spectrometry. The detected mass for processed ClpP2ATG2* indicates the same processing site between the amino acids S33 and R34, resulting in a protein that starts with RYIIPR, similar to processed ClpP2*. (D) Suc-LY-AMC (left) and FITC-casein (right) degradation assays showing peptidase and protease activity, respectively, of ClpP2ATG1 compared to ClpP2ATG2.

The data corroborates our results shown above regarding the role of ClpP1 in ADEP-mediated proteolysis as well as of ClpP2 for Clp-ATPase binding. In all assays, hydrolysis of Suc-LY-AMC and FITC-casein was recorded as an RFU increase over time. Mean values (normalized to %) of initial linear reaction kinetics are shown.

Further noteworthy, accelerated substrate degradation in the presence of ADEP1 also occurred in samples using ClpP2ATG2.

After verification by Sanger sequencing, the knockout constructs were transformed into E. coli ET12567 pUB307 and conjugated into S. lividans TK24 as described previously (79). Mutant colonies were grown with apramycin at 39\u00b0C in TSB liquid cultures and subsequently on MS agar to maintain cells with integrated plasmids only. Spores were harvested and dilutions were plated on LB agar with 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL of ADEP1 as selective pressure for plasmid loss. The obtained colonies were overlaid with 1\u2009mL of an X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-glucuronide) solution in water (1\u2009mg/mL) for a blue-white screen. For white colonies, loss of the vector and the respective clpP gene was further verified by colony PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing. Multiple sequence alignments were generated with the online tool clustal\u03a9 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Sequence identities were computed using Jalview Software (80).", "ADEP sensitivity assays.", "Spore suspensions of the respective Streptomyces strains were plated on nutrient extract agar (1% glucose, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.2% Casamino Acids, and 0.1% Lab-Lemco Powder, pH 7.0). Paper disks containing 20\u2009\u03bcg of ADEP1 were added to the plates, which were subsequently incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2\u2009days.", "Preparation of Streptomyces culture protein extracts.", "The respective Streptomyces strains were grown in 10\u2009mL of TSB medium with apramycin and/or hygromycin as appropriate for 40 h at 30\u00b0C and 180\u2009rpm. The mycelium was harvested and resuspended in 500\u2009\u03bcL of lysis buffer (20\u2009mM Tris, 5\u2009mM EDTA disodium salt, 1\u2009mM 2-mercaptoethanol; one cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [Roche] per 10\u2009mL of lysis buffer) in 2-mL lysis tubes. Upon cell disruption using the Precellys homogenizer, cell debris was removed by two centrifugation steps (14,000\u2009rpm, 10\u2009min, 4\u00b0C followed by 14,000\u2009rpm, 20 min, 4\u00b0C), and the concentration of the protein extracts was determined by measuring the absorption at 280\u2009nm with the NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific)."]
