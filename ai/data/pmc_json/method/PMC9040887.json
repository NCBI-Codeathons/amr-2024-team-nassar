Escherichia coli K-12 wild-type strain was purchased from the Keio E. coli knockout collection (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare). HED (Streptomyces griseoruber ATCC 23919) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI DTP) Open Compound Repository (NSC 70929). Trioxacarcin A (TXNA) was isolated from Streptomyces bottropensis NRRL 12051 as described previously (56). AZB was prepared from organic extract of Streptomyces sahachiroi (ATCC 33158) as in reference 31. NM8 compound was synthesized and purified by the Vanderbilt Molecular Design and Synthesis Center (31). AlkA, AlkC, AlkD, AlkZ, LldU1/5, TxnU2/4, and YcaQ were purified as described previously (30, 31, 52, 56, 74, 75).

All oligonucleotides were dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris\u00b7HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to 200 \u03bcM, and the DNA was stored at \u221220\u00b0C (stored in the dark for the Cy5/FAM oligonucleotides). The underlined nucleotide in the 7mG_Top, HED_Top, TXNA_Top, AZB_Top/_Bottom, and NM8_Top/_Bottom oligonucleotides is the site of the N7-alkylguanine lesion.

Searches were run with the BLOSUM62 matrix, 1,000 maximum target sequences, and 0.05 threshold using an e-value and identity cutoff of 10\u22124 and 25%, respectively. All hits were verified for the presence of the (H/Q)\u03a6(D/Q) catalytic motif, during which the (H/Q)\u03a6(S/T)(D/E) (AZL2) variant was identified. Truncated genes, poor-sequence-quality genes, and pseudogenes were eliminated. Additional sequences were obtained by searching the Pfam database v33.1 (76) for Streptomyces HTH_42 superfamily members (PF06224). Sequences from Pfam were sorted according to their domain classes (see Fig.\u00a0S1A in the supplemental material), and only sequences from class 1 with >75% coverage were included. Protein sequences were aligned using EMBL-EBI Clustal OmegaW or MAFFT v7 using default parameters (77, 78). The evolutionary history of YQL/AZL sequences was reconstructed using IQTREE2 with default settings (79), and the phylogenetic tree was assembled with the Interactive Tree of Life (v5) phylogeny display tool (80). Sequence logos were generated with WebLogo v2.8.2 (81). The copy number frequency and coincidence of YQL/AZL in the same genome was determined by manually counting the number and identity of homologs in each species. A list of all YQL/AZL/AZL2 proteins and Streptomyces genomes analyzed in this study can be found in Table\u00a0S1.", "Identification of AZL proteins in known biosynthetic gene clusters.", "To find AZL proteins in verified and/or published BGCs, we searched MIBiG v2.0 for the AZB BGC (BGC0000960) from S. sahachiroi (27, 82), followed by an iterative search using the MIBiG Hits function until no more hits were obtained. The homologs TxnU2 and TxnU4 were identified from the initial BLAST search within the deposited NCBI trioxacarcin BGC sequence (83). The homolog within the aclacinomycin BGC was also identified in the initial BLAST search as appearing in proximity to aclacinomycin biosynthesis genes. Closer inspection of the published sequence for the aclacinomycin BGC (GenBank accession number AB008466.1) revealed an AZL protein (Orf1) located immediately 3\u2032 of the cluster (84). A detailed list of the AZL proteins in known BGCs can be found in Table\u00a0S3.", "Identification of AZL proteins in uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters.", "To determine the physical distance in base pairs between the genomic coordinates of AZL proteins and those of BGCs present in the genome assemblies of Streptomyces (average number of scaffolds, 96.30; minimum, 1; maximum, 1,956), we first predicted the BGCs in each genome using antiSMASH v5.1.0 (38) with the taxon parameter set to bacteria. Using the BGC sequences identified from antiSMASH and AZL sequences, a custom python script using Biopython (85) determined the shortest base pair distance between the physical location of the YQL/AZL gene and the location of the nearest BGC on the same scaffold (less than 2 Mbp away). To be considered within a BGC, the homolog had to be observed within 5 genes or 2\u2009kb of the nearest cluster. Known Cluster BLAST was performed within antiSMASH to determine the BGC most similar to the unknown clusters, and the result with the highest percentage of similar genes was recorded as the most similar cluster. A detailed list of the genome information, cluster identifiers (IDs), and closest 3\u2032 and/or 5\u2032 BGC can be found in Table\u00a0S2.", "Gene ontology analysis.", "To identify GO terms for nearest neighbors identified through BLAST, Pfam, and MIBiG searches, we randomly chose 40 homologs each of AZL inside BGCs, AZL outside BGCs, and YQL, which represent \u223c10% of the sequences for each. Amino acid sequences for the five genes on both sides of the YQL/AZL genes were downloaded from the NCBI database, for a total of 400 neighbors for each of the three classes. Cellular functions of any already annotated genes in the NCBI database were identified and recorded. The downloaded sequences were then run through the GhostKOALA (v2.2) and eggNOG (v5.0) GO annotation databases (86, 87). After known GO terms for all gene neighbors were identified, proteins were categorized by biological processes and molecular functions, and the values for these terms were used to create the GO term distributions. Proteins that had multiple GO terms associated with them were counted into each class of terms. A list of all proteins and their annotated GO terms can be found in Tables S5 and S6.", "AZL nearest neighbor GO term analysis.
