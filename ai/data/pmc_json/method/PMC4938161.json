For selection either phleomycin was directly applied to the protoplasts (33 \u03bcg/mL) or hygromycin was applied to regenerated protoplasts 24 h after transformation by overlay agar at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. Resistant colonies were transferred to fresh selective medium (BII, pH 8, with phleomycin at 100 \u03bcg/mL or hygromycin at 0.5 mg/mL).

For the HRMS measurement, an Accela LC 60057-60010 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was linked to a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A SPD-M20A Shimadzu PDA Detector (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) was coupled to the MS spectrometer. Data acquisition was performed with Xcalibur 2.07 SP1 (Thermo Scientific). Separation was carried out on a 150 x 2.1, 3 \u03bcm, Nucleodur phenyl-hexyl column (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) using a binary gradient at a column temperature of 40\u00b0C. The injection volume was 15 \u03bcL and the autosampler was cooled to 7\u00b0C. The flow rate was set to 250 \u03bcL/min. Solvent A was MeOH with 1% of formic acid (v/v) and solvent B was water with 1% of formic acid (v/v). The HPLC was programmed as follows: in the first 5 minutes isocratic 10% of A, afterwards a binary gradient to 100% in 35 min.

For the detection of intermediates, a total ion scan of a mass range from m/z 100\u2013800 with a resolution of 60 000 in the positive and negative ion mode was used. All observed ions showed errors less than 5 ppm. The HRMS data were analyzed by Metworks (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) in order to screen for the characteristic sulfur isotopic pattern. To get information on the structure of the novel metabolites, the new substances were analyzed by stepwise mass spectrometric fragmentation experiments in the positive mode. The experiments included collision-induced dissociation (CID) with a relative energy of 20% to 45%, depending on the ionization and an isolation width of m/z 1.5.

The metabolites were identified by their retention time, exact mass and HRMSn data.", "Isolation", "The liquid fungal culture was filtrated through Miracloth (Calbiochem, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to remove the mycelium. 1 L of this filtrate was fractionated on a Strata C18-E 55 \u03bcm, 70 \u00c5, 10 g/60 mL solid phase extraction cartridge (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). First, the cartridge was activated by use of 150 mL methanol and 200 mL water. All steps were performed under vacuum at the column outlet. The culture filtrate was applied to the cartridge and to prevent plugging of the column 100 mL methanol/water (5+95, v/v) were applied in between to wash off salts and sugars and other polar compounds. After application of the whole amount of filtrate it was again washed with 200 mL of water. Afterwards five fractions with different amounts of methanol/water were collected (each 200 mL). The fractions were as follows: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% methanol/water (v/v). An aliquot of the five fractions were diluted 1:10 with water and used for fraction control via HPLC-HRMS. Therefore, the same MS-parameters were used as described above. For further steps only the 60% and 80% fractions containing the relevant metabolites were used. The solvent of these fractions was removed using a rotary evaporator (B\u00fcchi Rotavapor R-110 with B\u00fcchi Waterbath B-480, B\u00fcchi Labortechnik, Essen, Germany) at a temperature of 40\u00b0C under vacuum. Then the samples were dried using a freeze-drier LyoVac GT2 (AMSCO Finn-Aqua, H\u00fcrth, Germany) and resolved in 15 mL methanol/water (40+60, v/v).
