["Materials and Methods", "Soil Sample Preparation", "Twelve soil samples (\u226510 g) were collected from several different locations in Sweden (Table 1). Seven soil samples (1\u20137) were from Uppsala County along The Linnaeus Trails (Herbationes Upsalienses), one sample (8) was from G\u00e4vleborg County north of Uppsala, three samples (9\u201311) were from Norrbotten County, in the mountains above the Arctic Circle, and the last soil sample (12) came from a sandy beach in Gotland County, an island in the Baltic Sea. Samples were taken by pressing or digging a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube into the soil surface. The samples were kept cold until the time of dilution and plating. Aliquots of the individual soil samples were deep frozen and selected samples were later sent in a frozen state to BaseClear BV (Leiden, Netherlands) for DNA extraction, NGS (next generation sequencing) and analysis of microbial community composition (Supplementary Material).", "Isolated Pedobacter strains, antibiotics used for their selection, closest established identity according to 16S rRNA gene sequences (GenBank accession numbers MW332355 to MW332382), and sample collection coordinates.", "#a Soil sample number; (geographical coordinates) Isolate name Antibiotics used for selection Closest hit (BLAST\u00ae), \u2265 99% identity.", "1 1; (59\u00b049\u203207.2\u2033 N 17\u00b039\u203255.6\u2033 E) UP508b NAL, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP509 NAL, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "2; (59\u00b048\u203258.8\u2033 N 17\u00b039\u203251.1\u2033 E) UP579 NAL, AMP, KAN P. steynii WB2.3-45.", "3; (59\u00b048\u203258.9\u2033 N 17\u00b038\u203244.7\u2033 E) UP621 LIN, ERY, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP640 NAL, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "4; (59\u00b049\u20324.3\u2033 N 17\u00b046\u203236.9\u2033 E) UP696 NAL, AMP, KAN P. lusitanus NL19.", "9; (68\u00b03\u203215.0\u2033 N 19\u00b026\u203248.6\u2033 E) UP742 NAL, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP751 NAL, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "2 6; (59\u00b048\u20327.5\u2033 N 17\u00b041\u203217.7\u2033 E) UP1634 NAL, ERY P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1637 NAL, VAN P. lusitanus NL19.", "UP1642 NAL, ERY, KAN, STR P. cryoconitis A37.", "7; (59\u00b049\u20328.9\u2033 N 17\u00b039\u203219.3\u2033 E) UP1729 NAL, ERY, KAN, STR P. cryoconitis A37.", "8; (60\u00b040\u203214.1\u2033 N 16\u00b048\u203258.2\u2033 E) UP1478 CIP, AMP, KAN, POL P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1479 VAN, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "11; (68\u00b028\u203255.0\u2033 N 18\u00b049\u203221.6\u2033 E) UP1184 NAL, ERY, GEN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1189 CIP, LIN, GEN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1400 NAL, VAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "3 5; (59\u00b049\u20328.1\u2033 N 17\u00b040\u203235.7\u2033 E) UP1440 NAL, AMP, KAN P. steynii WB2.3-45.", "UP1426 NAL, CIP, LIN, ERY, AMP, KAN, GEN P. steynii WB2.3-45.", "10; (68\u00b028\u203224.7\u2033 N 18\u00b049\u20325.0\u2033 E) UP1427 NAL, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1428 NAL, AMP, GEN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1429 NAL, AMP, GEN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1430 CIP, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1431 CIP, AMP, GEN P. cryoconitis A37.", "12; (57\u00b019\u203247.9\u2033 N 18\u00b042\u203243.0\u2033 E) UP1435 NAL, AMP, GEN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1436 NAL, AMP, KAN P. cryoconitis A37.", "UP1437 CIP, AMP, GEN P. lusitanus NL19.", "UP1439 NAL, LIN, GEN P. cryoconitis A37.", "Isolation of MDR Pedobacter spp.", "As growth medium base for isolation of bacteria, a modified CN medium was used (Gavrish et al., 2008).

Fungicides and various antibiotics were added to NBCA after autoclaving and cooling the medium to 50\u00b0C. To reduce the growth of molds, two fungicides, cycloheximide, and nystatin, were added to the final concentration of (100 mg/L) and (10 mg/L), respectively. The NBCA was also supplemented with varying combinations of antibiotics to provide the selection conditions for the isolation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Selected antibiotics covered different antibiotic classes and mechanisms of action and when supplemented to the NBCA the following final concentrations were used: ampicillin (AMP, 20 mg/L), kanamycin (KAN, 20 mg/L), nalidixic acid (NAL, 20 mg/L), streptomycin (STR, 20 mg/L) and erythromycin (ERY, 20 mg/L), lincomycin (LIN 10 mg/L) was 10 mg/L, gentamicin (GEN, 5 mg/L), vancomycin (VAN, 2 mg/L), polymyxin B (POL, 2 mg/L), and ciprofloxacin (CIP, 1 mg/L).", "Approximately 4 g of each individual soil sample was thoroughly mixed by vortexing with 40 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The mixture was allowed to settle for at least 10 min and then 1 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 9 mL of sterile PBS in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube. From this dilution, 0.1 mL was spread onto the NBCA isolation plates without (control) or with different combinations of antibiotics. The plates were then incubated at 20\u00b0C for approximately one week in darkness to avoid degradation of light sensitive antibiotics.", "Morphologically different bacterial colonies were afterward re-streaked on Vegetable Peptone Broth Agar plates (VPA), containing 10 g Vegetable Peptone Broth (VPB; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom), and 15 g Bacto Agar (Saveen & Werner) in 1 L deionized water.", "Antibiotic Resistance Pattern of P. cryoconitis UP508", "The antibiotic resistance pattern of isolate UP508 was established using NBCA agar base (as above) supplemented with the following individual antibiotics at 20 mg/L: AMP, CIP, ERY, GEN, KAN, LIN, NAL, POL, STR, and VAN.

Sequencing was also performed for the five type isolates of different Pedobacter species purchased from the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms [BCCM/LMG, Pedobacter cryoconitis A37 (LMG 21415T) and P. lusitanus NL19 (LMG 29220T)], the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures [DSMZ, Pedobacter hartonius WB 3.3-3 (DSM 19033T) and Pedobacter westerhofensis WB 3.3-22 (DSM 19036T)] as well as from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms [JCM, Pedobacter himalayensis HHS22 (JCM 12171T)]. Briefly, colony PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed with the universal primers 27F (AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 1492R (TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT) followed by purification of amplified PCR-products (QIAquick PCR purifications kit, QIAGEN). Sequencing was then performed by Macrogen Europe (EZ-sequencing, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The resulting DNA sequencing chromatograms were assembled using the Geneious R8 software and manually inspected (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). The resulting 16S rRNA sequences were deposited at GenBank (accession numbers MW332350 to MW332382). The BLAST database for 16S rRNA sequences (Altschul et al., 1997) of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI2) was then used to retrieve the closest possible identity of the isolates. For aligning the sequences, the online MAFFT version 7 multiple alignment program for amino acid or nucleotide sequences3 was used and Neighbor Joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees were obtained after estimating the robustness of the internal tree branches by bootstrap analysis (Jukes\u2013Cantor/bootstrap 1000) using 1000 replications (Katoh et al., 2019).", "Culturing, Collection, and Extraction of Metabolites", "Bacterial strains isolated from soil samples and the reference Pedobacter species, were grown in liquid cultures (150 mL in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks) using half strength VPB [15 g VPB (Oxoid Ltd.) in 1 L deionized water]. Cultures were either started by transferring a loop (10 \u03bcL) of 24\u201348 h-old bacterial colonies grown on VPA plates or by transferring 100 \u03bcL of deep-frozen isolate stock per 150 mL VPB. The cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker (130 rpm) for 96\u2013120 h at 20\u00b0C in darkness. To collect extracellular metabolites, one sterile nylon mesh bag containing a polymeric resin, Sepabeads\u00ae SP850 (Sigma-Aldrich), was submerged in each actively growing culture, approximately 16\u201324 h after inoculation (approximately 8 g of resin per bag). At harvest, each adsorbent resin bag was washed with deionized water to remove bacterial cells and culture resins. Each bag was subsequently extracted with 2 \u00d7 20 mL MeOH and 2 \u00d7 20 mL MeCN, and the extracts were pooled and analyzed by UHPLC-MS and -MSMS (below), and the residues were dried in a vacuum centrifuge for subsequent fractionation by preparative HPLC (below).", "Analysis of Culture Extracts by UHPLC-MS and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis", "Adsorbent extracts were centrifuged (5 min, 13,000 rpm) and analyzed (injection volume 1 \u03bcL) by UHPLC-MS on a reversed phase column (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm, 1.5 \u03bcm, Thermo Accucore Vanquish RP-MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II instrument connected to a maXis Impact ESI-QTOF MS (Bruker), using a gradient of MeCN in water (20\u201355% MeCN in 3 min, 95% MeCN for 1.2 min, at 0.9 mL/min, with 0.2% formic acid). The MS was operated in positive mode with scanning of m/z 50\u20131500, and calibration of the mass spectra was obtained by a sodium formate clusters. The software Compass DataAnalysis 4.3 (Bruker Daltonics) was used for calibration and data analysis. Isopedopeptins were identified by comparison with authentic compounds from previous work (Nord et al., 2020), and identification of other compounds was attempted by comparison of HRMS-data with databases (Antibase and Combined Chemical Dictionary). UHPLC-MSMS was run on the same instrument, column and UHPLC-conditions, on extracts or on extracts treated with 2% NaOMe in MeOH for 30 min at room temperature, using the auto MSMS function (1+, 2+, and 3+ precursor ions, m/z 200\u20131100, ramped fragmentation energies: 1+: 30/40/45 eV for m/z 100/500/1000; 2+: 15/25/30 eV for m/z 100/500/1000; 3+: 10/20/25 eV for m/z 100/500/1000). Following conversion of UHPLC-MS data to mzXML format using DataAnalysis 4.3, ion-chromatogram peak picking in the range 20\u2013200 s was done by the program XCMS in the software environment R using the centWave method (peakwidth 3\u201320 s, m/z tolerance 5 ppm, noise 10,000) (Smith et al., 2006; Tautenhahn and B\u00f6ttcher, 2008). XCMS was used for subsequent peak grouping and missing peak filling. The resulting peak-areas of the molecular features of each sample were normalized against the sum of peak-areas, and the resulting relative peak-areas were then 10-logarithmized. To reduce the complexity of the data set, only the dominant molecular feature for each molecule was used, and features with peak-areas <200,000 were not included. The data were used to construct a heat map with hierarchical clustering of both strains and molecular features (distance: Euclidean, clustering: complete).", "Fractionation of Culture Extracts by Preparative HPLC", "Based on the UHPLC-MS analyses and the heat map data, representative isolates were selected for fractionation and subsequent bioassays. The dried culture extracts were dissolved in 1 mL 50% MeCN and following centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 5 min), 1-mL samples were fractionated on a reversed phase preparative HPLC column (Luna Omega PS C18, 21.2 \u00d7 100 mm, 5 \u03bcm), eluted with a gradient of MeCN in water (15\u201350% MeCN in 15 min, 50\u201395% MeCN in 2 min, and a hold at 95% MeCN for 8 min, at 10 mL/min) with 0.2% formic acid. The eluent was monitored at 210 nm and fractions (2 mL) were collected in deep-well plates (start after 5 min). Aliquots (100 \u03bcL) of all fractions were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, dried over-night in a fume-hood, and subsequently analyzed for antibacterial activity (below).", "In vitro Bioassay of Antibacterial Activity", "Chromatographic fractions of the extracts of selected isolates (above) were assayed for antibacterial activity using an earlier developed protocol (Thaning et al., 2001; Nord et al., 2019) with the following human pathogenic bacteria or bacteria commonly used in such bioassays: Escherichia coli LMG 15862, Acinetobacter baumannii LMG 1041T, Enterobacter cloacae LMG 2783T, Klebsiella pneumoniae LMG 20218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 6395, and Staphylococcus aureus LMG 15975, all purchased from BCCM/LMG and maintained as advised by supplier. Briefly, cell suspensions (0.1 mL/well) at a concentration of 104 cells per mL half strength VBP (Oxoid Ltd.) were added to the microtiter plates with dried aliquots of HPLC fractions (above), and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in darkness for 16\u201324 h. The effect on the bacterial growth was estimated visually according to the following scale: 3/red \u2013 full growth inhibition, 2/orange \u2013 intermediate growth inhibition, 1/yellow \u2013 weak growth inhibition, 0 \u2013 no growth inhibition. Positive controls were wells with cell suspensions in VPB only, and sterile VPB was used as negative control."]
