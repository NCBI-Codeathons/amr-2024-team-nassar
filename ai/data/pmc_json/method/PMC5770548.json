After that, optical densities (optical density at 600 nm [OD600]) were measured, and cultures were adjusted to have equivalent starting OD600 values. Then, 20\u00a0\u00b5l of the culture was transferred to 20\u00a0ml NYB in a 125-ml flask, which was incubated with shaking (200\u00a0rpm). For all strains tested, at least three replicate cultures were evaluated. At 1 day postinoculation (dpi) to 6 dpi, 10\u00a0\u00b5l was sampled from each flask and serially diluted, and dilutions were spread on KB and LMA plates. The numbers of CFU were counted on KB plates after 24-h incubation to estimate the population size in each flask. After 48-h incubation, the number of colonies with or without a halo on LMA was counted.

The resultant plasmid, p18Tc-pltA, was then transformed into the \u0394pltA mutant, and the repaired derivative strain was selected after two rounds of homologous recombination as described previously (11).

At 4 dpi, 10\u00a0\u00b5l was sampled from each flask and serially diluted, and dilutions were spread on LMA agar. The plates were incubated for 2\u00a0days, and exoprotease-deficient colonies, identified by the lack of a halo on LMA, were selected randomly. Genomic DNA was isolated from six exoprotease-deficient colonies of each strain (two colonies from each of the three replicate flasks). The gacA and gacS ORFs and flanking sequences were amplified by using primers gacA-seqF/gacA-seqR, and gacS-5\u2019F/gacS-3\u2019R (Table\u00a02), respectively. The amplified products were cleaned up using the ExoSAP-IT enzyme and submitted for Sanger sequencing. Primers gacA-seqF and gacA-seqR (seq stands for sequencing) were used to sequence the PCR products of the gacA gene. Multiple sequencing reactions and seven primers, including gacS-5\u2019F, gacS-3\u2019R, gacS-Reverse (1), gacS-Middle Forward (2), gacS-Middle Forward (3), gacS-Middle Reverse (3), gacS-Forward (1) (Table\u00a02) were used to sequence the full length (2,754\u00a0bp) of gacS ORF.

Five milliliters of the culture were extracted twice with 2.5-ml ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were dried under vacuum and solubilized in 100\u00a0\u03bcl methanol. A portion (10\u00a0\u03bcl) of the methanol solution was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC instrument consisting of a quaternary pump, autosampler, column heater (set at 30\u00b0C), and diode array detector. Separation was achieved using a Luna C18 column (4.6\u00a0mm by 150 mm; 5\u00a0\u03bcm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a flow rate of 1\u00a0ml/min with the following steps where solvent A was water plus 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile plus 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid. The column was preequilibrated in 90% solvent A\u201310% solvent B, and upon injection, this composition was held for 2\u00a0min. The composition of the mobile phase was then changed to 0% solvent A\u2013100% solvent B for 28\u00a0min utilizing a linear gradient. This composition was held for 6\u00a0min and then changed to 90% solvent A\u201310% solvent B for 2\u00a0min. The column was equilibrated in 90% solvent A\u201310% solvent B for 6\u00a0min prior to the next injection. Under these chromatographic conditions, pyoluteorin eluted at 15.1\u00a0min. The HPLC was operated with and data were viewed using ChemStation (version B.04.03; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Quantification was performed by integrating the area under the curve at 300\u00a0nm and comparing to a standard curve prepared by injection of purified pyoluteorin, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, monoacetylphloroglucinol, orfamide A, rhizoxin WF-1360 F (the predominant rhizoxin analogue produced by P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5), and pyrrolnitrin.

The plate was incubated in a 96-well plate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 Pro; M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) with shaking at approximately 200\u00a0rpm. Growth of the bacteria was monitored by measuring the OD600.

Three microliters of the pyoluteorin solution was placed on a sterilized filter paper disk (10-mm diameter).
