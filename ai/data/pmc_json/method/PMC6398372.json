["Materials and Methods", "Isolation and Identification of Streptomyces-Like Isolates", "Forty-five samples of rhizospheric soils were collected from rice-cultivated fields in Tolima (Colombia). In order to conduct this research, the ANLA (Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales) and the Ministry of Environment (Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible) were requested for permission to collect samples and study the recovered bacteria.", "Briefly, plants roots were removed from the soil and subsequently handshaked for 10 min to remove bulk soil. The remaining adhering soil was considered as rhizospheric soil, and was collected by handshaking roots for 10 min in a sterile plastic bag. Rhizospheric soil samples (4\u20135 g for each) were then mixed with 1 g of CaCO3. Samples were further dried at 45\u00b0C for 1 h, as described previously (Gurung et al., 2009). Actinobacteria were subsequently isolated by spread plate technique following the serial dilution of soil samples on starch casein agar (Starch 10 g/L, Casein 1 g/L, K2HPO4 0.5 g/L, Agar 13 g/L) and incubated at 30\u00b0C for a week. In order to select Streptomyces-like bacteria, microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of the obtained colonies were assessed resulting in a total of 60 isolates, which were further purified and sub-cultured. Single colonies were characterized by their colony morphology in International Streptomyces Project media (ISP2, ISP3, ISP4), Nutrient agar and Mueller Hinton Agar (Supplementary Figure S1). Catalase, oxidase and their carbon source utilization were tested, as suggested for Streptomyces-like bacteria (Shirling and Gottlieb, 1968; Goodfellow, 2012).", "Antimicrobial Activity Assays", "Actinobacteria strains were grown for 5 days in M3.7 liquid media (glucose 5 g/L, Yeast Extract 5 g/L, (NH4)2SO4 5 g/L, Corn gluten 5 g/L, CaCO3 2 g/L, NaCl 2 g/L, FeSO4 1 mg/L, starch 10 g/L pH 7.2). Five-day cultures were used for antimicrobial tests. Antibacterial activities against 21 strains from 15 species (Supplementary Table S1) were determined by using the Kirby-Bauer agar well-diffusion method, modified from the CLSI 2011 guidelines (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, 2011). Briefly, each strain to be tested was grown overnight in LB media, and its OD600 was determined. Bacterial absorbance was then adjusted to 0.25, and a cotton swab was fully immersed in each bacterial dilution. The inoculated swab was used to spread the entire surface of a Mueller Hinton Agar plate, containing 25 mL of agar five times. Seven mm (diameter) wells were perforated in the agar, and 50 \u03bcL of each actinobacterial culture were poured into the well. Plates were subsequently incubated at 30 or 37\u00b0C (according to the best temperature for each bacteria to be tested). Inhibition zones were measured after 24 h of incubation. Antibacterial assays were also performed against a collection of 48 B. glumae isolates recovered from rice plants exhibiting symptoms of BPB (kindly provided by FEDEARROZ-Colombia).", "Antifungal activities against 9 fungal plant pathogens (Supplementary Table S1) were measured as described previously (Kanini et al., 2013). For this assay, fungal strains were grown in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates for 3 days at 25\u00b0C, and two 6 mm disks of mycelium from each phytopathogenic fungi were then placed in opposites edges of a new PDA plate. Following fungal inoculation, two 6 mm wells were open in opposite sides of the PDA plate, containing 50 \u03bcL of a 5-day culture for each Actinobacteria strain tested. The plates were incubated at 28\u00b0C for 5 days and antagonistic activity was estimated by measuring the growth inhibition zone.", "Taxonomical Identification and Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLST)", "Three strains were selected based on their wide range of antimicrobial activity. Genomic DNA was isolated by using the Salting-out procedure described previously (Pospiech and Neumann, 1995), with few modifications. Briefly, single colonies of each isolate were grown in 30 mL Tryptic Soy Broth, with shaking at 30\u00b0C for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 10% sucrose, and suspended in 5 ml of STE Buffer (75 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5), containing heat-treated pancreatic RNase A at 10 mg/mL. Hundred microliters of lysozyme (50 mg/mL) were added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, with gentle tapping at intervals. This was followed by the addition of 140 \u03bcL of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and 600 \u03bcL of 10% SDS, with further incubation at 55\u00b0C for 2 h. Two mL of 5M NaCl were added and mixed by inversion until the temperature of the suspension reached the 37\u00b0C. The samples were cooled to room temperature and extracted twice with 5 ml of chloroform. Aqueous fractions were separated by centrifuging at 10000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and genomic DNA was precipitated by adding one volume of isopropanol, mixed by inversion and centrifuged 15 min at 15000 rpm. The obtained DNA pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, air-dried and suspended in 100 \u03bcL of DNAse-free sterile water.", "Taxonomical identification was first approached by PCR amplification, sequencing, and analysis of the entire 16S rRNA locus by using primers 16S_A and 16S_B described by Cui et al. (2001), and the cleaned PCR products were directly sequenced using universal primers 27F, 500F, 818R and 1492R (Supplementary Table S1). Closely related sequences were obtained from RDP (Ribosomal Database Project) (Cole et al., 2014) and EZTaxon (Kim et al., 2012). Obtained sequences were imported into MEGA6 software and aligned with ClustalW for phylogenetic analysis (Thompson et al., 1994).", "Multilocus Sequence Typing was used to elucidate a further taxonomical affiliation (Guo et al., 2008; Rong et al., 2009). Briefly, five loci (gyrB, atpD, recA trpB, and rpoB) were PCR amplified and purified by using the EuroGOLD Gel extraction Kit (EuroCLONE, Italy). Each fragment was then sequenced by using primers described previously (Guo et al., 2008), and listed in Supplementary Table S1. The sequences for all loci for each strain were concatenated head to tail in frame and exported in FASTA format. Sequences were aligned using CLCbio Mainworkbench 6.9.1 (CLC-Bio Qiagen) and MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2011). A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the concatenated sequences of all six loci, and representative Streptomyces strains available in the Streptomyces MLST database (Jolley and Maiden, 2010)1 Maximum likelihood algorithm trees were generated with MEGA based on the Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei, 1993), and a tree with the highest log likelihood was generated calculating the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms (Gascuel, 1997) to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log-likelihood value.", "In vitro Assessment of Plant Growth Promotion (PGP) Traits", "Biological nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, indoleacetic acid production (IAA), ACC deaminase and extracellular enzyme production were evaluated. For this purpose, each isolate was grown in 100 mL M3.7 medium for 5 days, and each assay was performed with three independent cultures for each strain.", "Biological Nitrogen Fixation", "To test biological nitrogen fixation, Acetylene Reduction Assay (ARA) was performed as described elsewhere (Hardy et al., 1968). To this purpose, 100 \u03bcL of washed cells were inoculated into 17 mL of semisolid NFb medium in 25 mL serum bottles with a cotton cap, and cultures were maintained at 30\u00b0C, without agitation (Dobereiner, 1995). After 5 days, 2 mL of acetylene were injected into the flask and a rubber stopper was used to replace the cotton cap. The acetylene and ethylene concentrations of each sample were determined by gas chromatography, using a chromatograph Varian 3400-G-crom, equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (Hayesep Porapak N 80/100 column; 6\u2032 X 1/8\u2033). Ethylene and acetylene estimation was done by integrating the area under the curve for each compound, at retention times of 1.417 and 2.40 min, respectively.", "Phosphate Solubilization", "Phosphate solubilizing abilities were qualitatively determined by inoculating single colonies of each strain in National Botanical Research Institute\u2019s Phosphate growth medium (NBRIP) (Nautiyal, 1999) and SRS media (Sundara-Rao and Sinha, 1963). Plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 5 days, and colonies with a clear orange halo in NBRIP media and/or a purple color in SRS media were marked positive for phosphate solubilization. A quantitative determination was performed by growing each strain in 100 ml of NBRIP liquid media supplemented with 5 g/L CaCO3, for 5 days. Subsequently, the solubilized phosphate present in the supernatant was measured with the Spectroquant Phosphor Kit (Merck).", "Siderophore Production", "Siderophore production was determined in Chrome Azurol Blue agar (Schwyn and Neilands, 1987), modified to use KOH to adjust the pH, as suggested previously (Mahmoud and Abdallah, 2001).", "ACC Deaminase Production", "1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase production was determined by checking the ability of each strain to use ACC as sole nitrogen source. For this purpose, single colonies were inoculated in Dorwin-Foster media (DF) supplemented with 3 mM ACC as sole nitrogen source, or with 2 g/L (NH4)2SO4 as growth control (Belimov et al., 2001; El-tarabily, 2008). In each case, 2 \u03bcL of a 106 CFU/mL culture, were spotted on the surface of a DF plate with or without N source, and growth was evaluated after 5 days at 30\u00b0C, and Burkholderia unamae MT1 641T was included as a positive control. An absence of phenotypic changes in growth or sporulation of the isolates in the medium supplemented with ACC in comparison with an (NH4)2SO4 supplemented medium were considered as indicators of the capacity of the microorganisms to use ACC as a source of nitrogen mediated by the production of ACC-deaminase.", "Indoleacetic Acid", "For the quantitative determination of Indoleacetic acid (IAA) and IAA-like molecules, the colorimetric Salkowski\u2019s assay was performed (Tang and Bonner, 1948). For this purpose, each Streptomyces strain was grown in 20 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TBS) supplemented with 60 mM tryptophan. After 4 days, 1 ml of Salkowski reagent (Glickmann and Dessaux, 1995) was pipetted into test tubes containing 1 ml of culture spent supernatant. The tubes containing the mixture were gently vortexed and left for 30 min for development of color at room temperature (26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C). The intensity of the color was spectrophotometrically determined at 535 nm.", "Extracellular Enzyme Production", "Extracellular enzyme production was evaluated in vitro. Cellulolytic activity was evaluated by spotting 2 \u03bcL of 5-day old cultures on the surface of CMC-media plates, in which CMC was the sole carbon source. Spots were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 4 days, and then strains were assayed for their ability to degrade CMC by flooding each plate with a 0.2% Congo red solution for 15 min, followed by washing with 1 M NaCl. Activity halos dimensions were then measured from the border of the colony to the outer edge of the halo. Similarly, ligninolytic activities were determined in guaiacol containing media and positive activity was scored when a red halo was formed around colonies, due to the oxidation of the substrate to tetraguaiacol, as described previously (Nagadesi and Arya, 2012).", "Plant-Growth Promotion Experiments", "Gnotobiotic Experiments", "Gnotobiotic inoculation experiments were performed in rice cultivars FEDEARROZ 733 (F733) and FEDEARROZ 60 (F60). For this purpose, rice seeds were surface sterilized and pre-germinated in 1% agar, for 5 days in complete darkness (Mattos et al., 2008). Each seed was then transferred into glass flasks (15 cm \u00d7 4 cm) with 40 mL of semisolid Hoagland media previously inoculated with 103 CFU/mL of each strain. To this end, each strain was grown in M3.7 media, and cells were suspended in sterile saline solution and added to the semi-solid medium to reach a final concentration of 103CFU/mL, before solidification of the medium.", "Plantlets were then transferred to a greenhouse (Relative humidity 43% \u00b1 8.6, Average Temperature 24\u00b0C \u00b1 5.2, natural light). Azotobacter chroococcum (APFN010) and Azospirillum brasilense (AZPP010) strains (105 CFU/mL) were used as positive controls, and sterile water was used as negative control. Each treatment included two biological replicates (two independent colonies for each bacterial strain), and 10 plants were inoculated with each inoculum. The entire experiment was performed twice, and biometric properties (root and shoot fresh weight, plant dry weight, and length) were measured 15 days post-inoculation.", "Soil Inoculation Experiments", "Inoculation experiments were also performed in sterile and non-sterile soil using cultivars F733 and F60 with pregerminated seeds, as described above. For these assays, 10 mL from a 108 CFU/mL inoculum were mixed with 250 g of sterile soil, to reach a concentration of 105 CFU/g. Subsequently, pre-germinated seeds were planted inside the pot and plants were kept in the greenhouse at 25\u00b0C for 31 days post-inoculation. A. chroococcum (APFN010) and A. brasilense (AZPP010) strains were used as positive controls, and sterile water was used as negative control. Each treatment included two biological replicates (two independent colonies for each bacterial strain), and 10 plants were inoculated with each inoculum. Biometric properties (root and shoot fresh weight, plant dry weight and length) were measured 31 days post-inoculation. Dry weight for each plant was determined after drying the plant material at 50\u00b0C, until obtaining a constant weight.", "Plant Colonization Experiments", "To assess the ability of the three Streptomyces for rice plant colonization, two independent assays were performed under gnotobiotic and soil conditions as described before, using in each case three biological replicates for each strain, with five plants per replicate. Bacterial strains were re-isolated from the rhizoplane by cutting and washing 2 cm segments of each plant root and placing the excised root segments on the surface of ISP3 plates. Roots of the soil experiment were placed on ISP3 medium supplemented with nalidixic acid (20 \u03bcg/ml) and nitrofurantoin (10 \u03bcg/ml) to inhibit the growth of other soil microorganisms. The identity of colonies recovered from the roots was verified from their phenotype and their antimicrobial profile.", "To verify endophytic colonization, inoculated plants were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite and 70% ethanol for 4 min each, followed by several washes with sterile water. Each plant was then excised in the root, plant shoot and leaves, and each part was macerated with a sterile pestle. Each suspension was then serially diluted and plated in ISP3 plates. Surface sterilization was regarded as optimum when no growth was observed: (1) after placing the processed plants on ISP3 plates, and (2) after plating 100 \u03bcL from the last wash in ISP3 (see more details from the experimental set-up in Supplementary Figure S2).", "Finally, to test the persistence and viability of isolates in the soil, rhizospheric soil portions were sampled from each treatment. 1 g of each sample was diluted in Tween 80 (0.1% v/v) and plated in ISP3 medium supplemented with nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin. Results were evaluated after 4 days incubation at 30\u00b0C and reported as CFU/g soil rhizosphere.", "Fluorescence Microscopy", "An egfp tagged mutant from Streptomyces sp.

Bibb from the John Innes Centre-Norwich, United Kingdom) (Sun et al., 1999; Kieser et al., 2000; Willey et al., 2007), and transconjugants were selected into Apramycin ISP3 plates (100 \u03bcg/ml). Fluorescent transconjugants were further selected for gnotobiotic inoculation experiments as described before, using either semisolid Hoagland or sterile vermiculite supplemented with Apramycin (100 \u03bcg/ml). For these experiments, 15 plants were inoculated with A20pIJ8641, non-tagged Streptomyces A20, and a non-inoculated set of plants was included as a control. To assess the colonization process three roots were evaluated for each treatment at days 1, 2, 3, 10, and 15 days post inoculation. In each evaluation day, the roots were excised from the matrix, washed three times with sterile water and cut in 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm fragments.

After 4 days, 1 L of culture was centrifuged and spent supernatants were filter-sterilized using a 0.22 \u03bcm membrane. Bioassay-guided fractionation of A20 fermentation sterile supernatants was then performed by a sequential partition with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 500 mL), followed by butanol (4 \u00d7 500 mL) extraction (Supplementary Figure S3), to yield organic (EtOAc), butanolic and residual aqueous fraction (ABP fractions). Each fraction was evaporated to dryness and suspended into sterile water to be subjected to antibacterial assays. Active fractions were first purified by ultra-filtration by using 1, 3, and 10 kDa Amicon filters (Millipore).", "Several chromatographic techniques were used to purify antimicrobial compounds produced by strain Streptomyces A20. Briefly, residual aqueous fractions from butanol extraction were dried and suspended into buffer A (sodium acetate 0.05 M pH 5.5) to be loaded into a strong anion exchanger column, Q Sepharose Fast Flow, previously equilibrated and washed with buffer A, using a BioRad Biologic Duoflow chromatography system. Compounds bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl concentration (0\u20131M). Antimicrobial compounds present in the flowthrough, were purified by loading it into an S SepharoseTM Fast Flow column (cation exchange chromatography), and antimicrobial compounds were eluted again with a gradient of increasing NaCl concentration. Antimicrobial fractions were then suspended into 20 mM ammonium acetate, containing 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), and injected onto a semipreparative C18 reversed phase column (1x 25 cm). Three fractions were recovered due to their antibacterial activity and were further analyzed by LC-MS.", "Samples for LC-MS were dissolved in 90% methanol and 10 \u03bcl injected onto a Gemini C18 column (2 \u00d7 150 mm, 5 \u03bcm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, United States) and separated using a gradient from water to 90% acetronitrile mobile phases containing 0.1% formic acid at 0.2 ml min-1.
