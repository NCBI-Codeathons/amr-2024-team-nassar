["Materials and methods", "Preparation of Streptomyces spores", "Streptomyces coelicolor M145 was cultivated on cellophane discs on solid agar plates (0.4% yeast extract, 1% malt extract, 0.4% glucose, 2.5% bacterial agar, pH 7.2) at 28\u00b0C for 14 days. Harvested dormant spores were filtered through cotton wool and used to screen for associated secondary metabolites. Spores mixed with 20% glycerol were stored frozen at \u221220\u00b0C.", "Germination and microbial growth", "Spores were washed twice in 10 mL sterile distilled water and resuspended in 50 mL NMMP (Kieser et al., 2000), R3 (Shima et al., 1996), or AM (Bobek et al., 2004) liquid medium to a final spore concentration 108 ml\u22121. Glucose, glycerol, or mannitol was used as a carbon source. For boosting synchronicity of the population, spores were incubated for 10 min at 50\u00b0C, followed by 6-h germination at 37\u00b0C (Hirsch and Ensign, 1976a; Kieser et al., 2000) before screening for produced secondary metabolites.", "To prepare samples from the stationary phase of growth, S. coelicolor was further cultivated 48 h at 29\u00b0C in the same medium. The grown mycelium or supernatant was then used in the screening for produced secondary metabolites.", "Solid phase extraction of secondary metabolites", "Secondary metabolites were taken from the culture supernatants extracted using ethyl acetate (Rajan and Kannabiran, 2014), QuEChERS (Schenck and Hobbs, 2004), or solid phase extraction (Kamenik et al., 2010), which was found to be the most suitable and was carried out as follows. An Oasis HLB 3cc 60 mg cartridge (hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced sorbent, Waters, USA) was conditioned with 3 mL methanol (LC-MS grade, Biosolve, Netherlands), equilibrated with 3 mL water (prepared using Milli-Q water purifier, Millipore, USA) and then 3 mL culture supernatant (pH adjusted to 3 with formic acid, 98\u2013100%, Merck, Germany) was loaded. Subsequently, the cartridge was washed with 3 mL water and absorbed substances were eluted with 1.5 mL methanol. The eluent was evaporated to dryness (Concentrator Plus, 2013 model, Eppendorf), reconstituted in 200 \u03bcL 50% methanol and centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min.", "LC-MS analyses", "LC-MS analyses were performed on the Acquity UPLC system with 2996 PDA detection system (194 - 600 nm) connected to LCT premier XE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters, USA).

The analyses were performed under a linear gradient program (min/%B) 0/5; 1.5/5; 15/70; 18/99 followed by a 1.0-min column clean-up (99% B) and 1.5-min equilibration (5% B).

The mass accuracy was kept below 6 ppm using lock spray technology with leucine enkephalin as the reference compound (2 ng \u03bcL\u22121, 5 \u03bcL min\u22121). MS chromatograms were extracted for [M+H]+ ions with the tolerance window of 0.03 Da, smoothed with mean smoothing method (window size; 4 scans, number of smooths, 2). The data were processed by MassLynx V4.1 (Waters).", "Bioactivity assays", "Although albaflavenone is not commercially available, we have verified its presence using LC-MS in the hexane extract from the supernatant after 48 h of S. coelicolor's growth in R3 medium with glycerol as the carbon source. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min (7,000 \u00d7 g). The supernatant was extracted three times with 300 mL of n-hexane (Lach-Ner, Prague, Czech Republic). The cells were washed in distilled water and mycelial products were extracted with 200 mL of n-hexane. Cells were removed by filtration. After separation of the phases, the n-hexane layers were pooled (below called as albaflavenone-hexane extract, Figure 1B).", "Figure 1Albaflavenone.

Dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO) was purchased from Lach-Ner (Czech Republic). On a six-sector culture microtiter plate, ONA medium (1.4% Oxoid nutrient agar, pH 7.2; Kieser et al., 2000) with a linear concentration gradient of germicidin A 0\u20138 \u03bcg mL\u22121 (standard dissolved in sterile distilled water) or chalcone 0\u20138 \u03bcg mL\u22121 (standard dissolved in DMSO), or the albaflavenone-hexane extract (concentration unknown) was poured into three sectors as follows. Pure ONA medium was poured into an inclined plate and allowed to solidify to form a wedge; the plate was then placed horizontally and ONA medium containing selected compound in concentration 8 \u03bcg mL\u22121 was poured to form a complementary wedge. The remaining three sectors were filled with either pure ONA medium for control cultivation respective to germicidin A, or ONA medium with DMSO for control cultivation respective to chalcone, or ONA medium with hexane for control cultivation respective to albaflavenone. 105 spores were spread on each sector and incubated 48 h at 29\u00b0C. Number of colony-forming units (CFU) was assessed and compared.", "A dehydrogenase activity test", "Two milliliter of the albaflavenone-hexane extract was mixed with 5 mL R3 medium with glycerol and used for 6 h germination of 5 \u00d7 106 spores. A negative control culture was performed in 5 mL R3 medium with glycerol with 2 mL pure hexane. The dehydrogenase activity test (as described in Burdock et al., 2011) was used to measure metabolic activity of germinating spores by means of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC). After the germination course, cells were incubated in the presence of TTC and an electron-donating substrate for 1 h. Rising triphenyl formazan (TF) was extracted using ethanol and its concentration was determined colorimetrically by measuring the optical density at wavelength of 484 nm. The absorbances were compared between the tested and negative control samples.", "Scanning electron microscopy", "Streptomyces spores were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. The fixed spores were extensively washed and then allowed to sediment at 4\u00b0C overnight onto circular coverslips treated with poly-L-lysine. The coverslips with attached spores were dehydrated through an alcohol series followed by absolute acetone and critical point dried from liquid CO2 in a K850 Critical Point Dryer (Quorum Technologies Ltd, Ringmer, UK). The dried samples were sputter-coated with 3 nm of platinum in a Q150T Turbo-Pumped Sputter Coater (Quorum Technologies Ltd, Ringmer, UK). The final samples were examined in a FEI Nova NanoSEM scanning electron microscope (FEI, Brno, Czech Republic) at 5 kV using CBS and TLD detectors. Beam deceleration mode of scanning electron microscope was used in some cases for minimization of charging artifacts."]
