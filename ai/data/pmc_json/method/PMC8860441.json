Full-length genomic regions for annotated human CEACAMs were used as query sequences. A full record of CEACAM orthologs identified and a partial record of BLAST results, including date accessed, query coverage and identity, as well as information on synteny, are listed in Figure 2\u2014source data 1A-C. Orthology was established by sequence identity, reciprocal best-BLAST hit, as well as intron structure and synteny. In total, we were able to extract 186 primate CEACAM sequences for analysis. We could not identify orthologs of every human CEACAM in every primate species, in some cases because of lineage-specific gains and losses and in some cases likely because of incomplete genome assembly. As a result, the number of primate orthologs available for evolutionary analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction for each human CEACAM range from 11 to 19 (Figure 2\u2014source data 1A).", "Sequence alignment and trimming", "Orthologous protein-coding sequences were extracted from CEACAM genes as follows. Multiple sequence alignments of the full-length gene were done using MAFFT alignment software as implemented in Geneious Prime 2020.2.2 with default settings. Alignments were manually corrected to correspond to human exon splice sites. Regions corresponding to human exons were then extracted, realigned, and minimally trimmed so all sequences were in-frame and orthologous codons aligned. So as not to exclude any protein-coding regions from evolutionary analysis, all human exons for a given CEACAM were concatenated and treated as a single protein-coding sequence. Consequently, representations of CEACAM proteins in figures are not necessarily indicative of mature peptides, but rather represent all parts of the CEACAM protein that could potentially have been subject to positive selection. Gaps in alignments were removed for evolutionary analyses (Figure 2\u2014source data 2) but were retained for tree building (Figure 4\u2014source data 1).", "CEACAM3 exons", "Almost all Old World monkey CEACAM3 genes analyzed had two extra exons annotated compared to humans. These exons are located between the exon encoding the N-domain and the transmembrane domain and are predicted by InterProScan (Quevillon et al., 2005), as implemented in Geneious Prime 2020.2.2, to encode the IgC-like domains typical of this region of CEACAM proteins. The majority of Old World monkeys have two exons annotated and all primates, including hominids, have strongly conserved sequences in this region, though hominids all encode premature stop codons. With the exception of the second IgC exon in colobus, these exons would allow for the translation of full-length CEACAM proteins. While exon annotation differences between primate CEACAM genes is not unusual, the conservation of these sequences across primates containing a CEACAM3 gene, including in hominids where they are not annotated, is striking. To the best of our knowledge CEACAM3 transcripts for humans or other primates including either of these extra IgC domains have not been reported. Indeed, the exon closest to the N-domain likely does not encode a functional protein in most hominids as a result of a premature stop codon. However, the strong conservation of these sequences across primates could indicate these exons encode functional protein segments in at least some species. For this reason, these exons and their orthologous sequences in hominids were included in downstream evolutionary analyses.", "CEACAM5 trimming", "The differences in number and likely arrangement of IgC domains in primate CEACAM5 orthologs prevented alignment of all full-length CEACAM5 genes into a single multiple sequence alignment for extracting human orthologous protein-coding sequences. Instead, sequences were first aligned in three groups: New World monkeys, leaf-eating monkeys (black-and-white colobus, black snub-nosed monkey, and golden snub-nosed monkey), and the remaining Old World monkey sequences with the hominid sequences. There were enough similarities with human exons for orthologous exon sequences to be assigned and extracted for New World monkeys and the Old World monkey/Hominid group, but not for the leaf-eating monkeys group. For leaf-eating monkeys the predicted exons in common between species in this group were extracted. After extracting coding sequences for each group individually, the extracted sequences were then aligned in a single multiple sequence alignment. However, the large gaps caused by missing IgC sequences relative to human CEACAM5 posed a problem for evolutionary analyses which require gaps to be removed from sequences prior to analysis. We were concerned that choices made regarding which sequences were removed would unduly influence the results of evolutionary analyses or result in lower coverage of the evolutionary history of the entire coding sequence. To account for this, three strategies of trimming alignment gaps were carried out and the results of each used in separate evolutionary analyses. For the first strategy (datasets 1 and 4) every species whose sequence contained gaps corresponding to missing IgC domains was removed. These species were black-and-white colobus, black snub-nosed monkey, golden snub-nosed monkey, drill, sooty mangabey, and common marmoset. This resulted in the longest sequence for analysis (2 kb) including six predicted IgC domains, but the smallest number of species represented (12). In the second strategy (datasets 2 and 5) primate sequences with gaps corresponding to the largest number of missing IgC domains (4) were removed, while those with only two missing domains were retained, and the alignment region containing the sequence gap caused by the missing domains removed, giving a smaller alignment (1.4 kb, with four IgC domains), but more species (16). For this strategy sooty mangabey, and common marmoset were removed from the analysis. For the third strategy (datasets 3 and 6) all species for which complete CEACAM5 gene sequences could be identified were retained and all gaps corresponding to missing IgC domains removed. This gave the smallest sequence (0.9 kb, retaining two IgC domains), but provided the largest number of represented species (18). Evolutionary analyses for these strategies are included in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1, Figure 2\u2014source data 1A and B, and Figure 2\u2014source data 3.", "Alignment comparison between MAFFT and MUSCLE", "To confirm that our alignment method was not biasing the assignment of orthology of coding sequences to human exons, we compared the results of alignments of extracted exons using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and the alternative program MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004), both as implemented in Geneious Prime 2020.2.2. With the exceptions of CEACAM7 and CEACAM5, there were no drastic changes between alignments performed using MAFFT and those done using MUSCLE. Upon inspection the discrepancy between MAFFT and MUSCLE alignments for CEACAM7 could be attributed to an approximately 7 kb insertion in the orangutan CEACAM7 gene relative to all other primates. Upon removing this insertion alignments with both MAFFT and MUSCLE were in agreement. Discrepancies between alignments of CEACAM5 with MAFFT and MUSCLE were due to differences in how the programs aligned sequences corresponding to IgC domains, likely as a result of differences in the number and possibly the arrangement of these domains between primates. MAFFT and MUSCLE alignments were carried out for each of the three different trimmed versions of CEACAM5 (see above) and each set of sequence alignments was tested using each of the evolutionary analysis methods. All other evolutionary analyses were carried out using sequences trimmed according to MAFFT alignments.", "The results of CEACAM5 evolutionary analyses were largely similar regardless of which alignment or trimming method was employed, identifying similar patterns of selection (sites under selection concentrated in the N-domain) and many of the same sites under selection. Results presented in the paper are for dataset 1 (ds1) which contains the largest number of domains and using the MAFFT alignment to match the method used for other CEACAM analyses presented. Results for alternative CEACAM5 trimming and alignment methods are included in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1, Figure 2\u2014source data 1A and B, and Figure 2\u2014source data 3.", "Bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain sequence verification", "For initial verification of the bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain sequence, we utilized currently available bonobo genome sequence data. Reads were not available for the genome assembly from which bonobo CEACAM sequences were identified for the evolutionary analyses described here. However, a more recent assembly of a different bonobo individual became available during the course of this study and sequencing reads for this new de novo assembly were deposited (Mao et al., 2021). The CEACAM1 genomic region of the newer assembly was 99% identical to the older version while the coding sequences differ at only a single nucleotide outside of the N-domain. Furthermore, examining the reads used to assemble the newer genome we confirmed that multiple reads covered the length of the bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain and included the highly diverged nucleotides of the binding region in contiguous reads. Additionally, we examined CEACAM1 sequences for the 13 bonobo individuals sequenced as part of the Great Apes Genome Project (Prado-Martinez et al., 2013). Genomes for these individuals were constructed using a reference-based assembly method to the human genome. The assembled sequences largely supported the highly diverged N-domain seen in the reference genome; however, there was a 31 bp region that was identical to the human CEACAM1 sequence rather than the two de novo bonobo sequences. Examining reads from these individuals failed to support human sequences at this position and in fact supported the more divergent sequence seen in the bonobo de novo assemblies.", "To further validate our results, we directly sequenced the bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain region by Sanger sequencing. Briefly, the nucleotide sequence of the bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain was amplified and sequenced from a sample of genomic DNA isolated from bonobo AG05253 (Elde et al., 2009) (a gift from Nels Elde). Products of the size expected for the region of CEACAM1 targeted in an initial PCR were isolated by size selection on a 1% agarose gel. This product was purified from the gel and used as template for further amplification of the N-domain region of bonobo CEACAM1 with a second set of primers. After gel purification this product was sequenced through GeneWiz (South Plainfield, NJ) using custom primers.

CEACAM21 sequences were included in subsequent phylogenetic reconstructions.", "CEACAM-coding sequences and specific amino acids were tested for evidence of positive selection using the PAML NS sites program under the codon model F3 \u00d7 4 (Yang, 2007). A relevant primate species tree, based on primate species relationships detailed in Pecon-Slattery, 2014, was provided for each analysis (Figure 2\u2014source data 2). To determine the likelihood a gene was evolving under positive selection, likelihood ratio tests were performed comparing the models of selection M1&M2 as well as M7&M8 (Figure 2\u2014source data 1D; Bielawski, 2013). Sites evolving under positive selection (Figure 2\u2014source data 1E) were identified by PAML using the Bayes empirical Bayes analysis as implemented in the NS sites package for evolutionary Model 2, which has been shown to be more robust to error due to recombination than the alternative, Model 8, when identifying sites under selection (Anisimova et al., 2003). In addition, sites under selection were identified using the HyPhy package programs FUBAR and MEME (Murrell et al., 2013; Murrell et al., 2012) as implemented on the Datamonkey web servers (https://www.datamonkey.org and classic.datamonkey.org, respectively) (Delport et al., 2010; Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005; Pond et al., 2005; Weaver et al., 2018). For FUBAR and initial MEME analyses, species trees of the relevant primates were provided to inform analyses of evolution. HyPhy GARD analyses (classic.datamonkey.org) were used to identify evidence of recombination and the number and approximate locations of breakpoints (Figure 2\u2014source data 1E, Figure 2\u2014source data 3; Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006). When GARD detects evidence of recombination the program splits sequence alignments at the predicted breakpoint and creates new phylogenies for each set of sequences. These updated GARD-informed phylogenies for CEACAM sequences were used for MEME analyses to account for errors in calling sites under selection due to recombination. Prior to running MEME and GARD analyses the \u2018automatic model selection tool\u2019 provided by classic.datamonkey.org was used to determine the most appropriate model of selection under which to run analyses. For PAML, sites with posterior probability >0.95 were considered to have strong support to be evolving under positive selection (Yang et al., 2005), while >0.9 posterior probability supported sites found by FUBAR (Murrell et al., 2013), and p-values \u2264 0.05 supported sites found by MEME (Murrell et al., 2012).

Multiple sequence alignments on which tree constructions were based were done by translation alignment using default settings of the MAFFT sequence alignment software as implemented in Geneious Prime 2020.2.2. For domain-specific phylogenetic reconstruction domains were identified using InterProScan (Quevillon et al., 2005) in Geneious Prime. Assignments for immunoglobulin-like domains, that is, the IgV-like (N-domain) and IgC domains were based on predictions by the Superfamily database (Wilson et al., 2009) and cytoplasmic domain assignments were based on the PHOBIUS database (K\u00e4ll et al., 2004). Transmembrane domains were excluded from analyses due to their particularly small sequence length, which can make tree building unreliable due to limited phylogenetically informative sites. Indeed, relatively short sequence lengths for the other domains, typically around 300 bp or less, along with often high sequence similarity likely decreased the reliability and statistical support for our domain trees. However, even with these limitations in many cases relationships between domains were resolved with high bootstrap support, particularly for peripheral nodes and clades and for CEACAMs not found to be evolving rapidly. Phylogenetic reconstructions of sequence alignments (Figure 4\u2014source data 1) were done using the PhyML 3.0 web browser (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/) with default settings and confidence testing by 1000 bootstrap replicates (Guindon et al., 2010).", "Data visualization", "Visualization of evolutionary analyses, phylogenetic trees, sequence identity, and haplotype frequencies was done in R (R Development Core Team, 2019) using the R packages BiocManager (Morgan, 2019), treeio (Wang et al., 2020), ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), ggtree (Yu et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2017), evobiR (Blackmon and Adams, 2015), and ggforce (Pedersen, 2021).
