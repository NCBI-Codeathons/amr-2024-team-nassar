["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Identification and transmembrane domain analysis of TTRs within the MiST database.", "TTRs for a representative set of genomes were collected from the MiST database by running a custom Python script on the local computer cluster (73). The script, which is available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/bioliners/TTRs), sends requests through the database API and processes the results. For each genome, all DNA-binding signal transduction proteins that contain transmembrane regions were retrieved (see File S2 in the supplemental material). The Pfam Profile hidden Markov models of DNA-binding domains listed on the help page of the MiST database were used to identify DNA-binding domains in the proteins. All DNA-binding domains identified in TTRs and those that were checked but not identified are listed in Table S1. TM regions of the protein sequences were identified by running TMHMM, domains were verified using TREND and Pfam profile hidden Markov models (74\u201376). Sequences corresponding to transmembrane regions were extracted using a custom Python script. The average length, number of amino acids, and surface area for each TTR transmembrane region were calculated from data in Files S4 to S6 using a Python script. Taxonomy information for the genomes was retrieved from GTDB database (36; see File S1 for data). All used scripts are available in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/bioliners/TTRs).", "Calculating statistical parameters of TTRs.", "The total number of all signal transduction (ST) proteins encoded in each analyzed genome was obtained from MiST database (73). The genome size and the number of all encoded proteins were obtained from the metadata tables of GTDB (36; see Files S1 and S7 in the supplemental material). These data were cross-referenced with the number of encoded TTRs in each genome using Excel. For statistical analysis, we considered phyla or classes that contained at least 10 sequenced genomes. By running Shapiro-Wilk test and exploring quantile-quantile plots, we have established that TTR counts are not normally distributed. Therefore, we used two nonparametric tests, Spearman and Kendall correlation tests, to explore correlations. Prior to performing correlation tests, we subtracted TTR counts from the overall counts of ST proteins and ST protein counts from the sum of all proteins encoded in each genome. This was done to remove the contribution of correlation of TTR and ST proteins with themselves. Statistical analysis was carried out in the R environment.", "Data availability.", "The data presented here are available from the corresponding authors upon request."]
