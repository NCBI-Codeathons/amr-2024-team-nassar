Cell lysates (20\u2009\u03bcg) from wild-type S. coelicolor were separated on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was washed with distilled water and soaked in 20\u2009mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) containing 30\u2009\u03bcM riboflavin and 30\u2009mM tetramethylethylenediamine for 30\u2009min in the dark. The gel was transferred to 20\u2009mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) containing 2.5\u2009mM nitroblue tetrazolium for 20\u2009min in the dark. The gel was illuminated with white light until an SOD activity band appeared.", "Gene deletion and overexpression.", "Streptomyces coelicolor deletion mutants were constructed by homologous recombination. In brief, flanking regions (upstream and downstream; up to \u223c1\u2009kb) of the gene were amplified by PCR and cloned into pKC1139 digested with BamHI/HindIII using Gibson assembly. Sequence-verified clones were introduced into nonmethylating E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 and transmitted into S. coelicolor via conjugation. Single-crossover strains were selected with 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL apramycin, and double crossover was induced through liquid culture at 38\u00b0C.

After incubation at 30\u00b0C for 48 h, an inhibition zone was observed.", "Antibiotic sensitivity assay.", "To enumerate antibiotic sensitivity, relative growth (%) and number of CFU (CFU/mL) were determined. Antibiotic and iron treatments were done at various concentrations using the early exponential-phase cells. After 8 h (for S. coelicolor) or 16 h (for M. smegmatis) of treatment, relative growth (%) was calculated by determining the ratio of the OD600 value of the culture to that of the nontreated control. Along with OD600 measurements, aliquots from cultures were subjected to viable counts on NA plates. CFU/mL were enumerated after 48 h of incubation.", "Intracellular iron quantification.", "Intracellular iron quantification was conducted as described previously (48) with slight modification. Briefly, the cells were lysed by ice-cold phosphate buffer saline using sonication. Cell lysate (100\u2009\u03bcL) was mixed with 100\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mM HCl and an iron-releasing solution (2.25% [wt/vol] KMnO4, 0.7 M HCl), incubated at 60\u00b0C for 2 h, and then subjected to cooling to room temperature, followed by the addition of 30\u2009\u03bcL of an iron-releasing solution (6.5\u2009mM ferrozine, 6.5\u2009mM neocuproine, 2.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 M ascorbic acid).

Early exponential-phase cells were diluted 1:10 with fresh medium, 200\u2009\u03bcL of which was dispensed into a 96-well plate with 2-fold serially diluted antibiotics, with or without 250 \u03bcM FeCl3. After 12 h of incubation (for S. coelicolor) or 36 h of incubation (for M. smegmatis), 30\u2009\u03bcL of 0.03% resazurin solution was added to each well. After an additional 3 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C for color change, the lowest concentrations with no color change (i.e., blue color remained unchanged) were scored as the MIC values. The minimum lethal concentration (MLC) was determined by directly plating the content (10\u2009\u03bcL) of the wells at concentrations higher than the MIC value. After 48 h of incubation, the lowest concentrations with no colony formation were determined as the MLC values.", "Translation rate measurement.", "S. coelicolor cells at the early exponential phase (OD600 of \u223c0.3) were treated with kanamycin and iron for 30\u2009min, followed by treatment with EasyTag l-[35S]methionine (1 \u03bcCi) (PerkinElmer) at 30\u00b0C for 10\u2009min.

Total mapped reads were separated by strand specificity using bamSplit v2.4.0 and sam_merge2 v1.2.0. Strand-specific mapping data were counted using featurecounts v1.6.4. Normalized expression data were analyzed using the DESeq2 package in R for identification of differential expressed genes (DEGs).

Proteins in the cell lysate were depleted by using a 10-kDa centrifugal filter (Merck). One half of the cell lysate and the other half that had been incubated at 60\u00b0C for 30\u2009min to deplete NAD+ were used to determine the quantity of the total (i.e., both NAD+ and NADH) NAD and that of NADH, respectively. Each sample was treated with cycling enzymes for 5\u2009min and mixed with a colorimetric probe. After incubation for 1.5 h, the OD450 was measured for the NAD/NADH quantity normalized by dry cell weight to calculate the ratio of NAD+ and NADH.", "ATP quantification.", "The ATP level was quantified using the BacTiter-Glo microbial cell viability assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After treatment with kanamycin and/or iron for 30 min, 100\u2009\u03bcL of culture medium was mixed with an equal volume of BacTiter-Glo reagent on a 96-well plate.
