BRA-346 was grown in 25\u2009ml of A1 liquid medium with 1\u2009ml of 20% (v/v) mycelial stock at 28\u00b0C for 48\u2009h with shaking. Then, 1\u2009ml of the seed culture was inoculated into 500\u2009ml flasks (equipped with helical springs) with 100\u2009ml of A1 liquid medium. Cultures were grown for 7\u2009days at 28\u00b0C and 220\u2009rpm. To test different media, BRA-346 was grown in A1, TSB, TSBY, or ISP2 media under the same conditions.", "Elicitation Experiments", "Testing of chemical elicitors was performed as described previously (de Fel\u00edcio et al., 2021). Briefly, BRA-346 was inoculated in 10\u2009ml of A1 medium at 28\u00b0C, 200\u2009rpm for 48\u2009h. One-hundred microliter of culture was plated onto SFM agar media and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 72\u2009h. The chemical elicitors were added to the solid media plates using an automated pipette to dispense 5\u2009\u03bcl drops of each chemical elicitor onto the bacteria layer. The chemical elicitors used were: ampicillin 100 or 10\u2009\u03bcg/ml, chloramphenicol 300 or 30\u2009\u03bcg/ml (prepared in ethanol), kanamycin 100 or 10\u2009\u03bcg/ml, streptomycin sulfate 50 or 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml, sodium butyrate 50 or 5\u2009\u03bcM, procaine 100 or 10\u2009\u03bcM, DMSO 100 or 2% or EDTA 10 or 1\u2009mM. Water and ethanol were used as controls. Plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 72\u2009h. Alterations on colony morphology were visually inspected and recorded, following the described in de Fel\u00edcio et al. (2021), and used to select the chemical elicitors for liquid culture. The liquid cultures for the elicitation tests were performed as described above, with the addition of the chemical elicitors 72\u2009h after BRA-346 inoculum.", "DNA Sequencing, Assembly, Annotation, and Genome Mining", "The BRA-346 genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, United States). Before sequencing, the quality of the extraction was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The genomic DNA was sequenced by the Macrogen laboratory (South Korea, Seoul), using the HiSeq System platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, United States). Paired-end reads were quality checked using FastQC and processed with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) to remove low quality reads and adapters sequences.1 QC reads were de novo assembled using the A5-miseq pipeline (Coil et al., 2015). Genome quality and completeness were evaluated using both Quast and CheckM (Gurevich et al., 2013; Parks et al., 2015). Gene prediction and annotation were performed with Prokka (Seemann, 2014) and BGCs were further predicted using the antiSMASH web server version 6.0.1 (Blin et al., 2021).

M1146 and M1146-epn/tmc cultures were supplemented with 25\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcl nalidixic acid, and M1146-epn/tmc was also supplemented with 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml kanamycin.", "Extraction and Fractionation", "The cultures of Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 (100\u2009ml), S. coelicolor M1146 (100\u2009ml), and M1146-epn/tmc (100\u2009ml), along with the culture medium A1 (control), were extracted by liquid\u2013liquid partition with ethyl acetate. The biomass was filtered with glass filters (22\u2009\u03bcm) after adding the solvent and before phase separation. The extraction was repeated twice by adding 40\u2009ml of ethyl acetate to 100\u2009ml of BRA-346 cultures. The organic phase was collected and dried under reduced pressure at 35\u00b0C. The crude extracts were submitted to solid-phase separation using C8 cartridge (Discovery\u00ae DSC-8 SPE Tube, Supelco) using H2O:MeOH gradient, yielding three fractions: 5% (F5), 50% (F50), and 100% (F100) of methanol. Crude extract and fraction samples were resuspended in DMSO to a final concentration of 10\u2009mg/ml. All samples were analyzed by UPLC\u2013MS/MS.", "LC\u2013MS/MS Data Collection", "LC-MS/MS data collection was performed as described previously (de Fel\u00edcio et al., 2021). For UPLC\u2013MS/MS chemical profile, 2\u2009\u03bcl aliquots of the samples (extracts and fractions) were injected on a BEH C18 reversed-phase column (1.7\u2009\u03bcm, 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009mm) attached to a compatible pre-column, using an Acquity H-Class UPLC Waters (Waters, Milford, MA, United States) system coupled to a Bruker Impact II UHR-ESI-QqTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, United States). A solvent system of water (A), acetonitrile (B) 2% formic acid (C) methanol (D), was used to compose the following analytical method: 0.5\u2009ml/min flow rate; column temperature 40\u00b0C; 0\u20131\u2009min, 5% B; 1\u20136\u2009min, 5% B to 35% B (curve 6); 6\u201310\u2009min, 35% B to 95% B (curve 1); 10\u201312\u2009min, 95% B; 12\u201315\u2009min, 95% D (curve 1); 15\u201318\u2009min for column equilibration on initial phase. C was kept constant, at 5% (final concentration of 0.1%). The mass spectrometer worked in positive ion mode scanning mass in the 30\u20132,000\u2009Da range, with acquisition rate of 8\u2009Hz. End plate offset\u2009=\u2009500 Volts (V); Vcap 4,500\u2009V; nebulizer 4.0\u2009bar; drying gas (N2) flow 10\u2009L/min; drying gas temperature 200\u00b0C, followed by an MS/MS scan for the most intense ions in a cycle time of 1\u2009s, absolute threshold (per 1,000 sum.) of 1,500 cts. As MS2 rules, mass ratio (m/z) below 200\u2009Da were excluded, and the \u201cactive exclusion\u201d function was enabled. Each run was automatically calibrated using HCOONa (10\u2009mM). Calibrated spectra were converted to mzXML files through Data Analysis 4.3 and included bio tools CompassXport (Bruker Daltonics, version 4.0.0.8).", "NP3 MS Workflow", "Data processing and analysis were done with an in-house collection of scripts called NP3 Mass Spectrometry (MS) Workflow, as previously described (de Fel\u00edcio et al., 2021) with some parameter modifications to adjust sample properties. The beta version of the NP3 MS workflow is freely available in our repository (accessed on 13 Aug 2021) with a detailed manual and a command line interface.2 The Ionization Variant Annotation Molecular Networking (IVAMN) was used as the base to select and exclude nodes present in chromatographic blanks (BLANKS) samples and their first immediate neighbors. Then, the remained nodes marked as \u201cprotonated representative\u201d (column \u201cprotonated_representative\u201d equals 1 at the nodes count table) were selected and filtered at the Spectra Similarity Molecular Network (SSMN). The raw SSMN was created with a minimum cosine similarity score for an edge connection of 0.6 and filtered with a maximum component size of 200 and a maximum number of connections for one single node of 15. IVAMN and SSMN construction at Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) were done with an in-house python script that automates some tasks using the py2cytoscape library (accessed on 13 Aug 2021).3 After these automated steps, some other undesirable nodes like the ones marked as culture media (BED) and the single nodes were manually removed leaving a clean network to process and analyze. MS/MS chemical structure annotation was performed using spectra matches to the GNPS (Wang et al., 2016b) and the UNPD-ISDB (Allard et al., 2016) databases. Annotations were manually revised and the related MS/MS clusters were grouped and named by the chemical groups found in the SSMN.", "BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC Phylogenetic Analysis", "Sequences were collected from antiSMASH ClusterBlast and KnownClusterBlast (Blin et al., 2021), from the antiSMASH-database (ClusterBlast Hit and KnownClusterBlast Hit for experimentally validated epoxyketone peptides BGCs; Blin et al., 2017), from the BiG-FAM database (querying the 29,955 Biosynthetic Gene Families, previously calculated using BiG-SLICE from a collection of more than 1.2 million Biosynthetic Gene Cluster; Kautsar et al., 2021a,b), and from MultiGeneBlast (Medema et al., 2013) run on the bacteria GenBank database from 2013 and a custom Streptomyces database from GenBank (2,526 NCBI GenBank Assemblies), using BRA-346 epn/tmc, Streptomyces hygroscopicus eponemycin and S. chromofuscus TMC-86A BGCs as probes. The best hit sequences, indicated by their closest relationship with BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC (low distance and high cumulative BLAST hit score), all carrying the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene, were aligned with BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC at nucleotide level with the multiple sequence alignment MAFFT v11 program (Katoh and Standley, 2013) using Geneious Prime (v.2021.2.2). Regions of poor alignment were inspected, and sequence refinement was done with Trimal software (Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009; Method: Automated1). Construction of maximum likelihood trees from the alignment was conducted using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) v11 software (Tamura et al., 2021) after statistical selection of the best-fit model of evolution with jModelTest2 tool (Darriba et al., 2012)."]
