["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Strains, plasmids and primers", "Strains, plasmids and primer sequences used in this study are summarized in Supplementary Data. Growth and fermentation of S. sahachiroi and isolation of azinomycin B were performed as described previously (20). Streptomyces and Escherichia coli strains were cultured and manipulated as previously reported (21). Restriction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enzymes were purchased from Fermentas or Takara. PCR primers were synthesized by GenScript. DNA fragments were cloned generally through amplification using the high PCR fidelity DNA polymerase KOD-plus- (TOBOYO).", "Detection of azinomycin resistance", "Detection of azinomycin resistance was executed in the orf1 gene deletion mutants and the azinomycin-sensitive strains expressing Orf1 by both disc diffusion test and cross streak method. In the disc diffusion test, filter paper discs spotted with azinomycin B were laid on lawns of the mutant strains, and incubated at 30\u00b0C for two days. Resistance levels to azinomycin B were determined by analysis of inhibition zones. In the cross streak method, a single streak of the wild type strain ATCC33158 (positive control), and the non-azinomycin-producing strain \u0394aziU3 (negative control), were independently inoculated onto GYM medium and incubated at 30\u00b0C for two days, allowing the active organisms to produce and secrete azinomycin B into the medium. The azinomycin-sensitive strains expressing Orf1 were subsequently streaked perpendicularly across growth lines of the control strains, and incubated at 30\u00b0C for another two days. Absence of growth adjacent to the wild type strain indicated inhibition of tested cultures.", "Electrophoretic mobility shift assay", "DNA fragments were acquired by using PCR or annealed with primers listed in Supplementary Table S3. Each DNA fragment was incubated with various amounts of Orf1 protein in 20 \u03bcl of a reaction solution (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol and 60 mM KCl) at 30\u00b0C for 30 min. The mixture was electrophoresed through a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) in 0.5\u00d7 Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE) and observed after ethidium bromide or SYBR Gold staining. Binding activity of Orf1 to the probe Porf7 labeled with biotin was determined using a chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol.", "Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay", "Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using the EZ-ChIPTM kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antisera used in these ChIP assays were raised by immunization of mice with recombinant Orf1. Procedures for chromatin preparation and immunoprecipitation were detailed in Supplementary Methods. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated twice.", "DNA cross-linking assay", "DNA cross-linking assays were performed as previously described (22\u201324). DNA was reacted with azinomycin B for DNA cross-linking under typical conditions (25 mM triethanolamine, 1mM EDTA, pH7.2, 37\u00b0C for 1 h). Samples were denatured with 0.05 M NaOH for 5 min and then detected by gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, ICL formation of DNA could be achieved by adding the drug directly to the DNA solution for a short incubation. However, this method was not as effective as the typical condition.", "DNA protection assay", "For drug binding assays, an appropriate amount of azinomycin B and excess Orf1 were first incubated together in the SGDM buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2) at 30\u00b0C for 20 min, linearized pBluescript SK(+) DNA was then supplemented. For site protection assays, substrate DNA and sufficient Orf1 were incubated together at 30\u00b0C for 15 min. DNA\u2013protein complexes were then incubated with azinomycin B at increasing concentrations. The above samples were denatured with 0.05 M NaOH for 5 min prior to electrophoresis.", "DNA repair assay", "A reaction buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing excess protein Orf1, 32.8 nM cross-linked linearized pBluescript SK(+) DNA or native DNA was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were either untreated or denatured with alkali and then separated in a 1% agarose gel.", "DNA cleavage assay", "28 nM supercoiled pOJ260 DNA or 32.8 nM linearized pBluescript SK(+) DNA was treated with azinomycin B at 37\u00b0C for 2.5 h. For oligodeoxynucleotides (3.75 \u03bcM), the reaction mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 h. Following extraction of the residual drug with an appropriate amount of chloroform, cross-linked DNA was incubated with Orf1 for 20 min at 30\u00b0C. For AP endonuclease cleavage, the Orf1-treated DNA was subject to the reaction with 1 U Endonuclease IV for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. All proteins were subsequently removed by digestion with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C prior to gel detection."]
