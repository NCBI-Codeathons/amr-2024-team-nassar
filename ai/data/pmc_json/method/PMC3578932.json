["Materials and Methods", "Culture Techniques and Genetic Manipulation", "S. griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov was cultivated with SFM agar plate at 30\u00b0C to collect spores, with YEME culture medium to produce mycelium. Isolation of total DNA and conjugation assay were carried out according to Kieser et al [22]. Operations on E. coli were referred to Sambrook et al [23]. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, KOD polymerase and alkaline phosphatase were purchased from MBI Fermentas.", "Construction of S. griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov Genomic Library", "CopyControl\u2122 Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA) was directly used for the genomic library construction. High-molecular-weight chromosomal DNA was derived by fracturing total DNA with mechanical force and repaired to blunt end with specific enzyme provided in the kit. Then the end-repaired DNA was fractionated through low-melting temperature agarose in pulsed field [24]. DNA fragment of about 36 kb was excised from the agarose gel and processed with agarase. The resolved DNA was ligated to the vector pCC1FOS (Table S2). Packaging and transduction into EPI300-T1R plating cells was attained with \u03bb-packaging mixes that were offered in the kit (Table S1) [24]. The chloramphenicol resistant colonies were picked one by one and inoculated in LB (100 mL) that contained chloramphenicol in each well of 14 96-well plates. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 20 hr on shaker, 50% glycerol (100 mL) was added into each well for storage at \u221280\u00b0C.", "PCR Primers and DNA Probes", "ecm1 and trsA encode AMP-binding ligases respectively in S. lasaliensis and S. triostinicus which were proposed to activate QXC before its loading onto PCP. trsA and ecm1 have high identity and hence their concensus could be used to design highly conserved primers Adef and Ader for screening the gene cluster among the genomic library. PCR product of about 600 bp was derived after 30 cycles of reactions with the total DNA of S. griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov as template and resolved by agarose gel (0.8%) electrophoresis. DNA Gel Extraction Kit (V-gene Biotechnology Ltd.) was used to retrieve the targeted 600 bp band, which was subsequently cloned into pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) for sequencing. The high sequence similarity of the PCR product to ecm1 (75%) and trsA (97%) validated the pair of primers for searching the genomic library for the gene cluster in question. the cells in the same row of 96-well plate were mixed together and inoculated in chloramphenicol containing LB. After 12 hr of culture at 37\u00b0C, plasmids were extracted to be used as template for PCR with the pair of primers qui16f and qui16r. The expectant 600 bp product emerged from two samples which correspond to two rows of the 14 96-well plates, subsequently, cells in each well of the two rows was inoculated individually to supply the template for PCR. In the same way, two clones containing the AMP-binding ligase gene were identified.", "Sequence Analysis", "Gene cluster was sequenced at Shanghai Major Biotechnology Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and multiple sequence alignment was performed with BioEdit 7.0. Open-reading frames (ORFs) and ribosome binding sites (RBS) were predicted through Frame-Plot 3.0.

The resistance cassette of about 1.4 kb was obtained by PCR with the template pIJ778 and a pair of primers qui17dF and qui17dR. The resulting fragment was introduced into competent E. coli BW25113/pIJ790/K311 (Table S1) [25] by electroporation to replace a 400 bp fragment sited in the qui17 via double crossover, yielding the recombinant plasmid pJTU5901 (Table S2). The clone containing pJTU5901 was screened by PCR with primers qui17dF and qui17dR (Table S3). pJTU5901 was introduced into E. coli ET12567 which could be used to transfer pJTU5901 into S. griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov by conjugation (Table S1).

Elution was monitored with a photodiode array detector at 280 nm and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS analysis was carried out in the positive mode.", "Construction of pET28-a(+) Derived Vector pCT28", "The construction of pCT28 was achieved through targeted mutagenesis on three sites of pET-28a. Three pairs of primers were used in PCR with the template of plasmid pET-28a. First, the primer pair ct1 was designed to remove the original XbaI site and meanwhile introduce a KpnI site (which was not existent in pET-28a). The PCR product was digested with KpnI and processed with T4 DNA ligase so that the two ends of the linear product could be connected to form a circular plasmid, the ligation product was transformed into DH10b and the positive clone pJTU5903 was picked out, plasmid pJTU5903 was used as the template for the next PCR mutagensis step. Second, the primer pair of ct2 and another pair of ct3 were used respectively to get the larger and smaller PCR products, both of which had XbaI and SpeI site respectively at two ends, thus a new XbaI site and a SpeI site would be introduced in pCT28 accordingly closely upstream the BglII site and downstream the T7 terminator of pET-28a. The two kinds of products were both digested with XbaI and SpeI and then ligated together by T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was transformed into DH10b, and the positive transformant with pCT28 was screened, which have all the necessary expression elements and MCS between XbaI and SpeI site (Table S2).", "Preparation of qui5, qui15, qui17and qui18 Expression Constructs and Coexpression Construct of qui5 and qui18", "For construction of qui5, qui15, qui17 and qui18 expression plasmids, the four genes were amplified from fosmid K311 by PCR respectively with the primers Exqui5, Exqui15, Exqui17and Exqui18 (Table S3).
