["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Fungal species.", "The data consisted of 50 Aspergillus and 1 Penicillium species with available whole-genome sequencing data, which were downloaded from the JGI database (5, 6, 25). Species information, including GenBank accession numbers, can be found in Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material.", "Input data.", "All data are stored as csv/sql files in a folder on Zenodo and can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2560245. The data used in the pipeline were organized in a MySQL database; an overview of the input data can be found in the file Input_data_pipeline.txt. The data include predicted secondary metabolite gene clusters based on an implementation of the SMURF pipeline (21) described previously (6). Homologous protein families were created with Aspergillus-optimized parameters based on single linkage of bidirectional BLASTp hits with an identity of \u226550% and a sum of query and hit coverage of \u2265130%, as described previously (6). InterPro annotations of the proteins (19, 20) and gff information were also used.", "Pipeline.", "All scripts and additional information files are available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2560245). The pipeline was created using Python, and the investigation of specific protein families was conducted in R (26). The versions and packages used can be seen in version information files. For alignment of sequences of the protein families, clustalo (27) was used, and sequences were trimmed with Gblocks (28, 29) using a Python script, also included in the folder. A readme file describes the various steps in the pipeline, including the inputs, outputs, how to run them, and which parameters can be changed. The first step of the pipeline is the most time-consuming, combining the protein families and the SMURF data to create \u201chomology count\u201d data, which takes approximately 7\u2009h on a standard desktop computer for the data used here. The following selection and filtering steps take 8 to 40 min, depending on the parameters used."]
