["Methods", "Bacterial strains, media and culture conditions", "The PM100117/18 producer S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A [31] and its isogenic strains were routinely cultivated on solid medium A [46] or in TSB [47] medium. Cultures for PM100117/18 production experiments were carried out in supplemented MS medium (SMS) [32] at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and rotary shaking at 200\u00a0rpm for 7\u00a0days. A more detailed description of these fermentations can be found in a previous report [32]. The Escherichia coli strains used for gene cloning (DH10B) [48] and intergeneric conjugation (ET12567/pUB307) [47] were grown at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 2xTY medium. All media were supplemented, when required, with the appropriate antibiotic for plasmid selection following standard directions [47].", "Analysis of PM100117 and PM100118 production", "Whole-culture samples (2\u00a0ml) from S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A wild type, or the corresponding mutant strains, were mixed with the same volume of ethyl acetate and shacked vigorously at room temperature for 1\u00a0h. The organic phase was collected and evaporated to dryness with a Speed-Vac. The residue was re-dissolved in 60\u00a0\u00b5l of methanol:DMSO (1:1), clarified by centrifugation and then subjected to UPLC and LC/MS analysis as described elsewhere [49]. To assess the PM100117/18 production level, SMS medium was vacuum-filtrated with nitrocellulose filters of 0.45\u00a0\u00b5m pore size (Millipore). After 7-days cultivation of the respective strains in clarified SMS medium, 2-ml whole-culture samples were collected by triplicate and centrifuged. The cell pellet was washed twice with milliQ water and then incubated for 72\u00a0h at 100\u00a0\u00b0C to determine cell dry-weight of the culture. Metabolite extraction and UPLC analysis were performed as mentioned above. The final sample solution was appropriately diluted to ensure reliable linear-range PM100117/18 quantifications. Peak areas were determined by triplicate and normalized with respect to the corresponding dry-weight values.", "Purification of PM100117 and PM100118 derivatives", "For purification of compounds 3\u201313, cultures of the corresponding producing strains were centrifuged and the supernatants were filtered and applied to a solid-phase extraction cartridge (Sep-Pak Vac C18, 10\u00a0g, Waters). The retained material in each case was eluted with a mixture of methanol and 0.05% TFA in water. A linear gradient from 0 to 100% methanol in 60\u00a0min, at 10\u00a0ml/min, was used. Fractions were taken every 5\u00a0min and analyzed by UPLC. The fractions containing the desired compounds were evaporated in vacuo and subsequently re-dissolved in a small volume of a mixture of DMSO and methanol (50:50). For purification of compounds 6 and 7 the extracted broth was acidified by adding formic acid up to 1% and re-extracted with one volume of ethyl acetate. Additionally, purification of compounds 3 and 4, required extraction from cell pellets with ethyl acetate. The resulting pellet extracts were similarly evaporated and re-dissolved. The compounds of interest were purified by preparative HPLC using a SunFire C18 column (10\u00a0\u00b5m, 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0mm, Waters). Compounds were chromatographed with mixtures of acetonitrile or methanol and 0.05% TFA in water in isocratic conditions optimized for each peak, at 7\u00a0ml/min, and when needed (compounds 3, 4, 6 and 7) collected on 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After every purification step, the collected compounds were diluted fourfold with water and then applied to a solid-phase extraction cartridge (Sep-Pak C18, Waters). The cartridge was washed with water, the retained compound was eluted with methanol and dried in vacuo. Once the purification was finished, the compounds were dissolved in a mixture of tert-butanol and water (1:1) and lyophilized.", "In vitro cytotoxicity assay", "The procedure to determine the in vitro antitumor activity of the PM100117/18 analogues obtained in this work was previously described [31, 32].", "DNA manipulation and plasmids construction", "DNA manipulation experiments in Escherichia coli and S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A were carried out according to standard protocols [47, 50]. PCR amplifications were performed by using Herculase II Fusion polymerase (Agilent Technologies) with the touchdown PCR procedure previously reported [32]. Primers and plasmids used in this work are described in (Additional file 4: Table S6). To accomplish single deletion of genes gonCM, gonD3, gonE, gonR1, gonR2, gonG1, gonG2, gonG3 and gonG4, the downstream DNA sequence of the corresponding target ORFs were amplified with the primer pairs EcoRV-CM/NdeI-CM, EcoRV-D3/BamHI-D3, EcoRV-E/BamHI-E, BamHI-R1/EcoRV-R1, EcoRV-R2/BamHI-R2, BamHI-G1/EcoRV-G1, BglII-G2/EcoRV-G2, NdeI-G3/EcoRV-G3 and BamHI-G4/EcoRV-G4, respectively, and cloned in the designated restriction sites (bold) of plasmid pEFBA-oriT [51], downstream to the aac(3)IV gene, which confers resistance to apramycin (ApmR). Then, the upstream sequence of the cited target genes were likewise amplified with the primer pairs NsiI-CM/SpeI-CM, NsiI-D3/SpeI-D3, NsiI-E/SpeI-E, SpeI-R1/NsiI-R1, NsiI-R2/SpeI-R2, SpeI-G1/NsiI-G1,\n SpeI-G2/NsiI-G2, XbaI-G3/NsiI-G3 and SpeI-G4/NsiI-G4, respectively, and cloned upstream to the aac(3)IV gene. Finally, the hygromycin B resistance (HygR) gene marker, hyg, was extracted by XbaI/NheI digestion from plasmid pLHyg [52] and introduced in the XbaI site of the deletion plasmids. Gene hyg allows recognizing clones in which a complete gene replacement by a double cross-over has taken place (HygS ApmR) from those in which a single cross-over event has integrated the deletion plasmid into the chromosome (HygR ApmR). To construct the pSETH plasmid backbone, used to achieve gene complementation and over-expression experiments, a 1.6-kb DNA fragment was amplified from plasmid pDR4 [53] with the primer pair NcoI-dHGR/NcoI-rvHGR and cloned in the NcoI site of plasmid pSETec [49], which harbors the constitutive ermE*p promoter. Plasmids intended to accomplish gene complementation and over-expression were constructed by inserting the respective target ORF in the BamHI/EcoRV sites of pSETH (Additional file 4: Table S6). Correct fragment insertion in deletion and complementation plasmids was verified by PCR and sequencing.", "Gene mutation and complementation by intergeneric conjugation", "Deletion plasmids pDgonCM, pDgonD3, pDgonE, pDgonR1, pDgonG1, pDgonG2, pDgonG3 and pDgonG4 (Table S6) were introduced in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A by intergeneric conjugation [32] to generate deletion strains \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3, \u0394gonE, \u0394gonR1, \u0394gonG1, \u0394gonG2, \u0394gonG3 and \u0394gonG4, respectively. ORF replacement in the resulting mutant strains was confirmed by PCR (Additional file 4: Fig. S5) with the primer pairs indicated in Table S6 (Additional file 4: Table S6). Complementation plasmids pCgonCM, pCgonD3, pCgonE, pCgonG1, pCgonG2 and pCgonG3 were then introduced by the same procedure in the corresponding mutant strains to afford strains CgonCM, CgonD3, CgonE, CgonG1, CgonG2, CgonG3, in which PM100117/18 biosynthesis was partially restored (Additional file 5: Fig S6). Plasmids, pSETH, pCgonR2 and pCgonG4 were also transferred to S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A to produce strains GUA-pSETH, OEgonR2 and OEgonG4, respectively. On the other hand, transfer of pSETH and pCgonG4 to mutant \u0394gonG2 yielded strains \u0394G2-pSETH and \u0394G2-OEG4, respectively. The exconjugant selection procedure followed in this work was thoroughly described in a previous report [31]."]
