["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Strains and media.", "G. sulfurreducens DL-1 (PCA strain, ATCC 51573) was grown under strictly anaerobic conditions in NB supplemented with acetate and fumarate (NBAF) medium, as previously described (76), except no resazurin was added. For growth of the pure culture, 20\u2009mM acetate and 40\u2009mM fumarate were used as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. P. aeruginosa PAO1, PA14, and PA14 \u0394phz1 \u0394phz2 (here referred to as the phz mutant) (57) strains were grown under strictly anaerobic conditions in NB medium containing 20\u2009mM formate and 20\u2009mM nitrate as the electron donor and acceptor. The two strains of P. aeruginosa differ in their phenazine production under different conditions, where PAO1 produces 4-fold higher pyocyanin (PYO) than does PA14 in medium that mimics the cystic fibrotic lung (77), while PA14 produces 10-fold higher pyocyanin PAO1 in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (57). For growth of the cocultures, 20\u2009mM formate and 40\u2009mM fumarate were provided as the electron donor and acceptor, the former of which is preferentially utilized by Pseudomonas spp., and the latter of which is only utilized by Geobacter spp. To initiate s0 cocultures, each bacterial species from pure cultures grown to late-log phase was inoculated at a concentration of 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 cells/ml as determined via a hemocytometer to ensure equal representation of Geobacter and Pseudomonas spp. when establishing the coculture. Adaptation of the cocultures involved transferring 1% of culture to fresh NB(formate/fumarate) medium once they reached stationary phase, the growth stage when P. aeruginosa begins producing phenazines (57), as determined by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600). The cultures were adapted to up to 13 transfers. The initial culture is referred to here as subculture 0 (s0), and the 13th transfer culture is called subculture 13 (s13). In total, 13 transfers were made, and stocks of cultures were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.", "SWATH-MS proteomics.", "All cell harvesting, protein extraction, proteomics, and statistical analyses were performed as previously reported (39).", "Genomic DNA extractions and next-generation sequencing.", "Each coculture comprised three biological replicates. For each biological replicate, there were an additional eight pooled technical replicate cultures. One milliliter of culture was harvested from each replicate at early stationary phase and centrifuged at 14,000 relative centrifugal force (rcf) for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and cell pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA extractions were done using the Isolate II genomic DNA kit from Bioline, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA concentrations were measured on the Implen NanoPhotometer P330, and samples were normalized to the same concentration before pooling all technical replicates to obtain an even representation of each replicate. Whole-genomic libraries were made with the Nextera XT kit (Illumina Inc., Australia), and library concentration and mean fragment lengths were measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Next-generation sequencing with 75-bp paired-end reads and 150 cycles in MID-output mode was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform by the Australian Genome Research Facility (Parkville, Victoria, Australia).", "Assigning reads in sequenced coculture genomes.", "Adapter sequences were trimmed from paired-end reads using Cutadapt v1.13 (78), with a required minimum length (m)\u2009of\u200930 and a quality cutoff (q) of\u200915. Trimmed reads were aligned against the GCF_000007985.2 assembly of the Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA genome, the GCF_000006765.1 assembly of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and the GCF_000404265.1 assembly of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 using SMALT v0.7.6 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smalt-0). The SMALT index for each genome was built using a k-mer (k) size of\u200911 and a step size (s)\u2009of\u20091. For each coculture of Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and a Pseudomonas strain, the alignment of paired-end reads against each reference genome was used to categorize each read pair using SAMtools (78\u201381) as properly mapped (-f 0\u2009\u00d7\u20092), or not (-F 0\u2009\u00d7\u20092) distinguishing reads unmapped (-f 0\u2009\u00d7\u20094). Given the two genomes (here referred to as species A and B), reads were assigned as originating from genome A if they were (i) mapped to genome A and unmapped to genome B, or (ii) mapped to both genomes, with a sum of the SMALT alignment for both reads in the pair in genome B being less than 80% of the sum of the alignment score in genome A. Read pairs not fulfilling these criteria or with a mapping quality score of less than 30 were excluded from further analysis. Using the above-described categorization, reads assigned to each genome were marked for duplicates with picard v2.9.3 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and realigned with the Genome Analysis Tool kit (GATK) v3.5-0 (80). Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions were called using the HaplotypeCaller function of GATK, with an indel size (indelSizeToEliminateInRefModel) of 20, a minimum mapping quality (mmq) score of\u200930, and ploidy\u2009of\u20092 to allow for detection of mutations occurring in a subset of the cell population. The impact of mutations on protein-coding transcripts was assessed using CooVar v0.07 (81).", "Harvesting for FISH and cell fixation.", "During harvesting of cocultures at early stationary phase, as described above, 2\u2009ml of each culture was harvested for FISH. Harvesting at early stationary phase for pure cultures of each bacteria was also performed and used for positive- and negative-control tests. Cells were pelleted at 4,000 rcf for 10 min, resuspended in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h\u2009at 4\u00b0C. The cells were pelleted and washed two times in 1\u00d7 PBS, followed by resuspension in a 1:1 ratio of 100% ethanol with 1\u00d7 PBS, after which they were stored at \u201320\u00b0C until hybridization was performed within 1 month of storage.", "Hybridization and microscopy.", "Hybridization was carried out according to the protocol by Erhart et al. (82), with minor modifications. Hybridizations were carried out at 46\u00b0C for 2 h\u2009in a humidity chamber using a hybridization buffer, as previously described (82); after testing a range of formamide concentrations, a 40% formamide concentration was found to give the most specific binding of the probes used, allowing distinct detection of each bacterial species compared to negative controls with no probe bound. Following hybridization, a 25-min wash step at 48\u00b0C was performed in a washing buffer, as previously described (82). The EUB338 FISH probe (83), which labels most bacteria, was used as a positive label for both G. sulfurreducens and P. aeruginosa and 5\u2032 labeled with ATTO633. P. aeruginosa FISH probe (84) targeting the 16S rRNA was 5\u2032 labeled with ATTO488. The G. sulfurreducens (23) FISH probe targeting the 16S rRNA was 5\u2032 labeled with ATTO565. Labeled probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies Pte. Ltd. (IDT, Baulkham Hills, NSW, Australia). All cells were also stained with the DNA binding dye 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize all cells and ensure there were not any contaminant microorganisms in the cocultures not belonging to P. aeruginosa or G. sulfurreducens. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss confocal LSM780 microscope with a 63\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Germany) at the LIMS BioImaging Facility (La Trobe University, Australia).", "Cloning standards and quantitative PCR.", "Gene fragments of G. sulfurreducens and P. aeruginosa 16S rRNA were PCR amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Australia) and the primers listed in Table\u00a0S1. G. sulfurreducens has a 16S rRNA gene copy number of 2, and P. aeruginosa has a copy number of 4. The reaction conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, followed by 32 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and 72\u00b0C for 1.5\u2009min. The fragments were then cloned into the TOPO TA Cloning kit for subcloning with One Shot TOP10 chemically competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the transformation of One Shot Mach-1 competent cells. The transformed clones were picked for plasmid miniprep using the PureYield plasmid miniprep system (Promega, Australia). Plasmids pLS1 and pLS2, containing cloned P. aeruginosa 16S rRNA and G. sulfurreducens 16S rRNA gene fragments, respectively, were confirmed with sequencing by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF). Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the ratio of G. sulfurreducens to P. aeruginosa in the cocultures. This quantification was done using the cloned 16S rRNA gene fragments to produce a standard curve. Their concentration was determined on the Implen NanoPhotometer P330, from which the copy number was calculated, and a 5-fold dilution series was made (109 to 102 genes/\u03bcl) to generate a standard curve. The primers (Table\u00a0S1) used for the quantification of G. sulfurreducens gene copy numbers were Gsulf_F and Gsulf_R, and Pse435F and Pse686R were used for P. aeruginosa quantification, generating amplicons of 108\u2009bp and 251\u2009bp, respectively. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 20\u2009\u03bcl with 3.3\u2009\u03bcl SensiFAST SYBR and fluorescein mix (Bioline, Australia), 133 nM each primer, and 2\u2009\u03bcl of DNA template. The qPCR cycle settings started with an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C (G. sulfurreducens) or 58\u00b0C (P. aeruginosa) for 30 s, with a melting curve of 60\u00b0C for 30 s and temperature increasing to 95\u00b0C, with data readings at increments of 0.5\u00b0C.", "Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid MIC.", "The MICs of PHZ-1-CA were determined using a broth dilution method where 2-fold serial dilutions (from 500\u2009mg/liter to 2\u2009mg/liter) of PHZ-1-CA (Merck) were made in anaerobic Hungate tubes and inoculated with cocultures (DL-1\u2009+\u2009PAO1, DL-1\u2009+\u2009PA14, and DL-1\u2009+\u2009phz mutant) and pure cultures of DL-1, PAO1, PA14, and the phz mutant. The dilutions were made in 10% ethanol of either NB(formate + fumarate) medium (for cocultures), NBAF medium (for DL1 pure cultures), or NB(formate + nitrate) medium (for PAO1, PA14, and phz mutant pure cultures). Positive-control and ethanol control tubes were also inoculated with culture and contained medium only or 10% ethanol medium, respectively, with no PHZ-1-CA. Once the cultures reached early stationary phase, they were diluted to a turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard (OD625, 0.1) corresponding to \u223c1 \u00d7\u2009108 to 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 cells (85), and 1% of the culture was added to the dilution series tubes. The tubes were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 to 38 h. The MIC was established as the lowest concentration of PHZ-1-CA that inhibited growth.", "Targeted sequencing of tetR and fabI.", "Targeted next-generation sequencing of the tetR and fabI regions was performed on G. sulfurreducens DL-1 pure cultures grown in phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (Merck) at various concentrations for MIC testing. Primers were designed to amplify \u223c350-bp regions of each gene and contained Illumina overhang adapter sequences (Table\u00a0S1). For each \u223c1-kb gene, three primer pairs were used to cover the entire length of the gene. Genomic DNA extractions were done using the Isolate II genomic DNA kit from Bioline, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA concentration was measured on the Implen NanoPhotometer P330, and samples were normalized to 5\u2009ng/\u03bcl and used to generate amplicon libraries with the MiSeq reagent kit V3 (Illumina, Inc., Australia). The tetR and fabI primers with appropriate Illumina adapters for the forward and reverse primers (Table\u00a0S1) were used to generate amplicons according to the 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol (part no. 15044223 rev. B; Illumina). PCR cleanup was performed using AMPure XP beads, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and subsequent PCR was performed to add Illumina flow cell adapters and Nextera XT indices. DNA concentration and mean fragment lengths were measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) and Agilent 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). Next-generation sequencing with 300-bp paired-end reads and 600 cycles was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform.", "Data availability.", "All raw sequences are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under BioProject number PRJNA544640 and BioSample numbers SAMN11792103 to SAMN11792109.
