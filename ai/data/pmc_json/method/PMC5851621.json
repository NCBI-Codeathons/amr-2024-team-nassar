["Materials and methods", "Isolation of SVBP6, and physiological and biochemical characterization", "Strain SVBP6 was isolated from the bulk top soil (0\u201310 cm) of an agricultural plot located in Viale, Entre R\u00edos province, Argentina (31\u00b0 52\u2019 59,6\u201d S; 59\u00b0 40\u2019 07\u201d W) using Gould\u2019s S1 selective media [38]. At sampling time (February 2010), the plot was cultivated with soybean and had a history of no-till management under good agricultural practices (crop rotation, nutrient replacement, and minimized agrochemical use) for, at least, 13 years [39]. Isolate SVBP6 was selected by its antagonistic potential against a diverse group of phytopathogenic fungi that included members of Fusarium, Colletotrichum, Phomopsis, Macrophomina and Cercospora genera [6].", "Colony morphology was observed under a magnifying glass (Olympus SZ61, 10\u00d7), after sowing a 20 \u03bcl-drop of a bacterial suspension with DO600 = 1.0 on a nutrient agar (NA, Biokar) plate and incubating for 48 h at 28\u00b0C. Morphological characterization of its cellular structure was performed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (JEM 1200EX II, Jeol) at the Central Service of Electron Microscopy (SCME) from the Faculty of Veterinary of the National University of La Plata (Buenos Aires, Argentina). For this assay, SVBP6 was grown overnight on nutrient yeast broth (NYB, Biokar) at 28\u00b0C and 200 rpm.", "Classical biochemical assays were performed to characterize SVBP6: Gram staining (Laboratorios Britania); catalase direct test with a drop of 3% H2O2 on a colony and evaluation of bubbling (O2 production); oxidase test (BD BBL\u2122 Taxo\u2122, N-discs with 6% of p-aminodimethylaniline monohydrochloride); gelatin liquefaction after 24 h of incubation of NYB with 12% of gelatin; glucose fermentation in Hugh and Leifson\u2019s OF basal medium (pH = 7.4); growth on NA plates at different temperatures (4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, 35\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C); growth on Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at several pH values (from 3.0 to 13.0) and NaCl concentrations (from 0% to 11%); reduction of nitrites and nitrates after 24 h of culture growth on NYB supplemented with KNO2 or KNO3, respectively, by the evaluation of nitrite presence with n-(1-naphtyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride [40] and gas formation inside a Durham tube [41]. Depending on the test performed, Escherichia coli K12 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 were employed as positive or negative controls. All incubations were done at 28\u00b0C, unless otherwise specified.", "To analyze the carbon sources that SVBP6 was able to metabolize, we assayed its growth in Biolog EcoPlatesTM [42], after 108 h of static incubation at 30\u00b0C. Antibiotic resistance was analyzed by growing SVBP6 in NYB medium supplemented with the corresponding antibiotic at the concentrations commonly employed for the Pseudomonas spp. genus: chloramphenicol (20 \u03bcg/ml), ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml), gentamicin (10 \u03bcg/ml), kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/ml) and tetracycline (150 \u03bcg/ml).", "Evaluation of PGP properties", "We tested several plant-growth promoting (PGP) activities as previously described [6]: exoprotease, phospholipase and 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activities; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production; siderophore and indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis; swimming and swarming motilities; inorganic phosphate solubilization ability; biofilm development; secretion of acyl homoserine lactone-like (AHL) quorum sensing signals and the presence of antifungal-related genes (phlD, phzF, pltB and prnD). Exoprotease (milk agar plates), phospholipase (egg yolk agar plates) and siderophore (CAS agar plates) activities were relativized to the colony diameter as follows: [halo diameter (in mm)\u2014diameter of each bacterial spot (in mm)] / diameter of each bacterial spot (in mm). Relative values were expressed as percentage.", "Additionally, we tested the chitinase activity by a fluorometric assay with 4-methylumbelliferone-N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminide as substrate [43]. Briefly, we grew SVBP6 on synthetic medium (SM) liquid medium supplemented with 10% v/v of LB broth and 0.2% w/v of colloidal chitin [44] for 72 h at 200 rpm and 28\u00b0C. Then, we collected 200 \u03bcl of supernatant by triplicate and mixed it with 50 \u03bcl of substrate at 200 \u03bcM in MES buffer 0.1M (pH = 6.1), to measure the fluorescence during 15 minutes. Control reactions and calculations of activity were done as previously described [43]. Chitinase production was expressed as the enzyme activity (nmol/min) relative to the OD600 value of the SM culture.", "For detection of lipopeptide production, we carried out the drop-collapse test on Parafilm\u00ae [19]. The presence of biosurfactants in a drop of cell-free supernatant (from a bacterial culture grown on NYB for 16 h at 28\u00b0C and 200 rpm) decreases the surface tension of the liquid and, therefore, results in its collapse. Methylene blue was added to stain the drops for photographic purposes and had no influence on the results. Besides, a specific assay for rhamnolipids detection was performed in Siegmund Wagner (SW) agar [45], evaluating the production of halos around the colonies after plate incubation for 48 h at 28\u00b0C. Rhamnolipids form an insoluble complex with the CTAB present in the SW medium, and it interacts with the methylene blue also present. Thus, rhamnolipids producers are detected by a dark blue halo around the colony [46].", "Antagonism by the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was evaluated by co-cultivation assays in partitioned Petri dishes [47]. Briefly, a heavy streak of SVBP6 was performed in one side of the plate onto NA, and a 1 cm2 plug of a fresh M. phaseolina culture was deposited onto the other side of the plate containing potato dextrose agar (PDA). Plates were sealed with Parafilm\u00ae and incubated for 5 days at 28\u00b0C in the darkness. The assay was performed by triplicate and controls without bacteria or fungal inoculum were included.", "Antibacterial activity was evaluated in two assays to analyze if it was due to a direct contact of cells (co-culture) or to the secretion of a toxin molecule (overlaid layer). For the first assay, NA plates were sown with 100 \u03bcl of a bacterial suspension of the prey with a OD600 = 1.0. Once plates were dried, a 10 \u03bcl drop of a SVBP6 bacterial suspension with OD600 = 1.0 was spotted on each one, and plates were incubated 24 h at 28\u00b0C for the optimal SVBP6 growth. For the second assay, a 10 \u03bcl drop of a similar SVBP6 bacterial suspension was spotted in the NA plates and incubated overnight at 28\u00b0C. Then, after 30 minutes of UV exposure to kill the SVBP6 cells, 4 ml of soft NA (0.8% agar) with 10% v/v of a saturated cultures of the confronted bacterial strain were overlaid above the drops and plates were incubated for 24 h at the optimal temperature of the bacterial prey. SVBP6 was confronted against Escherichia coli K12, a Bacillus subtilis strain from the bacterial collection of the Microbiology Area of the Department of Science and Technology (Universidad Nacional de Quilmes) and Pseudomonas fluorescens 1008 from Rizobacter Argentina S.A. NA plates with the overlaid layers of E. coli or B. subtilis strains were incubated at 37\u00b0C, or with P. fluorescens strain, at 28\u00b0C.", "Fatty acids and whole-cells protein profile analyses", "Fatty acid analysis was performed by gas chromatography using the MIDI Sherlock\u00ae Microbial Identification System and the standard protocol [48]. The RTSBA6 method was employed for comparison of the FAME profile with the available library (http://www.midi-inc.com/pdf/RTSBA_6.21%20.(Environmental%20Aerobes).pdf, as available in August 2017).", "Whole-cell protein profile of SVBP6 was obtained using the Ultraflex III UV-MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and MALDI Biotyper 3.1 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) at the CEQUIBIEM Institute (CONICET, Argentina) in association with the Institute of Biotechnology and Molecular Biology (IBBM, CONICET, La Plata, Argentina). The preparation of the samples was performed according to manufacturers' recommendation from a single colony cultured on LB for 24 h at 28\u00b0C [49]. Bacterial identification was performed with MALDI Biotyper Offline classification software using score values proposed by the manufacturer as follows: a score value higher than 2.0 indicates species identification; a score value between 1.7 and 1.9 indicates genus identification; and a score value lower than 1.7 indicates no taxonomic matching [50]. The Pseudomonas spp. database in the MALDI Biotyper software included 168 representative species (S1 Table).", "Genomic DNA preparation and sequencing", "For DNA isolation, we collected 20 mg fresh weight of SVBP6 cells from an overnight culture on NA. After processing with the ZR Soil Microbe DNA MicroPrep\u2122 kit (Zymo Research), we obtained ca. 9 \u03bcg of DNA with an OD260/280 of 1.9 and a good integrity as judged by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel. Purified DNA (approx. 300 ng) was sent to INDEAR (Rosario, Argentina) to prepare the corresponding libraries and to obtain a draft genome via the Illumina HiSeq 1500 sequencing system.", "Genome assembly and gene prediction", "Genome assembly was performed with the A5 pipeline [51]. Gene prediction and genome analysis of PGP-related traits in the draft genome of SVBP6 strain were performed with the Rapid Annotation with Subsystems Technology (RAST) server database 2.0 [52], Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST\u00ae, [53]), Pseudomonas genome database (www.pseudomonas.com, [54]), Antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) v. 3.0.5 [55] and the IslandViewer 3 software [56]. Synteny analyses were performed with the SimpleSynteny platform (https://www.dveltri.com/simplesynteny/index.html, [57]).", "Selection of genomes, identification of putative orthologous genes, alignments, and phylogenetic analysis", "All draft and complete assemblies, and protein coding sequences of the genus Pseudomonas were downloaded via ftp from ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes (April 19th, 2017). This first dataset comprised 3545 assemblies. Forty-four highly conserved ribosomal protein-coding genes were used for genetic comparison and sampling genomes (S2 Table). All 44 conserved genes were identified in 3162 genomes and these genomes were used for further analysis (S3 Table). The 44 groups of putative orthologous genes were independently aligned using Muscle [58] with the fastest algorithm (options: -maxiters 1 -diags1). Poorly aligned positions were eliminated using Gblock software with default parameters [59], and subsequently concatenated for sequence distance estimation. Genomes displaying a 99% or more similarity in these conserved genes were clustered. One genome for each cluster was randomly selected for subsequent phylogenetic analysis with preference for those with an assigned species, if available. This resulting second dataset comprise 140 selected genomes plus the one from Pseudomonas sp. SVBP6 reported here (Sampled Genomes in S3 Table). Sixty-seven putative orthologous genes were identified among these 141 genomes. The OrthoMCL method [60] was implemented in the Get_homologous software and used for homologous identification [61]. Blast searches were performed with a minimal identity value of 30% and minimal query coverage of 75%. Orthologous protein sequences were aligned using ClustalO v1.2.0 [62]. Again, poorly aligned positions were eliminated using Gblock with default parameters [59] and then concatenated for phylogenetic analysis. A phylogenetic tree was inferred using an approximately maximum likelihood method with an amino acid LG+G model using in FastTree 2.1 [63]. The Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH-like) test was used to evaluate branch support. The phylogenetic position of SVBP6 was established and all genomes from the most inclusive and robust monophyletic group were selected. Genomes from this monophyletic group were used to track back all the closely related genomes to SVBP6 strain available in the original first dataset. As a result, 122 closely related genomes from the first dataset were retrieved and used for a further phylogenetic analysis (Closely related genomes in S3 Table). As previously described, putative orthologous genes among the 122 genomes plus SVBP6 strain were identified using Get_homologues package. Six hundred and seventy-six clusters of orthologous genes were found and subsequently aligned and trimmed using ClustalO v1.2.0 and Gblock, respectively. Blocks were finally concatenated, and a phylogenetic tree was built by means of FastTree 2.1, as aforementioned. The whole approach is described as a workflow in S1 Fig. A Venn diagram was constructed with R software v. 3.4.0 [64], employing the VennDiagram package and all the ORFs (PEGs) found in every P. donghuensis genome as database.", "Average nucleotide identity score (ANI)", "Pairwise Two-way ANI score was computed among all closely related genomes of SVBP6 using the ani.rb script developed by Luis M. Rodriguez-R and available at enveomics.blogspot.com. ANI score is a result from a whole genome comparison. ANI index is used to delineate species from genomes sequence data [65]. Therefore, if two genomes display an ANI value of 95% or higher, both strains are believed to belong to the same species. Phylogenetic analysis was used to support ANI results.", "Tn5 mutagenesis and screening of mutant clones with reduced antifungal activity", "To obtain a clone library of random Tn5 mutants of SVBP6, we performed a triparental conjugation with SVBP6 as the acceptor strain, Escherichia coli CC118 \u03bbpir with the pBAMD1-4 plasmid as the donor strain and E. coli HB101 with the pRK600 plasmid as the helper strain, as previously described [66]. Briefly, from 5ml of NYB overnight cultures that were incubated at 37\u00b0C (for E. coli strains) and 35\u00b0C for SVBP6 strain (to improve the Pseudomonas ability to accept heterologous DNA, [67]), we combined equal volumes of the three bacterial cultures, centrifuged to obtain cellular pellets, and mixed them in a single 1.5 ml tube. We resuspended them with 50 \u03bcl of fresh NYB medium and we plated it on the border of a NA plate. The incubation was performed at 37\u00b0C for 5 h. Cells were collected with 1 ml of fresh NYB and appropriate dilutions were plated onto M9 minimal medium agar plates [49] with 0.2% of citrate as the sole carbon source, supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin [47]. We obtained approximately 2500 clones that were conserved in 384-well plates at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol. For selection of putative clones that had lost their antagonistic potential, we performed co-cultivation assays by streaking individual clones onto agar plates previously overlaid with a suspension of M. phaseolina 131.2010 conidia. After incubation for 48 h at 28\u00b0C, we searched for clones that did not produce a halo of fungal growth inhibition. To identify the Tn5 insertion site in each selected clone, we carried out an arbitrary nested PCR amplification with the methodology previously described [66], followed by partial sequencing of the corresponding amplicons at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea).", "RNA extraction and purification, and Northern blot analysis", "RNA preparation from SVBP6 cells was carried out essentially as described previously for P. protegens CHA0 [68], with minor modifications. Briefly, 200\u2013500 \u03bcl of cell culture was centrifuged, and cells were resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of TKM buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5). Washed cells were mixed with 75 \u03bcl of lysis solution (320 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.6, 8% SDS, 16 mM EDTA). Lysed cells were mixed for 5 min with 575 \u03bcl of water-saturated phenol at 65\u00b0C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was extracted once with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol. The resulting RNA pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O and kept at -80\u00b0C. RNA concentration was determined at 260 nm. Purity and integrity of RNA preparations were assessed by denaturing agarose electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Northern blot analyses were performed as reported elsewhere [69]. Three micrograms of total RNA from each sample was initially electrophoresed for 45 min at a constant current (15 mA) in polyacrylamide gels (8.3 M urea, 8% [wt/vol] acrylamide, 0.2% [wt/vol] bisacrylamide in 1\u00d7 Tris-borate-EDTA [TBE] buffer), with the low-range RNA ladder (Thermo Scientific, USA) serving as a molecular weight marker. The marker lane was cut and stained separately with ethidium bromide and the image registered with a UV transilluminator. The remaining gel was electroblotted at 150 mA for 30 min onto a Hybond-N membrane in 1\u00d7 TBE buffer. After washing the membrane twice with 2\u00d7 SSC solution (30 mM sodium citrate, 0.3 M NaCl), the RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV light for 5 min. The membranes were then blocked with prehybridization buffer (50% [wt/vol] formamide, 5\u00d7 SSC, 50 mM phosphate buffer [pH 7.0], 2% [wt/vol] blocking reagent, 0.1% [wt/vol] N-laurylsarcosine, 7% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) for 1 h at 50\u00b0C in a hybridization oven and then incubated overnight at 50\u00b0C with the hybridization buffer containing the specific anti-rsmY digoxigenin-labeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probe (previously generated by amplification of the rsmY genomic locus of P. protegens CHA0) [69]. The hybridized membranes were washed under standard stringent conditions, incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody solution, washed with the same buffer, and covered with the Lumiphos chemiluminescent reagent (Lumigen, USA) in the dark at room temperature for 5 min. The membranes were exposed for 60 min to photographic films and then further developed."]
