["Materials and Methods", "Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions.", "S. coelicolor M145 strain and mutant strains were grown on solid soy flour-mannitol (SFM) medium for sporulation. Then the spores stocked in 20% glycerol were inoculated to 2\u00d7TY medium for germinating. The total cells were collected and inoculated to liquid R5- medium and grown for about 14 h to M phase or 22 h to L phase. E. coli DH10B was used as the cloning host, and E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 was used for intergeneric conjugation. All E. coli strains were cultured in 2\u00d7TY medium at 37 \u00b0C. Full information is described in detail in SI\u00a0Appendix, Materials and Methods\u00a0and Tables\u00a0S2 and S3.", "The Construction of Plasmid and Streptomyces Mutant.", "For plasmid construction, different sgRNA targeted to each HCR window were one-step cloned to NheI and XbaI-digested plasmid pWHU2653 with promoter kasO*p and B1006 terminator by Gibson assembly. Then a series of left and right homologous arms together with the gus(a) reporter cassette or the RK-682 recombinant BGC cassette were introduced to the HindIII site of these sgRNA-born plasmids by Gibson assembly to achieve plasmids pGAM1\u201310, pGAL1\u201310, pRKM1\u201310 and pRKL1\u201310, respectively. The gus(a) reporter cassette or RK-682 recombinant BGC cassette was integrated into PvuI and XbaI linearized pSET152 to produce pGAattB or pRKattB, respectively. For S. coelicolor mutant construction, each plasmid was transformed from E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 to S. coelicolor by intergeneric conjugation. All mutants were verified by PCR and sequencing. Full information is described in detail in SI\u00a0Appendix, Materials and Methods.", "Measurement of Glucuronidase Activity and Production of RK-682.", "For the glucuronidase activity test, strains were cultured in liquid R5- medium. After reaching the specific growth phase, the whole cells were harvested and resuspended with 40% glycerol. Three-quarters of the cell suspension was separated and centrifugated, then washed twice with distilled water. This part was dried, and then the dry weight was measured. The rest of cell suspension was also centrifugated, the supernatant discarded, and then resuspended with GUS buffer. The cell suspension was then lysed by sonication. Cell lysate with six repeats was transferred to 96-well plates and then supplemented with p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-glucuronide. Incubating at 37 \u00b0C, the optical density at 415 nm was measured per 5 min for a total of 40 min.", "For RK-682 production and analysis, strains were cultured in liquid R5- medium. After reaching the specific growth phase, the whole cells were harvested by centrifugation and then washed twice with distilled water. These cells were dried and then the dry weight was measured. These dry cells were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the extracts were then dried and redissolved in methanol for further analysis. Analysis of RK-682 was performed with a Phenomenex C18 column. LC\u2013ESI\u2013HRMS analysis was carried out on an LTQ XL Orbitrap coupled with an Accela photodiode array detector, Accela PDA autosampler, and Accela pump, using electrospray ionization in the negative-ion mode. Full information is described in detail in\u00a0SI\u00a0Appendix, Materials and Methods.", "Transcriptome Analysis.", "Total RNA was extracted from the tissue using TRIzol\u00ae Reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA-seq transcriptome library was prepared following the TruSeqTM RNA sample preparation Kit. After quantifying by TBS380, the paired-end RNA-seq sequencing library was sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq \u00d7 TEN. htqc was used to filter the sequencing data to make clean data. Then the cleaned reads were mapped onto the S. coelicolor genome using SOAP. Full information is described in detail in\u00a0SI\u00a0Appendix, Materials and Methods.", "Hi-C Library Construction and Analysis.", "For Hi-C library construction, bacterial cells were cross-linked with 3% formaldehyde for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and quenched with 375 mM final concentration glycine for 15 min. The cross-linked cells were incubated with lysozyme at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to lyse the cells. Endogenous nucleases were inactivated with 0.5% SDS, then chromatin DNAs were digested by 50 U Sau3AI, marked with biotin-14-dCTP, and then ligated by 50 U T4 DNA ligase. After reversing cross-links, the ligated DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Purified DNA was sheared to 300 to 500-bp fragments, then blunt-end repaired, A-tailed, and adaptor-added before purification through biotin-streptavidin-mediated pull-down and PCR amplification. Finally, the Hi-C libraries were quantified and sequenced on the Illumina Nova-seq platform.
