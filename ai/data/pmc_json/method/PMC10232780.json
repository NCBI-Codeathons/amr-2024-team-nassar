Briefly, the Baby Carbs study recruited mother-infant pairs living in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria included vaginally delivered, full-term, exclusively breastfed infants who were not exposed to antibiotics (no antibiotic during labor and after birth). This study was exempted from medical research ethics committee approval for the collection of stool samples, after review by the Medical Ethical Reviewing Committee of Wageningen University. All parents provided written informed consent before the start of the sample collection. Participants collected fecal samples daily (consecutively during 1\u2009week) from a diaper using a sterile spoon (Sampling Systems, Coleshill, United Kingdom) and kept the feces anaerobically in a sterile 50\u2009mL collection tube inside a BD GasPak EZ anaerobe gas generating pouch (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, United States). The fecal samples were stored in the home refrigerator (\u00b14\u00b0C) for a maximum of 72\u2009h prior to the collection by one of the researchers for transport to the lab. Previous study showed that refrigeration of feces at 4\u00b0C for short term storage (up to 72\u2009h) did not alter fecal microbiota composition, compared to direct freezing to \u221280\u00b0C or cultures from fresh feces (Choo et al., 2015; Burz et al., 2019). These collections were scheduled up to two times per week. For transport to the lab, the refrigerated samples were put in an insulated bag containing frozen cooling elements, and upon arrival processed in the laboratory on the same day.

The data were processed using Chromeleon\u2122 CDS software version 7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The salicylate-hypochlorite method was used to measure the ammonia level in lumen and dialysate samples, based on the method described by Bower and Holm-Hansen (1980), with modification. Briefly, liquid fraction samples were diluted with Mili-Q water and 20\u2009\u03bcL of the diluted fraction was added transferred to 96-well microplate (Greiner Bio-One).

The absolute abundance of microbial taxa was calculated by multiplying the qPCR count of total 16S rRNA gene copies with the relative abundance of taxa, following the approach of quantitative microbiota profiling or QMP (Jian et al., 2020). Microbiota composition, at genus and ASV level, was visualized using the microViz package version 0.10.8 (Barnett et al., 2021). Taxa with unidentified genus were renamed as unidentified and followed by the lowest classifiable rank, e.g., the genus of unidentified_Enterobacteriaceae. ASVs were renamed to consist of genus name (or the lowest classifiable rank) and a numeric rank based on taxa abundance, e.g., the ASV of Bifidobacterium_01 (the most abundant ASV within Bifidobacterium genus). To explore associations between antibiotic exposure and the absolute abundances of individual microbial taxa, a linear regression model was used to model log2-transformed absolute abundance of each microbial taxon per time point and the resulting coefficients were visualized using the microViz package.", "The non-phylogenetic diversity estimates were generated using the microbiome package version 1.19.0 (Lahti and Shetty, 2017), including observed genera and Shannon diversity, in which the exponential of Shannon index was further calculated as Shannon effective number of genera. The phylogenetic diversity was calculated using the picante package version 1.8.2 (Kembel et al., 2010). The alpha diversity was visualized in box plots using the ggpubr package version 0.4.0 (Kassambara and Kassambara, 2020). The Wilcoxon test was performed to test the differences in alpha diversity between the groups treated with and without antibiotic using the rstatix package version 0.7.0 (Kassambara, 2021). In order to visualize the variation in microbiota composition between samples at different time points, principal component analysis (PCA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were used on log10-transformed absolute abundances of genera and GUniFrac distances, respectively. Principal Response Curve (PRC) analysis was performed on log10-transformed absolute abundances of genera using the vegan package version 2.6.2 (Oksanen et al., 2022). PRC analysis on GUniFrac distances was conducted using the distance-based PRC (dbPRC) approach (Shankar et al., 2017). PRC and dbPRC analyses were performed by comparing the control group (without antibiotic and without prebiotic) to antibiotic-treated groups with and without prebiotic (2\u2019-FL or GOS).", "The metabolite data were calculated as cumulative production for metabolites detected in both luminal compartment and spent dialysis liquid, or otherwise presented as detection in luminal compartment only in case of the absence of the metabolites in the dialysis liquid. To explore associations between antibiotic or prebiotic treatment and the production of each metabolite, a linear regression model was used to model log2-transformed concentration of each metabolite per time points and the resulting coefficients were visualized using microViz package. The graphs of metabolite amounts from each treatment run over time were generated using the ggplot2 package version 3.3.6 (Wickham, 2016). Spearman correlation test between rate of metabolite production and taxa was performed following the script provided in the Rhea pipeline (Lagkouvardos et al., 2017). For correlation analyses, the rate of metabolite production was calculated by dividing the change in total metabolite amount (mmol) by the change in time (hours) since the previous measurement time point. For metabolites that were never detected in the dialysis liquid, the total amount is equal to the amount in the lumen. Correlation network was constructed using visNetwork package version 2.1.1 (Almende, 2022), visualizing significant correlations with FDR corrected p value <0.05 and correlation coefficient\u2009>\u20090.5."]
