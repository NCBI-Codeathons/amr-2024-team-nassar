["Methods", "Bacterial strains, plasmids and primers", "Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2, and primers are listed in Supplementary Table S3. S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 is the wild-type strain used for activation of the cryptic mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. S. albus J1074, S. coelicolor M1146, S. coelicolor M1152 and S. coelicolor M1154 serve as hosts for heterologous expression of the cryptic mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. P. aeruginosa PAO1 and P. aeruginosa PA14 were used as indicator strains for mureidomycin bioassay. Escherichia coli Top10 was used as a general host for propagating plasmids. E. coli ET12567 (pUZ8002) was used as a host for transferring DNA from E. coli to Streptomyces by intergeneric conjugation. S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 was cultured at 28\u2009\u00b0C on AS-1 agar medium or in tryptic soy broth (TSB) liquid medium24. P. aeruginosa was grown at 37\u2009\u00b0C in Luria\u2013Bertani lacking sodium chloride (LBNS)25. General approaches for E. coli or Streptomyces manipulations were performed according to standard procedures2627.", "Sequence analysis", "The nucleotide sequence of the putative napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster is available in the GenBank database under accession number DS999644.1. The ORFs were deduced from the sequence with FramePlot 4.0 beta program (http://nocardia.nih.go.jp/fp4). The corresponding deduced proteins were compared with proteins in the databases by available BLAST methods (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) or ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/). The program HHpred was used for protein structure prediction (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred/).", "Construction of Sros-h02995, Sros-A and Sros-hA", "SSGG_02995 coding region and the hrdB promoter were amplified respectively with primer pair 02995-F/R and hrdBp-F/R from genomic DNA of S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 and Streptomyces coelicolor M145. Prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, hrdBp-R was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase to facilitate subsequent ligation reactions. The coding region of SSGG_02995 was digested with NotI, and the hrdB promoter was digested with XbaI. The two fragments were ligated together with XbaI/NotI digested pSET152 in a three-piece ligation reaction to generate pSET152::h02995. The plasmid pSET152::hA was constructed in a similar way except that primers ssaAorf-F and ssaA-R were used for amplification of ssaA coding region from cosmid 13R-1 9. For the construction of pSET152::A, a fragment covering the coding region of ssaA and its upstream region was amplified from cosmid 13R-1 by using primers ssaA-F and sssA-R. The amplified fragment was digested with XbaI and NotI and then inserted into the corresponding sites of pSET152 to generate pSET152::A. The plasmids pSET152::h02995, pSET152::A and pSET152::hA were introduced respectively into S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 to obtain recombinant strains, Sros-h02995, Sros-A and Sros-hA.", "Construction of mutants", "SSGG_02978 deletion mutant (Sros-02978D) in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 was constructed via double-crossover homologous recombination. To generate the construct, two 2.0 kb fragments flanking SSGG_02978 were amplified using primer pairs 02978-UpF/UpR and 02978-DnF/DnR with genomic DNA from S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 as template. The two fragments were digested with XbaI/SpeI and SpeI/EcoRV, and ligated into XbaI/EcoRV digested pKC1139 to obtain pKC1139::02978UD. The kanamycin resistance gene (neo) was amplified from pUC119::neo28 by using primers Kan-F and Kan-R. The resistance cassette was digested with SpeI and inserted into the SpeI linearized pKC1139::02978UD. The resulting pKC1139::02978UDneo was then transferred into S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 by intergeneric conjugation27. Spores of transformants were harvested and spread on AS-1 agar plates containing kanamycin. After growing at 40\u2009\u00b0C for 4 days, colonies were replicated on AS-1 agar plates containing kanamycin or apramycin. Double-crossover exconjugants are apramycin sensitive (Aprs) and kanamycin resistant (Kanr). Aprs/Kanr strains were then verified by PCR analysis.", "For the construction of SSGG_02988 disruption mutant in Sros-hA, approximately 500 bp internal fragments of SSGG_02988 were amplified using primer pair 02988-SCF/SCR with genomic DNA from S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 as template. The amplified fragment was inserted into EcoRV site of pKC1139hph, which is a derivative of pKC1139 with the replacement of apramycin resistance gene by hygromycin resistance gene. The resulting pKC1139hph::02988SC was then introduced into Sros-hA by intergeneric conjugation27. Spores of transformants were collected and spread on AS-1 agar plates containing hygromycin. After growing at 40\u2009\u00b0C for 4 days, colonies were patched on AS-1 agar plates containing hygromycin and then verified by PCR analysis.", "RNA extraction and semi-quantitative RT-PCR", "Total RNAs were isolated from cultures of the wild-type (WT) strain, Sros-h02995, Sros-A and Sros-hA grown in ISP-2 media at 48 and 96\u2009h as described previously29. The RNA samples were treated using RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) to remove genomic DNA. Synthesis of cDNA was the same as described previously30. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the reaction conditions were as follows: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, followed by amplification cycles consisting of 45\u2009s denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 30\u2009s annealing at 60\u2009\u00b0C to 62\u2009\u00b0C (depending on the set of primers used), and 40\u2009s extension at 72\u2009\u00b0C, and a final extension of 8\u2009min at 72\u2009\u00b0C.

The cultures were incubated at 28\u00b0C for different days before fermentation broths were collected by centrifugation. The supernatants were filtered through a Millipore membrane (pore diameter, 0.22\u2009\u03bcm) and 10 \u03bcl of sample was used for HPLC analysis. Separation of mureidomycins was achieved with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system and a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (5\u2009\u03bcm, 4.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009mm).

Cultures of indicator strains (1\u2009ml overnight culture of P. aeruginosa PAO1 or P. aeruginosa PA14) were well dispersed in 100\u2009ml pre-dissolved LBNS agar and poured into a 15\u2009cm plate. Supernatants of 100\u2009\u03bcl were added into holes with diameter of 7\u2009mm on the plates. For preparation of agar plugs, S. roseosporus and its derivatives were patched on ISP-2 agar. After incubation at 28\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u20138 days, agar plugs were prepared from the patches and placed on the surface of bioassay plates. The zone of inhibition was assessed after overnight incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C.", "For measuring the growth curves of P. aeruginosa PA14, the test strains were first grown overnight in LBNS medium. The overnight cultures were then diluted to 0.5% in LBNS containing different volumes (0, 10, 15, 20, 25\u2009\u03bcl) of fermentation extracts from the WT or Sros-hA. A total 200\u2009\u03bcl of cell suspension was added to each well of 100-well microplate, and the plate was then placed inside a Boscreen C automated system. Optical density at a wavelength of 600\u2009nm was measured at regular intervals of 20\u2009min over a 10\u2009h period.
