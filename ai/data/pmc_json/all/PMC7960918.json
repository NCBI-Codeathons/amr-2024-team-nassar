At first, the biosynthesis of this remarkable biosurfactant was described in this review. The peptide moiety of the surfactin is synthesized using huge multienzymatic proteins called NonRibosomal Peptide Synthetases. This mechanism is responsible for the peptide biodiversity of the members of the surfactin family. In addition, on the fatty acid side, fifteen different isoforms (from C12 to C17) can be incorporated so increasing the number of the surfactin-like biomolecules. The review also highlights the last development in metabolic modeling and engineering and in synthetic biology to direct surfactin biosynthesis but also to generate novel derivatives. This large set of different biomolecules leads to a broad spectrum of physico-chemical properties and biological activities. The last parts of the review summarized the numerous studies related to the production processes optimization as well as the approaches developed to increase the surfactin productivity of Bacillus cells taking into account the different steps of its biosynthesis from gene transcription to surfactin degradation in the culture medium.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Surfactin was firstly isolated in 1968 by Arima et al. as a new biologically active compound produced by Bacillus with surfactant activities, leading to its appellation. Its structure was elucidated firstly through its amino acid sequence (Kakinuma et al., 1969a) and then its fatty acid chain (Kakinuma et al., 1969b). Surfactin was thus characterized as a lipopeptide composed of a heptapeptide with the following sequence: L-Glu1-L-Leu2-D-Leu3-L-Val4-L-Asp5-D-Leu6-L-Leu7, forming a lactone ring structure with a \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acid chain. Bearing both, a hydrophilic peptide portion and a lipophilic fatty acid chain, surfactin is of amphiphilic nature, leading to exceptional biosurfactant activities and diverse biological activities.", "Surfactin was firstly isolated in 1968 by Arima et al. as a new biologically active compound produced by Bacillus with surfactant activities, leading to its appellation.

NRPSs are multimodular mega-enzymes, consisting of repeated modules. A module is defined as a portion of the NRPS that incorporates one specific amino acid into a peptide backbone. The order of the modules is usually co-linear with the product peptide sequence. Each module can in turn be dissected into the following three domains: the adenylation (A) domain, the thiolation (T) domain (\u201c-syn. peptidyl-carrier protein (PCP)-\u201d) and the condensation (C) domain (Marahiel et al., 1997; Roongsawang et al., 2011). The A-domain recognizes, selects, and activates the specific amino acid of interest (Dieckmann et al., 1995). Taking into account the 3D-structures of several adenylation domains and their active site, several tools have been set up to correlate the amino acid residue present in this active site and their substrate specificity. A NRPS code was so defined that it is based on 8 amino acid residues from the active site (Stachelhaus et al., 1996; Rausch et al., 2005). The activated amino acid is hereby covalently bonded as a thioester to the flexible 4\u2032-phosphopantetheinyl (4\u2032-Ppant) arm of the T-domain. The 4\u2032-Ppant prosthetic group is 20 \u00c5 in length and can swing from one to another adjacent catalytic center. Exactly this flexibility enables the transfer of the activated amino acid substrate to the C-domain, which catalyzes in turn (i) the formation of a peptide bond between the nascent peptide and the amino acid carried by the adjacent module and allows afterwards (ii) the translocation of the growing chain to the following module. Various functional subtypes of the C domain have been described. For example, an LCL domain catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between two L-amino acids while a DCL domain between a L-amino acid and a growing peptide ending with a D-amino acid (Rausch et al., 2007). The first module (A-T module) is considered the initiation module, while the subsequent (C-A-T) modules are defined as elongation modules. After several module-mediated cycles of peptide extension, the complete linear intermediate peptide is released by the terminal thioesterase (TE) domain which, often, catalyzes an internal cyclization (Marahiel et al., 1997; Trauger et al., 2000). Besides the above mentioned domains, the NPRS assembly line can furthermore comprise additional optional domains, which catalyze modifications of amino acid building blocks e.g. their epimerization (E-domains) (S\u00fcssmuth and Mainz, 2017). The lipid moiety of surfactins and most of the microbial lipopeptides is introduced directly at the start of the biosynthesis. The initiation module features a C-A-T- instead of a classic A-T-structure (Sieber and Marahiel, 2005; Bloudoff and Schmeing, 2017). It contains a special N-terminal C-domain, termed C-starter (CS) domain and is in charge of the linkage of a CoA-activated \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acid to the first amino acid.

The structural genes were identified in B. subtilis and are formed by the four biosynthetic core NRPS genes srfAA, srfAB, srfAC, and srfAD (Figure 1) which code together for a heptamodular NRPS assembly line. The three-modular enzyme SrfAA contains N-terminally the typical CS-domain of CLP-BGCs and acylates the first amino acid Glu1 with various 3-OH-fatty acids stemming from primary metabolism. The peptide is subsequently extended in a co-linear fashion by the elongation modules of SrfAA, SrfAB and SrfAC to yield a linear heptapeptide (FA-L-Glu1-L-Leu2-D-Leu3-L-Val4-L-Asp5-D-Leu6-L-Leu7). The inverted stereochemistry can be readily attributed to the presence of E-domains in modules M3 and M6 and DCL domains in modules M4 and M7 (Figure 1). Finally, the TE domain of SrfAC releases the lipopeptide and performs the macrocyclization between Leu7 and the hydroxy-group of the 3-OH fatty acid. Notably, SrfAD consist solely of a second TE-domain, which represents rather a supportive repair enzyme and is able to regenerate misprimed T-domains during NRPS assembly (Schneider et al., 1998; Schwarzer et al., 2002; Yeh et al., 2004).", "Three decades ago, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of the CLP surfactin was described in parallel by different research groups (Nakano et al., 1988; Cosmina et al., 1993; Fuma et al., 1993; Sinderen et al., 1993).

This biosynthetic route proceeds in two stages: initiation and iterative cyclic elongation. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme complex (ACC) performs the first committed step in bacterial FA synthesis to generate malonyl-CoA through the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (Marini et al., 1995; Tong, 2013). The malonate group from malonyl-CoA is transferred to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) by a malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD) (Serre et al., 1994, 1995; Morbidoni et al., 1996). The first reaction for the synthesis of the nascent carbon chain comprises the condensation of malonyl-ACP with a short-chain acyl-CoA (C2\u2013C5) catalyzed by a 3-keto-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH). Acetyl-CoA is used as a substrate for the synthesis of straight-chain FA, while branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) arise from isobutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA and methylbutyryl-CoA priming substrates.

A higher phi/pho surface ratio means a more thermodynamically favorable organization of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, but steric and/or electrical repulsions between polar heads have also to be considered. For surfactin, it was shown that the phi/pho surface ratio undergoes a decrease for the largest micelles of surfactin because they have to rearrange themselves to reach a more favorable organization. The low value of apolar moieties hydration observed for surfactin micelles is due to the very large peptidic head that efficiently preserves hydrophobic tails from contact with water. The Coarse Grain (CG) representation MARTINI (Marrink et al., 2007) (grouping atoms into beads to speed up the simulation process) was similarly applied to analyse the structural properties and kinetics of surfactin self-assembly in aqueous solution and at octane/water interface (Gang et al., 2020). With complementary MD of a pre-formed micelle and a monolayer, the authors showed that their CG model is in agreement with atomistic MD and experimental data, for micelle self-assembly and stability, as well as for the monolayer. Furthermore, this study allows the development of a set of optimized parameters in a MARTINI CG model that could open further investigations for surfactin interaction with various biofilms, proteins or other targets of interest with a better sampling than atomistic MD.", "Production", "Production", "This last part of this review is dedicated to the improvement of the production of surfactin like compounds.

Linked to the techniques mentioned before, foam can be recovered during the fermentation and lead to 70% of recovery (Davis et al., 2001; Willenbacher et al., 2014). For a fermentation process with the surfactin in the liquid medium, acid precipitation, linked to the negative charge of surfactin, is the oldest and more common used technique. It can lead to a high recovery rate, but has a low purity (55%) and is the only technique that cannot be continuously coupled to the production. Solvent extraction can also be used alone but it is mostly coupled with acid precipitation to enhance the purity (Kim et al., 1997; Geissler et al., 2017). One of the most common type of purification, membrane filtration, can especially be used for surfactin through its micelle forming ability above its critical micelle concentration. The aggregated molecule is larger an thus can be retained by membranes with a MWCO of 10\u2013100 kDa (Jauregi et al., 2013) with recovery rates and a purity above 90% depending on the applied membrane.
