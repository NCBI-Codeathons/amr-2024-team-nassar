Genome-mining techniques are meant to fill this gap, but in order to favor discovery of structurally novel as well as bioactive compounds it is crucial to amend genomics-based strategies with selective filtering principles. In this study, we followed a self-resistance guided approach aiming at the discovery of inhibitors of topoisomerase, known as valid target in both cancer and antibiotic therapy. A common host self-defense mechanism against such inhibitors in bacteria is mediated by so-called pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRP). Genes encoding the biosynthetic machinery for production of an alleged topoisomerase inhibitor were found on the basis of their collocation adjacent to a predicted PRP in the genome of the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax An d48, but to date no matching compound has been reported from this bacterium. Activation of this peculiar polyketide synthase type-II gene cluster in the native host as well as its heterologous expression led to the structure elucidation of new natural products that were named pyxidicyclines and provided an insight into their biosynthesis. Subsequent topoisomerase inhibition assays showed strong affinity to \u2013 and inhibition of \u2013 unwinding topoisomerases such as E. coli topoisomerase IV and human topoisomerase I by pyxidicyclines as well as precise selectivity, since E. coli topoisomerase II (gyrase) was not inhibited at concentrations up to 50 \u03bcg ml\u20131.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Natural products of bacterial origin have continuously provided drug leads to combat infectious diseases and cancer.1 However, as certain groups of microorganisms have been screened extensively for natural products, the discovery of novel secondary metabolite scaffolds becomes increasingly challenging.

Therefore, a second promotor was integrated via single crossover homologous recombination upstream of pcyJ, whereby this operon was activated in addition to the pcyA-I operon (Fig. 3).

Since the promotor-activated pcy cluster in the P. fallax An d48 pcy mutant strain was already constructed, genomic DNA of this strain was used for PCR-based transformation assisted recombination (TAR) assembly of the gene cluster as described by Bylik et al. (Fig. 3).35 Through this assembly method, the whole cluster is reassembled during the cloning step and additional modifications can be engineered into the final construct by co-transformation of PCR products (Fig. 3). The method also allows reorganising the native operon structure of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Thus, the minimal PKS operon (operon 1, pcyA-I) responsible for the creation of the polyketide chain was placed upstream of the tailoring enzyme operon (operon 2, pcyJ-P) likely responsible for the incorporation of an nitrogen-containing moiety into the molecule backbone (Section S1.12,\u2020\nTable 1) and subsequent dehydration to complete the fourth ring of the tetracyclic ring system. The putative resistance and export operon (operon 3, pcyQ-T) was relocated downstream of the tailoring enzyme operon. As already achieved in the An d48 double mutant, the minimal PKS system was kept under the control of the vanillate promotor/repressor system to control compound production through induction, thereby avoiding self-toxicity effects. The tailoring enzymes were subjected to control by the tn5 promotor as in the An d48 pcy mutant to ensure sufficient supply of tailoring enzymes for formation of mature pyxidicyclines. To boost the host's self-resistance towards the pcy cluster derived compounds, the putative resistance operon consisting of the ABC-transporter subunits and the pentapeptide repeat protein PcyT was placed under control of the native P. fallax An d48 gyrase subunit A promotor (PGyrA) to achieve strong and stable expression of the putative export and self-resistance system. That way, all pcy cluster related genes are transcribed in the same direction and the vanillate repressor's transcription and translation cannot interfere with the transcription of operon 2 or 3, and vice versa (Fig. 3). The heterologous promotors for operon 1 and 2 were PCR amplified from the double mutant gDNA together with their gene starts, while the gyrase promotor was taken out of P. fallax An d48 by an additional PCR (Section S1.11\u2020).

The method also allows reorganising the native operon structure of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Thus, the minimal PKS operon (operon 1, pcyA-I) responsible for the creation of the polyketide chain was placed upstream of the tailoring enzyme operon (operon 2, pcyJ-P) likely responsible for the incorporation of an nitrogen-containing moiety into the molecule backbone (Section S1.12,\u2020\nTable 1) and subsequent dehydration to complete the fourth ring of the tetracyclic ring system. The putative resistance and export operon (operon 3, pcyQ-T) was relocated downstream of the tailoring enzyme operon. As already achieved in the An d48 double mutant, the minimal PKS system was kept under the control of the vanillate promotor/repressor system to control compound production through induction, thereby avoiding self-toxicity effects. The tailoring enzymes were subjected to control by the tn5 promotor as in the An d48 pcy mutant to ensure sufficient supply of tailoring enzymes for formation of mature pyxidicyclines. To boost the host's self-resistance towards the pcy cluster derived compounds, the putative resistance operon consisting of the ABC-transporter subunits and the pentapeptide repeat protein PcyT was placed under control of the native P. fallax An d48 gyrase subunit A promotor (PGyrA) to achieve strong and stable expression of the putative export and self-resistance system. That way, all pcy cluster related genes are transcribed in the same direction and the vanillate repressor's transcription and translation cannot interfere with the transcription of operon 2 or 3, and vice versa (Fig. 3). The heterologous promotors for operon 1 and 2 were PCR amplified from the double mutant gDNA together with their gene starts, while the gyrase promotor was taken out of P. fallax An d48 by an additional PCR (Section S1.11\u2020). Finally, in addition to the vector described by Bilyk et al.35 the pClY vector backbone used in this study does not only carry two replication origins ori15A for E. coli and Cen-Ars6 for replication in S. cerevisiae, but also a yeast auxotrophy marker plus kanamycin and apramycin resistance genes. The vector additionally contains the Mx8 integrase system for later integration of the cloned construct into S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 and M. xanthus DK1622 (Fig. 3).36 Therefore the vector assembled in yeast can be used for M. xanthus transformation following retransformation in E. coli.

Since the promotor-activated pcy cluster in the P. fallax An d48 pcy mutant strain was already constructed, genomic DNA of this strain was used for PCR-based transformation assisted recombination (TAR) assembly of the gene cluster as described by Bylik et al.

Formation of the nitrogen-containing D ring is probably mediated by the tailoring enzyme operon comprising pcyJ, pcyK and pcyL. Considering the structure of pyxidicyclines and in light of biosynthetic logic, the nitrogen atom involved in fourth ring closure could stem from ethanolamine, serine or glycine incorporation.

Interestingly, the activation mutants of the minimal PKS in An d48 show production of 4 that cannot be observed in any of the heterologous expression systems.

Furthermore, upon activation of the minimal PKS operon in the An d48 mutant strains via tn5 or vanillate promotor the precursor anthraquinones were still produced but not the full-length pyxidicyclines.
