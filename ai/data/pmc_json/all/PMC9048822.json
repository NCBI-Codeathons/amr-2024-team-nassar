L-lysine, an essential amino acid, is produced biologically in quantities exceeding two million tons per year; yet, L-lysine production is challenged by efficient export system at high titers during fermentation. To address this issue, new exporter candidates for efficient efflux of L-lysine are needed. Using metagenomic functional selection, we identified 58 genes encoded on 28 unique metagenomic fragments from cow gut microbiome library that improved L-lysine tolerance. These genes include a novel L-lysine transporter, belonging to a previously uncharacterized EamA superfamily, which is further in vivo characterized as L-lysine exporter using Xenopus oocyte expression system as well as Escherichia coli host. This novel exporter improved L-lysine tolerance in E. coli by 40% and enhanced yield, titer, and the specific production of L-lysine in an industrial Corynebacterium glutamicum strain by 7.8%, 9.5%, and 12%, respectively. Our approach allows the sequence-independent discovery of novel exporters and can be deployed to increase titers and productivity of toxicity-limited bioprocesses.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The global chemical industry is transitioning from reliance majorly on petrochemical processes to more sustainable bio-based production. This development holds promise to improve the sustainability of the chemical industry while also reducing the overall production costs of chemical products. In order to establish a cost-competitive bioprocess, titers of fermentations frequently exceed 100 gl\u22121, which leads to a significant stress on the host organism. Indeed, a majority of industrial bioprocesses are limited in production due to several stresses, for example, osmotic stress, leading to product toxicity.", "The global chemical industry is transitioning from reliance majorly on petrochemical processes to more sustainable bio-based production.

The global bio-based L-lysine production is estimated to reach 3.0 million tons in 2022 corresponding to 5.6 billion USD of market value according to the current L-lysine market report (Elder, 2018). Industrial L-lysine bioprocesses entirely rely on Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli production strains that achieve titers over 1.2\u2009M (Becker and Wittmann, 2012; Lee and Kim, 2015). It was observed that the L-lysine export rate is inhibited by 50% upon exceeding the extracellular concentration of 400\u2009mM compared to that at 80\u2009mM (Kelle et al., 1996), indicating the substantial inhibition of the L-lysine-specific export in industrial fermentation. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the benefit of incorporating active efflux systems to address intracellular product accumulation in bio-based production (Malla et al., 2010; Hemberger et al., 2011; Borodina, 2019). Hence, L-lysine export system is an obvious target to maintain the producer organism at high lysine concentration as well as easing the downstream process. Despite its importance, there are only two identified lysine-specific exporters: (i) LysE as a member of the lysine efflux permease (LysE; 2.A.75) family (Vrljic et al., 1999; Bellmann et al., 2001) and (ii) lysine outward permease (LysO or YbjE in E. coli; Vrljic et al., 1996; Pathania and Sardesai, 2015) achieved five-fold higher lysine export rate upon overexpression of LysE in C. glutamicum (Vrljic et al., 1996). Similarly, Yasueda and coworker have deployed this strategy for 10-fold improvement in L-lysine production by expressing a spontaneously mutated LysE from C. glutamicum in Methylophilis methylotrophus (Gunji and Yasueda, 2006). In addition to the rational engineering of the existing exporters, there is an urgent demand for new genetic building blocks to further improve L-lysine tolerance and production.", "One of the most significant bio-based chemical products is L-lysine.

Hence, we set out to use functional metagenomic selection to identify novel L-lysine transporter candidates from a cow fecal library, with the goal of improving industrial L-lysine production (Figure 1A). Using C13-labeled L-lysine and mRNA expression of the screened transporter in Xenopus oocyte, the transporter candidate was confirmed as L-lysine exporter.

The constructed plasmid was introduced into C. glutamicum VL5 strain (Materials and methods), a producer strain currently used for industrial L-lysine production. Using sucrose as a carbon source, L-lysine production from the constructed C. glutamicum recombinant strain was analyzed at 30\u2009h. The C. glutamicum VL5 parent strain and VL5 transformed with empty plasmid (i.e., VL5/pEKEx2) produced 26.59 and 27.13 gl\u22121 of L-lysine respectively, whereas 29.72 gl\u22121 of L-lysine titer was produced by the strain expressing MglE operon (i.e., VL5/pEX-RCL-MglE).

Through applying this approach to the problem of L-lysine toxicity at high concentration, we discovered MglE, which is confirmed as a novel type of L-lysine exporter that belongs to the EamA superfamily and this gene could not have been identified by only sequence analysis or homology to known L-lysine transporters. We demonstrated the benefits of MglE in both Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (C. glutamicum) strains and showed that MglE expression improves the productivity of an industrial L-lysine production strain. If incorporated into industrial-scale bioprocesses, this discovery has the potential to enhance L-lysine production by about 10%\u201312%, representing an increased profit on the order of 200\u2013500 million USD per year.
