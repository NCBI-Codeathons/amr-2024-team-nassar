As a result, efforts to uncover the mechanisms of resistance are essential to the development of new antibiotics, anticancer drugs and pesticides. To study how nature evolves resistance to highly potent natural products, we examined the biosynthesis and mechanism of self-resistance of the fungal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibitor heptelidic acid (HA). HA is a nanomolar inhibitor of GADPH through the covalent modification of the active site cysteine thiol. The biosynthetic pathway of HA was elucidated, which uncovered the enzymatic basis of formation of the epoxide warhead. Structure\u2013activity relationship study using biosynthetic intermediates established the importance of the fused lactone ring system in HA. The molecular basis of HA inhibiting human GAPDH was illustrated through the crystal structure of Hs-GAPDH covalently bound with HA. A GAPDH isozyme HepG encoded in the HA cluster was characterized to be less sensitive to HA, and therefore contribute to self-resistance for the producing host. Comparison of the crystal structures of human GAPDH and HepG showed mutations both within and remote to the active site can contribute to resistance of inactivation, which was confirmed through mutagenesis. Due to the critical role GAPDH plays in aerobic glycolysis and other cellular functions, knowledge of HA mode of action and self-resistance mechanism could accelerate the development of improved inhibitors.", "The structural basis and self-resistance mechanism of fungal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor heptelidic acid are uncovered.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The rapid emergence of resistance to bioactive small molecules has become a major challenge for health care and agriculture.1 Once effective antibiotics, antifungal, anticancer drugs and pesticides are gradually becoming obsolete due to the rise of resistant strains that have acquired mutations in the cellular targets.2,3 Therefore, uncovering and overcoming the resistance mechanisms are of paramount importance for civilization. One approach that can provide insights into how nature evolves resistance in essential housekeeping enzymes is by examining how microbial hosts self-protect against biosynthesized, potent natural products (NPs). Often referred to as the chemical agent in microbial warfare, NPs are synthesized by microbes including both bacteria and fungi, to target essential housekeeping enzymes in antagonistic organisms. To protect against the NPs, the producing hosts have developed different strategies, including the ingenious use of a mutated and functional version of the housekeeping enzyme that is insensitive to the NP, and hence self-resistant.4,5 Gene encoding the self-resistance enzyme is frequently colocalized with the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of a NP, and has been used as a predictive tool for the bioactivity of the NP synthesized by the BGC.6,7 Clearly, nature has evolved self-resistance enzymes from housekeeping enzymes to become resistant to potent NPs. Understanding the molecular differences between sensitive and resistant enzymes of the same catalytic function can therefore provide immense information on the origins and mechanisms of resistance.", "The rapid emergence of resistance to bioactive small molecules has become a major challenge for health care and agriculture.1 Once effective antibiotics, antifungal, anticancer drugs and pesticides are gradually becoming obsolete due to the rise of resistant strains that have acquired mutations in the cellular targets.2,3 Therefore, uncovering and overcoming the resistance mechanisms are of paramount importance for civilization.

Because HA is a covalent and irreversible inhibitor, the host may had evolutionary pressure to evolve its housekeeping copy to also be more resistant, while still requiring the resistant copy in HepG. The increased resistance displayed by HepG provides further protection to the host, before HA is transported to the outside of the cell, possibly by the MFS efflux pump HepF. The less sensitivity measured for the housekeeping GAPDH here is in contrast to previous reports in which housekeeping GAPDH from A. oryzae and T. koningii are much more sensitive towards HA. For example, Endo and coworkers showed the kinact/KI of housekeeping GAPDH in T. koningii was \u223c160-fold greater than the proposed resistant isozymes.30 While Koyama and coworkers showed the IC50 of HA towards the housekeeping GAPDH is 60-fold lower than the HepG homolog in A. oryzae. These differences in the level of sensitivity displayed by the housekeeping GAPDH may therefore reflect the different extent of evolution in conferring self-resistances towards HA. While Tv-GAPDH may indeed have evolved to be more resistant to HA, the different methodology used for the assays in the prior reports can also contribute to the differences. As HA is a covalent inhibitor that irreversibly inactivates the enzyme, the values of potency of reversible binding (KI) and maximum potential rate of inactivation (kinact) measured by the Kitz\u2013Wilson method are more representative quantitative measurements of inhibition. On the other hand, IC50 values are strongly affected by both preincubation time between enzyme and inhibitor, and the overall time of the assay.", "Lastly, our data show the housekeeping GAPDH, Tv-GAPDH, is also significantly less sensitive to HA compared to Hs-GAPDH, and the kinact/KI is only 2.3-fold higher than that of HepG. Because HA is a covalent and irreversible inhibitor, the host may had evolutionary pressure to evolve its housekeeping copy to also be more resistant, while still requiring the resistant copy in HepG. The increased resistance displayed by HepG provides further protection to the host, before HA is transported to the outside of the cell, possibly by the MFS efflux pump HepF. The less sensitivity measured for the housekeeping GAPDH here is in contrast to previous reports in which housekeeping GAPDH from A. oryzae and T. koningii are much more sensitive towards HA.
