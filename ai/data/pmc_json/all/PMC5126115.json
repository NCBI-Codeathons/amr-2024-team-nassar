Without cell-surface stresses, ECF \u03c3 factors are sequestered by the cognate anti-\u03c3 factor, leading to inactivation and the resultant repression of regulons due to the inhibition of transcription of their own genes. Bacillus subtilis has seven ECF \u03c3 factors including \u03c3X and \u03c3M that transcribe their own structural genes. Here, we report that glucose addition to the medium induced sigX and sigM transcription independent of their anti-\u03c3 factors. This induction was dependent on an intracellular acetyl-CoA pool. Transposon mutagenesis searching for the mutants showing no induction of sigX and sigM revealed that the cshA gene encoding DEAD-box RNA helicase is required for gene induction. Global analysis of the acetylome in B. subtilis showed CshA has two acetylated lysine residues. We found that in a cshA mutant with acetylation-abolishing K to R exchange mutations, glucose induction of sigX and sigM was abolished and that glucose addition stimulated acetylation of CshA in the wild type strain. Thus, we present a model wherein glucose addition results in a larger acetyl-CoA pool, probably leading to increased levels of acetylated CshA. CshA is known to associate with RNA polymerase (RNAP), and thus RNAP with acetylated CshA could stimulate the autoregulation of sigX and sigM. This is a unique model showing a functional link between nutritional signals and the basal transcription machinery.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The association of \u03c3 factor with RNAP determines the specific binding of the RNAP holoenzyme to target promoters (Helmann and Chamberlin, 1988). The varieties of \u03c3 factors enhance the chance for survival in the environment via fine-tuning of the regulation of gene expression. Bacteria have several distinct \u03c3 factors including extracytoplasmic function (ECF) \u03c3 factors, which are composed of large paralog gene families (Souza et al., 2014; Helmann, 2016). ECF \u03c3 factors commonly respond to cell envelope stresses and transcribe genes related to the stress response (Souza et al., 2014; Helmann, 2016). In Bacillus subtilis, seven ECF \u03c3 factors, \u03c3M, \u03c3V, \u03c3W, \u03c3X, \u03c3Y, \u03c3Z, and \u03c3Y laC are encoded in the genome (Helmann, 2016). In many cases, these \u03c3 factors recognize similar nucleotide sequences. \u03c3M, \u03c3V, \u03c3W, and \u03c3X bind to the consensus -35 and -10 elements, (T)GAAACNT and CGT(C/A)T, respectively (Helmann, 2016). As a result, these \u03c3-factor regulons overlap, yet there are genes transcribed by a single ECF \u03c3 factor. \u03c3X- and \u03c3M-RNAPs transcribe their own genes: sigX and sigM, respectively (Asai et al., 2003; Helmann, 2016). The \u03c3X regulon contains the genes required for resistance against the antibiotic nisin and the peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitor bacitracin, and the genes encoding enzymes for D-alanylation of teichoic acids, which are required for the resistance against cationic antimicrobial peptides (Huang and Helmann, 1998; Cao and Helmann, 2002, 2004; Asai et al., 2003). In the sigX mutant, levels of heat and oxidative stress resistance are low, but the mechanism responsible for this is not yet known (Huang et al., 1997). The \u03c3M regulon includes >60 genes such as core genes for cell wall biogenesis and cell division (rodA, divIC, mreBCDminCD, and murBdivIB), regulatory genes (spx and abh), and the bacitracin resistance gene bcrC (Cao and Helmann, 2002; Thackray and Moir, 2003; Eiamphungporn and Helmann, 2008; Luo and Helmann, 2009).", "The association of \u03c3 factor with RNAP determines the specific binding of the RNAP holoenzyme to target promoters (Helmann and Chamberlin, 1988).

The anti-\u03c3 factor embedded in the cell membrane traps the cognate \u03c3 factor through a protein\u2013protein interaction, leading to repressed expression of the regulon. A detailed mechanism for the release of \u03c3 factor from anti-\u03c3 factor in B. subtilis is well-understood for \u03c3W and includes specific proteolysis of its cognate anti-\u03c3 factor (Ho and Ellermeier, 2012). Exposure to antibiotics that interfere with cell wall biosynthesis induces ECF \u03c3 factors (e.g., the peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitor vancomycin induces sigM) (Thackray and Moir, 2003). In addition, some mutations in the cell envelope biosynthesis pathway induce the sigX and/or sigM regulons (Hashimoto et al., 2013). For example, a mutation in yfhO, encoding a probable flippase for polymers synthesized by the CsbB glucosyltranfserase, enhanced sigM regulon expression (Inoue et al., 2013). A mutation in ugtP, which encodes a UDP glucosyltransferase, induces expression of the \u03c3X regulon (Matsuoka et al., 2011). Transposon mutagenesis for mutants that upregulate sigX promoter activity, that is, screening for inhibiting genes of \u03c3X activity, resulted in identification of seven mutations including a multidrug efflux pump gene (Turner and Helmann, 2000).", "In most cases, a gene encoding an ECF \u03c3 factor is associated with a gene encoding a corresponding anti-\u03c3 factor (Ho and Ellermeier, 2012).

Protein lysine acetylation is a well-conserved protein modification in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Wang et al., 2010; Thao and Escalante-Semerena, 2011; Bernal et al., 2014).

Between murF and cshA there is no terminator, and thus this promoter may transcribe cshA. In addition, there is a promoter upstream of ddlA (Nicolas et al., 2012). These suggested a read-through mechanism from the upstream promoters. To confirm this, we examined activities of a lacZ-fusion located at the original locus in the chromosome. This lacZ fusion showed higher activity as compared to its own promoter fused to lacZ. Glucose addition also did not affect the activity (Supplementary Figure S7B, right). It should be noted that the strain with this fusion at the original locus carries the cshA disruption. These observations showed that read-through transcription contributed to cshA expression.

These results strongly suggested that acetylation of two lysine residues in CshA is required for GI of sigX and sigM. Moreover, the results also indicated that basal expression and GI of sigX and sigM were mutually distinguishable in a genetic context. We note that the strains bearing wild type and mutant CshA proteins did not grow in culture with 2% glucose in the presence of xylose, and the extent of the resistance against glucose changed in the strains bearing sigX-lacZ and sigM-lacZ due to unknown reasons (data not shown).

Introduction of these mutations resulted in similar effects on the expression of sigX-lacZ and sigM-lacZ (Figure 6).

Our model shown in Figure 9 encompasses all of the experimental data: involvement of pdhC, the different effects of carbon sources on GI, the effects of non-acetylation mimicking mutations, and the enhancement of CshA acetylation by glucose, yet some key elements in this model remain unknown. It is of interest whether CshA is acetylated before it binds to RNAP or if acetylation of CshA stimulates RNAP-binding of CshA. In addition, there are several outstanding questions, for example, what enzyme acetylates CshA, or how \u03c3X/M replaces \u03c3A in the RNAP holoenzyme, during GI. According to an analysis of the RNAP holoenzyme, the core RNAP with no \u03c3 factor was barely detected (Delumeau et al., 2011). Thus, replacement of \u03c3X/M for \u03c3A is a likely event. Generally, competition between housekeeping \u03c3A and alternative \u03c3 factors for the core RNAP is favorable for \u03c3A-binding due to the higher affinity of \u03c3A for RNAP (\u00d6sterberg et al., 2011). To change the balance of \u03c3 binding, various mechanisms have been reported (\u00d6sterberg et al., 2011). For example, the small subunit of RNAP, the \u03c9- subunit, is involved in \u03c3 factor recruitment (Weiss and Shaw, 2015). This demonstrates that a protein associated with RNAP can modulate its affinity to a specific \u03c3 factor perhaps through structural change as we may see with CshA.", "RNA polymerase with acetylated CshA may somehow stimulate the autoregulatory loop of sigX and sigM.

A possibility that translational control of sigX and sigM by CshA cannot be completely excluded.
