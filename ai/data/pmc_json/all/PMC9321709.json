["Abstract", "By limiting the nitrogen source to glutamic acid, we isolated cyclic peptides from Euglena gracilis containing asparagine and non\u2010proteinogenic amino acids. Structure elucidation was accomplished through spectroscopic methods, mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. The euglenatides potently inhibit pathogenic fungi and cancer cell lines e.g., euglenatide B exhibiting IC50 values of 4.3\u2005\u03bcM in Aspergillus fumigatus and 0.29\u2005\u03bcM in MCF\u20107 breast cancer cells. In an unprecedented convergence of non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase assembly\u2010line biosynthesis between unicellular species and the metazoan kingdom, euglenatides bear resemblance to nemamides from Caenorhabditis elegans and inhibited both producing organisms E.\u2005gracilis and C.\u2005elegans. By molecular network analysis, we detected over forty euglenatide\u2010like metabolites in E.\u2005gracilis, E.\u2005sanguinea and E.\u2005mutabilis, suggesting an important biological role for these natural products.", "Light and glutamic acid induced E.\u2005gracilis to produce euglenatides with antifungal and anticancer activity. Euglenatides were also detected in E.\u2005sanguinea and E.\u2005mutabilis. They resemble the nemamides isolated from C.\u2005elegans, inhibited both producing species, and represent uniquely convergent assembly\u2010line biosynthesis between unicellular organisms and metazoans.", "M.

The resulting euglenatides contain L\u2010 and D\u2010asparagine, as well as (R)\u2010\u03b2\u2010aminoisobutyric acid, a rare constituent in peptide natural products. In addition, the euglenatides are the first peptide natural products disclosed to incorporate 4,5\u2010dihydroxynorvaline, 4,5\u2010dihdroxynorleucine and the novel C20 polyketide derived \u03b2\u2010amino acid graciline with a conjugated triene and two oxygenated stereocenters in the side chain. Interestingly, the E.\u2005sanguinea metabolite euglenophycin (Figure\u20051) also contains 20 carbons, and it is plausible that it shares a common C20 polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor with the euglenatides.", "We demonstrate that even a species like Euglena gracilis, subject to scientific study for centuries, harbors unusual and novel secondary metabolites. Ultimately, our successful unmasking of the euglenatides relied on the traditional \u201cone strain, many compounds (OSMAC)\u201d approach of altering fermentation conditions.\n[39]\n Specifically, culture in minimal media with glutamic acid as the sole nitrogen source served to activate a normally quiescent biosynthetic pathway.

By molecular network analysis, we detected over 40 euglenatide\u2010like metabolites in three Euglena species, implying a widespread occurrence within the genus. The euglenatides share a structural similarity to the nemamides, the only known metazoan natural product of NRPS\u2010PKS origin and inhibited the growth of both producing organisms E.\u2005gracilis and C.\u2005elegans. The astonishing structural congruence between protist and animal kingdom secondary metabolites is unique in chemical ecology. The ability to harvest multimg quantities of euglenatides from E.\u2005gracilis will expedite further research into the biological ramifications of these cyclic peptides.", "Euglenatides exhibited significant antiproliferative activity against Candida and Aspergillus, the two major pathogenic fungal genera, and a panel of human cancer cells.
