["Fungal-derived drugs include some of the most important medicines ever discovered, and have proved pivotal in treating chronic diseases. Not only have they saved millions of lives, but they have in some cases changed perceptions of what is medically possible. However, now the low-hanging fruit have been discovered it has become much harder to make the kind of discoveries that have characterised past eras of fungal drug discovery. This may be about to change with new commercial players entering the market aiming to apply novel genomic tools to streamline the discovery process. This review examines the discovery history of approved fungal-derived drugs, and those currently in clinical trials for chronic diseases. For key molecules, we discuss their possible ecological functions in nature and how this relates to their use in human medicine. We show how the conservation of drug receptors between fungi and humans means that metabolites intended to inhibit competitor fungi often interact with human drug receptors, sometimes with unintended benefits. We also plot the distribution of drugs, antimicrobial compounds and psychoactive mushrooms onto a fungal tree and compare their distribution to those of all fungal metabolites. Finally, we examine the phenomenon of self-resistance and how this can be used to help predict metabolite mechanism of action and aid the drug discovery process.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Fungi are the source of some of the most important drugs ever discovered, including drugs of historic importance as well as recent blockbuster drugs. These compounds have found essential roles in treating chronic conditions, predominantly for chronic infections (antibiotics and antifungal drugs) autoimmune diseases (immunosuppressants) and hypercholesterolemia (the statins) (Table 1 and Figure 1). More recently, fungal-derived metabolites have been entering clinical trials to treat chronic diseases such as cancer and drug-resistant depression. In this review, we examine the discovery history of established fungal-derived drugs and examine new lead compounds that have recently entered clinical trials. Although different definitions for chronic disease exist, for this review we shall use the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention definition, in which chronic diseases are defined as conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both [1].", "Fungi are the source of some of the most important drugs ever discovered, including drugs of historic importance as well as recent blockbuster drugs.

Indeed, various cultures have long made use of fungi as medicines and hallucinogens [2]. The isolation of pure chemical substances from fungi is not a recent endeavour either. Early examples of compound isolation date back to at least 1893 [3]. Despite this early knowledge of fungal bioactivity, the story of fungal drug discovery in many ways starts with the discovery of penicillin in the 1940s. Penicillin drew the attention of the scientific world to the incredible potential of fungi as a source of therapeutic small molecules.

It may have drifted in the air from the laboratory of Charles La Touche, a mycologist working on Penicillium moulds whose laboratory was in the same building [4]. Alternatively, it may simply have come from the air in Fleming\u2019s laboratory; spores of penicillin-producing fungi are after all highly ubiquitous in indoor environments. The fungal contaminant in question, which had previously been misidentified as Penicillium chrysogenum or P. notatum has recently been re-identified as Penicillium rubens [5]. Furthermore, the penicillin isolated from it at Oxford, UK was penicillin F (2-pentenylpenicillin), not penicillin G or penicillin V which are the penicillins used in medicine today [6]. Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) was isolated in the United States using the strain P. rubens NRRL 1951, (the Wisconsin strain) which was found growing on a mouldy cantaloupe, in Peoria, Illinois. Regardless of its origin, penicillin was not simply a highly effective antibiotic; it was a medicine that changed perceptions as to what was possible in the treatment of bacterial infections. Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits the cross-linking of peptidoglycans which are a structural component of bacterial cell walls [7]. Since humans lack a cell wall, penicillin is able to kill bacteria without affecting human cells. Its discovery established fungi as an important source from which to look for therapeutic molecules and begged the question, what other useful medicines might be lurking in what would be later recognised as the kingdom Fungi?", "The fungal contaminant on Alexander Fleming\u2019s Petri dish was a species of Penicillium but how it got there is unclear.

The producing organism Acremonium chrysogenum had been isolated in 1945 from seawater close to a sewage outfall in Sardinia by local scientist Giuseppe Brotzu, who was investigating the epidemiology of typhoid [8,9]. Brotzu had noticed that although Salmonella was common in the sewers of Sardinia, bathers who swam in the sea rarely contracted Salmonella infections, and he reasoned there might be a process of \u201cself-purification of seawater\u201d. In trying to investigate this hypothesis, he came across a fungal organism that exhibited antibiotic antagonism on a Petri dish, and like Fleming before him, he reasoned it might have therapeutic value [9]. The fungal strain he isolated eventually made its way to Edward Abraham, who had worked on the isolation of penicillin in Oxford, and he was able to chemically isolate cephalosporin C in 1953. The discovery stimulated the development of the wider cephalosporin class of antibiotics which have proved effective against bacteria resistant to penicillin and are still in development today. An interesting parallel between the isolation of cephalosporin C and penicillin drugs is the length of time taken to chemically isolate the active metabolite due to the lack of advanced separation methods available at the time. Given the paucity of effective antibacterial medicines available, it may be pertinent to consider if isolation of a semi-pure fraction would have been sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of these compounds as topical antibiotics. This could have been achieved in a very small fraction of the time taken to achieve the more complete isolation that took many years and significantly delayed the introduction of antibiotics.", "The next major antibiotic discovery was cephalosporin C, which shares the same beta-lactam structure with the penicillins, and also shares a similar mechanism of action.

In a recent phase III trial reported in 2022, comparing plinabulin efficacy against the drug pegfilgrastim, plinabulin was found to have comparable efficacy to pegfilgrastim for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, with a better safety and immunosuppressive profile [41].", "Irofulven is a DNA alkylating agent and synthetic derivative of illudin S which was first isolated in 1950 from cultures of Omphalotus illudens (formerly Clitocybe illudens) [42].

It might be assumed that A. terreus gains a survival advantage when competing for nutrients in close proximity with lovastatin-susceptible fungal species [74]. However, in humans, HMG-CoA reductase is required for the synthesis of cholesterol. Thus, by opting to meditate its antifungal effects by inhibiting an enzyme that is conserved between fungi and humans, A. terreus has inadvertently produced a drug useful in treating high cholesterol levels in humans.

Cyclosporin A is a cyclic peptide produced by the entamopathogenic fungus T. inflatum [23]. Cyclosporin A was originally discovered due to its antifungal properties but later found use as an immunosuppressant. In fungi, cyclosporin A is a selective inhibitor of the calcineurin pathway which controls the transcription of calcineurin-dependent genes [23]. Amongst the genes whose expression is controlled by the calcineurin pathway are those involved in virulence, hyphal growth and cell wall integrity [77]. Thus, cyclosporin A in all likelihood imparts a survival advantage to the fungal organism producing it when in direct close proximity and competition with cyclosporin A-susceptible fungal species. Yet, aside from its antifungal effects, cyclosporin A also appears to play a role in the immunosuppression of its insect host. T. inflatum is known for infecting beetle larvae and living inside them for a period of time before its spore-forming structures eventually emerge from its host. In higher eukaryotes such as insects and humans, calcineurin-dependent genes play an important role in immunity. Indeed, studies carried out in Galleria mellonella larvae treated with cyclosporin A demonstrated suppression of its humoral immune response [78]. Thus, it would appear that cyclosporin A enables T. inflatum to counter its host\u2019s immune response during the infection process. This intriguingly mirrors its role in human medicine, where inhibition of the calcineurin pathway inhibits human T-cell activation resulting in immunosuppression. Indeed, the powerful immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporin A in humans proved pivotal in the development of the field of organ transplantation as discussed earlier. The ecological function of cyclosporin A may therefore in fact be two-fold. Firstly, to act as an immunosuppressant of the insect host of T. inflatum and once the insect host is parasitised, to prevent opportunistic fungal pathogens from forming a co-infection by virtue of its antifungal properties.

A relatively recent success in fungal drug discovery has been the development of the multiple sclerosis drug fingolimod, whose chemical structure took inspiration from the compound myriocin, produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Isaria sinclarii (see Figure 2) [24]. Like T. inflatum, I. sinclarii infects insect larvae; in the case of I. sinclarii, specifically the grubs of certain cicada species. I. sinclarii produces the compound myriocin which inhibits the biosynthesis of sphingolipids resulting in immunosuppression of the insect host, whereas the drug fingolimod acts on sphingosine receptors resulting in receptor internalisation, which prevents lymphocytes from exiting lymph nodes in the human patient [24].

A relatively recent success in fungal drug discovery has been the development of the multiple sclerosis drug fingolimod, whose chemical structure took inspiration from the compound myriocin, produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Isaria sinclarii (see Figure 2) [24]. Like T. inflatum, I. sinclarii infects insect larvae; in the case of I. sinclarii, specifically the grubs of certain cicada species. I. sinclarii produces the compound myriocin which inhibits the biosynthesis of sphingolipids resulting in immunosuppression of the insect host, whereas the drug fingolimod acts on sphingosine receptors resulting in receptor internalisation, which prevents lymphocytes from exiting lymph nodes in the human patient [24].

Although the mechanism of action of myriocin and fingolimod differ somewhat, it is interesting that both are able to exert immunosuppressive effects in their respective target organisms.", "An obvious question that arises from the observation that so many fungal-derived drugs are themselves antifungal, is how does the producing fungal organism do this without killing itself? The answer appears to often lie with resistance genes that reduce the intracellular toxicity of the metabolites, thereby making their biosynthesis tolerable. Intriguingly, for compounds that are drug-like and interact with a specific receptor, such resistance genes are often a gene duplication of the actual pharmacological receptor of the compound. Cyclosporin A is one such example. A recent study aimed at identifying genes involved in cyclosporin A biosynthesis found that surprisingly, the biosynthetic gene cluster includes a copy of a gene similar to human cyclophilin A, the pharmacological target of cyclosporin A [79]. To investigate further, the authors created a deletion mutant in which the cyclophilin gene had been removed and then showed that this mutant was indeed sensitive to exogenous cyclosporin A whereas the wild-type strain was not [79].", "An obvious question that arises from the observation that so many fungal-derived drugs are themselves antifungal, is how does the producing fungal organism do this without killing itself?

Within this class, the order Hypocreales, with 2647 described species, encompasses mostly systemic endophytes, plant pathogens and fungal and insect parasites. The genus Acremonium (family incertae sedis), contains saprotrophs and opportunistic animal pathogens. The families Ophiocordycipitaceae and Cordycipitaceae, also in the Hypocreales, are especially well known for their medical and culinary value, a notable example being Tolypocladium inflatum. The genus Trichoderma (Hypocreaceae), present in most soils and generally observed to be easily culturable has also yielded numerous bioactive metabolites. Finally, the family Clavicipetaceae, which contains many taxa known to produce alkaloids toxic to animals is also found in the Hypocreales. Interestingly, the closest relatives to this order do not appear to be such prolific producers of bioactive compounds. Whereas the order Glomerelalles contains drugs and antibacterial compounds, and Microascales antifungal compounds, the closest Coronophorales, Falcocladiales and Torpedosporales, albeit much smaller groups, lack any records of compound activity in our datasets. One of the main differences for these rarer groups is that being mostly saprotrophs, they have a narrower nutritional range.", "The largest phylum Ascomycota is also the one that contains the highest number of orders containing bioactive species.

Conclusions", "In this review, we have shown that despite the importance of fungal-derived drugs to the treatment of chronic diseases, in many cases their discovery is purely serendipitous or the result of random screening. Future fungal drug discovery programs need to consider the ecological role metabolites may have in nature and use this to provide more intelligent screening methods. Furthermore, finding more efficient discovery methods that avoid the inherent bottlenecks in the fungal drug discovery process is key to unlocking the medicinal potential of the fungal kingdom. The inerrant disparity between the chemical diversity of fungi suggested by genomic analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters and the actual number of compounds discovered highlights the need for innovative new methods, but progress is now being made. Recent advances in heterologous expression of fungal biosynthetic gene clusters in yeast are making compound isolation and discovery more efficient and overcoming some of the experimental bottlenecks that have been a hallmark of fungal drug discovery in the past. An understanding of the importance of metabolite self-resistance is stimulating a renaissance in pharmaceutical bioprospecting from fungi. The ability to gain clues to the mechanism of action of compounds produced by a given species before any chemical analysis has even taken place is proving to be a powerful investigational tool, and has attracted significant investment from the commercial sector. These advances may yet see new fungal-derived drugs reaching the clinic in years to come. Even without these new experimental tools, research into previously known bioactive fungal metabolites has led to a range of fungal small molecules being tested in clinical trials, and a small number have recently received approval for use in humans.", "In this review, we have shown that despite the importance of fungal-derived drugs to the treatment of chronic diseases, in many cases their discovery is purely serendipitous or the result of random screening.

Our own analysis clearly proves the difficulty in revealing obvious patterns that may aid drug discovery predictions. Taxonomic relatedness does not seem to be a good predictor, at least with the bioactivity data sets used here. However, lifestyle flexibility may be a good indicator of bioactive metabolite production in the Ascomycota, but not in other groups. The fact that the fungal tree of life has so many unknowns and that so many bioactive species still have not been correctly placed, suggests that we may not yet be ready to use this type of information to guide drug discovery. Improved resolution of fungal genomic data combined with more densely sampled phylogenomic trees may help improve the situation. Additionally, a certain level of boldness is required; searching in previously unexplored groups may lead to the discovery of novel metabolites with novel mechanisms of action.", "Future fungal drug discovery programs may benefit from a big picture view that takes into account patterns in the distribution of bioactive metabolites across the fungal kingdom, but this may involve examining traits such as fungal lifestyle and nutritional characteristics rather than simple taxonomic relationships.
