With the completion of the genome sequence of FS14, the first comprehensive comparative-genomic analysis of the Serratia genus was performed. Pan-genome and COG analyses showed that the majority of the conserved core genes are involved in basic cellular functions, while genomic factors such as prophages contribute considerably to genome diversity. Additionally, a Type I restriction-modification system, a Type III secretion system and tellurium resistance genes are found in only some Serratia species. Comparative analysis further identified that S. marcescens FS14 possesses multiple mechanisms for antagonism against other microorganisms, including the production of prodigiosin, bacteriocins, and multi-antibiotic resistant determinants as well as chitinases. The presence of two evolutionarily distinct Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) in FS14 may provide further competitive advantages for FS14 against other microbes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of comparative analysis on T6SSs in the genus, which identifies four types of T6SSs in Serratia spp.. Competition bioassays of FS14 against the vital plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were performed to support our genomic analyses, in which FS14 demonstrated high antagonistic activities against both bacterial and fungal phytopathogens.", "Data Availability", "Genome data are deposited into NCBI GenBank (accession number: CP005927) and may be downloaded by following: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP005927.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The bacterial strain FS14 was isolated from an Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz plant infected by the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, which is a causative agent of the root-rot disease [1].

Both ChiA and ChiB are absent in S. marcescens FGI 94, implicating that it may have lost the ability to degrade chitin when it adopted a commensal life with fungus. FS14 possesses 4 genes involved in the secretion of chitinases and they may play a critical role in its suppression of fungi necessary for its competitive lifestyle in diseased plants.", "FS14 possesses a set of genes involved in the secretion of chitinases and they are expected to play an important role in the inhibition of mycelial extension, which is in agreement with the observations from our co-culture assays of FS14 and fungi. In fact, the culture filtrate of some S. plymuthica and S. marcescens has been used as a biocontrol agent against fungi because of their secretion of chitinases [76, 77].", "FS14 possesses a set of genes involved in the secretion of chitinases and they are expected to play an important role in the inhibition of mycelial extension, which is in agreement with the observations from our co-culture assays of FS14 and fungi.

The comparison of ten Serratia genomes has identified the universal core genes of Serratia and unique genes to each strain. S. marcescens FS14 possesses a unique Type I RM system, whereas FGI 94 has acquired a type III secretion system and S. fonticola RB-25 was found to have homologues of tellurium resistance genes. The presence of prodigiosin, bacteriocins, multi-drug resistant proteins and chitinases in Serratia suggests its antagonistic potential. The identification of two T6SS clusters offers further evidence that FS14 competes with other microbes, thus enhancing the survival of FS14 in various habitats. Compared to other Serratia, FS14 possesses both a prodigiosin cluster and two T6SSs. The antagonistic effect assays demonstrated that S. marcescens FS14 can suppress the growth of the vital plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in vitro.", "In a nutshell, the complete genome of S. marcescens FS14 is 5.25Mb with a genomic GC content of 59.46%.
