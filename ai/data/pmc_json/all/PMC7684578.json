["", "Pedobacter cryoconitis strain UP508 was isolated\nfrom a soil sample using a mixture of ampicillin, kanamycin, and nalidixic\nacid for selection. UP508 was found to produce >30 unknown antibacterial\npeptides, of which eight, isopedopeptins A\u2013H (1\u20138), were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation\nand characterized with respect to structures and biological properties.\nCompounds 1\u20138 were all composed of\nnine amino acid residues and one 3-hydroxy fatty acid residue, and\nthe structures were ring-closed via an ester bond from the C-terminal\naspartic acid to the 3-hydroxy fatty acid. The differences between\nthe peptides were the size and branching of the 3-hydroxy fatty acid\nand the presence of a valine or a 3-hydroxyvaline residue. The isopedopeptins\nmainly had activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and isopedopeptin\nB (2), which had the best combination of antibacterial\nactivity, in vitro cytotoxicity, and hemolytic properties,\nwas selected for further studies against a larger panel of Gram-negative\nbacteria. Isopedopeptin B was found to have good activity against\nstrains of WHO top-priority Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory\nconcentrations (MIC) down to 1, 2, and 4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.\nFurthermore, compound 2 had activity against colistin-resistant\nstrains of A. baumannii, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a MIC down to\n8, 2, and 4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Compound 6 was\ntested in an E. coli liposome system where it induced\nsignificant leakage, indicating membrane disruption as one mechanism\ninvolved in isopedopeptin antibacterial activity. Isopedopeptin B\nstands out as a promising candidate for further studies with the goal\nto develop a new antibiotic drug.", "The global\nspread of antibiotic\nresistance threatens many aspects of modern healthcare, and in the\nfuture even the simplest infection or any routine surgery may be dangerous\nwithout access to efficient and safe antibiotics. In Europe, infections\ncaused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are responsible for the deaths\nof more than 30\u202f000 individuals per year,1 and estimations in the U.S. show similar figures.2 The situation is expected to escalate in the\nyears to come. To manage this serious problem, humanity needs access\nto new antibiotic drugs but also regulations to limit the spread of\nresistance against present and future antibiotic drugs.", "A large\nproportion of the antibacterial drugs used today, and in\nthe past, originate from nature\u2014either as molecules isolated\nfrom microorganisms or developed from such molecules. Fungi and bacteria\nproduce compounds with antimicrobial properties, with the assumed\nfunction to mediate interactions with competing microorganisms, to\nbring benefits to the producers. One important group of natural compounds\nused as antibiotic drugs are peptides produced by fungi or bacteria,\nand vancomycin, penicillins, and cephalosporins are all classical\nexamples of such peptides which influence cell-wall synthesis in the\ntarget bacteria. Over the years, these peptides have served as models\nfor the development of related improved antibiotic drugs, such as\nextended-spectrum penicillins, fourth-generation cephalosporins, and\nthe recent semisynthetic vancomycin derivative telavancin. Another\nimportant group of peptide antibiotics are the cyclic lipopeptides,\nwhich have a cyclic peptide core carrying a fatty acid tail, exemplified\nby the cationic peptide colistin and the anionic peptide daptomycin.\nColistin was introduced more than 60 years ago for the treatment of\nGram-negative infections, but due to toxicity issues, its use decreased\nin the 1980s, and now it is used mainly as a last-resort antibiotic\nagainst multidrug-resistant infections. Daptomycin was approved by\nthe FDA in 2003, for treatment of, e.g., complicated skin and skin\nstructure infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Cationic peptides\ntypically exert their antibacterial activity by interaction with negatively\ncharged components of the bacterial membrane and disrupting its cohesion,\nand in the case of colistin, this includes specific interaction with\nbacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS).3,4 The mechanism\nof action of the anionic daptomycin involves calcium dependent oligomerization\nand membrane insertion, causing membrane leakage.5 Antibacterial peptides, produced by microorganisms, are\ncommonly produced by nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS). Nonribosomal\npeptides often contain nonproteinogenic amino acid residues, such\nas d-amino acids and a great variety of modified amino acid\nresidues. Examples of such modified residues are the oxidized and\nchlorinated tyrosine residues and cross-linked phenylglycin residues\nin vancomycin and the \u03b2-lactam-thiazolidine structure of penicillins,\nthat is formed by modification of an NRPS produced tripeptide precursor.", "Despite the impressive track record of antibiotics discovery in\nnature, it was out of fashion for a couple of decades to screen microorganisms\nfor the production of new antibiotics candidates, but in recent years,\nfungi and bacteria are again considered as promising sources for new\nchemical entities for development into antibiotic drugs.6,7 One major challenge when searching for new antibiotic compounds\nin microorganisms is to find novel drug-producing microbial strains\nto investigate. The recently described drug candidate teixobactin8 was discovered in a bacterial strain isolated\nusing methods targeting previously uncultured bacteria,9 which are estimated to be well over 90% of all\nbacterial species in environmental samples. This methodology is expected\nto open up an exciting untapped source of bacterial strains for the\nproduction of novel and interesting bacterial compounds. Another recent\napproach to obtain previously unexploited drug-producing microbial\nstrains is to use antibiotic resistance-based isolation of microorganisms.10 This technique is based on the inherent need\nfor antibiotic producing microorganisms to carry genes for \u201cself-resistance,\u201d\nwhich makes resistant microorganisms likely candidates to produce\nantibiotic compounds.", "The present paper describes the isolation\nand characterization\nof a family of antibacterial cyclic lipodepsipeptides, isopedopeptin\nA\u2013H (1\u20138) from the bacterium Pedobacter cryoconitis strain UP508, which was isolated\nfrom a soil sample using a resistance-based approach.

A similar spin-system, but extended by\na CH2 group, i.e., NH\u2013CH\u2013CH2\u2013CH2, suggested a 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid residue (DABA) to be\npresent in 1.

Subsequently,\nROESY experiments gave a cross-peak between this signal and the ABA\nolefinic signal (Figure 1A), which supported the assignment of the signal at \u03b4H 10.22 as the ABA amide proton, but also suggested the ABA residue\nto be in the E-configuration in 1.
