["In order to efficiently introduce DNA into B. subtilis ZK, which produces iturin A at a high level, we optimized seven electroporation conditions and explored an efficient electroporation method. Using the optimal conditions, the electroporation efficiency was improved to 1.03 \u00d7 107 transformants/\u03bcg of DNA, an approximately 10,000-fold increase in electroporation efficiency. This efficiency is the highest electroporation efficiency for B. subtilis and enables the construction of a directed evolution library or the knockout of a gene in B. subtilis ZK for molecular genetics studies. In the optimization process, the combined effects of three types of wall-weakening agents were evaluated using a response surface methodology (RSM) design, which led to a two orders of magnitude increase in electroporation efficiency. To the best of our limited knowledge, this study provides the first demonstration of using an RSM design for optimization of the electroporation conditions for B. subtilis. To validate the electroporation efficiency, a case study was performed and a gene (rapC) was inactivated in B. subtilis ZK using a suicide plasmid pMUTIN4. Moreover, we found that the rapC mutants exhibited a marked decrease in iturin A production, suggesting that the rapC gene was closely related to the iturin A production.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "B. subtilis, a type of Gram-positive bacterium, has been used as a cell factory for many enzymes, including proteases, amylases, and lipases [1,2,3]. Some subspecies produce antifungal lipopeptides (surfactin, iturin, and fengycin) that are widely applied for the control of plant pathogenic fungi in agriculture. B. subtilis ZK, a wild-type B. subtilis with high economic value, has been a workhorse for producing iturin A at a high level [4]. In order to study the high yield mechanism and further improve the iturin A production, it is desirable to perform molecular genetics studies in B. subtilis ZK. However, the fact that the genetic manipulation systems of B. subtilis ZK, such as the transformation system, gene deletion and mutation library, have not been established retards molecular genetic studies of this organism.

The first two methods are important methods for introducing DNA into Bacillus [10]. Unfortunately, these two methods have not been wildly used mainly due to heavy workload and time-consuming experimental processes [11]. Natural transformation and recombinant methods are usually used for introducing DNA into B. subtilis and lead to high transformation efficiency for some B. subtilis [7,8]. However, the transformation efficiency of these two methods is closely related to some genes, such as quorum sensing components, and competence master regulator comK. The divergent structures of those genes lead to a huge difference in the transformation efficiency [12,13]. Hence, the natural transformation and recombinant method are strain-specific. In contrast to other methods, electroporation is a common, time-saving transformation method and has been widely used for Bacillus [9,10,11,14,15]. Although the electroporation system for B. subtilis has been developed for many years, there is still no standard and universal protocol for all B. subtilis.

The four types of weakening agents all exhibited an enhancing effect on the electroporation efficiency.

Conclusions", "4. Conclusions", "In conclusion, a detailed and systematic protocol that results in improved electroporation efficiency for wild-type B. subtilis ZK is described in this manuscript. Using this new method, the electroporation efficiency for B. subtilis ZK is improved to 1 \u00d7 107 transformants/\u03bcg of DNA, which is highest level found for wild-type B. subtilis. This efficiency allows the construction of a directed evolution library and allows the knockout of a gene in wild-type B. subtilis ZK. We hope that the proposed protocol can facilitate the molecular genetics study in this economically important strain and may shed light on improvements in other wild-type B. subtlis strains. In order to validate the electroporation efficiency, a gene (rapC) was successfully inactivated using a suicide plasmid pMUTIN4 with the established electroporation method. Moreover, we found that the rapC mutants exhibited markedly decrease in iturin A production, suggesting that the rapC gene was involved in the regulation of iturin A production.", "In conclusion, a detailed and systematic protocol that results in improved electroporation efficiency for wild-type B. subtilis ZK is described in this manuscript.
