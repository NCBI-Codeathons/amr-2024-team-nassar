BRA-346 is an Actinobacteria isolated from the Brazilian endemic tunicate Euherdmania sp. We have reported that this strain produces epoxyketone peptides, as dihydroeponemycin (DHE) and structurally related analogs. This cocktail of epoxyketone peptides inhibits the proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity and shows high cytotoxicity to glioma cells. However, low yields and poor reproducibility of epoxyketone peptides production by BRA-346 under laboratory cultivation have limited the isolation of epoxyketone peptides for additional studies. Here, we evaluated several cultivation methods using different culture media and chemical elicitors to increase the repertoire of peptide epoxyketone production by this bacterium. Furthermore, BRA-346 genome was sequenced, revealing its broad genetic potential, which is mostly hidden under laboratory conditions. By using specific growth conditions, we were able to evidence different classes of secondary metabolites produced by BRA-346. In addition, by combining genome mining with untargeted metabolomics, we could link the metabolites produced by BRA-346 to its genetic capacity and potential regulators. A single biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was related to the production of the target epoxyketone peptides by BRA-346. The candidate BGC displays conserved biosynthetic enzymes with the reported eponemycin (EPN) and TMC-86A (TMC) BGCs. The core of the putative epoxyketone peptide BGC (ORFs A-L), in which ORF A is a LuxR-like transcription factor, was cloned into a heterologous host. The recombinant organism was capable to produce TMC and EPN natural products, along with the biosynthetic intermediates DH-TMC and DHE, and additional congeners. A phylogenetic analysis of the epn/tmc BGC revealed related BGCs in public databases. Most of them carry a proteasome beta-subunit, however, lacking an assigned specialized metabolite. The retrieved BGCs also display a diversity of regulatory genes and TTA codons, indicating tight regulation of this BGC at the transcription and translational levels. These results demonstrate the plasticity of the epn/tmc BGC of BRA-346 in producing epoxyketone peptides and the feasibility of their production in a heterologous host. This work also highlights the capacity of BRA-346 to tightly regulate its secondary metabolism and shed light on how to awake silent gene clusters of Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 to allow the production of pharmacologically important biosynthetic products.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Marine Streptomyces sp.

Both DHE and an epoxyketone-containing enriched fraction were evaluated by Furtado et al.

The enriched fraction inhibited the proteasome ChTL activity with IC50 of 45\u2009ng/ml (Furtado et al., 2021). Additional studies showed that the epoxyketone-containing fraction (at GI50 levels) led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and upregulation of genes related to ER-stress response, correlating to the observed proteasome inhibition. DHE alone induced similar effects in treated cells, but at concentrations 25 times its GI50, suggesting that the other epoxyketone compounds contained in Streptomyces sp.

It is estimated that less than 10% of the bacterial genome capacity is expressed under laboratory conditions (Rutledge and Challis, 2015; Liu et al., 2021). This is due to BGC expression regulation by specific BGC regulators (Fuqua et al., 1994; Santos et al., 2012; Rajput and Kumar, 2017) and also by broader epigenetic modulation (Trivella and de Felicio, 2018; Tomm et al., 2019).

In addition, genome mining and BGC cloning have provided alternative approaches for controlling and overproduction of bacterial secondary metabolites under laboratory conditions (Rigali et al., 2018; Mukherji et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021), for example, by deletion of the negative regulators from the cloned BGC (Yamanaka et al., 2014).", "Compound production by bacteria can be tightly regulated.

The production of the different classes of secondary metabolites by BRA-346 was modulated under laboratory conditions, being influenced by chemical elicitors in A1 medium cultures (ampicillin and procaine\u2014e.g., group 1 vs. group 2) and different culture media (salt concentration and carbohydrate sources\u2014e.g., group 1 vs. group 3).

The production of the different classes of secondary metabolites by BRA-346 was modulated under laboratory conditions, being influenced by chemical elicitors in A1 medium cultures (ampicillin and procaine\u2014e.g., group 1 vs. group 2) and different culture media (salt concentration and carbohydrate sources\u2014e.g., group 1 vs. group 3). By cloning the epn/tmc BGC of BRA-346 into a host organism, originally uncapable of producing epoxyketone peptides, free of competing BGCs for biosynthetic precursors, reduced quorum sensing crosstalk and using a strong promoter in the epn/tmc cloning cassette, it was possible to produce the pharmacologically important eponemycin and TMC-86A in high yields. Heterologous expression of the single epoxyketone peptide BGC of BRA-346, epn/tmc BGC, shows the plasticity of this BGC in producing both eponemycin and TMC-86A, and additional congeners. Importantly, the biosynthetic final products of the epn/tmc BGC were preferentially detected in the heterologous organism, further stressing that these BRA-346 BGC biosynthetic products are under tight regulatory control in the wild type organism. Phylogenetic analyses of the epn/tmc BGC give further insights on the preference for 2 or 4 biosynthesis and points some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of the epn/tmc BGC. A LuxR transcription factor containing a PAS-regulatory domain, aligned with the presence of TTA codons, are proposed as the main mechanisms of regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels. Heterologous expression of BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC with truncated versions of the Epn/TmcA LuxR/PAS transcription factor, as well eventual artificial control of its full-length LuxR transcription factor at the protein level, are alternatives for further improving biotechnological production of epoxyketone peptides encoded by the epn/tmc BGC.", "Data Availability Statement", "Data Availability Statement", "The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
