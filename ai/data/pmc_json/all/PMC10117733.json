["Abstract", "In the context of global warming, the melting of Arctic permafrost raises the threat of a reemergence of microorganisms some of which were shown to remain viable in ancient frozen soils for up to half a million years. In order to evaluate this risk, it is of interest to acquire a better knowledge of the composition of the microbial communities found in this understudied environment. Here, we present a metagenomic analysis of 12 soil samples from Russian Arctic and subarctic pristine areas: Chukotka, Yakutia and Kamchatka, including nine permafrost samples collected at various depths. These large datasets (9.2 \u00d7 1011 total bp) were assembled (525\u2009313 contigs >\u00a05 kb), their\u00a0encoded protein contents predicted, and then used to perform taxonomical assignments of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, as well as DNA viruses. The various samples exhibited variable DNA contents and highly diverse taxonomic profiles showing no obvious relationship with their locations, depths or deposit ages. Bacteria represented the largely dominant DNA fraction (95%) in all samples, followed by archaea (3.2%), surprisingly little eukaryotes (0.5%), and viruses (0.4%). Although no common taxonomic pattern was identified, the samples shared unexpected high frequencies of \u03b2-lactamase genes, almost 0.9 copy/bacterial genome. In addition to known environmental threats, the particularly intense warming of the Arctic might thus enhance the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistances, today's major challenge in public health. \u03b2-Lactamases were also observed at high frequency in other types of soils, suggesting their general role in the regulation of bacterial populations.", "Permafrost bacteria appear to constitute an enormous reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Two of the front-page societal concerns are global warming and the increasing frequency of emerging infectious diseases, eventually turning into pandemics (Morens et\u00a0al. 2020, Zhou et\u00a0al. 2020). It turns out that both predicaments are partly linked. Through its influence on the ecology of living organisms vectoring infectious pathogens, the warming climate contributes to spreading endemic diseases from tropical regions into temperate areas of the globe, such as Western Europe (Hertig 2019, Fuehrer et\u00a0al. 2020, Liu et\u00a0al. 2020). This phenomenon is further amplified by the encroachment into pristine areas (e.g. tropical forests) where expanding human activities generate new risks through imponderable contacts with (mostly uncharted) microbial environments and their associated wildlife hosts (Bradley and Altizer 2007, Keita et al. 2014, Plowright et\u00a0al. 2017, Valentine et al. 2019).", "Two of the front-page societal concerns are global warming and the increasing frequency of emerging infectious diseases, eventually turning into pandemics (Morens et\u00a0al. 2020, Zhou et\u00a0al. 2020).
