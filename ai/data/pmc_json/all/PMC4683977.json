As the quaternary and dihydro-benzo[c]phenanthridines can be transformed into one another, the dihydro-benzo[c]phenanthridines could be active compounds in vivo. The metabolism of C15 was examined in pig liver microsomes and cytosol by electrospray ionization hybrid ion trap/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and C7 was one of the main metabolites in liver microsomes and the only metabolite in cytosol [90]. Hence, the issue of whether the dihydro-benzo[c]phenanthridines were the main compounds combining with the targets in vivo requires further investigation.Fig.\u00a011The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "Fig.\u00a011The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "Fig.\u00a011The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "Fig.\u00a011The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "Fig.\u00a011The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "The hit number of the alkaloids to cancer related targets", "Among the 31 cancer-related targets, at least seven (including MIF, PPAR\u03b3*, CAMKII, and Pi3K\u03b3) were involved in the immune system.

The possible anti-HIV activity was notable, because HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and multidrug-resistant HIV-1 protease* were particularly related to AIDS [95\u201399]. Meanwhile, the anti-HIV activity was partly confirmed by HypoDB screening. The protein SARS-CoV M(pro) predicted by C3 and C5 was an attractive target for structure-based drug design of anti-SARS drugs owing to its indispensability for the maturation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [100]. Another target, HS5B Pol, fished by five alkaloids was a target for anti-HCV therapeutic advances [101]. Inhibitors of HS5B Pol would be a principal option for the treatment of HCV [102].
