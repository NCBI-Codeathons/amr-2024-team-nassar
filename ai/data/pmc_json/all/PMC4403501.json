The high abundance of fungal and bacterial species in these consortia results in specific communication between the microorganisms. A key role in this communication is played by secondary metabolites (SMs), which are also called natural products. Recently, it was shown that interspecies \u201ctalk\u201d between microorganisms represents a physiological trigger to activate silent gene clusters leading to the formation of novel SMs by the involved species. This review focuses on mixed microbial cultivation, mainly between bacteria and fungi, with a special emphasis on the induced formation of fungal SMs in co-cultures. In addition, the role of chromatin remodeling in the induction is examined, and methodical perspectives for the analysis of natural products are presented. As an example for an intermicrobial interaction elucidated at the molecular level, we discuss the specific interaction between the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus with the soil bacterium Streptomyces rapamycinicus, which provides an excellent model system to enlighten molecular concepts behind regulatory mechanisms and will pave the way to a novel avenue of drug discovery through targeted activation of silent SM gene clusters through co-cultivations of microorganisms.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Secondary metabolites (SMs) are low-molecular-mass organic compounds that, unlike primary metabolites, are not directly involved in growth, development or reproduction of the producing organism. Up until 2014 \u223c170,000 natural products have been characterized from both marine and terrestrial organisms (Seyedsayamdost and Clardy, 2014; Chapman and Hall, 2015). Microorganisms are able to synthesize a large number of SMs, but the exact number is not known. Furthermore, mining of microbial genomes revealed the presence of numerous SM gene clusters, displaying a discrepancy between the number of putative genes involved in secondary metabolism and the known SMs in a single microbe (Bergmann et al., 2007; Sanchez et al., 2012; Craney et al., 2013). For example, the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans is potentially able to produce 32 polyketides, 14 non-ribosomal peptides and two indole alkaloids (Brakhage et al., 2008; Rank et al., 2010), with little more than 50% of the produced SMs being identified. Furthermore, SMs can be found in diverse environments and even chemical biogeographic distribution maps for biomedically valuable families of natural products in the environment have been created (Charlop-Powers et al., 2014). A number of these compounds have important pharmacological applications and are used as antibiotics/antibacterial drugs (Brakhage, 2013). Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is spreading faster than the development of new antibiotics. As a consequence, there is the need for a constant provision of new compounds for the antibiotic development pipeline (Bbosa et al., 2014; Nathan and Cars, 2014). This is contrasted with a continuous rise in re-isolation of already known natural products (Strand et al., 2014). To manage this conflict, a more targeted natural product search is necessary. This effort directs SM research incrementally to a deeper understanding of the physiological relevance and ecological significance of SMs. It is generally accepted that in nature a substantial benefit to the SM producers must exist, simply arising from the fact that these very energy consuming biosynthetic pathways were maintained through evolution. An early postulated explanation for the role of SMs in nature was its function to defend the habitats of the producers by inhibiting the growth of its competitors (Davies, 1990; Brakhage et al., 2005; Gal\u00e1n et al., 2013). Another more recent hypothesis postulates an association between epibiotic predation and antibiotic production due to widespread predatory abilities in the genus Streptomyces (Kumbhar et al., 2014). At low, therefore non-inhibitory concentrations, such molecules are believed to function as signaling molecules (Aminov, 2009; Andersson and Hughes, 2014). This is supported by the assumption that over millions of years the evolution of SMs happened because microorganisms used them as chemical signals for communication between cells of the same species, different species (Figure 1) or between host cells, e.g., as endophytes in other microorganisms (Partida-Martinez and Hertweck, 2005) or plants (Brader et al., 2014).", "Secondary metabolites (SMs) are low-molecular-mass organic compounds that, unlike primary metabolites, are not directly involved in growth, development or reproduction of the producing organism.

Physical contact between these microorganisms can be assumed in various environments, such as soil, food or even patients (e.g., cystic fibrosis) where organisms can live in close contact and compete for different resources (Frey-Klett et al., 2011). Already in 2001, the production of pestalone, a potent antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, was obtained in the co-culture of a marine-derived gram-negative bacterium of the genus Thalassopia sp. (CNJ-328) and the marine fungus Pestalotia (Cueto et al., 2001). Although fungi-bacteria consortia exist in both terrestrial and marine environment, the majority (>90%) of the currently known microbial natural compounds are derived from terrestrial microorganisms (Subramani and Aalbersberg, 2012). Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus are reported to be the most commonly found bacteria in soil and the rhizosphere (Bouizgarne, 2011) and play the most important role as fungal partners. The gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis is one of the most frequently found microorganisms in the rhizosphere. It can also induce SM production in fungi, as proved by the formation of macrocarpon C, 2-(carboxymethylamino)benzoic acid and (\u2013)-citreoisocoumarinol in Fusarium tricinctum (Ola et al., 2013). Compared to the fungal monoculture, the production of lateropyrone, cyclic depsipeptides of the enniatin type, and fusaristatin A were up to 78-fold higher (Ola et al., 2013). Also marine-derived fungal-bacterial communities have been found to be a promising origin of novel SMs (Marmann et al., 2014). Oh et al.

Both metabolites showed a slightly increased activity against MRSA. Emericella is the teleomorph (sexual form) of many Aspergillus spp. (Geiser, 2009).

(2007a). Together with its symbiont the fungus is an important plant pathogen causing rice seedling blight. For more than two decades, it was thought that the fungus produces the causal agent for the plant disease. As shown, the endosymbiont is the actual producer of the phytotoxin, rhizoxin, that binds to the \u03b2-tubulin of the rice plant cells and causes mitotic arrest (Partida-Martinez and Hertweck, 2005, 2007; Partida-Martinez et al., 2007b). This, in turn induces the typical symptoms of swelling of the seedling tips and finally resulting in the death of the plants\u2019 offspring (Scherlach et al., 2006). Additionally, it has also been shown that the endobacterium is obligatory for sporulation of its host fungus (Partida-Martinez et al., 2007b).

One induced cryptic PKS gene encodes the long sought-after orsellinic acid synthase, thus the corresponding cluster was named the ors gene cluster. In addition to this archetypal polyketide orsellinic acid, three derivatives (lecanoric acid and two cathepsin K inhibitors F-9775A and F-9775B) were produced by A. nidulans. Lecanoric acid is a typical lichen metabolite that is usually found in a fungal/bacterial mutualism (Stocker-Worgotter, 2008), and thus likely plays a role in microbial communication. Indeed, the inducing bacterium was not affected by lecanoric acid. As mentioned above, a physical contact between both partners is needed for the activation of this silent gene cluster (Scherlach and Hertweck, 2009; Schroeckh et al., 2009). It is conceivable that a symbiotic relation between the fungus and the bacterium exists to defend against other microorganisms. One explanation on how the bacterium can trigger SM formation in Aspergillus would have been that rapamycin produced by the streptomycete could activate the cluster, either via the inhibition of the TOR pathway (Fitzgibbon et al., 2005) or due to its more general antifungal activity. Alternatively, another bacterial metabolite, the fungistatic antibiotic trichostatin A (TSA), which is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus could be responsible via its respective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting activity (Tsuji et al., 1976; Kouraklis and Theocharis, 2002). However, neither the addition of rapamycin nor TSA led to the activation of the ors gene cluster, therefore making both compounds unlikely to play a role in the interaction. When S. rapamycinicus was co-cultivated with A. fumigatus, this fungus also displayed an altered SM profile showing a group of similar new SMs (K\u00f6nig et al., 2013). In a microarray approach, a SM gene cluster was identified that was up-regulated only in the co-culture. Deletion of the PKS of the identified cluster, correlated with the lack of the corresponding natural products. Two metabolites of this group were isolated and named fumicycline A and B and the corresponding PKS was designated as FccA. It was shown that again a direct physical contact was necessary to induce the fcc gene cluster. An ortholog of the fcc gene cluster was identified in Neosartorya fischeri (Chooi et al., 2013). Overexpression of the transcription factor gene of the cluster led to the production of neosartoricins.

Supplementation of the co-culture with a TSA-like HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and with the histone acetylase (HAT) inhibitor anacardic acid led to the activation and inhibition of the transcription of the ors gene cluster, respectively. These findings indicated that chromatin remodeling can play an essential role in the regulation of SM clusters and that the targeted activation or inactivation of the respective chromatin modifiers can alter the SM production of the fungus. N\u00fctzmann et al. (2011) demonstrated that acetylation plays an essential role for mediating the interaction. Therefore, a comprehensive deletion library of all putative HATs in A. nidulans was generated and systematically screened for the ability of mutants to activate the ors gene cluster during co-incubation with S. rapamycinicus (N\u00fctzmann et al., 2011). Thereby, the HAT GcnE was identified as being essential for the cluster induction. This HAT is the catalytic subunit of the Saga/Ada complex (see Figure 2), a conserved multi-subunit complex also found in other eukaryotic organisms (Baker and Grant, 2007; Govind et al., 2007). Furthermore, it was shown that the acetylation of histone H3 lysines 9 and 14 is needed for the onset of the ors gene cluster transcription and product formation (N\u00fctzmann et al., 2013). However, SAGA not only seemed to play a role during the interaction with S. rapamycinicus, but also for the regulation of other well-known natural products such as penicillin, sterigmatocystin and terrequinone A in A. nidulans (N\u00fctzmann et al., 2011, 2013). Due to the intimate contact of S. rapamycinicus with A. nidulans the question arose whether there is a common mechanism by which the bacterium might interact with other members of the Aspergillus family, e.g., with A. fumigatus. It is possible to postulate different ways that can lead to the activation of such clusters in the fungus. As shown in Figure 2, an unknown, possibly membrane-bound compound or a protein can modulate the Saga/Ada complex directly (Figures 2a,b). Alternatively, the signal could be induced either by the physical contact between the two organisms (Figure 2c), or by a protein or compound secreted by the bacterium, and specifically sensed by receptors of A. nidulans (Figure 2d). These components need to be specific for S. rapamycinicus and must not be found in other actinomycetes. Convincible is also that the recognition of a fungal surface protein by the streptomycete, could directly lead to the activation of a signaling cascade triggering the SAGA complex (Figure 2e). In the interaction of A. nidulans with S. rapamycinicus the ors gene cluster regulation relies largely on the activity of GcnE and its acetylation activity of lysine 9 and 14 at histone H3. This in turn is induced upon physical contact with the bacterium leaving room for speculation on the key influence of the streptomycete on the fungus. Regarding the signaling pathway behind this interaction, it is known that LaeA as a global SM regulator has no influence on GcnE and therefore on histone H3 acetylation (N\u00fctzmann et al., 2011).

Thus, different toxins secreted by bacteria appear to manipulate and control chromatin remodeling and thereby transcription of targeted genes of eukaryotic hosts.", "The so-called erasers of acetylation are the HDACs that fulfill the opposing reaction of the HATs by removing the acetyl group from lysine residues of the histone proteins. HdaA, a class II HDAC, was one of the first discovered to play a role in SM cluster regulation. The deletion of hdaA in A. nidulans not only led to reduced growth of the fungus during oxidative stress, but also resulted in a higher production of SMs such as penicillin, sterigmatocystin, and terrequinone A (Tribus et al., 2005; Shwab et al., 2007). Consistently, HdaA had a significant impact on SM produced in A. fumigatus, such as fumitremorgin B, pseurotin, and gliotoxin. Interestingly, however, was the finding that gliotoxin production was down-regulated upon deletion of hdaA in A. fumigatus (Shwab et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009). Garcia-Garcia et al. (2009) were able to connect the activity of the human HDAC1 with the infection process of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in THP-1 cells (granulocyte model). Hereafter, the infection process led to an increased activation of HDAC1 leading to a reduced histone H3 acetylation and to the silencing of host defense genes. In accordance, the inhibition of HDAC1 by siRNA led to a significant drop of the bacterial load. This shows that the epigenetic control of the host cell by the bacterium promotes the disease by increased survival of the pathogen (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2009).", "The so-called erasers of acetylation are the HDACs that fulfill the opposing reaction of the HATs by removing the acetyl group from lysine residues of the histone proteins.

Methylation of lysine is regarded as one of the most complex modifications found so far with diverse impacts on gene transcription depending on its conformation (Rolando et al., 2013). Reyes-Dominguez et al. (2010) showed that upon growth arrest the methylation of lysine 9 was subsequently reduced, but affected only genes located inside the sterigmatocystin cluster, leading to its activation. Furthermore, H3 K9 methylation marks were associated with heterochromatin protein A (HepA), a protein responsible for heterochromatin formation. Consistently, the deletion of HepA led to the activation of the stc gene cluster (Reyes-Dominguez et al., 2010; Brakhage, 2013). However, the combination of both the hepA and the laeA deletions reduced the sterigmatocystin production to wild-type levels (Shaaban et al., 2010). The global SM regulator LaeA was indirectly found to be involved in histone methylation by influencing the methylation of H3 K9 and the occupancy of the respective locus by HepA. The deletion of this gene was also found to constrain the expression of the prominent natural product gene clusters penicillin, sterigmatocystin and the cholesterol lowering agent lovastatin (Bok and Keller, 2004; Reyes-Dominguez et al., 2010). In another study, the heterochromatin protein, HP1 of the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, could be implicated in the pathogenicity process responsible for plant infection. The fungus harbors effector genes with low expression during axenic cultivation, while being highly transcribed upon co-cultivation with plants. In an infection model with Brassica napus the effect of histone H3K9me3 on the respective effector genes was investigated. HP1 as well as the DNA-methylase DIM-5 were silenced by RNAi and analyzed concerning the transcription level of the effector genes in axenic cultures. Interestingly, the effector genes were actively transcribed in the mutant strains outside of the co-cultivation leading to the conclusion that HP1 as well as DIM-5 must be somehow involved in the repression of the effector genes during the non-infective life cycle (Soyer et al., 2014). Additionally, in a symbiotic interaction of the endophyte Epichlo\u00eb festucae and Lolium perenne, the fungus produced ergot alkaloids and lolitrems when cohabitating with a plant. Production of these bioprotective substances was repressed during axenic cultures. Comparing levels of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 between co-cultivation and non-symbiotic cultivation of the fungus, the methylation marks were reduced upon growth in the plant. Furthermore, the deletion of the responsible methyltransferases ClrD and EzhB resulted in an activation of the alkaloid and lolitrem gene clusters also in the axenic cultures of the fungus (Chujo and Scott, 2014).", "Besides the widely studied acetylation of histones, there is a multitude of other chromatin modifications which have been found to regulate expression of SM gene clusters (Strahl and Allis, 2000).

The deletion of the respective genetic locus in A. nidulans not only led to the production of F-9775A and F-9775B, which are also produced upon contact with the bacterium S. rapamycinicus, but led also to the activation of a novel monodictyphenon gene cluster. Another very interesting study was published by Rolando et al. (2013). They showed that pathogens can also introduce, so far, unknown modifications on host nucleosomes and thereby influence gene expression. In their study they elegantly revealed that Legionella pneumophila is able to tri-methylate lysine 14 on histone H3 of its host by a factor called RomA. This protein is a SET-domain containing methyltransferase which is secreted by Legionella during the infection process. Genome-wide ChIP analysis showed that approximately 4870 promoters were target of this modification by RomA (Rolando et al., 2013). The cause for this drastic modulation of the host genome by Legionella is not fully understood yet. One possible explanation might be that the switch to a methylated histone leads to down-regulation of the target genes due to a mutual exclusion of the acetylated lysine 14, which was found to coincide with actively transcribed genes (Cheung et al., 2000).", "Methylation of lysines 4 at histone H3 by CclA was found to be important for SM biosynthesis as well as for conidiation in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus (Palmer et al., 2008, 2013; Bok et al., 2009).

Bacterial toxins were shown to be useful tools during the infection process by reducing levels of acetylation and phosphorylation of histones and thereby influencing the expression of their target genes. Often, chromatin modifying complexes are mediators of those interactions, specifically targeting host defense genes and modulating their expression. Interestingly, this is not only achieved by host derived remodelers but also by proteins introduced by the interaction partner itself, which in turn can lead to unknown modification on the host genome.
