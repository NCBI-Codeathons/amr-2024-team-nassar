["Biofilms are mono- or multispecies microbial communities enclosed in an extracellular matrix (EPS). They have high potential for dissemination and are difficult to remove. In addition, biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant strains (MDRs) are even more aggravated if we consider antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as an important public health issue. Quorum sensing (QS) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are mechanisms that significantly contribute to the recalcitrance (resistance and tolerance) of biofilms, making them more robust and resistant to conventional sanitation methods. These mechanisms coordinate different strategies involved in AMR, such as activation of a quiescent state of the cells, moderate increase in the expression of the efflux pump, decrease in the membrane potential, antimicrobial inactivation, and modification of the antimicrobial target and the architecture of the EPS matrix itself. There are few studies investigating the impact of the use of inhibitors on the mechanisms of recalcitrance and its impact on the microbiome. Therefore, more studies to elucidate the effect and applications of these methods in the food production chain and the possible combination with antimicrobials to establish new strategies to control MDR biofilms are needed.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered one of the 10 main threats to public health that humanity currently faces [1,2]. A microorganism that is resistant to at least one agent of three or more classes of antimicrobials is defined as multidrug-resistant (MDR) [3]. MDR pathogens cause infections refractory to antimicrobials, which limit the therapeutic options, and consequently result in worsening of the clinical condition of the patient, prolonged hospital stays with intensive care, and a high fatality rate [2,4]. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR) has caused a global alert [4,5]. It is estimated that approximately 700,000 deaths from infections per year are caused by antibiotic-resistant strains, with an expected increase to 10 million in 2050 [6].", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered one of the 10 main threats to public health that humanity currently faces [1,2].

The adsorption sites in the EPS matrix act as adhesion points for exoenzymes, a factor that limits the transport of bactericidal agents and reduces their effectiveness by degrading metabolites [34,53]. In addition, the EPS matrix forms layers in the biofilm [54] that promote poor penetration of antimicrobials through the diffusion barrier, thus leading to entrapment, lower efficiency, or even inactivation of these agents [34,45]. The interference in the diffusion of the antimicrobials by the biofilms results in sublethal concentrations, which promotes microbial selection and the development of resistance.

QS is dependent on population density and is based on communication through autoinducers, signaling molecules that are recognized by cell surface receptors or in the cytoplasm.

Further, QS is an intrinsic resistance mechanism, but it also seems to exert an influence on adaptive resistance. Such thinking occurs because this mechanism allows transient adaptive changes in the expression of biofilm genes; however, this phenomenon can only occur through the previous existence of such genes [67]. Some studies found genes related to biofilm formation in MDR S. aureus (icaA icaB icaD and icaC), MDR Salmonella (adrA, bapA, csgB, csgD, fimA, fimH) and MDR Listeria (flaA and luxS) and observed strong biofilm production [13,71,72]. During exposure to stressors, QS promotes the overexpression of resistance genes, regulates the production of proteins involved in the permeability of the outer membrane, and increases the formation of micro-colonies, favoring biofilm formation and increasing sanitizer resistance [70,73]. Mutants with QS deficiency seem to produce less structured biofilms and are apparently more susceptible to antimicrobials since their structure is affected by this mechanism [11,34,45,72]. Furthermore, QS is directly linked to the regulation process of drug efflux pumps and modification of antimicrobial targets, important strategies of AMR [73,74,75]. These strategies have been previously associated with increased resistance to sanitizers and antibiotics [67]. In a recent study, the authors investigated the relationship between QS and MDR pathogens and suggested that biofilm formation by MDR bacteria provided greater antimicrobial resistance [76]. In addition, studies have tried to establish an association between AMR and increased biofilm formation [37,39]. The defense strategies coordinated by QS make the MDR biofilm a unique system with great resilience and a high potential for dissemination [77].", "Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication system that mediates chemical signals allowing cooperative expression of genes. These genes are responsible for several physiological mechanisms, such as biofilm formation, sporulation, conjugation, motility, regulation of bacterial luminescence, and virulence factors, such as toxins, proteases, and adhesins [67,68]. QS is dependent on population density and is based on communication through autoinducers, signaling molecules that are recognized by cell surface receptors or in the cytoplasm. As they are produced, these molecules accumulate in the biofilm environment [7,69]. After recognition of the receptor, there is transcription involving genes that code for surface proteins, virulence factors, transcription factors, and proteins involved in biofilm development [70]. The autoinducers used by Gram-positive bacteria are peptides (AIPs), and those used by Gram-negative bacteria are acylated homoserin lactones (AHLs). For intra- and interspecies communication, autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is used in both Gram-positives and Gram-negatives [11,69]. QS positively influences recalcitrance (tolerance and AMR) [11]. However, most authors indicate a direct relationship and more significant action on AMR. Further, QS is an intrinsic resistance mechanism, but it also seems to exert an influence on adaptive resistance.

Modification of Antimicrobial Targets", "Some classes of antimicrobial agents use cellular components as targets. One of the strategies used by MDR bacteria is the modification of these components [97]. Modification of the target occurs through changes in the structure or the number of transpeptidases (PBPs) involved in the construction of the cell wall peptidoglycans. The increase in the number of PBPs leads to a decrease in the binding capacity of the antimicrobial and, consequently, to a reduction in the action of or resistance to this agent [77]. The acquisition of mecA genes in S. aureus, for example, promotes changes in the structure of PBPs and reduces the capacity of the antimicrobial agent [91]. The acquisition of van genes through HGT also confers resistance to vancomycin, as it results in changes in the structure of peptidoglycan precursors and reduces their binding capacity [1]. Among the most widely used antimicrobial agents in both animal and human therapy are \u03b2-lactams. Resistance to these agents may occur by interrupting the interaction between the target transpeptidases (PBPs) and the agent, among others [98].

(A) Mature biofilm. (B) Mechanisms of tolerance: the extracellular matrix interferes in the permeation of the antimicrobial by the biofilm which cause microbial selection and development of resistance. These mechanisms lead to the activation of a quiescent state, a moderate increase in the expression of the efflux pump, and a decrease in membrane potential. Resistant bacterial cells (purple), sensitive bacterial cells (green). (C) Mechanisms of resistance. (I) Reduction in intracellular accumulation: bacteria reduce the antimicrobial content by decreasing membrane permeability and/or moderate increase in efflux pumps expression. (II) Modification of antimicrobial targets: the target alterations occur through changes in the structure or the number of transpeptidases involved in the construction of cell wall peptidoglycans. (III) Antibiotic degradation: resistance occurs by transferring chemical groups to the antimicrobial or by complete degradation of the antimicrobial.
