["The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance presents serious health challenges to the management of infectious diseases, a problem that is further exacerbated by slowing rates of antimicrobial drug discovery in recent years. The phenomenon of collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug is accompanied by increased sensitivity to another, provides new opportunities to address both these challenges. Here, we present a high-throughput screening platform termed Collateral Sensitivity Profiling (CSP) to map the difference in bioactivity of large chemical libraries across 29 drug-resistant strains of E. coli. CSP screening of 80 commercial antimicrobials demonstrated multiple CS interactions. Further screening of a 6195-member natural product library revealed extensive CS relationships in nature. In particular, we report the isolation of known and new analogues of borrelidin A with potent CS activities against cephalosporin-resistant strains. Co-dosing ceftazidime with borrelidin A slows broader cephalosporin resistance with no recognizable resistance to borrelidin A itself.", "Collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug is accompanied by increased sensitivity to another, provides new opportunities for antimicrobial drug discovery. Here, Liu et al. screen large chemical libraries across 29 drug-resistant E. coli strains to identify multiple CS interactions, including natural products with potent CS activities against cephalosporin-resistant strains.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The rise of antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR) worldwide represents one of the most pressing contemporary threats to human health1,2. In the most comprehensive study to date, Murray et al. reported an estimated 4.95 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR globally in 2019 alone3. Chief among the list of AMR culprits are pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, including third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, which in total account for more than 800,000 associated deaths3. AMR is challenging to address because resistance is an inherent consequence of antimicrobial drug use; even a single long-term infection may result in the emergence of drug resistance4. The ubiquitous and non-compliant overuse of antimicrobials in both clinical and agricultural settings contribute to large scale resistance evolution2. Despite recent attention to AMR, the incidence of multidrug resistant (MDR) infections continues to rise5 and resistance to newer drugs is often observed within a few years of deployment6.

Each antimicrobial was serially diluted (16 two-fold dilutions from 128\u2009\u03bcM to ~4\u2009nM) and screened in biological triplicate against the full target panel plus WT (average Z\u2019-factor\u2009=\u20090.71, Supplementary Table\u00a03).

In total, 34 out of 80 antimicrobial compounds induced at least a 2-fold increase in resistance to one or more drug-resistant strains, with the largest difference corresponding to an upwards 256-fold shift in the MIC. As anticipated, resistance and CR among mutant strains were observed for their original selection antibiotic and same-class analogues, respectively. Both chromosomal and plasmid-borne MDR strains exhibited widespread CR patterns across the entire antimicrobial set, notably against \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, rifamycins, and tetracyclines. Conversely, 43 antimicrobial compounds presented a minimum of 2-fold increase in CS activity to one or more strains; the largest being a downwards 32-fold shift in the MIC. CS activity was generally congruent among same-class analogues. The cephalosporin-resistant cell wall biosynthesis mutants, Cef6 and Cef7, displayed increased sensitivity towards a broad range of antimicrobials, including select fluoroquinolones, rifamycins, select aminoglycosides, macrolides, amphenicols, anthracyclines, and lipopeptides. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have identified a correlation between the frequency of CS interactions and cell wall mutations11.

Several studies from the existing literature help to contextualize this finding. First, knockouts of genes responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u00a0biosynthesis (rfa) in E. coli have been shown to increase resistance against \u03b2-lactams, including cephalosporin compounds38\u201340. These mutants produce a variably truncated LPS core that discourages trimerization of outer membrane porins, which themselves facilitate the entry of small polar drugs. Recently, Wang et al. reported that truncated LPS mutants exhibit decreased transcription and expression of porins OmpF and OmpC, but increased transcription of the \u03b2-lactam resistance gene blr39. Second, both laboratory and clinical isolates of \u03b2-lactam-resistant E. coli have been found to contain mutations in thrS41, the known target of the borrelidins. Studies have shown that inactivation of ThrRS results in a stringent response that reduces bacterial growth rate, which contributes to the observed resistance phenotype41,42. In this study, we show that 1 is a concentration-dependent inhibitor of ThrRS that preferentially kills cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (with deleterious mutations in rfa genes) as well as a MDR strain carrying the RK2 plasmid from clinical isolates of K. aerogenes19 (Fig.\u00a04). We furthermore demonstrate that this CS activity cannot be replicated by combination therapy between 1 and ceftazidime in the WT, and is therefore solely the result of the resistance mutations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Several studies have found that rfa mutants exhibit increased sensitivities to large, nonpolar antibiotics due to truncated LPS and thus a weaker protective barrier38; a finding corroborated in our own antimicrobial screen (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01).

The major component, possessing a m/z of 512.2981 [M\u2009+\u2009Na]+ was purified by HPLC to yield 9.82\u2009mg of a white amorphous powder. Extensive 1D and 2D NMR analyses (Bruker Avance III 600\u2009MHz with 5\u2009mm QCI cryoprobe running Topspin; data processing performed with MNova) identified this compound as the known macrolide borrelidin A (1; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07\u20139). Eleven other borrelidin analogs produced by RL09-056-NTSA were isolated across the A, B, C, and D prefractions at microgram quantities and assayed against select mutant strains. While 1 presented the strongest MIC shift, three additional analogs also presented recognizable CS activities. Two analogs shared identical masses to borrelidin A but eluted later at 11.1 and 12.3\u2009min, respectively.

The fourth bioactive analog eluted earlier than 1 at 10.2\u2009min and possessed a formula that did not correspond to any known borrelidin derivatives43,51\u201354. Consequently, this new molecule was named borrelidin P (4). Interpretation of HRMS and NMR data (Supplementary Fig.\u00a020\u201330) suggested the presence of a primary amide for 4 in place of the nitrile functional group in 1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a031). An identical 2D structure had recently been reported as a semisynthetic derivative of 1 by Hu et al.55. However, comparison of the NMR data between 4 and the semisynthetic derivative suggested that the new compound possessed a different configuration to 1 at one or more positions. To verify this result, we replicated the semisynthetic transformation of 1 reported by Hu et al., which yielded 12-desnitrile-12-carbamoyl-borrelidin A (5; Supplementary Fig.\u00a032\u201333). The NMR spectra of 5 mirrored that of the published semisynthetic derivative and was different from the natural product. Detailed interpretation of the 2D NOESY spectrum for 4 and comparisons against both 1 and 5 revealed an alternative 12-(Z)\u221214-(E) geometry in the diene region of the natural product (as opposed to a 12-(E)-14-(E) arrangement for 5), completing the planar structure determination for this new metabolite. To assign the absolute configuration of 4, the natural product was derivatized via a series of reactions to facilitate the eventual conjugation of the modified Mosher\u2019s ester on secondary alcohols.

Four concentrations were tested for each treatment, increasing two-fold from the starting concentration (i.e., treatment A: 0.063\u2009\u03bcM, 0.125\u2009\u03bcM, 0.25\u2009\u03bcM, and 0.5\u2009\u03bcM). Post-treatment and inoculation, plates were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 24\u2009h before an absorbance reading at OD600 is taken. The highest drug concentration resulting in at least 50% growth inhibition for each replicate was used to inoculate the subsequent day\u2019s treatment wells at a 1:100 ratio. Ceftazidime and norfloxacin drug concentration gradients were also modified in 2-fold steps as required to ensure that at least one concentration that produced 100% growth. Borrelidin A treatments were maintained at fixed concentrations. Resistance monitoring/sequential passaging was repeated daily for 12 consecutive days, the maximum length of time achievable given the high rate of consumption of a limited NP compound. The difference between day 1 and day 12 MIC values for each passaging condition was analyzed by a one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s HSD test. At the conclusion of the experiment, the most resistant samples from each replicate were archived as glycerol stocks at \u221270\u2009\u00b0C. To determine the MIC for each resistant strain under standard conditions, glycerol stocks were thawed and used to inoculate overnight cultures. Ceftazidime, cefadroxil, cefaclor, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and borrelidin A were prepared as 1:1 dilution series (128\u2009\u03bcM to ~3.9\u2009nM) in DMSO and reformatted into a 384-well plate.
