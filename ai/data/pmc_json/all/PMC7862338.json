Complex DNA damage (CDD) has a complex character/structure as compared to singular lesions like randomly distributed abasic sites, deaminated, alkylated, and oxidized DNA bases. CDD is thought to be critical since they are more challenging to repair than singular lesions. Although CDD naturally constitutes a relatively minor fraction of the overall DNA damage induced by free radicals, DNA cross-linking agents, and ionizing radiation, if left unrepaired, these lesions cause a number of serious consequences, such as gross chromosomal rearrangements and genome instability. If not tightly controlled, the repair of ICLs and clustered bi-stranded oxidized bases via DNA excision repair will either inhibit initial steps of repair or produce persistent chromosomal breaks and consequently be lethal for the cells. Biochemical and genetic evidences indicate that the removal of CDD requires concurrent involvement of a number of distinct DNA repair pathways including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated DNA strand break repair, base excision repair (BER), nucleotide incision repair (NIR), global genome and transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER and TC-NER, respectively), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathways. In this review, we describe the role of DNA glycosylase-mediated BER pathway in the removal of complex DNA lesions.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Endogenous oxidative stress and environmental factors induce multiple damage in cellular DNA, among them bulky DNA adducts, interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs), and clustered DNA lesions (including double-strand breaks, DSBs), which are distinguished from singular lesions by their complex characters and structures (Deans and West, 2011; Yang et al., 2017; Mullins et al., 2019; Nickoloff et al., 2020) (Figures 1A,B). Complex DNA damage (CDD) is characterized by two important features: bulky character and the presence of more than one modification of one turn of the DNA helix. Although in general CDD constitutes a relatively minor share of the total DNA damage induced by chemo- and radiotherapy in treated cancer cells, they present daunting obstacles to DNA template scanning processes and if not repaired lead to cell death and gross chromosomal rearrangements. Among complex DNA lesions, ICLs are one of the most cytotoxic and difficult to repair, because they prevent DNA strand separation during DNA replication and transcription. To get insight into the biological roles of CDDs, it is important to comprehend the nature and mechanisms of their formation which often proceeds via interactions of DNA with endogenous reactive metabolites and various exogenous factors. Studies of the cellular defense mechanisms counteracting genotoxic effects of CDD revealed that the removal of complex lesions requires several distinct DNA repair pathways including global genome and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER and TC-NER, respectively), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated DNA strand break repair, base excision repair (BER), nucleotide incision repair (NIR), mismatch repair (MMR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathways. In this review, we attempt to enlighten the structural properties, mechanisms of formation of CDD, and role of recently discovered alternative DNA repair mechanisms. Due to the space constraints, the formation and repair of clustered DNA lesions will not be discussed in this review instead; we would recommend several excellent reviews on this topic (Cadet et al., 2012; Georgakilas et al., 2013; Sage and Shikazono, 2017; Mavragani et al., 2019).", "Endogenous oxidative stress and environmental factors induce multiple damage in cellular DNA, among them bulky DNA adducts, interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs), and clustered DNA lesions (including double-strand breaks, DSBs), which are distinguished from singular lesions by their complex characters and structures (Deans and West, 2011; Yang et al., 2017; Mullins et al., 2019; Nickoloff et al., 2020) (Figures 1A,B).

These nucleotide modifications can be referred to as a tandem lesion in which both sugar and base moieties have been damaged within distance of single nucleotides (Kuraoka et al., 2000; Merecz and Karwowski, 2016). The additional covalent bond in cPu hinders cleavage of the glycosidic bond by DNA glycosylases, making these lesions substrates for the NER pathway (Brooks et al., 2000; Kuraoka et al., 2000; Kropachev et al., 2014). It was demonstrated that Cockayne syndrome (CS) complementation group A (CSA) protein, a DNA excision repair protein involved in the TC-NER sub-pathway, is required for the removal of 5\u2032S-cdA adducts in DNA from primary skin cells (D'Errico et al., 2007). The GG-NER pathway can remove cdA adducts with a similar efficiency as that of UV-induced CPDs but displays higher activity in excising the R-diastereomers as compared to S conformations (Brooks et al., 2000; Kuraoka et al., 2000). Hence, high levels of 5\u2032S-cdA diastereomer in the nonexposed control group of mice compared to analogous 5\u2032R-cdA might be due to the more efficient removal of 5\u2032R-cdA by the GG-NER pathway (Wang et al., 2012; Chatgilialoglu et al., 2019).

In agreement with this, cdG and cdA adducts accumulate in DNA of keratinocytes from NER-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group C (XPC) and CSA patients exposed to X-rays and potassium bromate (KBrO3) (D'Errico et al., 2006, 2007), as well as in organs of CSB\u2212/\u2212 knockout mice (Wang et al., 2012; Chatgilialoglu et al., 2019).

Cytochromes P450 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 are responsible for the metabolic activation of PAHs by mono-oxygenation of hydrocarbons in cells to form epoxides (Luch et al., 1999; Straif et al., 2005; Sulc et al., 2016). Cellular metabolism of B[a]Ps produces a diol epoxide benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-oxide (BPDE), which can be hydrolyzed to BPDE tetrols and interact with guanines in DNA to form bulky B[a]P-N2-dG adducts and B[a]P-N6-dA adducts. B[a]Ps induces primarily guanine transversions (G\u2022C \u2192 T\u2022A).", "Bulky DNA adducts generated by environmental carcinogens cause mutations that often drive malignant transformation of affected cells.

The partial oxidation of ethanol in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase produces acetaldehyde, which is converted into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). Half of the population of Northeast Asian descent and about 5\u201310% of Northern European descent harbor a dominant mutation in the ALDH2 gene, which greatly reduces the enzyme activity and leads to acetaldehyde accumulation after alcohol consumption. Individuals with a mutant form of ALDH2 have a greater risk of liver damage and susceptibility to many types of cancer (Seitz and Meier, 2007). Acetaldehyde can generate ICL and protein-DNA cross-links. N2-Ethyl-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (N2-ethyl-dG) and 1, N2-propano-2'-deoxyguanosine (1, N2-PdG) are major DNA adducts caused by acetaldehydes. Several studies indicated that endogenous aldehydes are a significant source of genotoxicity in the human hematopoietic system and that the presence of the proficient Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is essential to protect cells from DNA damage induced by these reactive compounds. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a primary target for aldehyde-induced DNA damage, and FA-deficient patients suffer from bone marrow failure due to p53/p21-mediated cell death and senescence (Ceccaldi et al., 2012). In agreement with this model, it was shown that the HSCs in Aldh2\u2212/\u2212, Fancd2\u2212/\u2212 double KO mice accumulate more DNA damage than HSCs in either of the single knockout mice (Garaycoechea et al., 2012). Formaldehyde, another highly reactive compound, can be generated from abundant folic acid consumption but would be effectively handled by a two-tier protection glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH5)/FANCD2 mechanism; however, DNA damage may still happen and lead to cytotoxic effects. Individuals affected by FA lack the defense system against formaldehyde and might be prone to the toxic compound exposure from folate decomposition (Burgos-Barragan et al., 2017). On the other side, a new strategy based on the delivery of a formaldehyde in the form of folate derivatives along with ADH5 inhibition that could effectively kill breast cancer cells deficient for BRCA1 and BRCA2 has been recently proposed (Burgos-Barragan et al., 2017).", "Acetaldehydes, abundant organic compounds, are highly reactive due to the electrophilic nature of their carbonyl carbon, causing a variety of cellular and chromosomal aberrations in human cells.

Acetaldehyde can generate ICL and protein-DNA cross-links. N2-Ethyl-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (N2-ethyl-dG) and 1, N2-propano-2'-deoxyguanosine (1, N2-PdG) are major DNA adducts caused by acetaldehydes.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a primary target for aldehyde-induced DNA damage, and FA-deficient patients suffer from bone marrow failure due to p53/p21-mediated cell death and senescence (Ceccaldi et al., 2012). In agreement with this model, it was shown that the HSCs in Aldh2\u2212/\u2212, Fancd2\u2212/\u2212 double KO mice accumulate more DNA damage than HSCs in either of the single knockout mice (Garaycoechea et al., 2012). Formaldehyde, another highly reactive compound, can be generated from abundant folic acid consumption but would be effectively handled by a two-tier protection glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH5)/FANCD2 mechanism; however, DNA damage may still happen and lead to cytotoxic effects. Individuals affected by FA lack the defense system against formaldehyde and might be prone to the toxic compound exposure from folate decomposition (Burgos-Barragan et al., 2017).

Currently, specific inhibitors against BER proteins such as Pol\u03b2, PNKP, FEN1, Ligase III\u03b1, and PARP1/PARG have been developed either to sensitize several cancers or to form synthetic lethal partnerships with common cancer mutations (reviewed in Grundy and Parsons, 2020).", "The study of repair of trioxsalen (psoralen)-induced ICLs in living cells by McNeill et al.

In general, the active sites of DNA glycosylases are small to accommodate large bulky base modifications; nevertheless, some observations indicate that DNA glycosylases can recognize and remove bulky DNA adducts despite steric constraints to fit these base lesions into their active site pockets.

FA is a recessive cancer-prone syndrome which is characterized with bone marrow failure and hypersensitivity to ICLs and, to a milder extension, to ionizing radiation and oxidative stress (Mace et al., 2005). Several lines of evidence indicate that in vertebrates, repair of ICLs is coupled to DNA replication and coordinated by the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The stalled replication fork unhooks an ICL via dual incisions on both sides of the lesion by the scaffolding protein SLX4 and structure-specific endonuclease XPF/ERCC1, and this results in the generation of a double-strand break (DSB) (Hodskinson et al., 2014; Klein-Dowel et al., 2014). The unhooked ICL fragment swings free of the duplex exposing a single-stranded gap. Translesion synthesis (TLS)-specific DNA polymerases catalyze bypass of the gap and produce a three-stranded DNA repair intermediate that contains a short DNA fragment covalently attached to the duplex. It was proposed that this unhooked ICL fragment is removed in the classic NER pathway (Sancar et al., 2004; Cipak et al., 2006). However, work by Couve et al. (2009) revealed that the oxidative DNA glycosylase E. coli Nei and human NEIL1 excise with high efficiency the psoralen-induced bulky unhooked ICL oligomer within a three-stranded DNA structure. Three Nei-like (NEIL) DNA glycosylases are present in mammalian cells; these proteins show structural homology to the Fpg and Nei proteins of Escherichia coli and initiate the BER pathway to remove oxidized bases from DNA (Liu et al., 2013) (Figures 2B,C). Both NEIL1 and NEIL3 are cell cycle regulated with expression topping in the S phase and late S/G2, respectively, whereas NEIL2 is expressed throughout the cell cycle in a constitutive manner (Neurauter et al., 2012; Hegde et al., 2013). NEIL1 and NEIL2 contain a highly efficient \u03b2/\u03b4-lyase activity, whereas NEIL3 exhibit a very weak \u03b2 lyase function. All three mammalian Nei-like DNA glycosylases demonstrate an unusual preference for single-stranded DNA substrates and other open DNA conformations such as bubbles, loops, and recessed DNA duplexes generated during DNA replication and transcription. NEIL3 is perhaps the most intriguing of the three due, (i) to its large structure that includes an extended C-terminal domain containing additional zinc finger motifs, (ii) the replacement of the usual proline residue as the nucleophile with valine, and (iii) its restricted expression pattern in mammalian cells (Liu et al., 2013). The observation that Nei-like proteins from E. coli to human cells can excise bulky unhooked psoralen-induced ICLs via simple one-step hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond between cross-linked base and deoxyribose sugar provides an alternative heuristic solution for the removal of complex DNA lesions. Complete reconstitution of the repair of unhooked ICL demonstrated that this bulky adduct can be processed in a short-patch BER pathway (Figures 2B,C). Based on these data, a model for the mechanism of ICL repair in mammalian cells that implicates the DNA glycosylase activity of NEIL1 downstream of XPF/ERCC1 and TLS repair steps was proposed (Couve et al., 2009).", "Mutations in genes responsible for counteracting ICL-mediated genotoxic effects can lead to Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder. FA is a recessive cancer-prone syndrome which is characterized with bone marrow failure and hypersensitivity to ICLs and, to a milder extension, to ionizing radiation and oxidative stress (Mace et al., 2005). Several lines of evidence indicate that in vertebrates, repair of ICLs is coupled to DNA replication and coordinated by the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The stalled replication fork unhooks an ICL via dual incisions on both sides of the lesion by the scaffolding protein SLX4 and structure-specific endonuclease XPF/ERCC1, and this results in the generation of a double-strand break (DSB) (Hodskinson et al., 2014; Klein-Dowel et al., 2014). The unhooked ICL fragment swings free of the duplex exposing a single-stranded gap. Translesion synthesis (TLS)-specific DNA polymerases catalyze bypass of the gap and produce a three-stranded DNA repair intermediate that contains a short DNA fragment covalently attached to the duplex. It was proposed that this unhooked ICL fragment is removed in the classic NER pathway (Sancar et al., 2004; Cipak et al., 2006). However, work by Couve et al. (2009) revealed that the oxidative DNA glycosylase E. coli Nei and human NEIL1 excise with high efficiency the psoralen-induced bulky unhooked ICL oligomer within a three-stranded DNA structure. Three Nei-like (NEIL) DNA glycosylases are present in mammalian cells; these proteins show structural homology to the Fpg and Nei proteins of Escherichia coli and initiate the BER pathway to remove oxidized bases from DNA (Liu et al., 2013) (Figures 2B,C).

In vitro reconstitution of the ICL repair using plasmid DNA and cell-free extracts from Xenopus eggs revealed the DNA replication-coupled repair of ICL, which results in the formation of an X-shaped DNA structure due to convergence of two replication forks on the lesion (Raschle et al., 2008). Interestingly, when only one fork was stalled at the ICL in egg extracts, no ICL repair was observed suggesting that the convergence of two forks is required for the removal of the blocking lesion (Zhang et al., 2015). At the same time, using mammalian cells and DNA combing, Huang et al. (2013) investigated the collision of replication forks with fluorescently marked psoralen ICLs to visualize the process. The results showed that in the S phase the majority of psoralen-induced ICLs are bypassed through a replication-traverse pathway to resume DNA replication on the other side without removal of the blocking lesions. Thus, the dual-fork convergence and replication fork traverse, and an X-shaped DNA structure is produced around the ICL (Zhang and Walter, 2014). Noteworthily, these remaining ICLs are removed after DNA replication and no DSB formation is observed (Huang et al., 2013). Subsequently, Semlow et al. (2016) have shown that NEIL3 from Xenopus laevis can excise ICLs induced by psoralen and abasic site in X-shaped dsDNA structures through a DNA strand incision-independent repair mechanism, implying that this repair function may be one of the many roles of NEIL3 in highly proliferating cells. Following work by Martin et al. (2017) demonstrated that the purified human NEIL3 can cleave psoralen-induced ICL in single-stranded, three-stranded, and four-stranded DNA structures to produce long unhooked DNA oligomers containing either an AP site or a psoralen-thymine monoadduct. Furthermore, E. coli Nei and human NEIL1, similar to NEIL3, excise a psoralen-induced four-stranded DNA substrate to generate two unhooked DNA duplexes but with a nick. Noteworthily, the unusual DNA substrate specificities of these highly evolutionary conserved Nei-like enzymes imply the occurrence of very long three- and four-stranded cross-linked DNA\u2013DNA structures that may originate in vivo via completion of DNA replication and TLS bypass of an unhooked ICL. In this hypothetical model, Martin et al. proposed that FANCM catalyze replication fork traverse through an unhooked ICL, without incision-mediated unhooking; this may produce either three- or four-stranded DNA molecules with a duplex cross-linked to long ssDNA or dsDNA molecules.

The authors found that NEIL3 plays a major role in the repair of psoralen-induced ICLs in mammalian cells, which is non-epistatic with the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, whereas the FA pathway is primarily responsible for the repair of ICLs induced by anticancer drugs such as MMC and cisplatin and proceeds via generation of DSBs.

Majority of DNA damage: non-bulky base modifications, abasic sites, and single-strand breaks with 3\u2032-blocking groups are removed in DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease-initiated BER and NIR pathways, respectively, without significant activation of DNA damage signaling pathways and cell cycle checkpoints, whereas complex DNA damage such as bulky DNA adducts and interstrand DNA cross-links, which constitute only a minor fraction of total DNA damage, presents a major challenge for DNA repair and cell fate. To counteract complex DNA lesions, the cell employs specific DNA damage signaling systems and several distinct DNA repair pathways acting in a highly coordinated manner. The chemical nature of complex DNA lesions and the extent of helix distortion their produce play important roles in DNA damage signaling, repair, and mutagenesis. Typically, complex DNA lesions are handled in the classical NER pathway, which can be coupled to transcription. Contrary to DNA glycosylases, NER machinery does not have specificity to a base modification per se but rather recognizes a DNA helix distortion, whereas DNA glycosylases are highly specific to the base modifications, because a damaged base should fit into their active site pocket. Intriguingly, certain types of DNA glycosylases are involved in the repair of bulky DNA adducts and ICLs, which cannot be accommodated inside the enzyme body. As a solution to this problem, T4 endonuclease V DNA glycosylase and UVDE endonuclease interact not with a UV pyrimidine dimer but with opposite adenine bases by inserting them into their specific pockets. The NER machinery cannot efficiently recognize bulky DNA adducts which do not distort DNA helix conformation and do not destabilize thermodynamic stability of the duplex (e.g., aristolactam-DNA adducts and di-benzopyrine-adenine adducts). In addition, the mammalian NER pathway is not efficient when acting upon ICLs, for the reason that both strands in duplex DNA are damaged and that the repair proteins cannot discriminate between two strands to excise the lesion (Mu et al., 2000), whereas Nei-like family DNA glycosylases recognize the adducted nucleobase but expel the bulky cross-linked moiety out of the active site pocket (Coste et al., 2008; Couve et al., 2009). NEIL1 and NEIL3 can excise ICL in both DNA strands in a sequential manner; importantly, NEIL3 does not cleave the DNA strand after base excision and thus does not generate toxic DSB (Semlow et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2017).", "Continuous damage of cellular DNA together with repair deficiency results in genome instability and cancer.
