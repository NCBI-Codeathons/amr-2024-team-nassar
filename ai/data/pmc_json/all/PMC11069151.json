They are ideal payloads for the antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) [1]. The anthraquinone-fused enediynes (AFEs) possess unique structural feature in which the anthraquinone moiety is fused with the 10-membered enediyne core to facilitate the interaction with DNA [2]. Six groups of AFEs have been identified to date, including dynemicins (DYNs), uncialamycin (UCM), tiancimycins (TNMs), yangpumicins (YPMs), sealutomicins (STMs), and non-canonical aromatized sungeidines (SGDs) (Fig.\u00a01A). In recent preclinical studies, different synthetic UCM analogs have been applied as ADC payloads and exhibited potent antitumor activity. Some of the analogs displayed a strong bystander-killing effect, which is beneficial for their antitumor efficacy [3\u20135]. Furthermore, the potent antitumor effect of targeted TNM-A delivery via liposomes supports an alternative strategy for the translation of AFEs as nanomedicines [6]. However, the low production titers of AFEs severely limit their clinical development. Multiple traditional methods, such as resin supplement, ribosome engineering, fermentation optimization, and genome shuffling, had been adopted to enhance the production of the AFEs (Fig.\u00a01A), such as DYNs [7, 8], UCM [9], TNMs [10\u201312], and YPMs [13].

This strategy has been successfully applied to improve the yields of many antibiotics, such as the veterinary medicine salinomycin [17], the immunosuppressive agent FK506 [18], and the natural herbicide thaxtomin [19]. In the five biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of AFEs (Fig.\u00a01B), many encoded proteins are highly conserved [20, 21]. Recent studies on DYN biosynthesis have revealed the dual role of PKSE in the formation of both the 10-membered enediyne core and the anthraquinone moiety [22, 23]. The biosynthetic studies on AFEs suggests that they share a common pathway in the early steps, and their structural differences are attributed to different post-modification enzymes [21]. For example, the cytochrome P450 hydroxylase TnmL and the O-methyltransferase TnmH are essential for the introduction of the hydroxyl and methoxy groups on the A-ring of TNM-A and TNM-D [24]. The extreme toxicity of enediynes has led their producers to evolve different self-resistance mechanisms, including the self-sacrifice proteins [25, 26]. The latest investigation on the self-resistance mechanism to TNMs has revealed a family of sequestration proteins (TnmS1/S2/S3) that provide resistance to the host. Such a mechanism is generic to the AFEs because homologs of TnmS1/S2/S3 are present in all BGCs for AFEs [27]. In addition, the putative self-sacrifice protein TnmB and the putative drug efflux pump TnmT1 may also contribute to resistance to TNMs.", "Compared with conventional strain improvement approaches, metabolic engineering strategy modifies host metabolism to direct metabolic flux into target pathway by overexpressing the genes involved in precursor supply and target product formation and eliminating competing pathways [14\u201316].

Because acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are the building blocks for TNM biosynthesis [22, 38], the six PKS BGCs other than tnm in CB03234-S may potentially compete for CoA precursors with the biosynthesis of TNM.

Time course monitoring revealed that TNM-W was detected after 5 days of S1021 fermentation in a 30-L fermenter. Its accumulation was negatively correlated with the concentration of TNM-A in a time-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a06A and S4). To clarify the possible origin of TNM-W, scaled-up fermentation of S1019 and S1020 was also performed. However, neither strain generated TNM-W (Fig.\u00a06A). According to the genotypes of S1019, S1020, and S1021, we hypothesized that the generation of TNM-W was dependent on both TnmE and TnmE10. Interestingly, S1021 produced TNM-W in the 30\u00a0L fermenter but not when fermented in a shaking flask (Fig.\u00a06A); this may be a consequence of different pH, as the changes in pH were quite different in these two fermentation conditions. To test this hypothesis, pH-controlled fermentation of S1021 was performed in shaking flasks. When the pH of broth in the shaking flasks was maintained between 8.1 and 8.4 using the acidic starch solution, TNM-W was detected similarly as in the 30-L fermenter (Fig.\u00a06B).

Without iodide, an essential element for the formation of the key intermediate iodoanthracene and subsequent biosynthesis of AFEs [23], neither TNMs nor TNM-W were detected in the OP medium. In this context, externally supplemented TNM-A was transformed into TNM-W by S1021 (Fig.\u00a06B).

Through the inactivation of potentially competitive BGCs, three competitive BGCs that were identified; however, only the successive inactivation of two BGCs with distinct pathways continuously improved the production of TNMs. Meanwhile, the overexpression of key biosynthetic and auxiliary genes revealed that tnmE and tnmE10 govern the formation of both the enediyne core and anthraquinone moiety, which are important for strengthening the production of TNMs. After integrating these beneficial mutations, the high-yielding strain S1021 was constructed. An average yield of over 43\u00a0mg/L TNMs was achieved in a pilot-scale 30\u00a0L fermenter, representing the highest reported AFE titer to date. In addition, S1021 produced a novel TNM analog, TNM-W, which is the first unnatural AFE analog with a unique double bond in place of the common ethylene oxide moiety found in other AFEs. Our study establishes a solid basis for the industrial production of TNMs and provides a platform to enhance the production of other AFEs.", "Electronic supplementary material", "Electronic supplementary material", "Electronic supplementary material", "Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.", "Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.", "Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.", "Supplementary Material 1", "Supplementary Material 1", "Supplementary Material 1", "Supplementary Material 1", "Supplementary Material 1", "Supplementary Material 1", "Publisher\u2019s Note", "Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "Zhoukang Zhuang and Wenping Kong contributed equally to this work.", "Author contributions", "ZXC, YXH, and DYW conceived and supervised the study.
