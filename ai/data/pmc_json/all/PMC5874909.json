["ABSTRACT", "Colibactins are hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides produced by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae harboring the pks genomic island. These genotoxic metabolites are produced by pks-encoded peptide-polyketide synthases as inactive prodrugs called precolibactins, which are then converted to colibactins by deacylation for DNA-damaging effects. Colibactins are bona fide virulence factors and are suspected of promoting colorectal carcinogenesis when produced by intestinal E.\u00a0coli. Natural active colibactins have not been isolated, and how they induce DNA damage in the eukaryotic host cell is poorly characterized. Here, we show that DNA strands are cross-linked covalently when exposed to enterobacteria producing colibactins. DNA cross-linking is abrogated in a clbP mutant unable to deacetylate precolibactins or by adding the colibactin self-resistance protein ClbS, confirming the involvement of the mature forms of colibactins. A similar DNA-damaging mechanism is observed in cellulo, where interstrand cross-links are detected in the genomic DNA of cultured human cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. The intoxicated cells exhibit replication stress, activation of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), and recruitment of the DNA cross-link repair Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) protein. In contrast, inhibition of ATR or knockdown of FANCD2 reduces the survival of cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. These findings demonstrate that DNA interstrand cross-linking is the critical mechanism of colibactin-induced DNA damage in infected cells.", "IMPORTANCE", "Colorectal cancer is the third-most-common cause of cancer death. In addition to known risk factors such as high-fat diets and alcohol consumption, genotoxic intestinal Escherichia coli bacteria producing colibactin are proposed to play a role in colon cancer development. Here, by using transient infections with genotoxic E.\u00a0coli, we showed that colibactins directly generate DNA cross-links in cellulo. Such lesions are converted into double-strand breaks during the repair response. DNA cross-links, akin to those induced by metabolites of alcohol and high-fat diets and by widely used anticancer drugs, are both severely mutagenic and profoundly cytotoxic lesions. This finding of a direct induction of DNA cross-links by a bacterium should facilitate delineating the role of E.\u00a0coli in colon cancer and engineering new anticancer agents.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Colibactins are genotoxic natural products of unknown structure produced by human commensal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains of Enterobacteriaceae and by other bacteria associated with different host organisms. Biosynthesis of colibactins is allowed by a highly conserved 54-kb genomic \u201cpks\u201d island found in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter koseri (1, 2). The colibactin synthesis pathway is also found in marine Pseudovibrio spp. associated with sponges, in the honey bee gut symbiont Frischella perrara, and in Erwinia oleae isolated from olive tree knots (3\u20135). Colibactin production has been linked to pathogenicity and cancer. Indeed, the pks island is associated with a highly virulent subset of extraintestinal pathogenic E.\u00a0coli isolates and with hypervirulent K.\u00a0pneumoniae strains (6\u20138). The contribution of colibactins to the virulence of E.\u00a0coli and K.\u00a0pneumoniae has been demonstrated in rodent sepsis and meningitis models, where isogenic mutants impaired for colibactin production exhibit attenuated virulence compared to wild-type pks-positive (pks+) strains (9\u201311). The presence of the pks island also correlates with the ability of E.\u00a0coli strains belonging to phylogenetic group B2 to establish persistent colonization of the host intestine (12). Studies have found an increased presence of pks+\nE.\u00a0coli in colorectal cancer patients (13\u201315).

The pks island codes for multienzymatic biosynthesis machinery, with nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), an efflux pump, and \u201caccessory\u201d enzymes. The NRPSs and PKSs are modified posttranslationally for acceptance of synthesis building blocks by the ClbA phosphopantetheinyl transferase (18, 19). The NRPSs and PKSs then function as a multimodular assembly line that synthesizes the inactive precolibactins. Precolibactin biosynthetic intermediates are offloaded from the assembly line by the ClbQ thioesterase, thus possibly regulating colibactin synthesis and genotoxic activity (20, 21). Precolibactins then follow a prodrug pathway, where the products are transported to the bacterial periplasm by the ClbM pump (22). Precolibactins are cleaved by the periplasmic peptidase ClbP to remove an N-terminal precursor scaffold (myristoyl-asparagine) and generate active colibactins (23\u201325). This prodrug export and activation pathway likely represents a self-protection mechanism preventing self-toxicity to the producing bacteria. As a supplemental self-protection mechanism, the pks island encodes the ClbS resistance protein, a cyclopropane hydrolase that inactivates colibactins in the producing bacterium (26, 27). This protection is also observed in cultured human cells transfected with the clbS gene (26).", "The pks island hosts 19 genes (clbA to clbS), and mutation of any of these genes, except clbS, results in a decrease in or loss of the genotoxic activity (1).

As a result, the cell recruits the DNA-damage response and activates the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) pathway, resulting in cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair or in removal of the injured cells by apoptosis and senescence (1, 16, 28, 29). In vivo, signs of DNA damage can be detected in gut cells of animals colonized with pks+\nE.\u00a0coli (10, 28, 30) or in liver or brain cells of mice infected with pks+\nK.\u00a0pneumoniae (11, 31). The DNA damage inflicted by colibactins is deleterious for the host cell genome stability, as low numbers of infecting pks+\nE.\u00a0coli bacteria promote chromosomal instability, aneuploidy, and gene mutations, resulting in cellular transformation (28). As natural mature colibactins confound isolation, how they inflict DNA damage, directly or indirectly, leading to the formation of DNA DSBs and ultimately promoting tumorigenesis, remains poorly understood.

As seen with cisplatin, but in contrast to the results seen with bacteria hosting the vector, infection with DH10B pBACpks induced the phosphorylation of Chk1 and RPA. Inactivating ATR by the use of its specific inhibitor VE-821 (ATRi) (41) prevented this response (Fig.\u00a04b; see also Fig. S5).

Treatment with ATRi alleviated this response, allowing pks+\nE.\u00a0coli-infected cells to enter mitosis with damaged DNA, evidenced by p-H2AX staining (Fig.\u00a0S6).

Upon blockage of replication fork progression by DNA ICLs, Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) is activated by monoubiquitinylation and is recruited to stalled forks, where it colocalizes in subnuclear foci with p-H2AX and orchestrates ICL removal (43\u201346). We thus examined whether HeLa cells infected with pks+\nE.\u00a0coli recapitulated these responses. As visualized by Western blotting, DH10B pBACpks-infected and MMC-treated cells exhibited the heaviest form of FANCD2 corresponding to the monoubiquitinylated protein, whereas DH10B pBAC vector-infected cells exhibited mostly the unmodified form of FANCD2 (Fig.\u00a05a). Next, FANCD2 and p-H2AX focus formation was examined by fluorescence microscopy in HeLa cells infected with DH10B pBACpks or vector or treated with MMC. Four hours after exposure to DH10B vector, the cells presented some detectable p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci, reflecting the S-phase cells, as some FANCD2 foci form spontaneously during unperturbed replication (45) (Fig.\u00a05b). In contrast, cells infected with DH10B pBACpks exhibited distinctive nuclear foci of FANCD2 colocalized with p-H2AX, similarly to the results observed in MMC-treated cells (Fig.\u00a05b; see also Fig. S7). The percentage of cells harboring p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci increased markedly between 4 and 20\u00a0h after infection with DH10B pBACpks or treatment with MMC (Fig.\u00a05c; see also Fig. S7). These comparable time-dependent responses strongly suggest that, similarly to the results seen with MMC-induced replication stress, DH10B pBACpks-infected cells entering the S phase encountered ICLs that activated the Fanconi pathway. We confirmed these observations by assessing the recruitment to DH10B pBACpks-induced repair foci of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and RPA, two well-established markers of DNA DSBs and blocked replication forks, respectively.

As natural active colibactins resist isolation, we used live bacteria with an intact colibactin synthesis pathway, under culture conditions that allowed production of the genotoxic metabolites as demonstrated by the genotoxicity for the infected epithelial cells. In summary, we observed that addition of exogenous bacterial or mammalian DNA during the infection of epithelial cells by pks+\nE.\u00a0coli protected the cells from colibactin genotoxicity. The DNA directly exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria did not exhibit strand breaks but did exhibit cross-linking of the DNA strands. The in vitro cross-linking activity of pks+\nE.\u00a0coli was also observed on naked DNA in the absence of epithelial cells. This DNA cross-linking was similar to that induced by MMC and cisplatin (a natural cytotoxin and a synthetic antineoplastic drug, respectively), which are bifunctional DNA alkylators generating ICLs. All pks+ enterobacterial species (including clinical E.\u00a0coli, C.\u00a0koseri, and K.\u00a0pneumoniae isolates) exerted the same phenotype. Mutagenesis of genes inactivating (pre)colibactin synthesis or inactivating the deacylation step that maturates precolibactins into genotoxic colibactins resulted in a complete loss of the cross-linking activity. These in vitro results strongly argue for a direct interaction of the natural colibactins with double-stranded DNA and for covalent cross-linking of the two complementary strands, resulting in DNA ICLs. Such a mode of action is in good agreement with the structural features that were recently predicted or identified in candidate nongenotoxic precolibactins: a thiazoline-thiazole tail and a spirocyclic cyclopropane ring (48, 49). Thiazole rings have been shown to allow DNA intercalation of DNA-targeting natural products such as the bleomycins, thus supporting the idea of a direct interaction of colibactins with DNA. Cyclopropane \u201cwarheads\u201d are found in potent DNA-damaging natural products such as illudins, CC-1065, yatakemycin, and duocarmycins, which alkylate DNA through nucleophilic cyclopropane ring openings. An isolated candidate precolibactin (purified from a nongenotoxic clbP mutant) bearing the cyclopropane showed weak cross-linking activity when added in millimolar amounts to plasmid DNA and incubated for 20 h (32). In addition, synthetic compounds bearing a cyclopropane ring system similar to that detected in precolibactin candidates from clbP mutants were recently shown to alkylate plasmid DNA, resulting in extensive DNA cleavage (but not cross-linking) (33). The NRPS ClbH incorporates the cyclopropane during synthesis of (pre)colibactins, and we observed that clbH gene inactivation fully abrogated the DNA damage in infected cells and the cross-linking of plasmid DNA in vitro. In addition, both the DNA cross-linking and genotoxicity of pks+\nE.\u00a0coli were inhibited by addition of purified self-resistance protein ClbS, which was recently shown to convert the cyclopropane into inactive products by hydrolysis (27). Altogether, these data support a model where the natural colibactins directly damage double-stranded DNA, with a key role for the electrophilic cyclopropane in the alkylation of one DNA strand, formation of a second electrophilic site, and alkylation of the cDNA strand, resulting in an ICL.", "In this study, we addressed the issue of the mode of action on DNA and resulting genotoxicity in the host cell of the natural colibactins produced by pks+ enterobacteria.

In addition, both the DNA cross-linking and genotoxicity of pks+\nE.\u00a0coli were inhibited by addition of purified self-resistance protein ClbS, which was recently shown to convert the cyclopropane into inactive products by hydrolysis (27). Altogether, these data support a model where the natural colibactins directly damage double-stranded DNA, with a key role for the electrophilic cyclopropane in the alkylation of one DNA strand, formation of a second electrophilic site, and alkylation of the cDNA strand, resulting in an ICL.", "Denaturing gel electrophoresis of DNA from epithelial cells infected with pks+\nE.\u00a0coli indicated that ICLs are rapidly (as soon as the end of the 4-h infection) generated within host cell genomic DNA. Thus, colibactins produced by pks+\nE.\u00a0coli not only directly damage and cross-link naked DNA in vitro but also can traffic in the infected epithelial cell, reach the nucleus, and cross-link DNA that is packaged into chromatin. DNA ICLs are recognized by the cellular DNA damage response mainly during DNA replication, halting the replication machinery and generating patches of single-stranded DNA (50, 51). ATR is activated in response to this replication stress signaled by the patches of single-stranded DNA directly bound by RPA (39). A previously published observation that pks+\nE.\u00a0coli-exposed cells lagged 48\u00a0h in the S phase before accumulating in the G2 phase whereas control cells proceeded through S-G2-M phases in 12\u00a0h (1) is consistent with the occurrence of replication stress. The recruitment of RPA in subnuclear foci and the activation/phosphorylation of ATR and its downstream substrate CHK1 also indicate the induction of replication stress in cells exposed to pks+\nE.\u00a0coli. Moreover, ATR activation was central in orchestrating the cellular response to colibactin-induced damage, since its pharmacological inhibition abrogated the DNA damage response and resulted in mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Activated ATR allowed the recruitment of the Fanconi anemia DNA cross-link repair pathway, evidenced by the activation of FANCD2 and its recruitment in subnuclear foci together with p-H2AX. As for ATR, FANCD2 was required for cell survival of colibactin-induced damage, as shown by the decreased level clonogeny upon FANCD2 depletion. Thus, induction of early genomic DNA ICLs by colibactins resulted in replication stress and activation of the ATR and Fanconi anemia repair pathways. Concurrently, DNA DSBs were formed, evidenced by ATM phosphorylation and the recruitment of p-H2AX and 53BP1 in subnuclear repair foci. Colibactin-induced ICLs are thus converted into DNA DSBs during the repair process, when DNA lesions are excised by the host repair nucleases (52, 53). Additionally, extended replication stalling and fork collapse can result in aberrant DNA structures and DSBs (54). The DNA-colibactin adducts might also degrade, as observed in vitro with synthetic colibactins mimics (33), or under oxidative conditions, colibactins could form reactive peroxides, leading to further DNA damage (27). We also cannot exclude the possibility that other types of DNA insults might be inflicted by different forms of colibactins, leading to DSBs by distinct mechanisms.", "Denaturing gel electrophoresis of DNA from epithelial cells infected with pks+\nE.\u00a0coli indicated that ICLs are rapidly (as soon as the end of the 4-h infection) generated within host cell genomic DNA.

Such lesions induce replication stress and favor DSBs, and it has been shown that their accumulation over time contributes to aging in tissue and to genomic instability, a hallmark of precancerous cells.
