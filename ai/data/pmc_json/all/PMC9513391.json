CmnC and its homologues, VioC in viomycin (VIO) biosynthesis and OrfP in streptothricin (STT) biosynthesis, catalyze hydroxylation of l-Arg to form \u03b2-hydroxy l-Arg (CmnC and VioC) or \u03b2,\u03b3-dihydroxy l-Arg (OrfP). In this study, a combination of biochemical characterization and structural determination was performed to understand the substrate binding environment and substrate specificity of CmnC. Interestingly, despite having a high conservation of the substrate binding environment among CmnC, VioC, and OrfP, only OrfP can hydroxylate the substrate enantiomer d-Arg. Superposition of the structures of CmnC, VioC, and OrfP revealed a similar folds and overall structures. The active site residues of CmnC, VioC, and OrfP are almost conserved; however Leu136, Ser138, and Asp249 around the substrate binding pocket in CmnC are replaced by Gln, Gly, and Tyr in OrfP, respectively. These residues may play important roles for the substrate binding. The mutagenesis analysis revealed that the triple mutant CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y switches the substrate stereoselectivity from l-Arg to d-Arg with \u223c6% relative activity. The crystal structure of CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y in complex with d-Arg revealed that the substrate loses partial interactions and adopts a different orientation in the binding site. This study provides insights into the enzyme engineering to \u03b1-KG non-heme iron oxygenases for adjustment to the substrate stereoselectivity and development of biocatalysts.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "\u03b1-Ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG)-dependent non-heme iron oxygenases catalyze diverse reactions involved in many natural product biosynthesis (Gao et al., 2018; Nakamura et al., 2018). These enzymes share initial steps of catalysis and a general enzyme mechanism (Martinez and Hausinger, 2015). The active site dioxygen supersedes the water molecule to form a FeII\u2013superoxide anion or a FeIII\u2013superoxide. The superoxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon of \u03b1-KG, resulting in the decarboxylation product succinic acid and the reactive FeIV\u2013oxo species. The reactive FeIV\u2013oxo typically undergoes diverse reactions through radical processes. For example, FeIV\u2013oxo abstracts a H atom (H\u00b7) from the carbon atom of the substrate to form a FeIII\u2013OH cofactor and the corresponding carbon radical (C\u00b7). The hydroxylation reaction is subsequently performed via the rebound recombination between the carbon radical and the iron-bound hydroxyl group (Hausinger, 2004; Yin and Zabriskie, 2004; You et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2014). In addition to hydroxylation, epoxidation, desaturation, cyclization, and halogenation are followed a similar catalytic mechanism (Blasiak et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2018; Nakamura et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020). Intriguingly, some enzymes in this versatile family of oxygenases catalyze multiple reactions. For example, clavaminate synthase (CAS) catalyzes sequential hydroxylation, cyclization, and desaturation reactions in clavulanic acid biosynthesis (Janc et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 2000); AusE and PrhA catalyze desaturation reactions, followed by intramolecular rearrangement to condense/expand the rings in austinol and paraherquonin biosynthesis, respectively (Nakashima et al., 2018).", "\u03b1-Ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG)-dependent non-heme iron oxygenases catalyze diverse reactions involved in many natural product biosynthesis (Gao et al., 2018; Nakamura et al., 2018).

VioC and OrfP are \u03b1-KG-dependent non-heme iron oxygenases involved in the first step of the non-proteinogenic amino acids capreomycidine (Cap) and hydroxy-Cap formation in viomycin (VIO) and streptothricin (STT) biosynthesis, respectively (Figure 1) (Ju et al., 2004; Yin and Zabriskie, 2004; Chang et al., 2014). VioC and OrfP catalyze hydroxylation and double hydroxylation of l-Arg to form \u03b2-hydroxy l-Arg and \u03b2,\u03b3-dihydroxy l-Arg, respectively. VioD and OrfR, the PLP-dependent enzymes, subsequently undergo dehydration and cyclization of the hydroxylated products from the last step and afford the six-membered ring product Cap and hydroxy-Cap (Figure 1) (Ju et al., 2004; Yin et al., 2004). The crystal structures of VioC and OrfP revealed that they share a similar fold and active site environment (Helmetag et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2014). The catalytic iron is coordinated by the conserved 2-His-1-Glu facial triad within the HXD/EXnH Fe binding motif. The substrate l-Arg is bound in the active site pocket, where the conserved residues, Arg and Asp, at the opposite faces stabilize the carboxylate and guanidino groups of the substrate through electrostatic interactions, respectively. Intriguingly, despite high sequence and structure similarity between VioC and OrfP, they show different substrate specificity and reaction products (Helmetag et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2014; Dunham et al., 2018a). As mentioned previously, OrfP catalyzes double hydroxylation of l-Arg at \u03b2 and \u03b3 positions (Chang et al., 2014), while VioC catalyzes single hydroxylation at \u03b2 position (Yin and Zabriskie, 2004). Furthermore, OrfP accepts the substrate enantiomer d-Arg and affords the hydroxylated product. VioC is unable to catalyze hydroxylation of d-Arg; however, it catalyzes an efficient oxidative deamination of d-Arg to form the corresponding 2-oxo-acid (Helmetag et al., 2009; Dunham et al., 2018b).", "In addition to the 20 standard amino acids, non-proteinogenic amino acids expand the structural diversity of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs). \u03b1-KG-dependent non-heme iron oxygenases were reported to participate in the biosynthesis of non-proteinogenic amino acids, incorporated into the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) machineries.
