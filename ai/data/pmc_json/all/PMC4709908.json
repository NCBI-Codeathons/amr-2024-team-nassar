Interestingly, increased levels of GFPT paralleled with the over-representation at A-90\u00a0h of diaminopimelate epimerase, UDP-N-acetylmuramate-alanine ligase and UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamyl-2,6- diaminopimelate--D-alanyl-D-alanyl ligase, whose encoding genes are organized in putative operons (Additional file 4: Supplementary Results); these proteins are all involved in the biosynthesis of the cell wall stem peptide, thus revealing an up-regulation of this cellular process during NAI-107 production at A-90\u00a0h.", "Protein metabolism", "Protein metabolism", "Protein metabolism", "Protein metabolism", "According to the general down-representation of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism during NAI-107 production at A-90\u00a0h, protein components involved in protein biosynthesis, folding and export were generally under-represented in both global and membrane proteomic maps.

However, surviving cells are still metabolically active and use medium peptides as carbon and nitrogen source. This can be inferred from the progressive increment of the pH value of the medium (Fig.\u00a01c), as consequence of amino acid utilization and ammonia production [24\u201326], and by the NAI-107 concentration that increases until D-140\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a01a). In order to shed light on the molecular events associated with NAI-107 production maintenance and arrest, differential proteomic analysis was carried out on biomass samples collected at D-117, D-140 and D-162\u00a0h substages, using D-117\u00a0h as pivotal time-point. This analysis revealed 171 differentially represented spots in the D-117 vs D-140\u00a0h comparison, with 111 and 60 ones over- and under-represented at D-117\u00a0h, respectively (Additional file 2: Table S2); on the other hand, 265 differentially represented spots were observed in the D-117 vs D-162\u00a0h comparison, with 130 and 135 ones over- and under-represented at D-117\u00a0h, respectively. Hundred and fifty-one spots were in common between the two datasets showing concordant abundance profiles in terms of up- and down-regulation (Additional file 2: Table S2). Thus, 285 spots were then subjected to MS analysis for protein identification. Identified proteins were clustered according their function as reported above (Fig.\u00a02c and d). Proteins occurring in spots (19 in total) presenting the concomitant presence of multiple components (Additional file 6: Table S5) were excluded from clustering. Functional analysis revealed that proteins with unknown function were the most represented group (i) of differentially regulated species, followed by that of species involved in carbon and protein metabolism (b and g, respectively). The two datasets showed a concordant profile and distribution into functional groups of over- and under-represented protein species (Fig.\u00a03c and d). These results univocally revealed that proteins belonging to all functional groups were mostly over-represented at D-117\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a03c and d; Fig.\u00a04b); conversely, an opposite trend was observed for proteins with unknown function (under-represented at D-117\u00a0h). In particular, proteins involved in protein biosynthesis, folding and turn-over, stress response factors, transport through membranes (either involved in amino acid, peptide and sugars up-take), and enzymes active in nucleotide, energy and carbon metabolism (mostly in TCA cycle) were accumulated at D-117\u00a0h (Additional file 2: Table S2; Fig.\u00a04b). Global accumulation pattern of these functional groups well paralleled the fact that mycelial cells stopped growth at D substages, with the occurrence of concomitant events of cell lysis which became more severe after D-140\u00a0h, thus determining the dramatic decrease of biomass content and NAI-107 production yield as observed thereafter (Fig.\u00a01a).

At the molecular level, this phenomenon was associated with a down-representation of enzymes involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and of proteins involved in DNA replication, amino acid and protein biosynthesis; conversely, protein degradation factors as well as TCA cycle enzymes were instead over-represented during NAI-107 production at A-90\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a05a). Interesting exceptions of the general trend of down-regulation of anabolic pathways at A-90\u00a0h were some over-represented enzymes involved in cell wall precursor biosynthesis. The glucose limitation signal may be responsible for a metabolic imbalance that results in the observed over-representation of oxidoreductive processes and oxidative stress response proteins (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 3: Table S3). In addition, the nutrient stress may be a triggering factor that, through the ppGpp activity (as suggested by ObgE GTPase and PNPase abundance profiles), can sequentially activate the bld cascade, as deduced by the accumulation profiles of the Microbispora BldK, BldG and BldD proteins. In agreement with this view, a stimulation of NAI-107 biosynthesis has been recently demonstrated in Microbispora corallina by the over-expression of relA, whose product is responsible of ppGpp biosynthesis [53]. Worth mentioning is the fact that the presence of BldK suggests the involvement of cell density signals too [38], which may integrate nutrient availability signals. Thus, in parallel with what already observed for the biosynthesis of the morphogenetic lanthionine containing peptide SapB in S. coelicolor [37, 54, 55], the bld regulatory cascade can promote the activation of pathway-specific mlb genes that control the production of NAI-107 in Microbispora. In line with these observations, products of the mlb cluster - i.e. ABC transporters MlbF and MlbZ, together with lantibiotic cyclase MlbC - accumulated in Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 during NAI-107 production at A-90\u00a0h. Interestingly, MlbF, MlbZ and MlbC were identified as associated with bacterial membranes, thus confirming the possibility that lantibiotic biosynthesis and self-immunity mechanisms occur in proximity of this bacterial district, as already reported in the case of nisin [28]. Indeed, proteomic analysis of the membrane extracts identified specific proteins, such as PspA, which shifted their quantitative representation moving from the cytosolic to the membrane district. These results confirmed also previous observations on cytosolic translational effectors in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, for which a \u201cmoon-ligthining\u201d activity was claimed [56, 57].", "The NAI-107 production onset coincided with a pronounced decrease of glucose amount in the growth medium. At the molecular level, this phenomenon was associated with a down-representation of enzymes involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and of proteins involved in DNA replication, amino acid and protein biosynthesis; conversely, protein degradation factors as well as TCA cycle enzymes were instead over-represented during NAI-107 production at A-90\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a05a). Interesting exceptions of the general trend of down-regulation of anabolic pathways at A-90\u00a0h were some over-represented enzymes involved in cell wall precursor biosynthesis. The glucose limitation signal may be responsible for a metabolic imbalance that results in the observed over-representation of oxidoreductive processes and oxidative stress response proteins (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 3: Table S3). In addition, the nutrient stress may be a triggering factor that, through the ppGpp activity (as suggested by ObgE GTPase and PNPase abundance profiles), can sequentially activate the bld cascade, as deduced by the accumulation profiles of the Microbispora BldK, BldG and BldD proteins. In agreement with this view, a stimulation of NAI-107 biosynthesis has been recently demonstrated in Microbispora corallina by the over-expression of relA, whose product is responsible of ppGpp biosynthesis [53]. Worth mentioning is the fact that the presence of BldK suggests the involvement of cell density signals too [38], which may integrate nutrient availability signals. Thus, in parallel with what already observed for the biosynthesis of the morphogenetic lanthionine containing peptide SapB in S. coelicolor [37, 54, 55], the bld regulatory cascade can promote the activation of pathway-specific mlb genes that control the production of NAI-107 in Microbispora. In line with these observations, products of the mlb cluster - i.e. ABC transporters MlbF and MlbZ, together with lantibiotic cyclase MlbC - accumulated in Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 during NAI-107 production at A-90\u00a0h.

Evidences of the importance of Pi for NAI-107 production have recently been reported [58]. In this study, the Pi content in the medium was observed as decreasing and reaching its minimum in coincidence of NAI-107 onset at A-90\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a01b); then, it progressively increased during the D stage. This last evidence may be a consequence of two different and partly simultaneous events consistent with: i) mycelial cell lysis during the D stage - as inferred by several experimental evidences such as biomass content kinetics (Fig.\u00a01a), fluorescent confocal microscopy observations (Additional file 5: Figure S6), the accumulation of osmotic and membrane-associated stress response factors (Additional file 1: Table S1, Additional file 2: Table S2, Additional file 3: Table S3) and overall diminished representation of primary metabolism enzymes during the transition from A to D stages (Additional file 5: Figure S1 and S2) - leading to the progressive release of cellular phosphate; ii) the scavenging action for phosphate from organic sources by Pho regulon gene products [35], whose members were observed as accumulating during NAI-107 production at A-90\u00a0h (Additional file 3: Table S3). This last occurrence well paralleled the Po consumption profile (Fig.\u00a01b). On the other hand, the ammonia content profile suggests an equilibrium between production/assimilation of ammonia from medium peptides [24, 25], according with the activity of the GlnA enzyme [34] that was up-regulated at A-90\u00a0h (Additional file 1: Table S1). This equilibrium appeared as interrupted in coincidence with glucose exhaustion during D substages. Ammonia metabolism seems to play a crucial role also during NAI-107 production maintenance at D substages, due to the accumulation profile of two GlnA paralogues and of GlnK (Additional file 2: Table S2). Altogether, these evidences suggest that NAI-107 biosynthesis is mainly supported by the supply of general and essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur. This is in good agreement with the fact that NAI-107 is a ribosomally synthesised lanthipeptide containing all the proteinogenic amino acids except phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamine and histidine as can be inferred from the amino acid sequence of the precursor peptide encoded by the structural gene mlbA.", "Interestingly, the metabolism of nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur resulted important for NAI-107 production onset.
