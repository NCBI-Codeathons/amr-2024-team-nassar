Interestingly, a retro-aldol synthesis of the precursor HBA [18], revealed this to be a yellow-orange powder, which broadly absorbs between\u2009~\u2009300\u2013450\u00a0nm in neutral-alkaline conditions (>\u2009pH 7.5) but is colourless below pH 7. Importantly, despite some absorbance between 260\u2013350\u00a0nm, none of the other pathway intermediates such as L-Tyr (colourless), p-coumarate (pale yellow) or p-coumaroyl-CoA (pale yellow) or raspberry ketone (colourless) shares this distinct visual spectral property. Based on this observation, we tested if we could monitor HBA production using EcoFlex, by first optimising the concentrations of only the first three genes, tal, pcl and bas to maximise HBA accumulation. To simplify this further, we also omitted the malonyl-CoA regeneration scheme since the E. coli malonyl-CoA pool is\u2009~\u200935 \u00b5M [15] and the BAS enzyme has a favourable KM (23.3\u00a0\u03bcM) for malonyl-CoA [16]. Therefore, at low (~\u2009\u00b5M) levels of flux, we did not expect malonyl-CoA to be rate-limiting. Next, we initially built the pathway with a random promoter library containing ten low to high-strength EcoFlex \u03c370 promoters into a medium-copy (ColE1) origin of replication pTU2-A destination vector, while also adding a kanamycin marker as an additional selective pressure to maintain plasmid stability.

To continue, we picked 32 colonies that displayed strong yellow-orange pigmentation and grew in small-scale liquid culture (Figs.\u00a01, 2). Interestingly, a number of the strains all but depleted the L-Tyr substrate (~\u20091.6\u20132.3\u00a0\u03bcM) and had high levels of p-coumarate (154\u2013180\u00a0\u03bcM), but no HBA or raspberry ketone. In addition, two strains had increased HBA levels up to 68\u00a0\u03bcM, and 14\u00a0\u03bcM raspberry ketone from an unidentified and non-specific E. coli alkene reductase [11]. Overall, all strains producing HBA had a weak promoter with the pcl gene (J23114, SJM914), while the bas gene had either a medium (SJM908, SJM910) or strong promoter (J23100). However, this new library also contained a number of recombination events between the pcl and bas genes, but only where the J23114 promoter was found preceding the pcl gene. This is probably due to its frequent occurrence within the library, as a weak strength promoter. From recent literature [19], this was due to the repetitive use homology between the promoters and the Bba_B0015 terminator in the Golden Gate assembly. Therefore, we aimed to increase the diversity of terminators used in the next round of assembly. In addition, to fine-tune individual enzyme levels, we also desired a wider selection of promoters. To achieve this, we built and characterised a new \u03c370 promoter library with degenerate bases to minimise homologous recombination.Fig. 1A comparison of raspberry ketone biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo identifies pathway limitations.

Based on this observation, we tested if we could monitor HBA production using EcoFlex, by first optimising the concentrations of only the first three genes, tal, pcl and bas to maximise HBA accumulation. To simplify this further, we also omitted the malonyl-CoA regeneration scheme since the E. coli malonyl-CoA pool is\u2009~\u200935 \u00b5M [15] and the BAS enzyme has a favourable KM (23.3\u00a0\u03bcM) for malonyl-CoA [16].

We were intrigued by the disturbances in growth for some pathway constructs in response to stronger promoters and whether this is\u00a0a common observation between different pathway enzymes. Therefore, we explored potential design faults at the level of individual gene expression for the first three pathway enzymes (TAL, PCL and BAS), which are responsible for HBA biosynthesis. To provide new variable strength \u03c370 promoters with reduced homology, we also expanded the EcoFlex promoter library [10]. This is based on the original Anderson promoter library [20] with degeneracy within the \u2212\u00a035 and \u2212\u00a010 boxes. In addition, to reduce homologous recombination, we also included two separate degenerate regions within the promoter. To assess how the new degenerate \u03c370 promoters control E. coli growth and the synthesis of specific proteins within the raspberry ketone pathway, we characterised eight \u03c370 promoters, spanning from low (1% activity relative to J23100) to high (SJM935\u2014113%) activity\u00a0(Additional file 1: Table S1). To monitor relative protein synthesis, we created a C-terminal eGFP translational fusion with the TAL, PCL and BAS proteins and monitored growth and fluorescence (Fig.\u00a03B). As expected, the strongest promoter (SJM935) gave the strongest levels of eGFP fluorescence for both TAL and BAS. However, over two independent measurements, we observed strong variability in both growth and fluorescence (Fig.\u00a03B) between the datasets for the strongest promoters (SJM935 and J23100) in contrast to more consistent growth for the low-medium strength variants. For example, some biological repeats for both SJM921-tal-eGFP and SJM921-bas-eGFP spontaneously lost GFP fluorescence during growth and demonstrated major lag times (>\u20092\u20134\u00a0h), before late exponential growth and loss of fluorescence. In addition, colonies from these clones were variable in size and smaller on average. This suggested strong promoter-gene combinations accumulate spontaneous mutations or loss of the plasmid during growth. While we did not investigate this observation in detail, we acknowledge that E. coli DH10\u03b2 has a high background mutation rate, 13.5-fold higher than MG1655 [21]\u2014the likely cause of genetic instability in response to toxicity. Intriguingly, these growth observations were also dependent on the gene studied. For example, for the PCL-eGFP fusions, while the final cell density decreased with increasing promoter strength for PCL variants, we did not observe any major variations in growth or fluorescence between biological repeats. This may be reflective of a specific level of toxicity to the system, which in the case of TAL, is likely due to depletion of L-tyrosine as a core metabolite. The case for the toxicity with single gene overexpression of bas is less clear but may be linked to differences in translation elongation/ribosome occupancy. While there was a clear trend between eGFP characterised promoter strength and fluorescence for the PCL-eGFP and BAS-eGFP fusion proteins, we were intrigued by the distinct and variable findings with TAL-eGFP (Fig.\u00a03A). Therefore, we sought to investigate the gene-eGFP fusions separately using denaturing SDS-PAGE to assess fusion protein solubility. To do this, we selected plasmid strains with either a low, medium or high-strength promoter for the tal-gfp, pcl-gfp and bas-gfp fusions and analysed intracellular proteins by denaturing PAGE (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Firstly, all GFP fusions were synthesised at the expected molecular size. Under a high-strength promoter (SJM935\u2014113%), all three fusion proteins were predominantly located in the insoluble fraction rather the soluble fraction. In particular, in comparison to TAL, the relative levels of insoluble protein for PCL and BAS decreased from the SJM935 promoter plasmids. Non-specific protein aggregation is a common issue with strong heterologous protein production in E. coli [22]. In contrast, both the low-strength (SJM942\u201418%) and medium-strength (SJM964\u201456%) promoter combinations gave major bands on SDS-PAGE for the soluble enzyme-GFP fusions (Additional file 1: Figure S4) and there was much less fusion protein observed in the insoluble fractions (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Therefore, as expected, the strongest promoters favour formation of inclusion bodies and drain resources quicker, resulting in decreased growth rates. In summary, these results confirmed that the characterisation of individual gene-fusions differ in relation to enzyme function and the state of protein folding within the cell. This is a form of context dependency, which is an increasingly important factor in the design of genetic circuits and pathways in synthetic biology [23]. Next, with this new knowledge, we set upon refactoring the pathway to optimise raspberry ketone production.Fig. 3Characterisation of promoter activity with HBA module enzymes with a C-terminal GFP translational fusion.

For example, some biological repeats for both SJM921-tal-eGFP and SJM921-bas-eGFP spontaneously lost GFP fluorescence during growth and demonstrated major lag times (>\u20092\u20134\u00a0h), before late exponential growth and loss of fluorescence. In addition, colonies from these clones were variable in size and smaller on average. This suggested strong promoter-gene combinations accumulate spontaneous mutations or loss of the plasmid during growth. While we did not investigate this observation in detail, we acknowledge that E. coli DH10\u03b2 has a high background mutation rate, 13.5-fold higher than MG1655 [21]\u2014the likely cause of genetic instability in response to toxicity. Intriguingly, these growth observations were also dependent on the gene studied. For example, for the PCL-eGFP fusions, while the final cell density decreased with increasing promoter strength for PCL variants, we did not observe any major variations in growth or fluorescence between biological repeats. This may be reflective of a specific level of toxicity to the system, which in the case of TAL, is likely due to depletion of L-tyrosine as a core metabolite. The case for the toxicity with single gene overexpression of bas is less clear but may be linked to differences in translation elongation/ribosome occupancy. While there was a clear trend between eGFP characterised promoter strength and fluorescence for the PCL-eGFP and BAS-eGFP fusion proteins, we were intrigued by the distinct and variable findings with TAL-eGFP (Fig.\u00a03A). Therefore, we sought to investigate the gene-eGFP fusions separately using denaturing SDS-PAGE to assess fusion protein solubility. To do this, we selected plasmid strains with either a low, medium or high-strength promoter for the tal-gfp, pcl-gfp and bas-gfp fusions and analysed intracellular proteins by denaturing PAGE (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Firstly, all GFP fusions were synthesised at the expected molecular size. Under a high-strength promoter (SJM935\u2014113%), all three fusion proteins were predominantly located in the insoluble fraction rather the soluble fraction. In particular, in comparison to TAL, the relative levels of insoluble protein for PCL and BAS decreased from the SJM935 promoter plasmids. Non-specific protein aggregation is a common issue with strong heterologous protein production in E. coli [22]. In contrast, both the low-strength (SJM942\u201418%) and medium-strength (SJM964\u201456%) promoter combinations gave major bands on SDS-PAGE for the soluble enzyme-GFP fusions (Additional file 1: Figure S4) and there was much less fusion protein observed in the insoluble fractions (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Therefore, as expected, the strongest promoters favour formation of inclusion bodies and drain resources quicker, resulting in decreased growth rates. In summary, these results confirmed that the characterisation of individual gene-fusions differ in relation to enzyme function and the state of protein folding within the cell. This is a form of context dependency, which is an increasingly important factor in the design of genetic circuits and pathways in synthetic biology [23]. Next, with this new knowledge, we set upon refactoring the pathway to optimise raspberry ketone production.Fig. 3Characterisation of promoter activity with HBA module enzymes with a C-terminal GFP translational fusion.

We started with a focused library to fine-tune HBA synthesis (Fig.\u00a04) applying the following rationale. Firstly, high synthesis of TAL leads to toxicity and the formation of inclusion bodies. However, since TAL has a relatively low catalytic rate and a high KM for L-Tyr, we selected six medium\u2013high strength \u03c370 promoters (SJM964, SJM926, SJM923, SJM936, SJM942, SJM933) for the tal gene. Secondly, PCL is a highly efficient enzyme, while too much inactivates the pathway. Therefore, six low-strength \u03c370 promoters (SJM940, SJM924, SJM956, SJM947, SJM952, SJM949) were paired with the pcl gene. Finally, we knew BAS was rate-limiting from all previous experiments, while high synthesis leads to formation of inclusion bodies and plasmid instability. Therefore, bas was paired with six medium\u2013high strength \u03c370 (SJM928, SJM931, SJM935, J23100, SJM937, SJM941) promoters to provide a trade-off between growth and performance. The advantage of using a focused promoter strategy is that the library can be populated with only a finite range of desirable promoter strengths, whereby the fastest growing clones (e.g., those with low-strength promoters) will not dominate within libraries. The rational selection of parts also reduced the library size from 103 in to 63. Additionally, we also included a different strong terminator (Bba_B0015, L3S1P51, L3S2P21) to minimise homologous recombination [9] and held the RBS position constant (PET-RBS). After assembly and E. coli transformation of the second library, we repeated the screening process by selecting 20 colonies displaying yellow-orange pigmentation. After growth, LC\u2013MS analysis revealed that the strains produced a wide range of p-coumarate levels (21\u2013153\u00a0\u03bcM) with strong production of both HBA (36\u201398\u00a0\u03bcM) and raspberry ketone (31\u201396\u00a0\u03bcM) (Fig.\u00a04). From sequencing, we found nine clones were duplicated within the library, but importantly, the level of the pathway intermediates between these clones were very similar. Unexpectedly, we found that clones, 6, 10, 14, and 18 contained a novel promoter sequence driving expression of the pcl gene that was not part of the characterised library. The promoter (SJM965, see Additional file 1) contained a single-base pair deletion and a novel randomised region between the -10 and -35 sequences. Sequencing data from the library was clean, suggesting this promoter must have been present at low levels, but was strongly selected for in our phenotypic screen. Interestingly, despite an average decrease in final OD600 (48\u00a0h) of 21% (range 3.7\u20134.7) in comparison to an empty vector control (OD600\u2009=\u20095.03) (Additional file 1: Figure S4), the pathways in all clones were stable based on Sanger sequencing (Additional file 1: Figure S5).

For the latter module, we aimed to increase the supply of malonate through heterologous expression of the Rhizobium trifolii matC (malonate transporter) gene in combination with matB (described earlier) under a low strength promoter in the final plasmid design. This strategy has previously been employed successfully for other flavonoid natural products [24, 25]. Additionally, we also introduced a sfGFP fluorescence reporter to monitor relative pathway stability, to act as an indicator of genetic stability [5]. To measure pathway stability and the drain of the plasmid system on general protein synthesis, we used a superfolder GFP (sfGFP) reporter, under the control of kasOp* promoter; a Streptomyces \u03c370 promoter that is strongly active in E. coli at low levels. Next, this final plasmid strain was assessed for growth and fluorescence to monitor for growth and plasmid stability (Fig.\u00a06). The relative fluorescence of the strains was very similar between individual repeats, which suggested the strains were stable. However, relative fluorescence was reduced by 70% (Fig.\u00a06) in comparison to the vector control (pTU1-A-kasOp*-sfGFP), which suggested that regardless of pathway productivity, the extra genes within the plasmid design (eight in total) cause a major drain on net protein synthesis.

Additionally, we also did separate experiments to test the effect of malonate on malonyl-CoA regeneration, but we found this was not significantly limiting for raspberry ketone production in E. coli (Additional file 1: Figure S8). This might be due to the kinetic properties of the BAS enzyme, which has a low KM (23.3\u00a0\u03bcM) for malonyl-CoA [16] and is favourable for E. coli to replace under homeostasis.
