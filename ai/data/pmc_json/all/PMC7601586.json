["The genus Streptacidiphilus represents a group of acidophilic actinobacteria within the family Streptomycetaceae, and currently encompasses 15 validly named species, which include five recent additions within the last two years. Considering the potential of the related genera within the family, namely Streptomyces and Kitasatospora, these relatively new members of the family can also be a promising source for novel secondary metabolites. At present, 15 genome data for 11 species from this genus are available, which can provide valuable information on their biology including the potential for metabolite production as well as enzymatic activities in comparison to the neighboring taxa. In this study, the genome sequences of 11 Streptacidiphilus species were subjected to the comparative analysis together with selected Streptomyces and Kitasatospora genomes. This study represents the first comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the genus Streptacidiphilus. The results indicate that the genomes of Streptacidiphilus contained various secondary metabolite (SM) producing biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), some of them exclusively identified in Streptacidiphilus only. Several of these clusters may potentially code for SMs that may have a broad range of bioactivities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial and antitumor activities. The biodegradation capabilities of Streptacidiphilus were also explored by investigating the hydrolytic enzymes for complex carbohydrates. Although all genomes were enriched with carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), their numbers in the genomes of some strains such as Streptacidiphilus carbonis NBRC 100919T were higher as compared to well-known carbohydrate degrading organisms. These distinctive features of each Streptacidiphilus species make them interesting candidates for future studies with respect to their potential for SM production and enzymatic activities.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The family Streptomycetaceae within the phylum Actinobacteria is one of the most diverse and ubiquitous soil bacterial groups [1] represented by three genera, classified as Streptomyces, Kitasatospora and Streptacidiphilus, which are closely related on phylogenetic and phenotypic aspects [2]. The representatives of this family are well-known for their roles in biodegradation (e.g., lignocellullose, chitin), secondary metabolite (SM) production and plant growth-promoting potential [3]. Among these three genera, Streptacidiphilus includes acidophilic species, and is phylogenetically more related with Kitasatospora as compared to Streptomyces [4,5]. They form branched substrate mycelia and aerial hyphae which are differentiated into long straight to flexuous chains of smooth surfaced spores. The whole-organism hydrolysates of Streptacidiphilus cell wall peptidoglycan contain LL-diaminopimelic acid (LL-DAP), a feature also observed in Streptomyces [5]. The cell wall peptidoglycan of Kitasatospora, on the other hand, contains either LL-DAP or meso-DAP in different parts of the mycelial structures [6].", "The family Streptomycetaceae within the phylum Actinobacteria is one of the most diverse and ubiquitous soil bacterial groups [1] represented by three genera, classified as Streptomyces, Kitasatospora and Streptacidiphilus, which are closely related on phylogenetic and phenotypic aspects [2].

Similarly, the genus Kitasatospora has also been the producer of several important SMs, such as setamycin, phosalacine, and endophenaside antibiotics that are mainly active against eukaryotic organisms [10,11,12,13]. Representatives of Streptomycetaceae are also considered as the key organisms in carbon recycling because of their potential to degrade biopolymers [3]. However, only Streptomyces has been the focus of study in most of these studies [14,15]. Nevertheless, the potential of Kitasatospora in the degradation of biopolymers, chitosan in soil for example, has been demonstrated in a limited number of studies [16,17]. Recently, a group of tripeptides designated acidiphilamides were discovered as the first known SMs from a representative of Streptacidiphilus, namely Streptacidiphilus rugosus AM-16T [18]. These acidiphilamides significantly inhibited cellular autophagy and highlighted the fact that under-investigated rare actinobacterial genera could serve as a good resource for novel bioactive natural products.", "Actinobacteria in general have been a great source of novel antibiotics, but the majority of these microbial compounds, such as cycloheximide [7], avermectins [8], hygromycin [9], and many others with known biological implications, have been derived from the family Streptomycetaceae, especially from Streptomyces.

About 13,376 (32%) accessory sequences were mapped to 1588 KEGG orthologs. The topmost ortholog, to which 249 sequences from the representative accessory genome were mapped, was \u201cK00059\u201d with 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] reductase (fabG, OAR1) activity. In addition to their roles in fatty acid metabolism, these reductases are also involved in the biosynthesis of prodigiosin and antibiotics (https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ko:K00059). Such enzymes are also attractive targets for the design of new antimicrobial compounds [69]. The second most abundant KEGG ortholog found in the accessory genome was again ABC-2 type transport system ATP-binding protein (\u201cK01990\u201d), to which sequences were mapped.

The large number of stkP orthologs observed in the accessory genome of Streptacidiphilus could be attributed to the fact that several eukaryotic-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (ESTPK) encoding genes have been reported from related Streptomyces. For example, the genome sequence of Str. coelicolor A3(2) led to the identification of at least 34 putative ESTPK genes [71].", "The accessory components of Streptacidiphilus genomes ranged between 1915 (S. bronchialis DSM 106435T) and 4678 (S. anmyonensis NBRC 103185T) CDS (Table 1). On average, a slightly higher percentage (~21%) of accessory genomes for each Streptacidiphilus strain were assigned to an unknown functional category (S).

While only one lanthipeptide was predicted for most clusters, multiple class II core peptides were predicted for clusters 22 and 24 (Table S4). No core peptides were predicted for clusters 13 and 33. In contrast, three lanthipeptide BGCs (clusters 8, 10 and 12) from S. bronchialis DSM 106435T were classified as those for class I lanthipeptides and predicted to have a core peptide associated with each cluster.

One sequence from Str. coelicolor A3(2) did not cluster with any of the sequences in the network and contained GH18 EndoS-like domain. This GH18 family endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase S (EndoS) is secreted by Streptococcus pyogenes and has the potential to hydrolyze the chitobiose core of asparagine-linked glycan on immunoglobulin G (IgG) [113]. The sequences in the well-defined clusters (clusters with 3 or more nodes) contained one or more domains in addition to the GH18 family domain and each cluster exhibited over-representation of certain domains. For example, several sequences of cluster 1 contained a fibronectin type 3 (FN3), or a chitin-binding domain of chitinase C (ChiC_BD) domains in addition to CBM_4_9 (annotated as CBM16 family by dbCAN) superfamily modules. In contrast, cluster 2 exhibited predominance of domains such as GH18_PF-ChiA-like, ricin-type \u03b2-trefoil lectin (ricin_B_lectin), and cellulose binding (CBM_2) domains. PF-ChiA is a chitinase present in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus with a GH18 catalytic activity. Although the catalytic residues are conserved in PF-ChiA, they mainly differ from the related GH18 family chitinases in their catalytic mechanism [114]. In addition to clusters 1 and 2, some sequences of cluster 3 also contained the FN3 domain, but the sequences in cluster 3 contained two FN3 domains instead of only one, as observed in the first two clusters. The FN3 domains are generally present between the catalytic and CBM modules [115].", "Based on amino acid sequence similarities, chitin-degrading enzymes are divided into three CAZy families (GH18, GH19 and GH20) [111]. All these enzymes were observed in all strains with the exception of S. oryzae TH49T, Str. avermitilis MA-4680T, and K. azatica KCTC 9699T, which seemed to lack chitinase from the GH19 family. Specifically, 132 GH18 family chitinases were distributed among the 11 Streptacidiphilus strains, and the number was highest in S. jeojiense NRRL B-24555T (17) and S. jiangxiensis NBRC 100920T (16). Within the genomes of known carbohydrate degraders Str. coelicolor A3(2) and Streptomyces sp. SirexAA, 12 and 10 GH18 family enzymes were present. In contrast, K. setae KM-6054T contained a maximum number of 19 GH18 enzymes among all species. When the amino acid sequences of 132 putative GH18 chitinases from Streptacidiphilus were compared with 80 chitinases from Streptomyces and Kitasatospora, the DXE catalytic motif [112] was well conserved in all these sequences despite a high degree of sequence variation (Figure S5).

Conclusions", "This study provides the first analysis of high-quality genome sequences for Streptacidiphilus, and also the first comprehensive comparative genome analysis of eleven Streptacidiphilus and representative Kitasatospora and Streptomyces species, which highlighted the potential of this genus in terms of biosynthetic as well as biodegradation capabilities. In summary, we observe that hopene represents the core BGC in the family Streptomcetaceae since it was identified in the genome of each strain used in this study. Some BGCs such as macrotetrolide were more abundant in Streptacidiphilus as compared to Streptomyces and Kitasatospora. In contrast, albaflavenone and melanin, which are highly abundant in Streptomyces, were absent in Streptacidiphilus. Based on the similarities with existing BGCs, there is a high probability that the potential SMs produced by these Streptacidiphilus strains may be novel and the expected bioactivities may cover a wide range, including antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial and antitumor activities. Similarly, some Streptacidiphilus species such as S. carbonis NBRC 100919T, S. jeojiense NRRL B-24555T, S. pinicola KCTC 49008T, and S. oryzae TH49T exhibited a higher number of genes that may have implications in biodegradation. Moreover, our pan-genome analysis suggests an open pan-genome for Streptacidiphilus and highlights that the unique genome is the least annotated as compared to the core and accessory genome. The biosynthetic gene clusters or enzymes (especially those representing the unique genome) highlighted in this study would provide a starting point to explore the genus for its full potential. With the availability of more high-quality genomes from this genus, new insights regarding the developmental processes or the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in Streptomycetaceae might be revealed in more detail.", "This study provides the first analysis of high-quality genome sequences for Streptacidiphilus, and also the first comprehensive comparative genome analysis of eleven Streptacidiphilus and representative Kitasatospora and Streptomyces species, which highlighted the potential of this genus in terms of biosynthetic as well as biodegradation capabilities.
