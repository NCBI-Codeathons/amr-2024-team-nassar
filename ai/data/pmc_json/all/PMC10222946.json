["Substantial progress has been achieved and knowledge gaps addressed in synthetic biology-mediated engineering of biological organisms to produce high-value metabolites. Bio-based products from fungi are extensively explored in the present era, attributed to their emerging importance in the industrial sector, healthcare, and food applications. The edible group of fungi and multiple fungal strains defines attractive biological resources for high-value metabolites comprising food additives, pigments, dyes, industrial chemicals, and antibiotics, including other compounds. In this direction, synthetic biology-mediated genetic chassis of fungal strains to enhance/add value to novel chemical entities of biological origin is opening new avenues in fungal biotechnology. While substantial success has been achieved in the genetic manipulation of economically viable fungi (including Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in the production of metabolites of socio-economic relevance, knowledge gaps/obstacles in fungal biology and engineering need to be remedied for complete exploitation of valuable fungal strains. Herein, the thematic article discusses the novel attributes of bio-based products from fungi and the creation of high-value engineered fungal strains to promote yield, bio-functionality, and value-addition of the metabolites of socio-economic value. Efforts have been made to discuss the existing limitations in fungal chassis and how the advances in synthetic biology provide a plausible solution.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases including neurodegenerative, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases can be addressed by adopting a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet. Different kinds of less/fat-free diets, low carbohydrate diets [1], and soy-based diets [2] including others are gaining importance and are adopted for good health, together with increased usage of functional food, nutraceuticals, and drugs to delay aging and promote well-being [3,4,5,6]. Microorganisms define a key platform to produce different kinds of high-value metabolites/food products for thousands of years, and have garnered attention in commercial initiatives, towards the bio-based production of metabolites for value addition [7]. Several decades have witnessed the consumption of fungi as functional food, majorly including edible mushrooms (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), regarded as edible delicacies and key nutritional sources, across the globe. Although several yeasts (Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Yarrowia lipolytica) and multiple fungal strains have been industrially employed to produce high-value metabolites, filamentous fungi demonstrate key properties, including presence in solid-state cultures, metabolite production, and polymers degradation, and thereby, prospects in commercial applications [8,9]. The presence of natural products in fungal species provides a defense against predators, harmful UV radiation, and competitive microbes, ensuring their survival in the ecological niche, while broad-spectrum functions prove beneficial for human health [10]. In the present era, several fungal species (including non-Basidiomycota species) are being explored and commercialized as nutraceuticals/supplements, and functional foods attributed to multiple pharmacological properties [11,12], and some well-known examples include Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium sp. The mycelia of some fungal species comprise healthy lipids, dietary fiber, vitamins, etc., and the consumption of these components defines key health advantages [13,14]. Certain filamentous fungi are used as an alternative protein source (due to higher protein contents) [13] while other species are defined as good sources of food flavors, probiotics, and healthy food lipids, respectively.
