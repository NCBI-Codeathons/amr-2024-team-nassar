["Stable adherence to epithelial surfaces is required for colonization by diverse host-associated microbes. Successful attachment of pathogenic microbes to host cells via adhesin molecules is also the first step in many devastating infections. Despite the primacy of epithelial adherence in establishing host-microbe associations, the evolutionary processes that shape this crucial interface remain enigmatic. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) encompass a multifunctional family of vertebrate cell surface proteins which are recurrent targets of bacterial adhesins at epithelial barriers. Here, we show that multiple members of the primate CEACAM family exhibit evidence of repeated natural selection at protein surfaces targeted by bacteria, consistent with pathogen-driven evolution. Divergence of CEACAM proteins between even closely related great apes is sufficient to control molecular interactions with a range of bacterial adhesins. Phylogenetic analyses further reveal that repeated gene conversion of CEACAM extracellular domains during primate divergence plays a key role in limiting bacterial adhesin host tropism. Moreover, we demonstrate that gene conversion has continued to shape CEACAM diversity within human populations, with abundant human CEACAM1 variants mediating evasion of adhesins from pathogenic Neisseria. Together this work reveals a mechanism by which gene conversion shapes first contact between microbes and animal hosts.", "eLife digest", "Trillions of bacteria live in and on the human body. Most of them are harmless but some can cause serious infections. To grow in or on the body, bacteria often attach to proteins on the surface of cells that make up the lining of tissues like the gut or the throat. In some cases, bacteria use these proteins to invade the cells causing an infection. Genetic mutations in the genes encoding these proteins that protect against infection are more likely to be passed on to future generations. This may lead to rapid spread of these beneficial genes in a population.", "A family of proteins called CEACAMs are frequent targets of infection-causing bacteria. These proteins have been shown to play a role in cancer progression. But they also play many helpful roles in the body, including helping transmit messages between cells, aiding cell growth, and helping the immune system recognize pathogens. Scientists are not sure if these multi-tasking CEACAM proteins can evolve to evade bacteria without affecting their other roles.", "Baker et al. show that CEACAM proteins targeted by bacteria have undergone rapid evolution in primates. In the experiments, human genes encoding CEACAMs were compared with equivalent genes from 19 different primates. Baker et al. found the changes in human and primate CEACAMs often occur through a process called gene conversion. Gene conversion occurs when DNA sections are copied and pasted from one gene to another. Using laboratory experiments, they showed that some of these changes enabled CEACAM proteins to prevent certain harmful bacteria from binding.", "The experiments suggest that some versions of CEACAM genes may protect humans or other primates against bacterial infections. Studies in natural populations are needed to test if this is the case. Learning more about how CEACAM proteins evolve and what they do may help scientists better understand the role they play in cancer and help improve cancer care. Studying CEACAM evolution may also help scientists understand how bacteria and other pathogens drive protein evolution in the body.", "Research organism", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Epithelial surfaces are typically the initial point of contact between metazoans and microbes (Brown and Clarke, 2017). As such, host factors at this barrier play an important role in facilitating or deterring microbial colonization. Bacterial attachment to epithelial surfaces is often mediated by a broad class of surface proteins termed adhesins (Kline et al., 2009). In addition to permitting the growth and colonization of commensal microbes, adhesins are also key virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. Adhesin-mediated adherence to host cells is often required for other downstream processes including biofilm formation, epithelial invasion, and the delivery of toxic effectors into host cells (Kline et al., 2009; Sadarangani et al., 2011; Figure 1). Microbial adherence can also trigger epithelial cell signaling cascades, further shaping host responses to resident and invasive microbes. Despite the fundamental importance of epithelial adherence for bacterial colonization and infectious disease pathogenesis, the dynamics of these interactions between host surface proteins and bacterial adhesions over evolutionary timescales remain a mystery. Theory predicts that exploitation of host proteins by pathogens places a significant burden on host populations, driving selection for beneficial mutations that limit microbial invasion or virulence. From a microbial perspective, host defenses can also pose an existential threat resulting in reciprocal adaptation to enhance colonization, growth, and transmission (Aleru and Barber, 2020; Brockhurst et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 1990; Van Valen, 1973). However, pathogens hijack many host factors not directly involved in immunity, possibly limiting their adaptive potential in response to pathogen interaction. For example, epithelial surface proteins are not only essential for interacting with the environment but also serve crucial cellular and physiological functions including barrier maintenance, cell-cell communication, as well as coordinating host physiological and developmental pathways (Kuespert et al., 2006).

One mechanism by which this could occur is through gene conversion, a form of homologous recombination in which genetic material from one location replaces sequence in a non-homologous location, often with substantial sequence similarity (Chen et al., 2007). Gene conversion can provide an important source of genetic novelty and a mechanism that can accelerate adaptation (Bittihn and Tsimring, 2017; Daugherty and Zanders, 2019; Gendreau et al., 2021). To determine if inter-locus recombination has shaped the evolution of CEACAM genes in primates, we looked for evidence of discordance between species and gene trees. Gene-species tree discordance can be an indication of multiple evolutionary processes, including a history of gene conversion between paralogs. In a maximum likelihood-based phylogeny of full-length CEACAM-coding sequences, clades containing single CEACAM paralogs were inferred with robust statistical support (Figure 4A, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). In general, the relationships between CEACAM homologs are inferred with high confidence and reflected species relationships as expected for the divergence of orthologous-coding sequences. To determine if there have been domain-specific instances of gene conversion, we constructed phylogenetic trees of individual CEACAM domains. Typically, we expect paralogs to form clearly defined clades reflecting species divergence. This is the pattern we observe for full-length CEACAM-coding sequences, indicating that overall the paralogs have remained distinct since their initial duplication and have steadily diverged between species. Specific CEACAM domain sequences generally follow this pattern (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3\u20136). However, the N-domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 deviate strikingly from this norm and form a single monophyletic group (hereafter called CCM1356), albeit one with low bootstrap support (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4). Within the CCM1356 clade we observe that rather than clustering by paralog, N-domains are split into subclades representing the three major primate lineages (Figure 4C, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4). In general, the close phylogenetic relationship of sequences within these clades is well supported. This topology suggests that these CEACAM N-domains are more similar to paralogous domains within the same species or primate lineage than they are to their respective orthologs across species. Several well-supported nodes provide further evidence that gene conversion is driving concerted evolution within the CCM1356 clade (Figure 4C). Certain pairs of N-domains, such as CEACAM3 and CEACAM1 in gorilla and CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 in orangutan, form monophyletic groups with strong bootstrap support. As these relationships are not observed for the other domains of these CEACAM proteins, this suggests conversion events affecting only the N-domains of these CEACAMs occurred in these species. New World monkeys provide the most striking phylogenetic evidence of gene conversion among primates. For each of the four New World monkey species examined, the N-domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 are all more closely related within species than to their orthologs in other species, suggesting gene conversion has independently acted on the N-domains of these three CEACAMs at least four times within this single clade (Figure 4C). These findings are consistent with N-domains of CEACAMs 1, 3, 5, and 6 undergoing widespread concerted evolution, likely facilitated by gene conversion.", "The degree of divergence within the N-domain of bonobo CEACAM1 suggests processes other than sequential accumulation of single nucleotide mutations could be responsible. One mechanism by which this could occur is through gene conversion, a form of homologous recombination in which genetic material from one location replaces sequence in a non-homologous location, often with substantial sequence similarity (Chen et al., 2007). Gene conversion can provide an important source of genetic novelty and a mechanism that can accelerate adaptation (Bittihn and Tsimring, 2017; Daugherty and Zanders, 2019; Gendreau et al., 2021). To determine if inter-locus recombination has shaped the evolution of CEACAM genes in primates, we looked for evidence of discordance between species and gene trees. Gene-species tree discordance can be an indication of multiple evolutionary processes, including a history of gene conversion between paralogs. In a maximum likelihood-based phylogeny of full-length CEACAM-coding sequences, clades containing single CEACAM paralogs were inferred with robust statistical support (Figure 4A, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). In general, the relationships between CEACAM homologs are inferred with high confidence and reflected species relationships as expected for the divergence of orthologous-coding sequences. To determine if there have been domain-specific instances of gene conversion, we constructed phylogenetic trees of individual CEACAM domains. Typically, we expect paralogs to form clearly defined clades reflecting species divergence. This is the pattern we observe for full-length CEACAM-coding sequences, indicating that overall the paralogs have remained distinct since their initial duplication and have steadily diverged between species. Specific CEACAM domain sequences generally follow this pattern (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3\u20136). However, the N-domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 deviate strikingly from this norm and form a single monophyletic group (hereafter called CCM1356), albeit one with low bootstrap support (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4). Within the CCM1356 clade we observe that rather than clustering by paralog, N-domains are split into subclades representing the three major primate lineages (Figure 4C, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4). In general, the close phylogenetic relationship of sequences within these clades is well supported. This topology suggests that these CEACAM N-domains are more similar to paralogous domains within the same species or primate lineage than they are to their respective orthologs across species. Several well-supported nodes provide further evidence that gene conversion is driving concerted evolution within the CCM1356 clade (Figure 4C). Certain pairs of N-domains, such as CEACAM3 and CEACAM1 in gorilla and CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 in orangutan, form monophyletic groups with strong bootstrap support. As these relationships are not observed for the other domains of these CEACAM proteins, this suggests conversion events affecting only the N-domains of these CEACAMs occurred in these species.

Searching population data from the Great Apes Genome Project (Prado-Martinez et al., 2013), alleles similar to bonobo CEACAM1 are not found for chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. Likewise, CEACAM1 alleles similar to those found in humans and chimpanzees are not observed in any of the bonobo genomes from the same dataset. Given the information at hand, it is difficult to precisely determine the series of mutational events that produced the bonobo CEACAM1 allele or determine the likely origin point of this allele in the diversification of hominids. However, these results are consistent with multiple independent instances of gene conversion giving rise to bonobo CEACAM1, with subsequent fixation of this haplotype in bonobo populations since their divergence from chimpanzees over the last million years.", "Given the large number of residue changes between human and bonobo CEACAM1, we next sought to determine if a subset of rapidly evolving sites are sufficient to either impair or restore recognition by bacterial adhesins. To test this, we generated CEACAM1 N-domain proteins in which a subset of residues between humans and bonobos were swapped. We focused on sites that are identical in humans and chimpanzees but differ in bonobos and which exhibit high \u03c9 across primates, resulting in a total of five tested sites (Figure 5A and B). Of these residues we chose to mutate adjacent amino acids 27\u201329 as a single group. This patch of sites is highly variable among the rapidly evolving CEACAMs, particularly CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM5 (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1). None of the \u2018humanized\u2019 mutants in the bonobo CEACAM1 background were sufficient to confer binding (Figure 5C). In contrast, introduction of bonobo residue 44 into human CEACAM1 (mutation Q44L) prevents binding by H. pylori and Opa-expressing strains, while introduction of bonobo variable sites 27\u201329 abolishes binding to Opa74 (Figure 5C). Mutation G51Q has no appreciable impact on binding by H. pylori strain G27 or Neisseria Opa74, but blocks binding by H. pylori strain Tx30a and reduces binding to J99 and Opa52. Collectively these results reveal that multiple single positions in human CEACAM1 exhibiting signatures of positive selection are sufficient to impair recognition by multiple bacterial adhesins. Moreover, these findings also demonstrate how instances of gene conversion between CEACAM paralogs could serve as large-effect adaptive mutations mediating microbial evasion.", "Given the large number of residue changes between human and bonobo CEACAM1, we next sought to determine if a subset of rapidly evolving sites are sufficient to either impair or restore recognition by bacterial adhesins.

To explore the existence of human CEACAM variants and their consequences for bacterial interactions, we queried human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and haplotype data for rapidly evolving CEACAM paralogs available from the IGSR accessed through the Ensembl genome browser (see Materials and methods). We found that variation in the N-domains of CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 predominantly consists of polymorphisms not shared with other CEACAM proteins and found on isolated haplotypes. In contrast, CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM5 N-domain variation is composed primarily of extended haplotypes (Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134). Furthermore, these extended haplotypes increase similarity between CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM5, consistent with possible gene conversion events.

The haplotype containing all three alternative alleles is the most frequent non-reference CEACAM1 haplotype annotated, occurring in 14% of the human population overall and in up to 43% of individuals in African populations (Figure 6A). In total, nearly 17% of all sequenced individuals carry at least one of these high-frequency SNPs (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2). Of the three variants, A49V and Q89H both lie within regions of CEACAM1 known to interact with bacterial adhesins suggesting they may alter bacterial adherence (Figure 6B). To determine if these high-frequency CEACAM1 polymorphisms affect bacterial recognition, we generated recombinant CEACAM1 N-domain variant proteins for use in our adhesin-binding assays.

In contrast, Neisseria Opa-expressing strains exhibit highly variable recognition of multiple human CEACAM1 variants.

Instead, sequences were first aligned in three groups: New World monkeys, leaf-eating monkeys (black-and-white colobus, black snub-nosed monkey, and golden snub-nosed monkey), and the remaining Old World monkey sequences with the hominid sequences. There were enough similarities with human exons for orthologous exon sequences to be assigned and extracted for New World monkeys and the Old World monkey/Hominid group, but not for the leaf-eating monkeys group. For leaf-eating monkeys the predicted exons in common between species in this group were extracted. After extracting coding sequences for each group individually, the extracted sequences were then aligned in a single multiple sequence alignment. However, the large gaps caused by missing IgC sequences relative to human CEACAM5 posed a problem for evolutionary analyses which require gaps to be removed from sequences prior to analysis. We were concerned that choices made regarding which sequences were removed would unduly influence the results of evolutionary analyses or result in lower coverage of the evolutionary history of the entire coding sequence. To account for this, three strategies of trimming alignment gaps were carried out and the results of each used in separate evolutionary analyses. For the first strategy (datasets 1 and 4) every species whose sequence contained gaps corresponding to missing IgC domains was removed. These species were black-and-white colobus, black snub-nosed monkey, golden snub-nosed monkey, drill, sooty mangabey, and common marmoset. This resulted in the longest sequence for analysis (2 kb) including six predicted IgC domains, but the smallest number of species represented (12). In the second strategy (datasets 2 and 5) primate sequences with gaps corresponding to the largest number of missing IgC domains (4) were removed, while those with only two missing domains were retained, and the alignment region containing the sequence gap caused by the missing domains removed, giving a smaller alignment (1.4 kb, with four IgC domains), but more species (16). For this strategy sooty mangabey, and common marmoset were removed from the analysis. For the third strategy (datasets 3 and 6) all species for which complete CEACAM5 gene sequences could be identified were retained and all gaps corresponding to missing IgC domains removed. This gave the smallest sequence (0.9 kb, retaining two IgC domains), but provided the largest number of represented species (18).

For FUBAR and initial MEME analyses, species trees of the relevant primates were provided to inform analyses of evolution. HyPhy GARD analyses (classic.datamonkey.org) were used to identify evidence of recombination and the number and approximate locations of breakpoints (Figure 2\u2014source data 1E, Figure 2\u2014source data 3; Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006). When GARD detects evidence of recombination the program splits sequence alignments at the predicted breakpoint and creates new phylogenies for each set of sequences.

The authors should refrain from the arms race analogy and focus on the CEACAM evolution without providing that as the context. The authors conclude the evolutionary pressure is due to escape from bacterial (and possibly other) pathogens but the bacterial species known to bind CEACAMs are host-adapted, opportunistic pathogens (so-called pathobionts) that do not cause significant pathology in hosts and have coevolved with their hosts. Gene conversion is a natural consequence of sequence similarity among paralogous members of a gene family, and it does not seem that special consequences for pathogen evasion need to be invoked. Instead, the presence of frequent gene conversion among members of the CEACAM family seem to indicate that maintaining some degree of sequence similarity among paralogs is beneficial, perhaps due to the role of CEACAM3 as decoy receptor. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the specific bacterium used in this study, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been associated with primates at all and how long it's been associated with humans is under debate and suggests this organism is a major driver of CEACAM evolution can be discussed but is not solid. It is more likely that one or more primordial commensal Neisseria species have been present in primates and humanoids. The authors have also ignored the phase variable nature of the Neisseria Opas and the different specificity for CEACAM orthologues.", "2. Given that the model is based on a Neisseria species, showing a spirochete form in the model figures is not accurate.", "3. In Figure 1: Do the different shades of gray in Figure 1A indicate anything? The legend simply lists gray = all other domains.", "4. In Figure 4: The colors of CEACAM 1/3/5/6 are too similar, making Figure 4C hard to interpret. Using more distinctive colors here would be helpful. Just a cladogram could be clearer here, as opposed to having both a tree with and without branch lengths (which is what appears is going on in panel C).", "5. Figure 6, panel D appears to be missing.", "6. The authors make a point of using GARD to detect recombination breakpoints and accounting for them when they run evolutionary models, e.g. on line 26, page 29. However, it is not exactly clear to me what the authors mean by a \"GARD informed phylogeny\". Could this be clarified?", "7. There have been several other papers on the role of sequence divergence in CEACAM binding, most notably Adrian et al., 2019.

The authors should refrain from the arms race analogy and focus on the CEACAM evolution without providing that as the context.", "We have modified language in the Introduction in relation to the arms race analogy (lines 37- 42).", "The authors conclude the evolutionary pressure is due to escape from bacterial (and possibly other) pathogens but the bacterial species known to bind CEACAMs are host-adapted, opportunistic pathogens (so-called pathobionts) that do not cause significant pathology in hosts and have coevolved with their hosts.", "We agree that it is difficult to make specific inferences about the particular microbes that may have driven selection in CEACAMs. We have added language to the Introduction clarifying why we believe that such microbes could drive host adaptation and also that \u201cpathobionts\u201d are not the only microbes that have been found to engage CEACAM proteins (lines 72 \u2013 78).", "Gene conversion is a natural consequence of sequence similarity among paralogous members of a gene family, and it does not seem that special consequences for pathogen evasion need to be invoked. Instead, the presence of frequent gene conversion among members of the CEACAM family seem to indicate that maintaining some degree of sequence similarity among paralogs is beneficial, perhaps due to the role of CEACAM3 as decoy receptor.", "We now explicitly discuss high sequence identity as a contributing factor for the high frequency of gene conversion observed for some CEACAMs (lines 409 \u2013 412). We have also rewritten a section of the Discussion to include a more explicit example of how exchange of amino acids between epithelial CEACAMs can alter bacterial adhesion (lines 412 \u2013 416).", "Moreover, it is uncertain whether the specific bacterium used in this study, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been associated with primates at all and how long it\u2019s been associated with humans is under debate and suggests this organism is a major driver of CEACAM evolution can be discussed but is not solid. It is more likely that one or more primordial commensal Neisseria species have been present in primates and humanoids.", "We hypothesize that CEACAM evolution has most likely been shaped by multiple microbes over millions of years, and now further elaborate on this point in the Discussion (lines 426 \u2013 429). We also explicitly state that the use of H. pylori and Neisseria adhesins in this study provides a model for how CEACAM variation can impact diverse types of adhesins, rather than making direct conclusions about the role of these particular microbes in driving host evolution (lines 426 \u2013 431). We have also modified language comparing the evolution of Opa and CEACAM proteins by gene conversion (lines 431 \u2013 434).", "The authors have also ignored the phase variable nature of the Neisseria Opas and the different specificity for CEACAM orthologues.", "We have added information on the diverse specificities of Neisseria Opa proteins to the introduction of our experimental system in the Results section (lines 174 -176). The phase variable nature of Neisseria Opa proteins was mentioned in the original draft (now lines 176 \u2013 179).", "2. Given that the model is based on a Neisseria species, showing a spirochete form in the model figures is not accurate.", "The model was meant to depict a general mechanism by which gene conversion can rapidly alter interactions with bacterial adhesins. It was our intention to depict a Helicobacter species in this model, however we agree that not only might the figures appear to depict a spirochete, but also may imply we are arguing this is a mechanism specific to interactions between a limited set of organisms. Consequently, we have changed Figures 1 and 7 to now show an image of a generic rod-shaped bacterium.", "3. In Figure 1: Do the different shades of gray in Figure 1A indicate anything? The legend simply lists gray = all other domains.", "Different shades of gray indicate different CEACAM domains. To clarify which domains are indicated by different shades we now include this information within the Figure 1 legend.", "4. In Figure 4: The colors of CEACAM 1/3/5/6 are too similar, making Figure 4C hard to interpret. Using more distinctive colors here would be helpful. Just a cladogram could be clearer here, as opposed to having both a tree with and without branch lengths (which is what appears is going on in panel C).", "In Figure 4 and Figure 4 \u2014figure supplements 2-6 we have changed the colors of CEACAM1/3/5/6 branches on phylogenetic trees to increase contrast and readability.

Figure 6, panel D appears to be missing.", "We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. The reference to a panel D in the legend refers to an earlier version of this figure. Text referring to panel D has now been removed from the Figure 6 legend.", "6. The authors make a point of using GARD to detect recombination breakpoints and accounting for them when they run evolutionary models, e.g. on line 26, page 29. However, it is not exactly clear to me what the authors mean by a \u201cGARD informed phylogeny\u201d.

There have been several other papers on the role of sequence divergence in CEACAM binding, most notably Adrian et al., 2019.
