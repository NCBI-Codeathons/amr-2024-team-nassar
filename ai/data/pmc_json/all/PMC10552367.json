["With the invasion of green tides and the increase of urban green areas worldwide, multimillion tons of Enteromorpha need to be reutilized. In this study, Enteromorpha prolifera powder is considered a promising biomass resource for the production of commercial chemical products production. Ilamycins, novel cyclic heptapeptides with significant anti-TB activities, are isolated from Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16, a deep-sea-derived strain. Using EP powder as a nitrogen source, the production of ilamycins reached 709.97\u00a0mg/L through optimization of the nitrogen source using the engineered strain S. atratus SCSIO ZH16 \u0394R. After mutant strain constructions and tests, strain S. atratus SCSIO ZH16 \u0394R::bldD EP powder achieved a higher production titer of ilamycins. Furthermore, the production titer of ilamycins and ilamycin E reached 1561.77\u00a0mg/L and 745.44\u00a0mg/L, respectively, in a 5\u00a0L bioreactor. This study suggests that E. prolifera is a promising and eco-friendly nitrogen source for the production of ilamycins.", "Supplementary Information", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13068-023-02398-w.", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13068-023-02398-w.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "In the past 10 years, severe eutrophication of seawater has resulted in the occurrence of Enteromorpha prolifera (EP) green tides, which are harmful algal blooms causing significant damage to the economy and environment of coastal cities in Asia [22]. Due to its high organic matter content and abundant production, however, EP has the potential to be used as raw materials for digestion [13]. Carbohydrates in EP exist in the polymer forms of hexose and pentose, which can be subsequently converted into bioethanol or biohydrogen [3]. EP proteins serve as a source of N-containing valuable products and nutrients for humans or animals. They can also be hydrolyzed into amino acids and subsequently converted into commercial chemical products [11]. Therefore, the efficient reutilization and disposal of EP as a source of energy and materials can help mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, only a few studies have been reported on the application of EP [11]. Actinomycetes species are renowned for the capacity to produce a multitude of high-valued product, even using waste biomass [5, 12]. Previous studies have demonstrated that S. atratus SCSIO ZH16, isolated from deep-sea sediment in the South China Sea, exhibits advantages, including rapid growth, ease of cultivation, and stable metabolism, for the production of high-value products [19, 20]. Among the natural products from S. atratus SCSIO ZH16, nonribosomal peptides ilamycins, especially ilamycin E, show brilliant anti-tuberculosis properties [9], and require yield improvement for the realization of industrial production or process.

Commonly used targets in Streptomyces genetic modification include metabolism pathways that supply or shunt the precursors, resistance proteins that protect the host, modifying factors that determine the activity of enzymes, and regulators that promote or repress secondary metabolism, etc. [6]. Among them, genetic operation towards regulatory genes is a promising approach. For example, global regulator BldD dominates the process of morphology and secondary metabolism in multiple Actinomyces, and overexpression of bldD has boosted the production of daptomycin, avermectin and moenomycin [4, 10, 17].

DNA sequencing was carried out by Azenta (Suzhou, China). To amplify the complete open reading frame (ORF) of the target gene, primer pair x-F/R was used to amplify the gene from the S. atratus genomic DNA.

This ligation generated sg-up-arm. (3) In-fusion cloning of sg-up-arm and down-arm into pKCcas9dO: the sg-up-arm and downstream homologous arm were then ligated into the pKCcas9dO vector between the SpeI and HindIII restriction sites using in-fusion cloning.
