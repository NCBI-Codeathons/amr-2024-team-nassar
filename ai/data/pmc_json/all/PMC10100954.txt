ABSTRACT Lasalocid, a representative polyether ionophore, has been successfully applied in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry and also displays promising potential for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the regulatory system governing lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we identified two conserved (lodR2 and lodR3) and one variable (lodR1, found only in Streptomyces sp. strain FXJ1.172) putative regulatory genes through a comparison of the lasalocid biosynthetic gene cluster (lod) from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 with those (las and lsd) from Streptomyces lasalocidi. Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that both lodR1 and lodR3 positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, while lodR2 plays a negative regulatory role. To unravel the regulatory mechanism, transcriptional analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) along with footprinting experiments were performed. The results revealed that LodR1 and LodR2 could bind to the intergenic regions of lodR1–lodAB and lodR2–lodED, respectively, thereby repressing the transcription of the lodAB and lodED operons, respectively. The repression of lodAB–lodC by LodR1 likely boosts lasalocid biosynthesis. Furthermore, LodR2 and LodE constitute a repressor-activator system that senses changes in intracellular lasalocid concentrations and coordinates its biosynthesis. LodR3 could directly activate the transcription of key structural genes. Comparative and parallel functional analyses of the homologous genes in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T confirmed the conserved roles of lodR2, lodE, and lodR3 in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis. Intriguingly, the variable gene locus lodR1–lodC from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 seems functionally conserved when introduced into S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T. Overall, our findings demonstrate that lasalocid biosynthesis is tightly controlled by both conserved and variable regulators, providing valuable guidance for further improving lasalocid production. IMPORTANCE Compared to its elaborated biosynthetic pathway, the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we characterize the roles of regulatory genes in lasalocid biosynthetic gene clusters of two distinct Streptomyces species and identify a conserved repressor-activator system, LodR2–LodE, which could sense changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinate its biosynthesis with self-resistance. Furthermore, in parallel, we verify that the regulatory system identified in a new Streptomyces isolate is valid in the industrial lasalocid producer and thus applicable for the construction of high-yield strains. These findings deepen our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in the production of polyether ionophores and provide novel clues for the rational design of industrial strains for scaled-up production. KEYWORDS INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Actinobacteria, as the most abundant producers of secondary metabolites, produce a variety of complex polyketides with broad-spectrum biological activities (1). Among them, polyether ionophores are a unique class of type I polyketides featuring distinctive tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran rings and are produced exclusively by actinobacteria. These polyketides have been successfully used in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry for more than half a century. Furthermore, they also display promising biological properties, including antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities (2). The intriguing activities of ionophore agents can be attributed to their ability to chelate metal cations to form lipid-soluble complexes. These complexes facilitate cation transport across plasma membranes, resulting in membrane depolarization and subsequent cell damage or death (2, 3). Lasalocid (4), one of the seven currently marketed carboxylic polyether ionophores, has been validated as a classical anticoccidial drug for poultry and a growth promoter in ruminants (5, 6). Lasalocid selectively inhibits intracellular sporozoites while remaining relatively noninjurious to the host cell, and it has biased antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas most Gram-negative strains are still refractory (7). Recently, this ionophore has been verified as a novel inhibitor that protects cells from multiple deadly bacterial toxins via corrupting vesicular trafficking and Golgi stack homeostasis (8). Moreover, lasalocid and its synthetic analogs have shown high antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines and, simultaneously, lower cytotoxicity toward nontumor cells than cisplatin, which hints at their potential to be developed as candidates for cancer treatment (2, 3, 9, 10).

Given the broad-spectrum bioactivities and promising applications of polyether ionophores, increasing numbers of studies have been performed on the regulation of their biosynthesis. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of nigericin (nig) and salinomycin (sln) both contain a single pathway-specific regulatory gene, and the overexpression of these genes greatly enhanced the production of the corresponding polyether ionophores (11, 12). Unlike nig and sln, the BGCs of monensin (mon) and nanchangmycin (nan) each contain multiple regulatory genes that encode regulators belonging to diverse families, including LAL (large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family), SARP (Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins), TetR, and AraC. These regulators form complex coregulatory cascades governing the biosynthesis of monensin and nanchangmycin (13, 14). In addition to the above-mentioned cluster-situated regulators (CSRs), the global transcriptional regulator DasR has also been proven to increase monensin production in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (15). However, although the biosynthetic pathway for lasalocid has been well elucidated (16), the regulatory mechanism in lasalocid production remains obscure, which hinders its titer improvement and further industrialization. Meanwhile, comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses have revealed that even BGCs encoding the same molecule may vary in both gene content and organization (17–19). These homologous BGCs normally keep conserved biosynthetic genes and relatively variable regulatory genes, the latter of which promote BGC diversification and can serve as evolutionary evidence (20, 21). Several BGCs for polyether ionophores have been identified, while little is known about their regulatory diversification. Comparative dissection of their regulation systems may provide valuable insights into the evolution of these BGCs.

Several BGCs for polyether ionophores have been identified, while little is known about their regulatory diversification. Comparative dissection of their regulation systems may provide valuable insights into the evolution of these BGCs. To date, lasalocid BGCs have been cloned from two closely related strains of Streptomyces lasalocidi, ATCC 31180T (las) and ATCC 35851 (lsd) (22, 23), and were recently discovered from a potential novel species represented by red soil-derived Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (lod) (24–26). Here, to elucidate the pathway-specific regulatory mechanism in lasalocid biosynthesis, we conducted comparative and parallel functional analyses of the regulatory genes from different lasalocid BGCs. Compared to las and lsd, the lod cluster contains an exclusive regulatory gene, lodR1, in addition to the conserved lodR2 and lodR3 genes that are universal in the reported lasalocid BGCs. We reveal that both the variable and conserved regulatory genes are functional in different lasalocid BGCs, providing evidence for regulatory diversification. We also identified a conserved repressor-activator system composed of LodR2/Las3/Lsd6–7 (unless otherwise specified, the dash indicates a range) and LodE/Las2/Lsd5, which is important for the control of lasalocid concentrations at appropriate levels in the producers.

RESULTS RESULTS Comparison of the lasalocid BGCs from Streptomyces. Comparison of the lasalocid BGCs from Streptomyces. Comparison of the lasalocid BGCs from Streptomyces. In our previous study, we identified a 76,167-bp putative lasalocid gene cluster (lod [GenBank accession number KT591188]) from the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (26). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the cluster contains 22 open reading frames (ORFs), designated lodA–lodT. In this study, to unravel the regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species, we first compared lod with the other two lasalocid gene clusters (las and lsd from S. lasalocidi strains). The results showed that all three BGCs share highly conserved biosynthetic genes and two regulatory genes (lodR2 and lodR3) that encode MarR and LuxR family regulators, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Intriguingly, lod contains four exclusive ORFs: lodR1, encoding a TetR family regulator; lodA, encoding a protein with domains of unknown functions; lodB, encoding a monooxygenase; and lodC, encoding a 3-oxoacyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) synthase that is much longer than its putative homologs encoded by orf09 in las and lsd3 in lsd (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This result illustrates the diversity of lasalocid BGCs in Streptomyces, notably the diversity of their regulatory elements.

FXJ1.172, including a variable gene (lodR1) and two conserved ones (lodR2 and lodR3). To verify the functions of these genes, we constructed their mutants by disruptive in-frame deletions in the Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 wild type (FXJ1.172-WT) and designated them ΔlodR1, ΔlodR2, and ΔlodR3, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the culture extracts from these mutants revealed a substantial loss of lasalocid production in the ΔlodR1 mutant and a complete loss in the ΔlodR3 mutant but a moderate increase in the ΔlodR2 mutant (Fig. 2). Complementation with lodR1, lodR2, and lodR3 (inserted into pSET152 and driven by PkasO*) in the corresponding mutants partially or completely restored lasalocid production (Fig. 2). These results indicate that lodR1 and lodR3 positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, while lodR2 plays a negative regulatory role.

FXJ1.172 seems to act similarly when introduced into S. lasalocidi.

LodR1 positively regulates lasalocid biosynthesis by repressing the expression of adjacent lodA–lodC, and this variable system of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 seems to act similarly when introduced into S. lasalocidi. The variable gene lodR1 encodes a transcriptional regulator belonging to the TetR family, members of which are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and the export of secondary metabolites (27, 28). To unveil the regulatory mechanism of LodR1, we performed transcriptional analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and DNase I footprinting experiments. Cotranscriptional analysis of lod by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed the existence of at least five transcriptional units (lodAB, lodED, lodR2–F, lodH–P, and lodST) and four individually transcribed genes (lodR1, lodC, lodG, and lodQ) (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that lodR2 was cotranscribed with lodR3 and lodF in one operon. Next, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted to investigate the effect of lodR1 disruption on lasalocid biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. Total RNAs of FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodR1 mutant were isolated at days 3 to 5. These time points were selected because lasalocid was initially detected in FXJ1.172-WT on the third day of fermentation, followed by a substantial increase in production over the next 2 days (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Compared to that in FXJ1.172-WT, the transcription of lodA–lodC was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig. 3B), implying that LodR1 negatively regulates lodA–lodC. In contrast, the transcript levels of the structural genes (lodF, lodG, lodH–P, and lodST) were decreased in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig. 3B). To determine the target genes of LodR1, EMSAs were performed with all potential interoperonic promoters indicated in Fig. 3A and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 (a possible intraoperonic promoter may exist in this region of over 500 bp in length). Recombinant protein LodR1-His6 was purified from Escherichia coli C41(DE3) containing expression plasmid pET23b::lodR1. The result showed that LodR1 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR1–lodA (PR1–A) rather than to the other promoter regions in lod or the promoter region of hrdB (Fig. 4A and Fig. S2). LodR1 comprises an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain and shows high identity to SCO6121 from Streptomyces coelicolor and SVEN_3912 from Streptomyces venezuelae (both with 88% identity). To investigate the potential substrate of the ligand-binding domain in LodR1, EMSAs were performed with PR1–A in the presence of different antibiotics (including lasalocid as the most probable ligand and other antibiotics with structural diversity, such as ampicillin, apramycin, and chloromycetin). Yet no perturbation of the DNA-binding activity of LodR1 was observed (data not shown), indicating that these antibiotics are not ligands of LodR1. To further elucidate the exact DNA-binding sites of LodR1, DNase I footprinting was carried out with probe PR1–A. The results showed that LodR1 protected a region from nucleotide (nt) −52 to nt +38 relative to the lodA transcription start point (TSP) (Fig. 4B). Analysis of this region identified a conserved recognition sequence (5′-CTAGCGTTGC-3′) forming a palindromic structure near the lodA TSP (Fig. 4C). Together, these data suggest that LodR1 directly represses the expression of lodAB. As lodC was not cotranscribed with lodAB and its intergenic region with lodB could not be recognized by LodR1, the increase in the lodC transcript level in the ΔlodR1 mutant is likely due to the indirect repression of lodC by LodR1.

Although the lodR1–lodC locus was found only in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, we speculate that it might also function in heterologous lasalocid producers. To test this speculation, the lodA–lodC and lodR1–lodC loci were heterologously expressed in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T to generate strains 31180-KABC and 31180-R1ABC, respectively. As expected, the constitutive expression of lodA–lodC resulted in a dramatic decrease in lasalocid production in 31180-KABC (Fig. 4D). In contrast, lasalocid production in 31180-R1ABC was comparable to that in the WT strain, which might be attributed to the inhibition of lodA–lodC expression by LodR1. These findings suggest that the variable genes lodR1 and lodA–lodC seem to function conservatively in lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species.

LodR2 and LodE constitute a conserved repressor-activator system that senses changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinates its biosynthesis. LodR2 and LodE constitute a conserved repressor-activator system that senses changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinates its biosynthesis. LodR2 and LodE constitute a conserved repressor-activator system that senses changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinates its biosynthesis. The regulatory protein encoded by lodR2 contains DNA-binding domains with a characteristic winged helix-turn-helix fold that is conserved in the MarR family of transcriptional regulators (29). As a common feature of MarR members, these regulators can interact with specific ligands to modulate the DNA-binding affinity, thus regulating the transcription of their cognate genes (30). LodR2 exhibits extremely high identity (93%) to its homologs Las3 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd6–7 (which should be an intact ORF but was likely interrupted and split into two truncated ORFs by misannotation) from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table 1), suggesting a conserved role of this MarR regulator in lasalocid biosynthesis. To functionally characterize the regulatory role of LodR2, experiments similar to those described above for LodR1 were carried out. RT-qPCR results showed that the transcript levels of lodR3 and all of the structural genes were significantly increased in the ΔlodR2 mutant compared to those in FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 3B). This finding indicates that LodR3 may activate the expression of structural genes. Meanwhile, the transcription of lodED was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR2 mutant, indicating that LodR2 negatively regulates lodED. EMSAs of LodR2-His6 with all potential interoperonic promoters and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 also proved that LodR2 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR2–lodE (Fig. 5A and Fig. S2). Footprinting showed that LodR2 protected a region from nt −65 to nt +88 relative to the lodE TSP (Fig. 5B). There is a conserved sequence, 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G), in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region, forming a palindromic structure near the TSP of lodR2 (Fig. 5C). MarR family regulators, especially the cluster-situated ones, commonly have ligand-binding domains. To test whether the DNA-binding activity of LodR2 is modulated by lasalocid, EMSAs in the presence of different antibiotics were performed. The addition of lasalocid led to the dissociation of LodR2 from PR2–E, while the addition of the other antibiotics tested showed no effect on LodR2 (Fig. 5D), indicating that lasalocid interacts specifically with LodR2 and abolishes its DNA-binding activity.

As the ΔlodR2 mutant exhibited enhanced lasalocid production and LodR2 directly repressed the transcription of lodED (Fig. 2 and 3 and Fig. 5A to C), it was suggested that the proteins encoded by lodED could activate lasalocid biosynthesis. Based on the proposed functions of lodE and lodD (Table 1), we speculate that lodE (encoding a putative resistance protein) is vital for lasalocid biosynthesis. To test our assumption, a lodE mutant (ΔlodE) was constructed by disruptive in-frame deletion. Compared to FXJ1.172-WT, the ΔlodE mutant produced much less lasalocid (Fig. 5E), which was consistent with the significantly decreased transcription of the structural genes lodF–lodS in this mutant (Fig. 3B). Sequence alignment indicated that LodE belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters with relatively high protein similarity to MonT (53% identity), a putative efflux protein responsible for self-resistance to monensin in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (31). To ascertain whether LodE acts as a transporter of lasalocid, we compared the intracellular and extracellular distributions of lasalocid in FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant. As expected, the ratio of intracellular/extracellular lasalocid concentrations of the ΔlodE mutant was significantly higher than that of FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 5F), confirming that LodE is a transporter of lasalocid. Moreover, FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant had comparable growth rates and biomasses (Fig. S3), excluding the possible effect of the growth perturbation of the mutant on lasalocid production.

As the ΔlodR2 mutant exhibited enhanced lasalocid production and LodR2 directly repressed the transcription of lodED (Fig. 2 and 3 and Fig. 5A to C), it was suggested that the proteins encoded by lodED could activate lasalocid biosynthesis. Based on the proposed functions of lodE and lodD (Table 1), we speculate that lodE (encoding a putative resistance protein) is vital for lasalocid biosynthesis. To test our assumption, a lodE mutant (ΔlodE) was constructed by disruptive in-frame deletion. Compared to FXJ1.172-WT, the ΔlodE mutant produced much less lasalocid (Fig. 5E), which was consistent with the significantly decreased transcription of the structural genes lodF–lodS in this mutant (Fig. 3B). Sequence alignment indicated that LodE belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters with relatively high protein similarity to MonT (53% identity), a putative efflux protein responsible for self-resistance to monensin in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (31). To ascertain whether LodE acts as a transporter of lasalocid, we compared the intracellular and extracellular distributions of lasalocid in FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant. As expected, the ratio of intracellular/extracellular lasalocid concentrations of the ΔlodE mutant was significantly higher than that of FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 5F), confirming that LodE is a transporter of lasalocid. Moreover, FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant had comparable growth rates and biomasses (Fig. S3), excluding the possible effect of the growth perturbation of the mutant on lasalocid production. LodR3 positively regulates the expression of key structural genes in lod. LodR3 positively regulates the expression of key structural genes in lod. LodR3 positively regulates the expression of key structural genes in lod. The third regulatory gene, lodR3, encodes a prototypical LuxR family transcriptional regulator containing an N-terminal ATPase domain and a putative C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The ATPase-associated LuxR regulators are usually involved in antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces (32). LodR3 shows strong sequence identity (80%) to both Las4 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd8 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table 1). RT-qPCR analysis supported the above-mentioned result that LodR3 could positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis. Very few transcripts of the structural genes were detected in the ΔlodR3 mutant compared to FXJ1.172-WT (Fig. 3B), indicating that LodR3 is essential for initiating the transcription of the key structural genes. Unfortunately, all efforts to express soluble LodR3-His6 were unsuccessful. Thus, gusA transcriptional fusion assays were performed to determine the potential target genes of LodR3 as previously described (33). According to the results of the cotranscriptional analysis mentioned above (Fig. 3A), the putative promoters of lodC, lodG, lodH, lodQ, lodS, and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 were tested using Streptomyces coelicolor M1146 as a host (Fig. 6A). As a result, blue color was detected in S. coelicolor M1146 derivatives containing lodR3 driven by PkasO* and gusA driven by the above-mentioned promoters except for the lodC promoter (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that lodR3 may have its own promoter in the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 in addition to cotranscription with lodR2. It also suggests that the promoters of lodR3, lodG, lodH, lodQ, and lodS are the targets of LodR3 and that LodR3 can therefore directly activate the transcription of lodR3–F, lodG, lodH–P, lodQ, and lodST.

Comparative and parallel functional analyses confirmed the conserved roles of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 homologs in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi. Comparative and parallel functional analyses confirmed the conserved roles of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 homologs in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi. Comparative and parallel functional analyses confirmed the conserved roles of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 homologs in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi. S. lasalocidi strains are used as industrially valuable lasalocid producers, and thus, the regulatory mechanism of their lasalocid biosynthesis is worth dissecting for the construction of high-yield strains. As las and lsd are very similar clusters from the same species, we then selected las (which is from the publicly available S. lasalocidi type strain) to compare the functions of its regulatory genes with those in lod. Homologs of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 were identified in las, which have been designated las2, las3, and las4, respectively (22). To verify the role of these genes in lasalocid biosynthesis, the corresponding disruption mutants (Δlas2, Δlas3, and Δlas4) were constructed from the S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT). Compared to that of 31180-WT, the lasalocid yield of the Δlas2 mutant was greatly reduced (from 33.8 to 4.7 mg/L), and that of the Δlas3 mutant was increased (from 33.8 to 112.5 mg/L), while lasalocid was no longer detected in the Δlas4 mutant (Fig. 7A). Complementation with the genes in the disruption mutants restored the yields (Fig. 7A). To verify the functional conservation of las4 and its homolog lodR3, cross-complementation of the two genes was conducted. As a result, both the ΔlodR3 mutant cross-complemented with las4 and the Δlas4 mutant cross-complemented with lodR3 could restore lasalocid production to the level of the WT strains (Fig. 7B). Cotranscriptional analysis of las revealed the existence of at least four transcriptional units (las1–2, las3–5, lasAI–lasAVII, and lasCB) and two individual transcriptional genes (las6 and las7) (Fig. S4). Similar to their homologs in lod, las3–5 form a single operon. Likewise, RT-qPCR analysis of las genes in 31180-WT and the disruption mutants displayed transcriptional patterns similar to those observed for lod genes in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (Fig. 7C). Moreover, soluble Las3-His6 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the expression plasmid pET28a::las3. Next, EMSAs and footprinting assays were performed to determine its target genes and binding sequences. As expected, Las3-His6 formed complexes with the intergenic region of las2–las3 and protected a region from nt −44 to nt +11 relative to the las2 TSP (Fig. 7D). Analysis of the binding sites revealed an 8-bp palindromic sequence near the las2 TSP (consensus, 5′-CATTMRTT-3′ [where M is C or A and R is A or G]) (Fig. 7D), which is similar to the 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G) sequence found in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. All of these results are consistent with those for Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in the two species. Based on the above-described regulatory studies, high-yield lasalocid-producing strains were constructed by overexpressing las4 in the Δlas3 mutant via a multicopy vector, pKC1139::PkasO*las4, or a single-site integrative vector, pSET152::PkasO*las4. The resultant mutants, Δlas3-1139-las4OE and Δlas3-152-las4OE, enhanced their lasalocid yields by 5.1 and 6.8 times, respectively, compared to 31180-WT (Fig. 7A). Overall, by the simultaneous disruption of the negative regulatory gene las3 and the overexpression of the positive regulatory gene las4, we obtained high-yield strains with lasalocid production of up to 230 mg/L. S. lasalocidi strains are used as industrially valuable lasalocid producers, and thus, the regulatory mechanism of their lasalocid biosynthesis is worth dissecting for the construction of high-yield strains.

DISCUSSION DISCUSSION Multiple regulatory genes coexist in lasalocid BGCs, but they may not form the complex coregulatory cascade process seen in the biosynthesis of monensin and nanchangmycin (13, 14). Our results reveal that lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species is controlled by one variable and two conserved regulatory systems, providing an understanding of the regulatory diversification and mechanism. To our surprise, no intact homologs of lodR1–lodC were identified in the NCBI nucleotide database. The presence of this variable locus in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 could be partially ascribed to the divergent evolution of the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis among streptomycetes. The distant phylogenetic relationship between Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and S. lasalocidi (96.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and 81.7% genome-wide average nucleotide identity) (24) and their disparate soil origins, red soil in China (25) and park soil in the United States (34), respectively, both support the divergent-evolution hypothesis. Nevertheless, more lasalocid BGCs are needed to reconstruct an evolutionary roadmap of the biosynthesis regulation of this polyether. The lsd2 gene, encoding a putative IclR family protein (23), might also have a regulatory role in lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851, albeit the whole sequence of lsd needs to be confirmed by genome sequencing. It was unexpected that the constitutive heterologous expression of lodA–lodC from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 also resulted in the diminished production of lasalocid in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T. This result suggests that these ORFs exclusive to lod can play a general role in the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species. Although we attributed the undisturbed lasalocid production in the mutant strain 31180-R1ABC to the inhibition of lodA–lodC expression by LodR1, we cannot exclude another possibility, that all of these genes are not well expressed in the heterologous host, and more details are needed to further check whether the repression of the expression of lodA–lodC by LodR1 is functionally conserved in S. lasalocidi. Additionally, based on their proposed roles (Table 1), we presumed that lodA–lodC might be involved in the biosynthesis of an unknown molecule, which shares substrates with lasalocid biosynthesis, thus leading to the reduced production of lasalocid. However, no additional metabolites were detected in S. coelicolor M1146 or S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T derivatives containing heterologously expressed lodA–lodC (data not shown). Notably, S. lasalocidi has only about 1/3 of LodC encoded within its lasalocid BGC, which keeps only a residue of the conserved domain found in LodC and thus looks like a truncated and useless protein (Table 1). Our further work will focus on functional analyses of lodA, lodB, and lodC to determine how much of the reduced lasalocid production in different strains is due to lodAB versus lodC and to uncover their repression mechanism in lasalocid biosynthesis. Multiple regulatory genes coexist in lasalocid BGCs, but they may not form the complex coregulatory cascade process seen in the biosynthesis of monensin and nanchangmycin (13, 14).

Our further work will focus on functional analyses of lodA, lodB, and lodC to determine how much of the reduced lasalocid production in different strains is due to lodAB versus lodC and to uncover their repression mechanism in lasalocid biosynthesis. CSRs are often pathway-specific regulators that function as switches controlling the onset of antibiotic production (32). We used the consensus binding sequences found for LodR1 and LodR2 as queries for a local BLAST search against the genomes of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T, and we identified no other homologs. Thus, these regulators may not bind to the promoter regions of other genes, indicating that they tend to function as pathway-specific regulators instead of pleiotropic regulators. Nevertheless, antibiotics as well as their intermediates from the biosynthetic pathways can also modulate the activity of their cognate CSRs (35). This generates feedback regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis, which is important for self-protection against the overproduction of antibiotics (32, 36, 37). In this study, we demonstrate that lasalocid specifically binds to the MarR family transcription repressor LodR2 and causes its dissociation from the promoter region of lodR2–lodE (Fig. 5B), thus activating the transcription of lodE. This finding coincides with the defining feature of MarR family regulators: they normally respond to specific ligands, resulting in attenuated DNA-binding activity and often the derepression of target gene transcription (38). Recently, a polyether antibiotic, calcimycin, has also been proven to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of its cognate CSR CalR3, which subsequently initiates the expression of the calcimycin transporter-encoding gene calT (39). Our results further verify that polyether antibiotics can act as modulating ligands of their cognate CSRs, and more polyether ionophores should be used to test the ligand-binding specificity of LodR2 in future studies. The transporter LodE is also crucial for lasalocid biosynthesis because disruption of lodE results in reduced lasalocid production and an increased ratio of intracellular/extracellular lasalocid concentrations. It is noteworthy that the residual production of lasalocid in the ΔlodE mutant implies the existence of other efflux systems in the producer strain, as seen in the salinomycin producer Streptomyces albus BK3-25 (40). Intriguingly, the ΔlodE mutant has an intracellular level of lasalocid equivalent to that of FXJ1.172-WT at day 4 but exhibits a greatly reduced transcriptional profile (Fig. 3B and Fig. 5F). A possible explanation for these differences observed is as follows. Lasalocid acts as an ionophore antibiotic, which facilitates cation transport across plasma membranes. Although the intracellular concentration of the lodE mutant is similar to that of FXJ1.172-WT at day 4, there are still significant differences between the intracellular and extracellular lasalocid concentrations in the ΔlodE mutant. This may lead to the imbalance of ions across the membrane and subsequent cell damage. The cells may sense the changes in ion concentrations and thus downregulate the expression of lod to avoid self-damage. Additional transcriptome analysis will help to explain this confusing phenomenon that we observed.

Additional transcriptome analysis will help to explain this confusing phenomenon that we observed. The distribution of highly similar homologs of lodR2–lodE in the other reported lasalocid BGCs highlights their indispensable role in the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis. Furthermore, lodE homologs are also present in other polyether ionophore BGCs, i.e., idmC, monT, and ladT (with 67 to 69% nucleotide sequence identities to lodE) from the indanomycin, monensin, and laidlomycin (a monensin analog) gene clusters, respectively (31, 41, 42). Analogous to lodE coupled with lodR2, each of these homologous genes is flanked by a gene encoding a TetR/MarR family regulator (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). This observation indicates that similar regulatory systems may be widespread in different polyether producers. Hence, the disruption of these TetR/MarR family regulator-encoding genes or the overexpression of lodE homologs is potentially applicable for generating valuable polyether-overproducing mutants.

The large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family (LALs) often serve as CSRs in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces (32). Recently, a LAL member named SlnR was identified as a positive pathway-specific regulator in Streptomyces albus for the biosynthesis of salinomycin, another marketed carboxylic polyether ionophore (11). Akin to how SlnR modulates salinomycin biosynthesis by activating the transcription of most of the structural genes, LodR3 is essential for the transcription of genes responsible for the formation of the lasalocid skeleton (Fig. 6B). Based on the results of gusA assays and cotranscriptional analyses, lodR3 may be dually controlled by itself and lodR2. The high sequence identity between lodR3 and las4 suggests the conserved role of this regulatory system in lasalocid biosynthesis, which is confirmed by the results of cross-complementation (Fig. 7B). Noticeably, both lodR3 and las4 contain rare TTA codons, suggesting that their expression may rely on the Streptomyces development-associated gene bldA, which encodes a tRNA for a rare leucine codon, UUA (43).

Taken together, we propose a plausible regulatory model for lasalocid biosynthesis (Fig. 8). In the early stage of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 growth, LodR2 specifically binds to the bidirectional promoter region between lodR2 and lodE, inhibiting the transcription of these two genes and part of lodR3. Meanwhile, lodR3 has a separate promoter of its own, and LodR3 can initiate the transcription of most structural genes, leading to the production of lasalocid. When lasalocid accumulates and reaches a certain threshold in the cells, its allosteric interaction with LodR2 induces a conformational change, causing the dissociation of LodR2 from the lodE promoter region. Subsequently, the strong expression of lodE, which encodes an antibiotic efflux pump, results in a drop in the intracellular lasalocid concentration and then the continuous production of lasalocid. Thus, with the LodR2–LodE system, the concentration of lasalocid in the producing strain is controlled at an appropriate level to avoid self-inhibition. Moreover, LodR1 positively regulates lasalocid biosynthesis by repressing the expression of adjacent lodA–lodC, which seems to serve as an alternative regulatory system in addition to the conserved LodR2-LodE and LodR3 systems. In addition, a previously neglected gene, lodQ (homologous to las7), was unexpectedly identified as a putative target gene of LodR3 in gusA transcriptional fusion assays (Fig. 6B). lodQ (las7) encodes a hypothetical protein with no proposed function in lasalocid biosynthesis. However, the disruption of las7 led to a remarkable decrease in lasalocid production in S. lasalocidi (Minghao Liu, Kairui Wang, and Ying Huang, unpublished data), implying an important role of lodQ/las7 in lasalocid biosynthesis. Thus, the detailed function of lodQ/las7 deserves further investigation. Based on our results, multiple genetic modifications can be performed to further improve lasalocid yields. These may include the overexpression of odR3 (las4 or lsd8), lodE (las2 or lsd5), and dasR-like positive pleiotropic regulatory genes in a ΔlodR2 (Δlas3 or Δlsd6–7) mutant.

Nucleic acid manipulations were performed using standard procedures for E. coli (45) and Streptomyces (46) and according to the instructions of the manufacturers of the restriction enzymes and kits. The lasalocid BGC sequences and genome sequences of Streptomyces were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. The Streptomyces mutant strains were constructed from wild-type strains by gene replacement via homologous recombination as previously described (26, 47). For the genetic complementation of lodR1, a DNA fragment carrying the lodR1 ORF was amplified by PCR using primers lodR1-orf-F and lodR1-orf-R (Table S3). The PCR product was gel purified and then ligated with EcoRV-digested pSET152 and a strong constitutive promoter, PkasO*, by Gibson assembly to give plasmid pSET152::PkasO*lodR1C. The recombinant plasmid was subsequently introduced into the lodR1 mutant (ΔlodR1) via conjugation to generate the ΔlodR1C complemented strain. Other complemented strains and heterologous-expression strains were constructed similarly. The primers used in this study are listed in Table S3.

The PCR product was gel purified and then ligated with EcoRV-digested pSET152 and a strong constitutive promoter, PkasO*, by Gibson assembly to give plasmid pSET152::PkasO*lodR1C. The recombinant plasmid was subsequently introduced into the lodR1 mutant (ΔlodR1) via conjugation to generate the ΔlodR1C complemented strain.
