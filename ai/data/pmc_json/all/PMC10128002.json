Here, we show that the frequency of spontaneous PHZ-resistant mutants in Sinorhizobium meliloti is below the detection limit. We find that PHZ can enter S. meliloti cells through two distinct promiscuous peptide transporters, BacA and YejABEF, which belong to the SLiPT (SbmA-like peptide transporter) and ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter families, respectively. The dual-uptake mode explains the lack of observed resistance acquisition because the simultaneous inactivation of both transporters is necessary for resistance to PHZ. Since both BacA and YejABEF are essential for the development of functional symbiosis of S. meliloti with leguminous plants, the unlikely acquisition of PHZ resistance via the inactivation of these transporters is further disfavored. A whole-genome transposon sequencing screen did not reveal additional genes that can provide strong PHZ resistance when inactivated. However, it was found that the capsular polysaccharide KPS, the novel putative envelope polysaccharide PPP (PHZ-protecting polysaccharide), as well as the peptidoglycan layer jointly contribute to the sensitivity of S. meliloti to PHZ, most likely serving as barriers that reduce the amount of PHZ transported inside the cell.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Molecules of a peptidic nature constitute a considerable part of the known diversity of natural compounds with antimicrobial activity (1). The passage of intracellularly acting peptidic antibiotics through the cell envelope is a key step limiting their concentration inside the cell (2, 3). In Gram-negative bacteria, intracellularly acting peptidic antibiotics commonly cross the outer membrane via porins or TonB-ExbBD-dependent transporters and then rely on nonspecific peptide transporters for passage through the inner membrane (4, 5). Multiple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) cross the inner membrane through peptide/H+ symporters similar to Escherichia coli SbmA (SLiPTs [SbmA-like peptide transporters]) (6). Several others cross the inner membrane via an unrelated ATP-binding cassette (ABC) importer, YejABEF, which is powered by ATP hydrolysis (4, 7, 8). Bacteria can pump out internalized peptidic antibiotics with the help of TolC-dependent efflux pumps, thus countering uptake and enhancing resistance (4, 5, 9).", "Molecules of a peptidic nature constitute a considerable part of the known diversity of natural compounds with antimicrobial activity (1).

PHZ belongs to a class of natural products known as ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) (12, 13). PHZ contains eight azole cycles installed into the structure of a precursor peptide through the cyclization of Ser and Cys residues by specific enzymes (Fig.\u00a01A). PHZ is a translation inhibitor and prevents, at low-micromolar concentrations, the growth of bacteria from the Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium genera (10). Active export by the specific pump PhzE confers self-resistance to PHZ in the producing strain (10). Pop5 is a soil bacterium that establishes a symbiotic relationship with the legume Phaseolus vulgaris.

Thus, PHZ provides another example of an azole-containing molecule internalized through a SLiPT. The exact mechanism of peptide recognition by SLiPTs is still unknown. Available SLiPT structures reveal a large cavity where structurally unrelated AMPs are thought to bind (6). The large size of the likely ligand-binding site explains the observed promiscuity of SLiPTs, which can also transport a number of other natural (19\u201322) and artificially designed (23) peptidic substrates.", "In E. coli, YejABEF is the only point of entry for microcin C, a heptapeptidyl-nucleotide antibiotic targeting aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (8).

In parallel, the growth of pure cultures of each strain was monitored. Culture aliquots were withdrawn at the start and every 24\u2009h afterward and used for CFU counting on tetracycline- or streptomycin-containing medium (Fig.\u00a02B and Fig.\u00a0S3B). After 24\u2009h of cocultivation, the number of CFU per milliliter of Sm1021 dropped by almost 4 orders of magnitude. No increase in the number of S. meliloti CFU per milliliter was observed afterward, while the number of Pop5 CFU per milliliter continued to increase. In contrast, for mixed cultures containing either transporter-deficient Sm1021 \u0394bacA \u03a9yejA or non-PHZ-producing Pop5 \u03a9phzD, the numbers of CFU per milliliter on both selective media increased ~10-fold during the first 24\u2009h of cultivation and remained stable afterward. We conclude that the transporter-deficient strain avoids the action of PHZ produced by Pop5, while the growth of PHZ-susceptible wt Sm1021 is efficiently inhibited. The differences in total cell counts (by flow cytometry) and viable cell counts (CFU) suggest that PHZ-affected bacterial cells persist in the coculture after the loss of viability.", "The production of an unrelated antirhizobial RiPP, trifolitoxin, was shown to enhance the competitiveness of its producer, Rhizobium anhuiense bv. trifolii T24, in root colonization and the occupancy of nodules (36, 37).

Notably, the adenylate cyclase gene cyaA (smc00339) is strongly depleted in our PHZ screen (Fig.\u00a05A). Thus, the identification in our screens of the polysaccharide biosynthetic genes and polysaccharide synthesis regulatory genes tolC, phoRUB, relA, and cyaA points to a role of surface polymers in PHZ resistance. While S. meliloti has the genetic potential for the production of a variety of surface polysaccharides (48), we propose that the positively or negatively selected mutations in regulatory genes are involved in PHZ resistance/sensitivity by affecting the production of the PPP and KPS polysaccharides.", "Transposon insertions in several genes involved in PGN metabolism also affect the resistance of S. meliloti to PHZ, either negatively or positively (Fig.\u00a05A).
