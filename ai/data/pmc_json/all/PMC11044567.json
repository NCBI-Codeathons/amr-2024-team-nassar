Paralog HOGs are those where at least one genome contributed more than one gene. Confirmed HOGs are those where all genes assigned by OrthoFinder to a HOG were supported by synteny. Unconfirmed HOGs lacked synteny support for all genes assigned to a HOG by OrthoFinder or any SOG subgroup. HOGs where synteny eliminated at least one paralog and/or divided the HOG into at least one SOG are designated Modified HOGs.

The BLAST e-value and percent identity mostly agreed with these groupings (Additional file 2: Table S4); however, SKDI_07G4440 was the best match for both S. cerevisiae genes, which led to a failure in correct ortholog assignment for the two paralogs in S. cerevisiae based on sequence similarity alone.

HOG 55 is composed of two genes from each of the three genomes\u2014annotated as encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, either tdh2 or tdh3\u2014which are known paralogs [59]. OrthoRefine split the HOG into two SOGs, correctly separating the members of the two groups: SOG55.0, the tdh2 group, was comprised of SMKI_10G2100, YJR009C, & SKDI_10G2170, whereas SOG55.1, the tdh3 group, was comprised of SMKI_16G0680, YGR192C, & SKDI_07G4440 (Fig.\u00a010). The BLAST e-value and percent identity mostly agreed with these groupings (Additional file 2: Table S4); however, SKDI_07G4440 was the best match for both S. cerevisiae genes, which led to a failure in correct ortholog assignment for the two paralogs in S. cerevisiae based on sequence similarity alone. It has previously been reported that orthologs sometimes have a lower percent identity compared to their paralogs [58, 60]. This result shows that synteny can, at least in some instances, resolve such discrepancies in sequence divergence. The phylogenetic analysis mostly supported the synteny groupings; however, similar to the BLAST e-values, there was a lack of support to tell where to group the genes from S. kudriavzevii (Additional file 3: Figure S6).Fig.\u00a010Synteny analysis of HOG 55.

OrthoRefine is designed to mimic the desirable properties of OrthoFinder, namely ease-of-use (no dependencies on additional software, a simple input, and support scripts to download data or create summary statistics), automation, and speed. We expect OrthoRefine to be most beneficial when the desired orthologous relationship is 1-to-1 (i.e., no paralogs). The value of synteny for ortholog identification has been demonstrated in previous studies [31, 60\u201363], but in the absence of easy-to-use tools to identify syntenous orthologs automatically, such studies have been time-intensive and generally limited in their scope. This work further demonstrates how the use of synteny, automated in OrthoRefine, can enhance ortholog identification by analyzing different data sets and groups separated by different distances. In addition to confirmation of OrthoRefine\u2019s ability to increase specificity and functional ortholog identification via the community benchmarking tool, detailed investigation of several cases by manual inspection of sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, and operon structures provided additional independent support for OrthoRefine\u2019s results.", "We developed OrthoRefine, a standalone program that automates refinements of ortholog identification by evaluating gene synteny.
