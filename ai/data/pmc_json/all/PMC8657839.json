["Glycosylation inactivation is one of the important macrolide resistance mechanisms. The accumulated evidences attributed glycosylation inactivation to a glucosylation modification at the inactivation sites of macrolides. Whether other glycosylation modifications lead to macrolides inactivation is unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that varied glycosylation modifications could cause inactivation of midecamycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic used clinically and agriculturally. Specifically, an actinomycetic glycosyltransferase (GT) OleD was selected for its glycodiversification capacity towards midecamycin. OleD was demonstrated to recognize UDP-D-glucose, UDP-D-xylose, UDP-galactose, UDP-rhamnose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to yield corresponding midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides, most of which displayed low yields. Protein engineering of OleD was thus performed to improve its conversions towards sugar donors. Q327F was the most favorable variant with seven times the conversion enhancement towards UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Likewise, Q327A exhibited 30% conversion enhancement towards UDP-D-xylose. Potent biocatalysts for midecamycin glycosylation were thus obtained through protein engineering. Wild OleD, Q327F and Q327A were used as biocatalysts for scale-up preparation of midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glucopyranoside, midecamycin 2\u2032-O-GlcNAc and midecamycin 2\u2032-O-xylopyranoside. In contrast to midecamycin, these midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides displayed no antimicrobial activities. These evidences suggested that besides glucosylation, other glycosylation patterns also could inactivate midecamycin, providing a new inactivation mechanism for midecamycin resistance. Cumulatively, glycosylation inactivation of midecamycin was independent of the type of attached sugar moieties at its inactivation site.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Antibiotics have been applied extensively in the clinic, veterinary medicine and farming as antibacterials. Of these antibiotics, macrolides are an important group of antibiotics, which account for 20% of all antibiotics prescribed. At least 500 kinds of macrolide antibiotics are known, most of which are derived from Streptomyces species. The frequently used macrolide antibiotics are erythromycin [1], oleandomycin [2,3], josamycin [4,5], midecamycin [4,6], spiramycin [7,8], roxithromycin [9,10], azithromycin [11,12], and clarithromycin [13,14]. Macrolides exhibit high activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and are thus used widely as excellent bacteriostatic agents due to their low toxicity and broad-spectrum activities. Macrolide antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the nascent peptide exit tunnel of the bacterial ribosome, thus leading to growth arrest or cell death. The action mechanism of macrolides is determined by the location of sugars and specific functional groups on their macrolactone rings [15,16,17]. However, as with other antibiotics, the misuse and overuse of macrolides will inevitably result in antibiotic resistance [18], which usually causes the decline or loss of antibiotic efficacy. Antibiotic-resistant infections can be difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, thereby resulting in extended hospital stays, higher medical costs and increased mortality. Antibiotic resistance is regarded as one of the biggest threats to healthcare, veterinary and agriculture industries in our time. Hence, it is urgent to explore the underlying mechanisms of macrolide resistance.", "Antibiotics have been applied extensively in the clinic, veterinary medicine and farming as antibacterials.

Of these mechanisms, antibiotic inactivation is achieved by enzyme-mediated structural modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and acylation [19,20]. Under the actions of modifying enzymes like phosphotransferases (PTs), glycosyltransferases (GTs) and acyltransferases (ATs), macrolide antibiotics are modified to form derivatives with structural alterations, which can impair target binding [18,19,20]. Enzymatic modification of antibiotics has been known as one of the most common resistance mechanisms, which is extensively present in antibiotic producers [18,22]. Enzymatic modifications are effective strategies to inactivate antibiotics, thereby avoiding their damage to producers, which is also called self-resistance [23]. GT-mediated macrolides inactivation has been observed in diverse producers, like Streptomyces vendargensis [24], S.\nlividans [25,26,27], S.\nantibioticus [28,29,30,31,32], Saccharopolyspora erythraea [33], Nocardia Species [34,35], S.\nhygroscopicus [36] and S.ambofaciens [37].

Understanding more about the resistance mechanisms will be helpful for better treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Glucosylation inactivation is one of the important resistance mechanisms [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. However, if other glycosylation modifications will inactivate antibiotics is not clear. Herein, we took macrolide antibiotic midecamycin as the research object and demonstrated that besides glucosylation, other glycosylation modifications could cause antibiotics inactivation for the first time.", "This work has at least three contributions to the new cognition in this field. First, this study provided a novel mechanism for midecamycin inactivation. Midecamycin is an important macrolide antibiotic.

Besides glycosylation modifications, the resistance to midecamycin could also be achieved by the combinational modification of phosphorylation of 2\u2032-OH and reduction at the 18-formyl group (18-dihydro-2\u2032-O-phosphorylmidecamycin) [34,35]. These evidences suggest that multiple modifications at 2\u2032-OH can cause midecamycin inactivation. Hence, 2\u2032-OH is a key determinator for midecamycin activity. 2\u2032-OH of the desosamine moiety, which locates at C5 position of midecamycin and some macrolides, can make specific hydrogen bond interaction with the nucleobase of A2058 of the 23S rRNA, thereby facilitating the occupation of macrolide drugs in the nascent peptide exit tunnel. The glycosylation at 2\u2032-OH might blocked the binding between the desosamine hydroxyl and the N1 atom of A2058, thus leading to macrolide resistance [18,59].

The OD600 of each well was recorded and the lowest concentration that inhibited bacterial growth completely was defined as MIC values of midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides.", "The determination of antimicrobial activity of midecamycin and its glycosides were based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against the tested microorganisms. The MICs of midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides were measured using the broth microdilution procedure described previously [66]. Briefly, the cell suspensions of these tested microorganisms were prepared from a 24 h-culture using LB liquid medium (BHI medium for S. pneumoniae). The serial dilutions of midecamycin and its glycosides were made using the corresponding mediums in serially decreasing concentrations from 64 \u03bcg/mL. The same amount of diluent and bacterial solution (usually 200 \u03bcL each) were added to 96 well plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The OD600 of each well was recorded and the lowest concentration that inhibited bacterial growth completely was defined as MIC values of midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides.", "5. Conclusions", "5. Conclusions", "Glucosylation inactivation is one of commonly-accepted resistance mechanisms on antibiotics. Still, the effect of other glycosylation modifications, such as xylosylation and O-GlcNAcylation, on macrolide inactivation is unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that besides glucosylation inactivation, other glycosylation could inactivate macrolide antibiotics, deepening the understanding on glycosylation inactivation of antibiotics. In addition, glycosylation modification has been proved to be a new mechanism of midecamycin resistance. Moreover, glycosylation inactivation of midecamycin was independent of the type of attached sugar moieties at its inactivation site. These data contribute to the in-depth understanding of the resistance mechanism and lay a foundation for the development of glycosyltransferase inhibitors.", "Glucosylation inactivation is one of commonly-accepted resistance mechanisms on antibiotics.
