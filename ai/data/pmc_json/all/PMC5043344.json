Bacillus subtilis is a suitable host for the heterologous production of natural products from bacilli and related Firmicutes. Existing technologies for heterologous expression of large biosynthetic gene clusters in B. subtilis are complicated. Herein, we present a simple and rapid strategy for direct cloning based heterologous expression of biosynthetic pathways in B. subtilis via Red/ET recombineering, using a 5.2\u2009kb specific direct cloning vector carrying homologous sequences to the amyE gene in B. subtilis and CcdB counterselection marker. Using a two-step procedure, two large biosynthetic pathways for edeine (48.3\u2009kb) and bacillomycin (37.2\u2009kb) from Brevibacillus brevis X23 and B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, respectively, were directly cloned and subsequently integrated into the chromosome of B. subtilis within one week. The gene cluster for bacillomycin was successfully expressed in the heterologous host, although edeine production was not detectable. Compared with similar technologies, this method offers a simpler and more feasible system for the discovery of natural products from bacilli and related genera.", "Microorganisms produce a large number of secondary metabolites, the main resource for pharmaceuticals and bio-pesticides1234. Many of these natural products belong to the polyketide and nonribosomal peptide families synthesized by large multienzyme megasynthetases, known as polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), respectively567. Occasionally, the transfer of a secondary metabolite pathway from the original producing microorganism into a suitable heterologous host, that is, heterologous expression, is warranted for the following purposes: to demonstrate the gene cluster required for the biosynthesis of a compound; to increase the yield of a compound; to discover microbial natural products, which are difficult to culture or not genetically amenable; or to generate natural product derivatives or unnatural products by modification of biosynthetic pathways in a genetically amenable host89.", "Bacilli is one of the largest resources of natural products, from which numerous secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways have been detected101112. The increasing number of published genome sequences of bacilli strains has revealed that a large number of biosynthetic pathways are cryptic in bacilli, particularly for strains not belonging to Bacillus genera12. These bacteria are generally difficult to genetically manipulate, thereby impeding the discovery of novel natural products from these microbes by genome mining13. However, the cloning and heterologous expression of these cryptic gene clusters in an amenable host has been proven to be a feasible approach to uncover natural products from genetically hard-to-handle bacteria8914. The selection of a suitable heterologous host as well as efficient cloning and transferring large gene clusters is the key issue for successful heterologous expression8. Bacillus subtilis is the best host for the heterologous expression of the secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways from Bacillus and related genera. First, B. subtilis is a well-studied non-pathogenic bacteria with excellent fermentation characteristics1516. Second, B. subtilis possesses functional and genetic background similar to its related species and genera for the biosynthesis of natural products and their required precursors. Third, B. subtilis has sophisticated and simple genetic operation approaches and tools, particularly for the integration of large foreign DNA fragments into the chromosome by natural transformation, with a capacity of more than 3 Mb1718. Several secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways have been successfully expressed in B. subtilis, for example, bacitracin biosynthetic gene cluster from B. licheniformis19, nisin biosynthetic gene cluster from Lactococcus lactis20, polymyxin biosynthetic gene cluster from Paenibacillus polymyxa21, enniatin biosynthetic gene cluster from Fusarium.sp22, amicoumacin biosynthetic gene cluster from B. subtilis14, and 6 -deoxyerythronolide B biosynthetic gene cluster from Saccharopolyspora erythraea23.", "However, obtaining secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters is challenging, as these gene clusters are typically large, ranging from10 to 100\u2009kb. Conventionally, fosmid or cosmid genomic libraries have been constructed to obtain the gene clusters of interest; however screening the correct clones is an extremely time-consuming and laborious task2425. Recently, simple technologies have been developed to directly clone large biosynthetic gene clusters from genomic DNA, such as Gibson assembly26, transformation-associated recombination (TAR)27, \u03c6 BT1 integrase-mediated direct cloning28, oriT-directed capture29, Cas9-Assisted Targeting of Chromosome segments (CATCH)30, and Red/ET recombineering31. Direct cloning via Red/ET recombineering3233 is based on in vivo linear plus linear homologous recombination (LLHR) in E. coli mediated by the prophage recombinases RecE and RecT, representing a powerful method for the cloning and genetic engineering of natural product biosynthetic pathways. To date, several gene clusters have been cloned and heterologously expressed using this method, including the luminmycin3134, luminmide31, syringolin35, glidobactin34, colibactin36, sevadicin37, and salinomycin38 gene clusters.", "Linear cloning vector for direct cloning in Red/ET recombineering comprises only two elements, the plasmid replication origin and antibiotic selection marker maintained in E. coli29, lacking maintenance or transfer elements for other heterologous hosts. Thus, several steps for further modifications were required to add heterologous expression elements, such as a suitable promoter, appropriate antibiotic selection marker and chromosomal integration elements, to the cloned gene cluster38. Therefore, in the present study, we constructed a specific cloning vector for direct cloning carrying homologous sequence to B. subtilis and established a simple and rapid strategy for the direct cloning of natural product biosynthesis gene clusters and expression in B. subtilis via Red/ET recombineering. The recombinant plasmid that contains the cloned gene cluster can be directly integrated into the chromosome of B. subtilis without further modification. For proof of principal, two NPRS gene clusters, the edeine39 biosynthetic pathway (48.9\u2009kb) from a biocontrol bacteria Brevibacillus brevis X2340 and the bacillomycin41 biosynthetic pathway (37.2\u2009kb) from B. amyloliquefaciens FZB4242 were directly cloned using this vector and each one was integrated into chromosome of B. subtilis within one week. The results showed bacillomycin has been successfully produced in the heterologous host. This work will further facilitate the heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic pathways in B. subtilis.", "Results", "Results", "Repair of the sfp gene in B. subtilis 1A751 to construct a functional host for NRPS and PKS", "Repair of the sfp gene in B. subtilis 1A751 to construct a functional host for NRPS and PKS", "Repair of the sfp gene in B. subtilis 1A751 to construct a functional host for NRPS and PKS", "B. subtilis 1A75143, a two protease-deficient derivative of B. subtilis16818, has a clear genetic background, sophisticated genetic manipulation method and lower protease activity, making this bacterium to be a good candidate as a heterologous host.

Consistent with the close genetic relationship between the producer strain and heterologous host stain, all of the cloned gene clusters were under the control of their original promoters. The ede gene cluster of the recombinant plasmid p15A-amyEF-Spect-amyER-ede can be directly used to transfer into B. subtilis without further modification. Another gene cluster-containing plasmid, p15A-amyEF-Spect-amyER-bmy, contains a 1.5\u2009kb redundant region downstream from the bacillomycin gene cluster, which was highly homologous to the host strain B. subtilis 1A751\u2009+\u2009sfp. We knocked out this region by linear plus circular homologous recombination (LCHR) mediated by the \u03bb phage recombinase Red\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 using a lox71-cm-lox66 cassette and excised the antibiotic marker by a Cre-loxP systems to ensure the specific integration of the cloned gene cluster into the amyE gene locus of B. subtilis 1A751\u2009+\u2009sfp, generating the recombinant plasmid p15A-amyEF-Spect-amyER-bmy2, followed by verification by restriction enzyme analysis (Fig. S3B).", "Heterologous expression of the bacillomycin biosynthetic gene cluster", "Heterologous expression of the bacillomycin biosynthetic gene cluster", "Heterologous expression of the bacillomycin biosynthetic gene cluster", "The recombinant plasmids p15A-amyEF-Spect-amyER-ede and p15A-amyEF-Spect-amyER-bmy2 were transferred into B. subtilis 1A751\u2009+\u2009sfp by natural competence transformation49.
