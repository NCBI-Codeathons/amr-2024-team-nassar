["The peptidyl nucleoside blasticidin S (BS) isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes was the first non-mercurial fungicide used on a large scale to prevent rice blast. In the biosynthesis of BS, leucylblasticidin S (LBS) was suggested as the penultimate metabolite with 20-fold less inhibitory activity than the final product BS. Incomplete conversion of LBS to BS at a variable efficiency ranging from 10% to 90% was observed either in the native strain S. griseochromogenes or a heterologous producer Streptomyces lividans WJ2. In this study, we determined that maturation of BS from LBS is not a spontaneous process but is governed by a standalone peptidase PepN, which hydrolyzes LBS in a pH-sensitive way with most appropriate of pH 7~8 but is inactive when the pH is below 5 or above 10. PepN1 and PepN2, two neighboring PepN homologs from Streptomyces lividans were purified in E. coli but displayed ca.100-fold difference in LBS hydrolytic activity. Overexpression of pepN1 in WJ2 enhanced BS yield by 100% and lowered the ratio of LBS to BS from 2:1 to 2:3. This work presents the expansion of the biological role for PepN in antibiotic maturation and the first report of hydrolysis of beta amide linkage by this conserved enzyme.", "Blasticidin S (BS) is a nucleoside analog consisting of a cytosine linked to a dideoxyhexose and bonded to a modified arginine. BS was isolated from the broth of Streptomyces griseochromogenes in an effort to identify natural non-mercurial fungicides1. BS has been used on a large scale to control rice blast by foliar application against the virulent fungus (Pyricularia oryzae) which was the cause of the disease in Asia2. BS was found to strongly inhibit the production of aflatoxin by Aspergillus flavus without impairing fungal growth3.", "Blasticidin S exerts its inhibitory activity by interfering with ribosomal protein synthesis in host cells. Unlike other peptidyltransferase inhibitors, such as clinically used chloramphenicol, linezolid, the lincosamides lincomycin and clindamycin, which bind to the A site of the large ribosomal subunit456, BS occupies the P site, where it induces conformational changes of the P-site tRNA7.", "As BS displayed non-selective toxicity to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, it is of great interest to understand the resistance mechanism, particularly the mechanism for self-resistance. There have been two groups of BS resistance genes reported in non-BS producers. The first group featured by BSD or BSR encodes blasticidin S deaminase89101112 that converts BS to non-toxic deaminohydroxyblasticidin S. This group of resistance genes along with BS are widely used in the selection of the transformed cells, particularly in eukaryotic transgenic studies131415. The other group is blasticidin S acetyltransferase that uses acetyl-coenzyme A to acetylate the amino group at C-13 of blasticidin S to give N-acetylblasticidin S161718. In some fungi, two groups of resistance genes are present to convert BS to N-acetyldeaminohydroxyblasticidin S3. Impermeability of the cell membrane constitutes another barrier to delivery of BS to its intracellular targets. But some nutrient uptake systems could be hijacked for BS delivery, such as an ABC transporter named NppA1A2BCD19 and the leucine-rich repeat-containing 8(LRRC8) proteins20 in mammalian cells.", "In studies of blasticidin S, demethylblasticidin S (DBS)21 and leucylblasticidin S (LBS)22 were isolated as the intermediates in the broth of S. griseochromogenes when the pH of the culture medium was kept below 4. However, LBS was later isolated from Streptomyces sp. SCC 1785 and S. griseochromogenes under the normal laboratory conditions2324. Addition of leucine to C-13 of the beta-amino group of BS was expected as a new self-resistance mechanism because the antibiotic activity of LBS against indicator strain Bacillus circulans was decreased by 20 folds compared to BS23. LBS was suggested as the direct precursor for BS biosynthesis as the washed cells22 or cell lysate23 of S. griseochromogenes can convert LBS into BS (Fig. 1A). It is of particular interest to know where this conversion occurs to avoid self-destruction of the host by the generated BS, as well as identifying the protein responsible for this hydrolysis in vivo.", "In this study, we determined that PepN from E. coli and Streptomyces lividans can catalyze the hydrolysis of LBS into BS. The activity of PepN is pH-dependent wherein it shows the highest hydrolytic activity at pH 7\u20138 and loses its activity when pH is below 5 or above 10. The variation in the ratio between LBS to BS in the fermentation broth of S. lividans is attributed to the changes in activity of PepN that is affected by the medium pH in different fermentations.", "Results", "Results", "LBS and BS productivity is significantly affected by fermentation conditions", "LBS and BS productivity is significantly affected by fermentation conditions", "LBS and BS productivity is significantly affected by fermentation conditions", "The blasticidin S native producer Streptomyces griseochromogenes has a very strong barrier system against introduction of foreign DNA. Heterologous expression of the BS biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces lividans initially only yielded LBS, but not BS25.
