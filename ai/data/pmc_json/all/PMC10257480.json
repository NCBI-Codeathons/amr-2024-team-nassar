["Abstract", "It is almost a century since nisin was discovered in fermented milk cultures, coincidentally in the same year that penicillin was first described. Over the last 100 years this small, highly modified pentacyclic peptide has not only found success in the food industry as a preservative but has also served as the paradigm for our understanding of the genetic organization, expression, and regulation of genes involved in lantibiotic biosynthesis\u2014one of the few cases of extensive post-translation modification in prokaryotes. Recent developments in understanding the complex biosynthesis of nisin have shed light on the cellular location of the modification and transport machinery and the co-ordinated series of spatio-temporal events required to produce active nisin and provide resistance and immunity. The continued unearthing of new natural variants from within human and animal gastrointestinal tracts has sparked interest in the potential application of nisin to influence the microbiome, given the growing recognition of the role the gastrointestinal microbiota plays in health and disease. Moreover, interdisciplinary approaches have taken advantage of biotechnological advancements to bioengineer nisin to produce novel variants and expand nisin functionality for applications in the biomedical field. This review will discuss the latest progress in these aspects of nisin research.", "The highly post-translationally modified peptide nisin has been studied over the course of the last 100 years, and although it has been employed successfully as a food preservative, its potent activity against multidrug resistant microbes, long safety record, lack of any significant resistance development, and amenability to bioengineering approaches to improve its antimicrobial and physicochemical properties has meant that the focus on nisin-related research is shifting from food preservation towards therapeutic use for the treatment of bacterial infections.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Nisin is one of the oldest known antimicrobial compounds. In 1928, the same year that Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, Rogers and Whittier (Rogers 1928) noted that certain lactic streptococci (then called Group N Streptococcus) were inhibitory to starter cheese cultures. Almost 20 years following its discovery, this inhibitory peptide was named nisin, or \u2018group N Streptococcus Inhibitory Substance\u2019, the suffix \u2018-in\u2019 implying antibacterial properties (Hirsch and Mattick 1949). Although initially proposed for use as an antibiotic based on its activity against veterinary and clinical pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it was deemed unsuitable due to low aqueous solubility and poor stability at physiological pH (Hurst 1981). However, in the 1950s the potency of nisin as a food preservative was realized based on its success in preventing spoilage of processed cheese by clostridia (Delves-Broughton et al. 1996). Since then, this highly modified peptide has gained approval by regulators in over 80 countries, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (Chikindas et al. 2018). Nisin has been used in a wide assortment of foods including dairy and dairy desserts, canned goods, processed meats, fish, fruit juices, and beverages (Gharsallaoui et al. 2016, Todorov et al. 2022). Nisin exhibits potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci. Nisin has also been used in limited applications in the veterinary industry to prevent or treat bovine mastitis (Roy et al. 2016). The commercial success of nisin has made it the most investigated bacteriocin (antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that can kill other bacteria) in terms of its genetic organization, biosynthesis, mode of action and efforts to broaden its food and potential therapeutic applications. Nisin is also a lanthipeptide, a rapidly expanding subset of the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) family (Arnison et al. 2013). Their defining feature is the presence of unusual thioether amino acids including lanthionine (Lan) and/or methyllanthionine (MeLan) that are introduced through a series of enzyme-mediated post-translational modifications (Sahl et al. 2008). Currently, lanthipeptides can be classified into five distinct groups based on the characteristics of their lanthipeptide synthetases. For Class I lanthipeptides, of which nisin is the prototypical member, the thioether cross-linked amino acids (Me)Lan are generated by two distinct enzymes: a dehydratase LanB and cyclase LanC (see later section on nisin biosynthesis). However, in Class II\u2013IV lanthipeptides, multifunctional enzymes are employed to form (Me)Lan, namely LanM (Class II), LanKC (Class III), and LanL (Class IV). A recently discovered group of lanthipeptides that are generated via a biosynthetically distinct pathway since the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) do not contain genes encoding well-defined Class I\u2013IV (Me)Lan synthase homologues constitutes the newest class (Class V) (the reader is referred to excellent reviews covering these aspects in more detail (Hegemann and S\u00fcssmuth 2020, Montalb\u00e1n-L\u00f3pez et al. 2021, Lee and van der Donk 2022). Lanthipeptides that exhibit antimicrobial activity have been historically termed lantibiotics. Importantly, some lantibiotics, including nisin, exhibit multiple modes of action, which involve interactions with highly conserved cell wall synthesis intermediates as well as the ability to form pores in the bacterial membrane (Sahl and Bierbaum 2008). In the case of nisin, this dual mode of action and demonstrable high potency against multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria makes the lantibiotic very attractive for potential use as a biotherapeutic in human and animal health related applications (Mathur et al. 2018, van Staden et al. 2021). Indeed, recent advances in genome mining tools and next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (Biermann et al. 2022) have facilitated the prediction of novel BGCs from a diverse range of bacteria and sources including human and animal microbiomes. Consequently, the number of natural nisin variants has doubled in the last decade, representing a valuable collection of novel peptide structures that exhibit a range of properties and antimicrobial spectra. Moreover, increasing numbers of metagenomic studies are beginning to shed light on the complex interactions between microbes in the human gastrointestinal tract and the role that antimicrobial peptides might play in this context (Garcia-Gutierrez et al. 2019a, Heilbronner et al. 2021). In fact, recent microbiome-based investigations have revealed that commensal nisin producing bacteria can inhibit MDR pathogens and shape niche competition in the gastrointestinal microbiome, offering exciting prospects for the use of nisin in human therapeutic applications.", "Nisin is one of the oldest known antimicrobial compounds.

The leader peptide serves as a signal sequence for export by NisT and as a recognition motif recognized by the modification enzymes NisB and NisC (Siegers et al. 1996, Kuipers et al. 2006). The first phase in nisin maturation involves the dehydration of selected serine and threonine residues in the core peptide, a process mediated by a dimer of the membrane-associated dehydratase NisB (Fig.\u00a01). This process involves the transfer of glutamate to specific serine and threonine side chains followed by subsequent elimination reactions to generate dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, respectively (Garg et al. 2013). In the next phase, these dehydrated residues are coupled to nearby cysteines via intramolecular addition reactions mediated by the cyclase NisC to form five cyclic bridges composed of a lanthionine (Lan, where an initial serine is linked to a neighbouring cysteine) and 4 methyllanthionine (MeLan, where a threonine is linked to cysteine) rings (Koponen et al. 2002, Li and van der Donk 2007). In the final step, the modified 57 amino acid peptide is exported from the cell via the dedicated ABC-type transporter NisT (Kuipers et al. 2004) and the mature bioactive peptide is released following removal of the leader region by a dedicated serine protease, NisP (Lagedroste et al. 2017, Montalb\u00e1n-L\u00f3pez et al. 2018) (Fig.\u00a01). The producer cell is protected from the now active peptide by two distinct immunity systems composed of a lipoprotein NisI and an ABC transporter NisFEG (Khosa et al. 2016a). To ensure a proper equilibrium between production and immunity, nisin expression is autoregulated by the mature nisin peptide via a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) composed of a sensor histidine kinase NisK, and response regulator NisR (Kuipers et al. 1995) (Fig.\u00a01). Binding of mature nisin to NisK stimulates autophosphorylation. The phosphate group is then transferred to activate NisR, which then induces transcription from two of the four promoters in the nisin gene cluster, P*nisA and P*nisF (Fig.\u00a01). Thus, nisin functions as both an antimicrobial peptide and a peptide pheromone that plays an essential role in quorum sensing control of its own biosynthesis (Kleerebezem 2004). A multitude of studies with a particular focus on the individual biosynthetic proteins have been instrumental in elucidating the intricate catalytic processes and stereochemistry involved in formation of the Lan and MeLan residues (For comprehensive reviews see Repka et al. 2017, Montalb\u00e1n-L\u00f3pez et al. 2021). For example, the precise mechanism of the NisB dehydratase action remained elusive due to the inability of researchers to reconstitute NisB activity in vitro. This was finally achieved when it was established that NisB required glutamyl-tRNA to bring about the dehydration reaction (Garg et al. 2013). Later studies identified the domains within NisB that catalyse the transfer and subsequent elimination of glutamate from the tRNA to the core peptide to form Dha or Dhb, as well as elucidating the importance of the highly conserved -FNLD- box within the leader peptide for recognition and binding of NisB and NisC to pre-NisA (Abts et al. 2013, Ortega et al. 2015). Furthermore, the requirement of Zn2+\u00a0for NisC catalytic activity provided further mechanistic insight into how the cyclase guides the formation of the lanthionine rings (Li and van der Donk 2007). Another important breakthrough revealed the details of the formation of the modification complex which was shown in vitro to have a stoichiometry of 2:1:1 (NisB:NisC:pre-NisA) (Reiners et al. 2017a). Additionally, the purification and in vitro ATPase activity of NisT was recently demonstrated (Lagedroste et al. 2020). Importantly, numerous reports concerning the organization and cellular location of the nisin modification machinery have alluded to the existence of a membrane-associated multimeric synthetase protein complex consisting of NisB, NisC, and NisT (for a comprehensive review see Lubelski et al. 2008).", "To produce the active peptide, nisin is first ribosomally synthesized as an unmodified 57 amino acid precursor peptide (pre-NisA) consisting of a 23-amino acid N-terminal leader peptide and a 34-amino acid C-terminal core peptide (Fig.\u00a01).

Using an elegantly designed suite of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled NisA fusions as well as sfGFP and mCherry fusions to the N- and/or C-termini of NisB, NisC, and NisT, respectively, it was revealed that pre-NisA binds NisB and NisC to form a complex, i.e. localized to the poles of the Lactococcus lactis host (Fig.\u00a01). Further analysis established that NisB and NisC were preferentially located at one pole in single cells, later identified as the \u2018old\u2019 pole through time\u2013course experiments. Surprisingly, the transporter NisT was shown to be evenly distributed in the cell periphery and not part of a NisBCT complex as predicted, suggesting that NisT is recruited to the pole localized NisBC complex only when required to transport of the fully modified prepeptide. Indeed, a NisT mutant incapable of secretion and dissociation confirmed this when it was visualized together with NisB and NisC, also at a polar position. Finally, the order of assembly was clarified and revealed that NisB plays a central role in the initial recruitment of the other components (Chen et al. 2020). A short domain (NisB750\u2013769) targets dimeric NisB to the pole of the cell. NisC is recruited to form a NisBC complex that interacts with nisin precursor and both enzymes act in succession to perform the dehydration and cyclization reactions and create each lanthionine ring in turn.

The fully modified pre-NisA is then released from NisBC and transferred to NisT. Following export of the fully modified prepeptide, the complex dissociates and NisT again becomes evenly distributed around the cell. It is thought that this polar-localized synthesis and secretion of nisin prevents access of the peptide to its target lipid II, given that peptidoglycan synthesis would be significantly lower at the old pole, thereby limiting the possibility of any self-killing action (Chen et al. 2020).

A perfect example of this describes the expression of more than 30 novel lantibiotics from almost 60 promising candidate genes identified from genome mining of publicly available prokaryotic sequences (van Heel et al. 2016).

Resistance to lantibiotics has been noted, with the most frequent mechanisms involving physiological adaptations to the cell-envelope including cell wall thickening, alterations to phospholipid and membrane fatty acid composition, and the overall cell wall charge (The reader is directed to comprehensive reviews describing these mechanisms in greater detail; Bastos et al. 2015, Draper et al. 2015, Barbosa et al. 2021). Over the last decade, bacterial resistance mediated by transporters has gained significant attention due to the high degree of protection these systems provide against cell wall-active drugs, including antimicrobial peptides (Gebhard 2012). Although a wide variety of these integral membrane proteins have been characterized as immunity systems in producing organisms, they have also been identified in the genomes of nonproducing and often pathogenic organisms. To understand how these transporters confer resistance to nisin, it is first necessary to appreciate the mode of action of the peptide. Nisin exerts its antimicrobial action both by pore formation and by inhibition of cell wall synthesis through specific binding to lipid II, an essential precursor in peptidoglycan biosynthesis (Breukink et al. 1999, Wiedemann et al. 2001). This dual functionality is mediated by two structural domains, an N-terminal domain composed of rings A, B, and C, linked to the C-terminal rings (D and E) by a short three residue hinge region (Fig.\u00a02A). Studies have revealed that the N-terminal lanthionine rings form a pyrophosphate cage around the head-group of lipid II, thus inhibiting cell wall synthesis. The interaction primarily occurs via five hydrogen bonds formed between the amide backbone of rings A and B of nisin and the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid II (Hsu et al. 2004). This binding enhances insertion of rings D and E in a transmembrane orientation, facilitated by the flexible hinge, forming a stable pore. Notably, lipid II is also the target of the glyco- and lipoglyco-peptide antibiotics vancomycin, teicoplanin, telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin that serve as first line antibiotics to treat MDR Gram-positive pathogens. This is also true for the depsipeptides ramoplanin and teixobactin, though they bind different segments of the highly conserved lipid II molecule than nisin, which has relevance for both mode of action and mode of resistance (Ulm and Schneider 2016). In the case of nisin, binding to lipid II also facilitates pore formation leading to the rapid efflux of ions and small cytoplasmic compounds from the target organism (Bierbaum and Sahl 2009). Initially, it was believed that the pores consisted of eight nisin and four lipid II molecules (Hasper et al. 2004), though recent evidence suggests the pore complex grows continuously through the recruitment of more and more nisin\u2013lipid II aggregates leading to immense membrane damage (Scherer et al. 2015). The producer strain escapes the killing action of nisin by expressing a set of nisin-specific immunity proteins consisting of a membrane-anchored lipoprotein NisI and a multiprotein ABC-type export complex NisFEG (Stein et al. 2003). One line of evidence suggests that NisI intercepts nisin and blocks the peptide from reaching its molecular target lipid II (Stein et al. 2003, Koponen et al. 2004), thereby preventing pore formation (Geiger et al. 2019). Furthermore, recent reports indicate that NisI\u2013nisin interactions also promote cell clustering that acts as a shield to inhibit the action of nisin (AlKhatib et al. 2014). On the other hand, the ABC transporter NisFEG functions by ejecting nisin from the cell membrane before a pore can be formed (Stein et al. 2003). The specificity of NisFEG appears to reside in the C-terminal region of nisin, since deletion of the terminal six amino acids and Ring E reduced the degree of immunity provided by NisFEG (AlKhatib et al. 2014). Although it is postulated that NisI and NisFEG act co-operatively, the role of NisI in self-immunity of the producer appears to be more critical than the transporter since a deletion of nisI results in greater susceptibility to nisin compared to a nisFEG knockout (Siegers and Entian 1995). While the manner of NisI-mediated immunity is not yet fully understood, recent NMR (Hacker et al. 2015) and molecular modelling studies (Jeong and Ha 2018) have revealed a C-terminal cleft and groove region that may represent important sites for NisI\u2013NisA interactions.", "Given the remarkable ability of microbes to adapt to their environments, it is not surprising that persistent bacterial exposure to bacteriocins can lead to resistance development (Kumariya et al. 2019).

However, the presence and distribution of resistance genes as described above across multiple species including important human pathogens poses a significant challenge to potential use of nisin and other bacteriocins in therapeutic applications. For example, the nsr operon has been detected in animal and human pathogenic streptococci (including S. agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, S. suis, Streptococcus canis), staphylococci (including Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), and in Enterococcus faecium (Khosa et al. 2013, Sim\u00f5es et al. 2016, Field et al. 2018). It is worth noting that these genes are often positioned on transmissible elements such as plasmids (Froseth and McKay 1991, Liu et al. 1997), highlighting the potential for NSR-associated resistance transfer to other microbes. Indeed, the prevalence of NSR amongst lactococci was recently emphasized when whole genome sequencing of 710 dairy-associated L. lactis strains found that an impressive 270 (38%) harboured an nsr gene (van Gijtenbeek et al. 2021). Furthermore, a singular nisI immunity gene located on a 50-kb plasmid was shown to provide nisin resistance to the non-nisin producer L. lactis NCDO712 (Tarazanova et al. 2016).

Nisin C28P (Fig.\u00a04) was as active as wild type nisin and retained the ability to form pores in the membrane, but was notably more effective against an NSR producing strain due to the inability of NSR to cleave this variant efficiently (Zaschke-Kriesche et al. 2019a).", "Recent investigations have highlighted the importance of ring D and E for recognition by the NSR (Khosa et al. 2016a). Specifically, the resistance provided by NSR was overcome by nisin variants lacking rings D and E or only ring E. This was further emphasized by molecular simulations of the NSR/nisin complex, which revealed the role of the C-terminal rings for substrate specificity to ensure the exact coordination of the nisin cleavage point (Ser29) at the enzymatic active site (Khosa et al. 2016b). Considering this, Field et al. (2018) used saturation mutagenesis such that serine at position 29 was replaced with all other 19 amino acids. The results identified one derivative, S29P (Fig.\u00a04), as having comparable activity to nisin A but crucially exhibited a 20-fold increase in specific activity against several NSR producing strains due to the inability of NSR to cleave the mutant peptide.

The outer membrane of Gram-negative organisms is impermeable to nisin, preventing access to the inner membrane and its target lipid II (Nikaido and Vaara 1985). Consequently, nisin exhibits poor activity towards Gram-negative species. However, disruption of the outer membrane with chelating agents such as EDTA can restore susceptibility to nisin (Stevens et al. 1991). Thus, the main impediment for nisin to kill Gram-negative bacteria appears to be its inability to traverse the outer membrane. A recent approach to assist nisin in penetrating the outer membrane involved the fusion of several small anti-Gram-negative peptides tails including apidaecin 1b, oncocin, and drosocin to the C-terminal end of nisin (Zhou et al. 2016). One such fusion, containing an eight amino acid (PRPPHPRL) tail from apidaecin 1b attached to full length nisin (Fig.\u00a04), exhibited 2-fold greater activity against Escherichia coli CECT101, highlighting that the strategy of combining a lipid II binding peptide with the penetrative ability of eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides extends the activity of nisin towards Gram-negative bacteria (Zhou et al. 2016). Subsequent studies involved a greater selection of peptide tails and re-engineered variants and identified several of them with greater activity against a range of important pathogenic Gram-negative organisms including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes when compared to nisin alone (Li et al. 2018).

The authors note that the specificity and activity observed for the hybrid peptide makes it an interesting potential candidate in the treatment of C. difficile infections, avoiding side effects and protecting the normal gut microbiota (Cebri\u00e1n et al. 2019).", "Nisin as a modulator of the gut microbiota", "Nisin as a modulator of the gut microbiota", "It is now becoming increasingly clear that the gut microbiome is integral to human health (Mousa et al. 2017, Garcia-Gutierrez et al. 2019a). Indeed, maintaining a healthy gut microbiome could be considered as a new therapeutic target since any significant imbalance could contribute to the development or progression of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity and infection by intestinal pathogens such as C. difficile (Duan et al. 2022). Enteric diseases in farm animals are also a cause of significant economic losses in the agribusiness sector. Furthermore, treating such diseases accounts for considerable antibiotic use in both humans and animals that not only has the potential to adversely affect the composition and function of the gut microbiome, but also encourages the selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. It would, therefore, be advantageous to be able to modulate the gut microbiota to selectively target or deplete undesirable microbes without impacting the beneficial microbes. Bacteriocins are gaining credibility as precise modulators of the human microbiome (O\u2019Connor et al. 2020b). Indeed, several recent studies provide comprehensive evidence that bacteriocins and bacteriocin-producing bacteria can be used to modify the gut microbiota, making them an attractive strategy to address gut-related diseases and disorders (Guinane et al. 2016, Umu et al. 2016, 2017, Lawrence et al. 2022). Bacteriocins could address some of the issues associated with conventional antibiotics and significant research is ongoing to elucidate any role they could play within the gastrointestinal tract, their ability to inhibit pathogens as well as any potential functions in safeguarding host health (Heilbronner et al. 2021). Several recent studies have investigated the capacity of nisin, either by direct application or secreted by in situ bacteria, to influence the gut microbiota and/or to control specific pathogens associated with chronic intestinal diseases. For example, it was evident that nisin, when supplemented in the diet of poultry, can beneficially modulate the gastrointestinal ecology and enhance growth performance (J\u00f3zefiak et al. 2013, Kieronczyk et al. 2017, 2020). Similar effects were observed in rabbit models (Laukov\u00e1 et al. 2014). Likewise, nisin treatments elicited significant changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota in a bacterial diarrhoea mouse model by increasing favourable species such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium while reducing pathogenic strains of E. coli and Enterococcus spp (Jia et al. 2018). More recently, when nisin was used as a feed additive in aquaculture it was shown to alter the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota of common carp (Ke et al. 2021), bream (Moroni et al. 2021), and flounder (Nguyen et al. 2018).", "It is now becoming increasingly clear that the gut microbiome is integral to human health (Mousa et al. 2017, Garcia-Gutierrez et al. 2019a).

Antibiotic use is a major risk factor for developing a C. difficile infection as a result of changes to the gut microbiota that allow C. difficile to proliferate and cause recurrent C. difficile-associated diarrhoea and intestinal inflammatory disease (collectively designated C. difficile infection or CDI). The standard treatment for CDI is use of the antibiotics fidaxomicin, metronidazole, or vancomycin, although none of these antibiotics are fully effective (Czepiel et al. 2019). In comparative studies carried out with nisin, vancomycin, and metronidazole against\u00a0>60 clinical C. difficile isolates, the results revealed that nisin was the most effective of the three antimicrobials tested. Nisin was more potent as observed by its overall MIC90 of 0.256\u00a0mg/l while both vancomycin and metronidazole had MIC90s of 0.8\u00a0mg/l (Bartoloni et al. 2004). Furthermore, nisin A was shown to significantly reduce C. difficile spore viability in liquid suspension following 1 hour of treatment (Lay et al. 2016).", "Nisin has also been considered for its therapeutic potential in targeting the gut pathogen C. difficile.

Nisin A (in the form of Nisaplin\u00ae) proved to be an effective inhibitor of C. difficile, achieving over a 100-fold reduction in cell numbers when used at 76\u00a0\u00b5mol/l (equivalent to 20X MIC) in a simulated human colon system (consisting of a cell immobilized and continuous fermentation single-stage reactor to simulate the proximal, transverse, and distal colons; Cinquin et al. 2004, Le Lay et al. 2015). The treatment also brought about significant alterations to the microbial composition whereby Gram-positive bacteria were notably disturbed. Indeed, Ruminococcaceae were most impacted in that they underwent an almost 4-log reduction, while Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Leuconostocaceae groups as well as bifidobacteria were less affected (Le Lay et al. 2015). Although an increase in the Gram-negative population (Bacteroidetes and Enterobacteriaceae) was also noted, the initial balance was restored 24 hours after nisin addition. In the same study, a L. lactis nisin producer, which was shown to persist and proliferate in the model colon, was ineffective against C. difficile, most likely due to the inability of the strain to generate a sufficient quantity of peptide in these conditions to inhibit the pathogen (Le Lay et al. 2015).", "To evaluate nisin in conditions that more closely mimic the GIT and as a consequence observe the effects on the total microbiota, researchers have explored its ability to inhibit or kill C. difficile in model colon systems (Le Lay et al. 2015, O\u2019Reilly et al. 2022).

The situation is so challenging that VRE have been earmarked by the World Health Organization as a critical target for the identification and development of new antimicrobials and novel approaches to combat infections (AbdelKhalek et al. 2018). Notably, a recent study revealed that administration of a four strain cocktail consisting of Clostridium bolteae, Bacteroides sartorii, B. producta, and Parabacteroides distasonis could reduce the density of enterococci in the colon of infected mice and restore resistance to VRE infection (Caballero et al. 2017).
