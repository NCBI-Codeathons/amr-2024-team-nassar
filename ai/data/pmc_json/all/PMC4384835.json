["", "Synthetic\nbiology offers a new path for the exploitation and improvement\nof natural products to address the growing crisis in antibiotic resistance.\nAll antibiotics in clinical use are facing eventual obsolesce as a\nresult of the evolution and dissemination of resistance mechanisms,\nyet there are few new drug leads forthcoming from the pharmaceutical\nsector. Natural products of microbial origin have proven over the\npast 70 years to be the wellspring of antimicrobial drugs. Harnessing\nsynthetic biology thinking and strategies can provide new molecules\nand expand chemical diversity of known antibiotic scaffolds to provide\nmuch needed new drug leads. The glycopeptide antibiotics offer paradigmatic\nscaffolds suitable for such an approach. We review these strategies\nhere using the glycopeptides as an example and demonstrate how synthetic\nbiology can expand antibiotic chemical diversity to help address the\ngrowing resistance crisis.", "Antibiotics are among the most\nsuccessful drugs discovered and developed over the past century. The\nfirst clinically useful antimicrobial compounds were synthetic molecules\nincluding dyes, organometallic complexes, and structurally simple\naromatic compounds. The discovery and purification of antibiotics\n(a term first used to describe antimicrobial compounds derived from\nliving organisms) such as penicillin, gramicidin, tyrocidine, and\nstreptomycin in the late 1930s and early 1940s ushered in what has\nbecome known as the Golden Age of antibiotics: a decade and a half\nwhere the products of microbial secondary metabolism were systematically\nscreened for antibiotic activity.1 The\nvast majority of chemical scaffolds in current clinical use can be\ntraced back to this relatively short period of time. The remarkable\nrichness of microbial natural products as sources of antibiotics reflects\nthe fact that they are products of evolution, selected over millennia\nfor interaction with biological targets. When compared to synthetic\nmolecules that are generally the result of experimental campaigns\nbased on chemical diversity that is readily accessible in the lab,\nthe privileged nature of microbially derived natural products as antibiotics\nbecomes clear.", "A hallmark of antibiotic natural products is\ntheir chemical diversity\nand complexity (Figure 1). This chemical diversity\nis based on the production of chemical scaffolds consisting of peptide,\npolyketide, carbohydrate, alkaloid, or terpene backbones that serve\nas the core structure. These scaffolds are then modified by a variety\nof chemical reactions catalyzed by a broad spectrum of tailoring enzymes\nthat are co-produced with the scaffold assembly machinery. Scaffold-tailoring\nreactions include isomerization and racemization, reduction and oxidation\n(including hydroxylation), as well as group transfer such as acylation,\nmethylation, glycosylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, and halogenation.2 As a result the end products are often chemically\ncomplex, stereochemically intricate, and rich in hydrogen bond donors\nand acceptors. For example, the antibiotic erythromycin has 18 chiral\ncenters compared to none for the synthetic antibiotic ciprofloxacin.\nMoreover the macrocyclic polyketide scaffold of erythromycin, 6-deoxyerythronolide,\nis further modified by glycosylation by two unusual carbohydrates\nthat contribute to bioactivity and bioavailability to complete the\nantibiotic. Nature\u2019s ability to generate a large number of\nnatural product scaffolds, including the combination of scaffolds\nto produce hybrids, and to tailor them in combinatorial fashion results\nin near limitless bioactive chemical diversity. Nevertheless, despite\nthe proven track record of natural products in drug and antibiotic\ndiscovery, they have largely been abandoned by the pharmaceutical\nsector in favor of large libraries of synthetic molecules.", "Figure 1Chemical diversity\nand complexity of antibiotics in nature. Antibiotics\nderived from microbial sources are rich in chiral centers and hydrogen\nbond donors and acceptors and span an order of magnitude in molecular\nweight.", "Chemical diversity\nand complexity of antibiotics in nature. Antibiotics\nderived from microbial sources are rich in chiral centers and hydrogen\nbond donors and acceptors and span an order of magnitude in molecular\nweight.", "The rich bioactivity of natural\nproducts is the result of chemical\ndiversity that is intrinsically compatible with interaction with proteins,\nnucleic acids, and membranes under physiological conditions and fine-tuned\nby natural selection. It is therefore not surprising then that natural\nproducts and their derivatives dominate the molecules that find use\nas drugs and drug leads including antibiotics.3,4 Yet\ndespite their success, the drug discovery sector has turned away from\nthese molecules over the past two decades in favor of small synthetic\nmolecules. As outlined by Li and Vederas,4 the reasons for the abandonment of natural products by the pharmaceutical\nindustry are multifactorial, yet there are two significant reasons\nfor the current emphasis on small synthetic molecules over natural\nproducts. First is the limited number of natural scaffolds discovered\nthat have proven suitable for downstream antibiotic development. Second\nare the significant technical challenges in the identification, purification,\nsynthesis, and scale up production of natural products for the preparation\nof diverse libraries suitable for screening and lead optimization.\nOn the other hand, synthetic and combinatorial chemistry provide tractable\nmolecules that, while often lacking in innate bioactivity, can be\nreadily modified in the lab by medicinal chemists. Drug discovery\nfirms therefore have largely chosen to forego the rich bioactivity\nof natural products, and their associated chemical challenges, in\nfavor of the predictable outcomes of synthetic chemistry. The fruits\nof this emphasis on synthetic molecules are evident in the absence\nof new antibiotics brought to market over the past 20 years.", "There is a growing clinical need for new antibiotics that is driven\nby the emergence and prevalence of multidrug resistance.5 As noted by Fischbach and Walsh, our current\narsenal of broad spectrum antibiotics is dominated by only four major\nscaffolds:6 cephalosporins, penicillins,\nquinolones, and macrolides, all of which were discovered almost half\na century ago. Other distinct chemical scaffolds are also important,\namong them glycopeptides, lipopeptides, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines,\nbut these generally have more narrow application than the \u201cbig\nfour\u201d. The innovation gap in new antibiotic scaffold identification\nover the past 50 years has been obscured by the great success in tailoring\nof existing scaffolds either by the discovery of natural variants\nor by medicinal chemical modification in the lab. The challenges faced\nby antibiotic field are emblematic of a general crisis in the generation\nof new bioactive chemical matter in drug discovery.", "Fortunately,\nnew genomic technologies including rapid and low-cost\nDNA sequencing and a growing understanding of the mechanistic details\nof natural product biosynthesis, along with innovation in chemical\nsynthesis and analytical methods, can be combined to expand bioactive\nchemical diversity in a fashion that is compatible with high-throughput\ntechnology and begin to overcome the innovation gap in antibiotic\ndiscovery. In order to fully exploit the privileged nature of natural\nproducts in antibiotic drug discovery, what is required is the ability\nto rapidly identify scaffolds, tailor them using a collection of modifying\nenzymes, and rapidly purify the resulting compounds in sufficient\nquantity to generate libraries of molecules suitable for high-throughput\nscreening. The rise of synthetic biology offers a tremendous opportunity\nto address these issues. At the same time, medicinal chemical modification\nof natural product scaffolds and de novo compound\nsynthesis of new natural product-inspired scaffolds will increase\nthe value of synthetic libraries in drug discovery.", "Synthetic Biology\nand Antibiotics", "Synthetic Biology\nand Antibiotics", "Natural products are genetically encoded\nsmall molecules.

The CH999 strain of S. coelicolor, with most of the actinorhodin cluster removed,\nwas among the first designer strains developed as a \u201cclean\u201d\nhost dedicated for expression of foreign natural product clusters.\nSeveral tools and techniques have been evolved or adapted (such as E. coli-Streptomyces artificial chromosomes, Transformation\nAssociated Recombination, ReDirect technology among others)60\u221262 over the years that benefit the process. During this time, a phenomenal\naccomplishment was achieved when the Khosla group and colleagues at\nKosan successfully expressed the genes necessary for the biosynthesis\nof the erythromycin polyketide scaffold (6-deoxyerythronolide) from Saccharopolyspora erythrea in E. coli.\nTo achieve this, they reengineered the E. coli strain\nand added appropriate promoters to the biosynthetic genes, which could\nbe readily identified by the host system. Genes for alternate substrates\nrequired for building the polyketide, absent in E. coli, were also added.63 Various bacterial\nhost systems besides Streptomyces and E.\ncoli such as Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Myxococcus xanthus, and others have been developed\nover the years.64 In the post genomics\nera the enormous natural product wealth of the Actinomycetes has been\nunleashed. It has opened the genome-wide view of strains and developed\npatterns that reveal a relatively conserved essential genomic core\nand dispensable arms with natural product pathways. On the basis of\nsuch information and advances in molecular engineering, improved host\nsystems have been developed in recent years, including a genome minimized\nstrain of S. avermitilis where 1.4 Mb of the dispensable\ngenomic region has been removed to develop an efficient and versatile\nhost.15 The genome reduction channels metabolic\nresources toward the production of heterologous molecules as was shown\nwith streptomycin and cephamycin C overproduction. Similarly the M1154\nstrain of S. coelicolor has been developed by Bibb\u2019s\ngroup at John Innes Centre, where the four major secondary metabolite\npathways (act, red, cdA, cpk) have been systematically deleted generating\na host with greater heterologous biosynthetic potential.18 Further, mutations in rpoB and rpsL genes that stimulate secondary metabolite production\ndiscovered by the Ochi group65 have also\nbeen incorporated in this strain, further improving heterologous expression.\nAnother strain of S. coelicolor devoid of all of\nthe 10 PKS and NRPS biosynthetic pathways in the strain, along with\n900 kb subtelomeric DNA, has also been recently developed offering\nyet more potential biosynthetic capacity as an efficient chassis for\nsynthetic biology.66", "In the current\nscenario, the best available option for development\nof a GPA synthetic biology platform is to build a genomic library\nof a producer using one of the E. coli-Streptomyces artificial chromosomes (pPAC-S2, pSTREPTOBAC V, pSBAC).67 The advantage of using such a system instead\nof a cosmid vector lies in its capacity to carry large \u201cpayload\u201d\n(up to 300 kb) enough to accommodate virtually any bacterial natural\nproduct biosynthetic apparatus in a single clone.
