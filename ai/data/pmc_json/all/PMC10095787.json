["The balance between anabolism and catabolism is disrupted with aging, with the rate of anabolism being faster than that of catabolism. Therefore, mTOR, whose major function is to enhance anabolism and inhibit catabolism, has become a potential target of inhibition for anti-aging therapy. Interestingly, it was found that the downregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway had a lifespan-extending effect resembling calorie restriction. In addition, the mTOR signaling pathway promotes cell proliferation and has been regarded as a potential anti-cancer target. Rapamycin and rapalogs, such as everolimus, have proven to be effective in preventing certain tumor growth. Here, we reviewed the basic knowledge of mTOR signaling, including both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Then, for anti-aging, we cited a lot of evidence to discuss the role of targeting mTOR and its anti-aging mechanism. For cancer therapy, we also discussed the role of mTOR signaling in different types of cancers, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tumor immunity, etc. In short, we discussed the research progress and both the advantages and disadvantages of targeting mTOR in anti-aging and anti-cancer therapy. Hopefully, this review may promote more ideas to be generated for developing inhibitors of mTOR signaling to fight cancer and extend lifespan.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP or SKS) is a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) that controls cell growth, metabolism, survival, immune responses and so on. mTOR forms two complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 consists of six subunits (Figure 1A\u2013D): mTOR (including Horn, Bridge, FAT, FRB and the kinase domains), raptor (regulatory protein associated with mTOR), mLST8 (mammalian lethal with Sec13 protein 8, also known as GBL or WAT1), PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa), DEPTOR (containing the PDZ domain and the DEP domain tandem, DEPt), and FKBP12, which binds to the FRB domain of mTOR (Figure 1C). On the other hand, mTORC2 consists of mTOR, rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), mSin1, mLST8, and DEPTOR (Figure 1E,F). The structures and functions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 are conserved in eukaryotes, such as yeast, worms, flies, and mammals. Raptor promotes the recruitment of substrates to mTORC1 by binding to the TOR signaling (TOS) group on the substrates. mLST8 may stabilize the kinase activation loop of mTOR. PRAS40 is a raptor-interacting protein and inhibits mTORC1. DEPTOR, which is an mTOR-binding protein, can inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2. mSin1 is critical for the insulin-dependent regulation of mTORC2 activity, with its PH domain inhibiting the catalytic activity of mTORC2 in the absence of insulin. mTORC2 can modulate the phosphorylation of protein kinase C\u03b1 and the actin cytoskeleton. mTORC1, but not mTORC2, is inhibited by the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex.

In contrast, mTORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin treatment.", "The major functions of mTORC1 are to promote anabolism and to inhibit catabolism. mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP). mTORC1 also promotes lipid synthesis via the sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factor. Meanwhile, mTORC1 can promote the synthesis of nucleotides by the ATF4-dependent expression of methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2), and S6K1-dependent activated carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CAD). Additionally, mTORC1 can also promote a shift in glucose metabolism by increasing the translation of the transcription factor HIF1\u03b1. mTORC1 regulates cell growth and metabolism, while mTORC2 mainly controls proliferation and survival by phosphorylating certain members of the AGC family of protein kinases, including PKA, PKG and PKC. Compared with mTORC1, mTORC2 mainly acts as an effector of insulin/PI3K signaling. Vellai et al. first revealed the key role of mTOR in aging in 2003 [1]. In recent decades, lifespan extension by inhibiting the mTOR pathway has been proved by more and more evidence. In addition, the activity of mTOR is also frequently deregulated in many kinds of human cancers, such as breast, lung, liver, prostate, renal and pancreatic cancers.

Anti-Aging by Targeting mTOR", "Apparently, the mTOR signaling pathway is a key anti-aging target, and there has been much supporting evidence. Mice with two hypomorphic (mTOR\u25b3/\u25b3) alleles, 129S1 and C57BL/6Ncr, expressed mTOR at approximately 25% of the wild-type levels and exhibited an approximately 20% increase in median survival through reduced mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity [3]. Even though the mTOR\u25b3/\u25b3 mice were smaller than the wild-type mice, they did not show any difference in food intake, glucose homeostasis, or metabolic rate. Consistent with their increased lifespan, mTOR\u25b3/\u25b3 mice exhibited a reduction in a number of aging tissue biomarkers. Attenuated mTORC1 signaling is sufficient to extend lifespan independent of alterations in glucose homeostasis, as in female mice, but not male mice, heterozygous in mTOR or mLST8 (mtor+/\u2212 or mlst8+/\u2212) exhibited reduced mTORC1 activity and prolonged lifespan but still maintained normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity [4]. In female mice, but not male mice, the deletion of s6k1 leads to increased lifespan and resistance to age-related diseases, such as bone diseases, immune system dysfunction, and a loss of insulin sensitivity [5]. The deletion of s6k1 induced gene expression patterns similar to those seen in caloric restriction (CR) or those with pharmacological activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a conserved metabolic regulator in response to CR [5]. The lifespan of tsc1-overexpressed female mice, but not male mice, was significantly increased. A modest increase in TSC1 overexpression can enhance overall health, especially cardiovascular health, and improve female survival [6]. Garratt et al. found that only males with acarbose and 17-\u03b1 estradiol treatment obtained lifespan extension.

Kaeberlein et al. found that the dietary restriction of tor1\u25b3 or sch9\u25b3 failed to increase lifespan in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [8]. This result suggests that the benefits of dietary restriction and the downregulation of mTORC1 at least partially overlap [9]. However, several studies also demonstrated TOR-independent longevity activated by dietary restriction. What is more, rapamycin can extend the lifespan beyond the maximum level induced by dietary restriction. Rapamycin is specific for inhibiting mTORC1, and thus it enables us to investigate mTOR\u2019s anti-aging mechanism using rapamycin. Bjedov et al. showed that feeding rapamycin to adult Drosophila extended the lifespan through the downregulation of S6K activity and the upregulation of 4E-BP1 activity [10]. In addition to lifespan extension, rapamycin also increases stress resistance and reduces fecundity. Rapamycin mediates lifespan extension independent of insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) and AMPK. In addition, rapamycin also promotes autophagy and decreases protein translation. Autophagy is activated under nutrient-limited conditions and is inhibited by mTOR activity through the inhibitory phosphorylation of autophagy-initiating kinases ULK1 (ATG1) [11], ULK2, ATG13, FIP200 [12], and lysosome-localized TFEB [13].

Demaria et al. demonstrated that the senescence of non-tumor cells could help tumor growth and metastasis, and they showed that eliminating senescent cells could reduce chemotherapy side effects, such as bone marrow suppression, cardiac dysfunction, cancer recurrence, and fatigue [17]. These results suggested that reducing SASP may contribute to reducing chemotherapy side effects and extending lifespan. Baker et al. found that clearing senescent cells improves aging-related phenotypes [18,19]. Carroll et al. found that mTORC1 can be constitutively active and resists serum and amino acid starvation due to stress, replication failure, or oncogene activation in senescent human fibroblasts [20]. They thought that this was caused in part by the depolarization of the plasma membrane of senescent cells, which leads to defects in primary cilia and failure to suppress growth factor signaling. Furthermore, increased autophagy and high levels of intracellular amino acids may support mTORC1 activity under starvation conditions. Hence, they suggested that the inhibition of mTORC1 can contribute to the cleaning of senescent cells and delaying aging. Walters et al. showed that the acute short-term treatment of human skin fibroblasts with low-dose ATP-mimicking pan-mTORC inhibitor AZD8055 reversed many of the phenotypes that developed as cells approached replicative senescence, including reduced cell size and granularity, the loss of SA-\u03b2-gal staining, and the regaining spindle-shaped morphology of fibroblasts [21]. AZD8055 treatment also induced rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, which provided a possible explanation for the observed rejuvenation. Their finding suggests that the combined inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 may be a promising strategy to reverse the development of senescence-associated traits in near-senescent cells.

Feng et al. demonstrated that p53, a tumor suppressor, regulates the mTOR pathway through AMPK activation and the TSC1/TSC2 complex and regulates autophagy [55]. They concluded that the p53 and mTOR pathways could cross-talk and coordinately regulate cell growth, proliferation, and death. While the regulation of protein synthesis is largely attributed to mTORC1, mTORC2 regulates members of the AGC kinase family and is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and diabetes. It was reported that growth factors activate mTORC2 through PI3K signaling [56,57,58]. Recent evidence suggests that activated mTORC2 is physically associated with ribosomes, and insulin-stimulated PI3K signaling promotes the binding between mTORC2 and ribosomes, suggesting that ribosomes are involved in the activation of mTORC2 [59]. mTORC2 promotes cell survival through Akt and mediates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton [60,61]. It was found that ribosomes were upstream of TORC2, and mNIP7 deletion inhibited TORC2 kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. These data suggested that the disruption of the mTORC2-ribosome supercomplex selectively induced apoptosis in PTEN-deficient melanoma cells. The observation that mTORC2 was required for tumor progression in some cancers suggested that myc and ribosomes may promote tumorigenicity by stimulating mTORC2 and its downstream effector, Akt [62,63,64]. Moreover, it was suggested that TORC1 indirectly controls TORC2 via the activation of ribosome biogenesis and the inhibition of autophagy-induced ribosome turnover. Sarbassov et al. also reported that long-term rapamycin treatment indirectly inhibits mTORC2 [65]. Thus, blocking the mTORC2-ribosome interaction could be an effective strategy for the treatment of melanoma, colon cancer, and possibly other cancers. Gulhati et al. showed that rapamycin significantly decreased the proliferation of certain sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (rapamycin sensitive), whereas other cell lines were resistant to its effects (rapamycin resistant). siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rictor, one of the mTORC2 subunits, significantly decreased the proliferation of both rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-resistant CRC cells. Furthermore, the stable downregulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 reduced the proliferation and cell cycle progression in rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-resistant CRCs, whereas only the downregulation of mTORC2 increased apoptosis in rapamycin-resistant CRCs [63].

Studies of prostate cancer have shown that the most common targets of increased translation through mTOR are those involved in invasion, metastasis, and protein synthesis [75,76]. mTOR is deregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human prostate cancers, and genetic studies in mouse models suggest that mTOR is overactivated during prostate cancer initiation [62,75,77,78,79]. Once activated, mTORC1 phosphorylates elongation initiation factor (eIF)-4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which promote translation. Increased cap-dependent translation caused by aberrant mTORC1 activation leads to increased cell size and proliferation, which are two common hallmarks of cancer [80,81]. Liu et al. found that mutations of key Sin1 residues mediating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) interactions inactivate mTORC2, whereas patient-derived mutations in the Sin1-PH domain pathologically increased mTORC2 activity, promoting cell growth and tumor formation [82]. Now, AKT has been reported as one of the most frequently highly activated proteins in cancer. AKT integrates signals from PI3K/mTORC2 and PI3K/PDK1 to promote cell growth and survival.

The combination of mTOR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies, such as NK cells, Car-T cells, PD-1 inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors (Table 1), could be considered. In fact, many pharmaceutical companies have been working toward this direction.", "Disclaimer/Publisher\u2019s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
