Currently, the ergosterol-targeting Amphotericin B (AmB) and the DNA/RNA-synthesis inhibitor 5-flucytosine (5-FC) are the two main drugs available for first-line defense against life-threatening Candida auris infections. However, important aspects of their mechanisms of action require further clarification, especially regarding metabolic reactions of yeast cells. Here, we applied Raman spectroscopy empowered with specifically tailored machine-learning algorithms to monitor and to image in situ the susceptibility of two Candida auris clades to different antifungal drugs (LSEM 0643 or JCM15448T, belonging to the East Asian Clade II; and, LSEM 3673 belonging to the South African Clade III). Raman characterizations provided new details on the mechanisms of action against Candida auris Clades II and III, while also unfolding differences in their metabolic reactions to different drugs. AmB treatment induced biofilm formation in both clades, but the formed biofilms showed different structures: a dense and continuous biofilm structure in Clade II, and an extra-cellular matrix with a \u201cfluffy\u201d and discontinuous structure in Clade III. Treatment with 5-FC caused no biofilm formation but yeast-to-hyphal or pseudo-hyphal morphogenesis in both clades. Clade III showed a superior capacity in reducing membrane permeability to the drug through chemically tailoring chitin structure with a high degree of acetylation and fatty acids networks with significantly elongated chains. This study shows the suitability of the in situ Raman method in characterizing susceptibility and stress response of different C. auris clades to antifungal drugs, thus opening a path to identifying novel clinical solutions counteracting the spread of these alarming pathogens.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Invasive candidiasis associated with biofilm formation is a fungal infection of difficult therapeutic management, further complicated by the rise of species with strong resistance against antifungal drugs (Sato et al., 2009; Cavalheiro and Teixeira, 2018; Pappas et al., 2018). Fungal colonization contributes to lower lung function and might lead to severe lung disease (Sato et al., 2009). Since different fungal species differ in drug resistance characteristics (Ademe and Girma, 2020; Dahiya et al., 2020), prompt diagnosis of Candida species and accurate susceptibility monitoring of antifungal resistance are key diagnostic essentials.", "Invasive candidiasis associated with biofilm formation is a fungal infection of difficult therapeutic management, further complicated by the rise of species with strong resistance against antifungal drugs (Sato et al., 2009; Cavalheiro and Teixeira, 2018; Pappas et al., 2018).

C. auris genotypes, which specialize to particular geological areas, frequently exhibit multidrug-resistance with specific clades displaying unusual sensitivity profile. C. auris is comprehensive of five distinct clades, classified according to where the first isolate of the clade was reported: South Asian (Clade I), East Asian (Clade II), African (Clade III), South American (Clade IV), and Iranian (Clade V) (Chow et al., 2019; Welsh et al., 2019). These clades possess specific genetic and biochemical characteristics, which link to their response to different drugs (Forsberg et al., 2019; Guadalupe Frias-De and Martinez-Herrera, 2020). It should be noted that misidentifications and inconsistent results from commercialized kits often complicate candidiasis management, lead to treatment failure, and potentially amplify multidrug-resistance risks (Snayd et al., 2018). Given the progressively recorded spread of C. auris into an increasing number of countries, measures of preventive control, and deeper knowledge of physiological responses to specific drugs are paramount to counteract lethal effects and to interrupt transmission.", "Among Candida species, the multi-drug resistant pathogenic Candida auris (C. auris) (Sato et al., 2009) can cause nosocomial infections in immunocompromised persons.

However, the predominant vibrational contributions of CH3, CH2, and CH groups can be distinguished, which gives hints for identifying structural features in specific structural context, as discussed later. Deconvolution into Lorentzian-Gaussian sub-bands in the high-frequency zone was made according to Borchman et al. (1999) and Kolijenovic et al. (2005). This spectral zone is basically comprehensive of eight sub-bands: at 2,820 cm\u22121 (CH2 symmetric stretching in fatty lipids) at ~2,850 cm\u22121 (CH2 symmetric stretching in fatty acids) and its Fermi resonance at ~2,886 cm\u22121, at 2,900 cm\u22121 (CH stretching), at ~2,935 cm\u22121 (chain-end CH3 symmetric stretching), at ~2,960 cm\u22121 (out-of-plane chain end and anti-symmetric CH3 stretching), at 2,995 cm\u22121 (=CH stretching), and at 3,010 cm\u22121 (unsaturated =CH stretching). Two additional weak bands could be seen at ~3,056 and 3,100 cm\u22121, which can be assigned to OH and NH stretching vibrations. Small fluctuations in frequency for the above band components might arise from differences in the molecular structures in which the bonds are comprised.

Additional Amide I band components, seen as shoulders at 1,615~1,620 and 1,687 cm\u22121, are believed to arise from different chitin secondary structures or defects in small crystalline chitin fibrils (Focher et al., 1992). Using the relative intensities of the Amide III (C-N stretching and N-H bending) or 956 cm\u22121 (C-CH3 deformation) bands (the latter labeled with an asterisk in Figures 4, 5), it is possible to estimate the degree of chitin acetylation, the higher the intensity the higher the fraction of acetylated chitin chains (Zhang et al., 2012). Moreover, as mentioned above, the Amide I doublet represent vibrations from C=O bonds linked by hydrogen bonds to either NH or C-OH groups (Minke and Blackwell, 1978). Therefore, the relative amount of hydrogen bonds linked to C=O groups is represented by the areas under the respective Amide I bands. Based on the above structural interpretation of amide-related vibrations, it becomes clear that the treatment with AmB enhanced the presence of chitin structures with a higher degree of acetylation as compared to untreated clades. However, while an almost constant intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio (0.34 vs.0.32) was preserved in Clade II, such ratio dropped by ~30% in Clade III upon drug exposure. An additional feature in the high-frequency zone was a clear increase in relative intensity of the C=O and O-C=O ester bands at ~1,730 and 1,750 cm\u22121, respectively, in both clades (cf. Figures 4, 5).

An analysis of the Amide I doublet at 1,625 (intermolecular C=O\u2026HN chitin bonds) and 1,650 cm\u22121 (intramolecular C=O\u2026HO(C6) and C=O\u2026HN chitin bonds) revealed that both clades experienced a clear increase in the intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio upon drug exposure. A clear increase in relative intensity of the C=O ester band (at 1,745 cm\u22121) upon 5-FC treatment could only be recorded in Clade III (cf. Figures 4C, 5C).", "Similar to the case of treatment with AmB, the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of glucan structures switched from the value of ~1 characteristic of both unexposed clades to a common value of 0.66 after 5-FC exposure. The enrichment in \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans together with the increased content of chitin could yet be interpreted as a physiological reaction of both clades to drug exposure, in the attempt to stiffen the membrane. Note, however, that the observed change in glucan structure could also be partly related to yeast-to-hyphae morphogenesis (cf. Figures 1c,g for Clades II and III, respectively).

Upon AmB treatment, we observed a clear split of the low-frequency ergosterol band at 594 cm\u22121 into two sub-bands at 585~588 and 603 cm\u22121, and a clear reduction of the 713 cm\u22121 band. These characteristics were consistent for both clades (cf. Figure 9A). Even assigning the entire intensity reduction of the 713 cm\u22121 band to ergosterol, this cannot necessarily represent an inhibition of ergosterol synthesis but is rather be the spectroscopic consequence of ring constraint. Structural constraints might arise from ergosterol binding with the mycosamine group of the AmB molecule and its subsequent alignment along the side of the AmB lactone ring with multiple conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds (cf. Figure 10A) (Gray et al., 2012). The invariance in the intensities of other bands related to ergosterol supports this interpretation. On the other hand, splitting of the 594 cm\u22121 ring-related band should be interpreted as a modification of the ergosterol structure and a signature of the detoxifying action developed by yeast cells to scavenge oxygen radicals (Moradas-Ferreira and Costa, 2000). The observed split indeed points at the presence of ergosteryl ester with its related fatty acid tails (cf. Figure 10A) (Krafft et al., 2005). Sterol ester metabolism in Candida species is known to enable yeasts to modulate the level of free sterol at different stages of growth (Mullner and Daum, 2004). The present study newly suggests that such modulation also takes place in both C. auris clades when yeast needs to build a biofilm in defense against AmB. In strong support of this interpretation are: (i) the observed intensification of the ester band at 2,980 cm\u22121 and of the unsaturated =CH stretching band at 3,010 cm\u22121 (cf. Figures 7A\u2013D); and, (ii) the enhanced intensity of C=O stretching and O-C=O stretching at 1,730 and 1,750 cm\u22121, respectively, (cf. Figures 4B, 5B). Note that both these spectral features fit with the hypothesized increase in ergosteryl ester (cf. Figure 10B). Candida yeasts have also been reported to increase the amount of unsaturated lipids as a strategy to minimize the effect of interdigitated phases (Vanegas et al., 2012). Moreover, the observation of strong lipid signals outside the yeast cells (cf. Raman maps in Figures 8C,D) suggests an intensification in the production lipid droplets composed of triacylglycerides and steryl esters (Leber et al., 1994). Steryl ester in yeast contains a high content of fatty acids (i.e., accounting for ~75% of the total sterol content) (Madyastha and Parks, 1969; Hunter and Rose, 1972). Chang et al. (2015) have reported that trapping of endogenous toxins (i.e., self-secreted proteins and glycoproteins) by lipid droplets represents a self-resistance mechanism and acts to quench the production of reactive oxygen species. Those researchers clearly showed that, in Candida yeasts, neutral lipids and lipophilic agents of the droplets trap toxins and quench the formation of reactive oxygen species. Based on the above interpretation and the present results, one could argue that oxygen radicals were produced by the clades in response to the formation of toxins produced upon AmB treatment. Yeast cells then attempted to escape oxidative damage by compartmentalizing toxins into lipid droplets with the consequent sequestration of oxygen radical formation. In sum, the diffuse signals of ergosterol detected by Raman molecular imaging suggest the following events in reaction to AmB interdigitation stress: (a) stimulating the formation of lipid droplets, and (b) supporting the generation of ergosteryl ester and, possibly, of other neutral lipids. Regarding the unsolved dualism between occurrence of AmB autoxidation or cell-produced toxic radicals in response to AmB, note that the present Raman results could not support the thesis of AmB autoxidation, since no difference could be found between AmB Raman signals before and after interactions with C. auris clades (cf. AmB spectrum in Figure 6D with the strong and sharp AmB signals in Figures 4B, 5B). The extensive formation of lipid droplets and the Raman signatures for ergosteryl ester and elongated fatty acid tails point instead at a detoxifying action developed by yeast cells to scavenge self-produced oxygen radicals.", "The present in situ Raman data gives us a chance to discuss in details the reaction of C. auris clades to AmB, including the actual origin and the effects of oxidative damage. Upon AmB treatment, we observed a clear split of the low-frequency ergosterol band at 594 cm\u22121 into two sub-bands at 585~588 and 603 cm\u22121, and a clear reduction of the 713 cm\u22121 band. These characteristics were consistent for both clades (cf. Figure 9A). Even assigning the entire intensity reduction of the 713 cm\u22121 band to ergosterol, this cannot necessarily represent an inhibition of ergosterol synthesis but is rather be the spectroscopic consequence of ring constraint.

In particular, the split of the 1,112 cm\u22121 band into two sub-bands at 1,100 and 1,107 cm\u22121 in Clade III could be interpreted as a fingerprint for the formation of allomorphs with symmetric stretching vibrations from glycosidic C-O-C groups (Schenzel and Fischer, 2001).

Filamentous growth transition in C. auris has been observed upon growth in NaCl-rich yeast extracted-peptone-dextrose medium (Wang et al., 2018), upon deletion of heat shock molecular chaperone protein (Kim et al., 2019), or upon passaging through a mammalian host (Yue et al., 2018). The present study showed that treatment with 5-FC induced hyphal-like phenotype transition in both Clades II and III, which from the one hand helps explain their success as highly virulent pathogens and, on the other hand, gives hints on their emergent resistance to this drug.", "In addition to confirming the 5-FC mechanism of action, Raman spectroscopy revealed important details as well as differences in the metabolic reactions of different clades to the drug. While both clades reacted to 5-FC exposure with a similar overproduction of ergosterol (likely in an attempt to reduce membrane permeability) and chitin (with a clear increase in the intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio), only Clade III produced its enhanced fraction of chitin structure with a high degree of acetylation (cf. Figure 10B). This effect represents a remarkable \u201cchemical\u201d trick for reducing permeability while further increasing membrane stiffness beyond the mere effect of a fractional increase (Motta de Moura et al., 2011). Another remarkable \u201cchemical\u201d ability of Clade III over Clade II was represented by its capacity to increase by nearly a factor 2 the chain length of the produced fatty acids (i.e., the intensity ratio of C-H(CH2) to C-H(CH3) stretching bands, I2850/I2935) in response to 5-FC treatment. Longer fatty acids are indeed more rigid and can greatly reduce membrane fluidity and permeability (Cavalheiro and Teixeira, 2018; Tyler et al., 2019). Because of its \u201cchemical skills\u201d, Clade III could be extremely efficient in developing resistance to 5-FC treatments.", "In addition to confirming the 5-FC mechanism of action, Raman spectroscopy revealed important details as well as differences in the metabolic reactions of different clades to the drug.

(2016) documented the role of hyphal morphogenesis on host cell damage in C. albicans and showed that both yeast and hyphal cells are required for reaching high virulence. In systemic infections, neither yeast-locked strains nor hyperfilamentous mutants are fully virulent, but it is their combination and morphogenic switching capacity that leads to the highest virulence with the two forms fulfilling specific functions during infection: dissemination via blood stream by yeast, adhesion and invasion of host cells by filamentous hyphae. Several independent studies have proposed a direct correlation between the formation of C. albicans hyphae and an enhanced capacity for tissue invasion, damage, and virulence, while the capacity of pseudohyphal forms is yet unclear (Lo et al., 1997; Saville et al., 2003; Gow et al., 2011). In a study on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Mukaremera et al., 2017), yeast cells were found to induce the generation of more inflammatory cytokines than hyphae, while pseudohyphae induced intermediate cytokine levels. This indicates that immune recognition targets more severely yeast cells, while filamentous hyphal cells induce an altered immune response (Gantner et al., 2005; Van Der Graaf et al., 2005; Gow et al., 2011; Moyes et al., 2011). C. auris has also been reported to exhibit cellular polymorphism to produce pseudohyphal cell growth in the presence of genotoxic stress induced by hydroxyurea (Bravo et al., 2020); growth in high salt concentrations also induced cell elongation (Kim et al., 2019). Filamentous or elongated morphologies were also observed in C. auris populations retrieved from murine infection (Yue et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2021). However, hyphal morphogenesis did not occur in a number of circumstances that induce hyphal growth in C. albicans (Wang et al., 2018). The effect of drugs causing genotoxic stress, such as hydroxyurea or methyl methanesulfonate, can trigger an arrest of genetic replication via a cell cycle checkpoint (Pardo et al., 2017). Our present data are in agreement with those reported in Bravo et al. (2020), showing that 5-FC (converted into fluorouracil in the Candida yeast cells) perturbed RNA and DNA biosynthesis causing the growth of pseudohyphal cells in Clade II. By showing morphological differences between Clade II and Clade III treated under the same conditions, we also confirmed that C. auris filamentation is strain dependent (Bravo et al., 2020). However, a new result here is that LSEM 3673 (South African) Clade III was converted into a fully developed hyphal morphology upon 5-FC treatment. This result confirms the capacity of hyphal switching for C. auris so far only observed for yeast passaging through a mammalian body (Yue et al., 2018) or in genetically manipulated morphogenic mutants (Santana and O'Meara, 2021). This latter study revealed a dysregulated chitinase expression, attenuated virulence, and altered antifungal susceptibility in morphogenic mutants. Parallel to genomic analyses, the present study adds molecular structure insight into an enhanced fraction of chitin with high intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio and a high degree of acetylation (cf.

First, tens of spectra were collected with a 20x optical lens to cover relatively large areas of the clade cultures (in the order of mm2) with high spectral resolution, and their average computed for each clade and drug treatment. The obtained average spectra were deconvoluted according to a specifically tailored machine-learning algorithm linked to a database of Raman spectra from elementary molecules. Then, millions of spatially resolved spectra were taken through mapping on more limited areas of the cultures (in the order of 10\u22122 mm2) and converted into Raman hyperspectral images at wavelengths representing selected lipid, polysaccharide, and DNA molecules. These two complementary procedures gave consistent results and unfolded important differences in the way different clades react to different antifungal drug treatments with important implications on cellular morphogenesis, virulence, and drug resistance.", "A twofold spectroscopic approach was followed in performing Raman analyses of C. auris Clades II and III before and after exposure to AmB or 5-FC.

On the other hand, no biofilm formed in any clade upon treatment with 5-FC, but fungal morphogenesis with pseudo-hyphal and hyphal transitions being observed in Clade II and Clade III, respectively. Clade III showed a superior capacity to chemically tailor chitin structure with a high degree of acetylation and fatty acids networks with significantly elongated chains, both structural characteristics greatly reducing membrane permeability to the drug.
