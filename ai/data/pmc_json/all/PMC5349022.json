Microbial Cell\n3(3): 120-125. doi: 10.15698/mic2016.03.485", "Gliotoxin (GT) is a mycotoxin produced by some species of ascomycete fungi\nincluding the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus\nfumigatus. In order to produce GT the host organism needs to have\nevolved a self-protection mechanism. GT contains a redox-cycling disulfide\nbridge that is important in mediating toxicity. Recently is has been\ndemonstrated that A. fumigatus possesses a novel\nthiomethyltransferase protein called GtmA that has the ability to thiomethylate\nGT in vivo, which aids the organism in regulating GT\nbiosynthesis. It has been suggested that thiomethylation of GT and similar\nsulfur-containing toxins may play a role in providing self-protection in host\norganisms. In this work we have engineered Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae, a GT-na\u00efve organism, to express A.\nfumigatus GtmA. We demonstrate that GtmA can readily thiomethylate\nGT in yeast, which results in protection of the organism from exogenous GT. Our\nwork has implications for understanding the evolution of GT self-protection\nmechanisms in organisms that are GT producers and non-producers.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Gliotoxin (GT) is a fungal natural product with known antibiotic and antifungal\nproperties and is biosynthesized by the opportunistic human pathogen,\nAspergillus fumigatus, as well as by related ascomycetes 123.
