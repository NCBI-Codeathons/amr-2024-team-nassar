["Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a serious threat to human health, with few treatment options being available. New therapeutics are urgently needed to relieve the health and economic burdens presented by VRE. A potential target for new therapeutics is the VanRS two-component system, which regulates the expression of vancomycin resistance in VRE. VanS is a sensor histidine kinase that detects vancomycin and in turn activates VanR; VanR is a response regulator that, when activated, directs expression of vancomycin-resistance genes. This review of VanRS examines how the expression of vancomycin resistance is regulated, and provides an update on one of the field\u2019s most pressing questions: How does VanS sense vancomycin?", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "In the early 1950s, the glycopeptide vancomycin was isolated from Amycolatopsis orientalis and soon emerged as a promising new treatment for infections caused by penicillin-resistant staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria [1,2]. Early studies showed that the compound successfully cleared staphylococcal infections and did not induce resistance in serial-passaging experiments [1,3,4]. Thus, vancomycin was greeted as an attractive alternative to penicillin and was swiftly approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1958 [1,5,6]. Impurities present in early vancomycin preparations gave rise to significant toxicity, but improved formulations overcame most of these issues; nonetheless, perceptions about toxicity lingered [1,7]. At the same time, alternatives became available (e.g., methicillin), and as a result vancomycin was used only sparingly until the early 1980s, when the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus prompted its use as an antibiotic of last resort [8,9,10,11,12]. Vancomycin also became a popular treatment option for enterococcal infections, which are tolerant of or resistant to some other antibiotic classes [13,14]. This increased use of vancomycin encouraged the development and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).", "In the early 1950s, the glycopeptide vancomycin was isolated from Amycolatopsis orientalis and soon emerged as a promising new treatment for infections caused by penicillin-resistant staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria [1,2].

Several of the associated gene products work together to alter the d-Ala-d-Ala target of vancomycin, preventing vancomycin binding (Figure 1). In different VRE strains, d-Ala-d-Ala is remodeled to either d-alanyl-d-lactate (d-Ala-d-Lac) or d-alanyl-d-serine (d-Ala-d-Ser), thereby reducing the affinity of vancomycin for its ligand [30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. This remodeling is accomplished by three essential enzymes encoded in the vancomycin-resistance gene cluster: First, either a pyruvate dehydrogenase (VanH) or a serine/alanine racemase (VanT); second, a ligase that joins d-lactate or d-serine to d-alanine (the naming convention for these ligases is described in Section 2.3); and third, a d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase (VanX or VanXY). VanH and VanT convert pyruvate to d-lactate and L-serine to d-serine, respectively [38,39,40], which can then be coupled with d-Ala by the appropriate ligase to form d-Ala-d-Lac or d-Ala-d-Ser [38,39,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53].

The signal sensed by the VanRS TCS is vancomycin, and the response is expression of the vancomycin-resistance genes [147,148]. Upon sensing vancomycin, VanS autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine residue (Figure 3). The phosphoryl group is then transferred to VanR [124,149]. When phosphorylated, VanR is activated and upregulates the transcription of the vancomycin-resistance operon [149,150,151]. In the absence of a vancomycin signal, VanS dephosphorylates VanR, switching off the resistance pathway [148,152,153].

Phosphotransfer from the H-box to the RR is made possible by the binding of the RR to the lower portion of the DHp four-helix bundle [141,182]; this portion of the DHp also contains the X region, which is important for phosphatase activity [181].", "Following the linker region/HAMP domain is the conserved kinase region of the HK, consisting of the DHp and CA domains. These domains are ~70 and ~110 amino acids in length, respectively. The DHp domain earns the first half of its name by contributing to the dimerization of HK protomers; for example, in the EnvZ family of HKs, the DHp domain forms a long helical hairpin, with the two \u03b1-helices of each protomer dimerizing to form a four-helix bundle [177,178]. Rearrangements of this helical bundle permit switching between kinase and phosphatase activities. The first third of the first DHp helix harbors the conserved histidine (His164 in A-type VanS), which is autophosphorylated upon HK activation [179,180]. Situated within the aptly-named H box, this histidine residue is absolutely required for signal transduction [165]. The H-box represents the site at which the CA domain docks, bringing the CA domain into close proximity to the histidine phospho-acceptor [165]. In addition to its importance to the autophosphorylation activity of the HK, the H box is required for phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities [181].
