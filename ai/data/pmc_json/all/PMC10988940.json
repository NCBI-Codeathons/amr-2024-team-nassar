["Surfactin is a cyclic hexalipopeptide compound, nonribosomal synthesized by representatives of the Bacillus subtilis species complex which includes B. subtilis group and its closely related species, such as B. subtilis subsp subtilis, B. subtilis subsp spizizenii, B. subtilis subsp inaquosorum, B. atrophaeus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. velezensis (Steinke mSystems 6: e00057, 2021) It functions as a biosurfactant and signaling molecule and has antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, and plant disease resistance properties. The Bacillus lipopeptides play an important role in agriculture, oil recovery, cosmetics, food processing and pharmaceuticals, but the natural yield of surfactin synthesized by Bacillus is low. This paper reviews the regulatory pathways and mechanisms that affect surfactin synthesis and release, highlighting the regulatory genes involved in the transcription of the srfAA-AD operon. The several ways to enhance surfactin production, such as governing expression of the genes involved in synthesis and regulation of surfactin synthesis and transport, removal of competitive pathways, optimization of media, and fermentation conditions were commented. This review will provide a theoretical platform for the systematic genetic modification of high-yielding strains of surfactin.", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical Abstract", "", "", "Keywords", "Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Recently, biopesticides made by antagonistic Bacillus species or their metabolites have been used to reduce the application of chemical pesticides in agriculture [1].

The biocontrol efficiency of Bacillus strain relies on three main traits: ecological fitness, strong antagonistic activity toward plant pathogens, and an ability to trigger plant immune reaction [6]. The cyclic lipopeptides (LPs) of the surfactin, iturin and fengycin families produced by Bacillus strains are the key biocontrol elements which contribute to the traits mentioned above, especially antagonistic activity of biocontrol agents [6\u20138]. Especially surfactin is a key element in plant-bacteria interactions, enabling the Bacillus cells to form biofilms on plant roots, and to stimulate induced systemic resistance in plants. Cross talks between plants and bacteria are accomplished by a bacterial sensing system for plant pectin leading to enhanced surfactin synthesis in B. velezensis [9]. In addition, surfactin is directly or indirectly involved in several processes of cell differentiation, such as development of competence, motility, matrix production, cannibalism, quorum sensing and endospore formation [10\u201312].", "Recently, biopesticides made by antagonistic Bacillus species or their metabolites have been used to reduce the application of chemical pesticides in agriculture [1].

The NRPS system consists of seven catalytic modules encoded by the genes srfAA, srfAB, srfAC, which is 27\u00a0kb in length [67, 68]. Each catalytic module is responsible for the recognition and condensation of an amino acid, and each module contains several catalytic structural domains: an adenylation (a) structural domain; a peptidyl carrier protein or thiolation (PCP) structural domain; a condensation (C) structural domain; a differential isomerization (E) domain; and a thioesterase (TE) structural domain, which is only present in the termination module [69\u201371]. Module 1 is responsible for the condensation of l-Glu; modules 2, 3, 6, and 7 are responsible for the condensation of l-Leu; module 4 is responsible for the condensation of l-Val; and module 5 is responsible for the condensation of l-Asp. srfAD is a type II thioesterase gene responsible for the cyclization and release of surfactin [72]. Downstream to the srfAA-AD operon, there is a phosphopantothionine ethantransferase (PPTases) gene, encoding the Sfp protein that activates surfactin synthesis [73]. Deletion of the sfp gene results in the inability to synthesize all three classes of lipopeptide antibiotics in Bacillus [74].Fig.\u00a01The surfactin gene cluster (BGC0000433) in B. velezensis FZB42. Transcription of the srfAA-AD operon is governed by the Psrf promoter. The comS gene is embedded within the srfAB gene, and is also transcribed by the Psrf promoter. Three genes, srfAA, srfAB, and srfAC, transcribe the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) SrfAA, SrfAB, SrfAC, and the thioesterase SrfAD. SrfAA contains N-terminally the CS-domain and acylates the first amino acid Glu1 with various fatty acids.

Rapid advances in the application of efficient genetic engineering techniques for the development of high-yielding strains, together with the use of high-cell density and other innovative fermentation techniques, now enable the production of surfactin in a range of 20\u00a0g/L and above. The success story reviewed here could also promote the development of highly efficient production processes for the biosynthesis of other \u201cgreen\u201d compounds which can be used as environmentally friendly tools in sustainable agriculture and industry. Examples include fengycins and iturin-like compounds with antifungal properties, as well as other active ingredients that are useful in biological plant protection.", "In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to unravel the complex network involved in surfactin expression and to optimize the production process for a \u201cgreen\u201d surfactin to an economically attractive level.
