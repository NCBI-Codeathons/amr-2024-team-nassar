Biosynthesis of redox-active gliotoxin in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus has been elucidated over the past 10 years. Some fungi which produce gliotoxin-like molecular species have undergone unexpected molecular rewiring to accommodate this high-risk biosynthetic process. Specific disruption of gliotoxin biosynthesis, via deletion of gliK, which encodes a \u03b3-glutamyl cyclotransferase, leads to elevated intracellular antioxidant, ergothioneine (EGT), levels, and confirms crosstalk between the biosynthesis of both sulfur-containing moieties. Gliotoxin is ultimately formed by gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT-mediated oxidation of dithiol gliotoxin (DTG). In fact, DTG is a substrate for both GliT and a bis-thiomethyltransferase, GtmA. GtmA converts DTG to bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (BmGT), using 2 mol SAM and resultant SAH must be re-converted to SAM via the action of the Methyl/Met cycle. In the absence of GliT, DTG fluxes via GtmA to BmGT, which results in both SAM depletion and SAH overproduction. Thus, the negative regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis via GtmA must be counter-balanced by GliT activity to avoid Methyl/Met cycle dysregulation, SAM depletion and trans consequences on global cellular biochemistry in A. fumigatus. DTG also possesses potent Zn2+ chelation properties which positions this sulfur-containing metabolite as a putative component of the Zn2+ homeostasis system within fungi. EGT plays an essential role in high-level redox homeostasis and its presence requires significant consideration in future oxidative stress studies in pathogenic filamentous fungi. In certain filamentous fungi, sulfur is additionally indirectly required for the formation of EGT and the disulfide-bridge containing non-ribosomal peptide, gliotoxin, and related epipolythiodioxopiperazines. Ultimately, interference with emerging sulfur metabolite functionality may represent a new strategy for antifungal drug development.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Sulfur is an essential element that is incorporated into various cellular metabolites and used for multiple metabolic processes in fungi, including the proteogenic amino acids cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met), oxidative stress defense [glutathione (GSH) and ergothioneine (EGT)], methylation [S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)], epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) toxin biosynthesis (e.g., gliotoxin) and iron metabolism (Fe\u2013S clusters) (Davis et al., 2011; Struck et al., 2012; Amich et al., 2013; Sheridan et al., 2016). Fungi, such as the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, can acquire sulfur either from inorganic or organic sources (Amich et al., 2013). In A. fumigatus, sulfur availability is an important consideration for pathogenesis, as it must be sourced from the environment for fungal survival (Amich et al., 2016). Due to the differences between human and fungal sulfur assimilatory pathways, the enzymes and intermediates produced by fungi represent attractive drug targets to potentially enable treatment of these serious infections. It is also important to note that interplay occurs between many components of these sulfur metabolic pathways with other systems in pathogenic fungi (Yadav et al., 2011). These also present opportunities for antifungal drug target development. In addition to A. fumigatus, the most common human pathogenic fungi are Candida and Cryptococcus spp., and these opportunistic yeast species also possess sulfur uptake and utilization pathways which are often essential for virulence. Hydroxyl radicals can also be dissipated via cellular thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductases (TRR), and glutaredoxin/glutathione reductases, respectively, as elegantly reviewed in Zhang and Feng (2018). Moreover, TRR inhibitors have been proposed as selective antifungal drugs to target A. fumigatus, and TRR also contributes to fungal pathogenicity in Fusarium graminearum (Fan et al., 2019; Marshall et al., 2019).", "Sulfur is an essential element that is incorporated into various cellular metabolites and used for multiple metabolic processes in fungi, including the proteogenic amino acids cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met), oxidative stress defense [glutathione (GSH) and ergothioneine (EGT)], methylation [S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)], epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) toxin biosynthesis (e.g., gliotoxin) and iron metabolism (Fe\u2013S clusters) (Davis et al., 2011; Struck et al., 2012; Amich et al., 2013; Sheridan et al., 2016).

It then proceeds to describe the metabolic consequences of aberrant cellular methylation, and after introducing advances in the biosynthesis and self-protection against gliotoxin (Dolan et al., 2015), attempts to illustrate how new thinking on the apparent integration of this biosynthetic pathway with SAM homeostasis (Owens et al., 2015) might be exploited therapeutically. The recent demonstration of interplay between gliotoxin biosynthesis and zinc homeostasis (Saleh et al., 2018; Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018) is then elaborated and presented in a context which serves to illustrate how this unprecedented finding may prove useful in future mechanistic studies pertaining to fungal virulence. Disruption of gliotoxin biosynthesis led to the discovery of EGT in A. fumigatus, and the review then pivots to describe the biochemistry and functionality of this high level antioxidant in fungi (Gallagher et al., 2012). Indeed, we contend that the discovery of EGT may necessitate re-consideration of previous studies pertaining to the oxidative stress sensitivity of A. fumigatus, and possibly other fungi, following deletion of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dissipating systems (Lessing et al., 2007; Lambou et al., 2010). We then move to reveal and illustrate that both gliotoxin and EGT biosynthesis (Sheridan et al., 2016; Dolan et al., 2017) has led to molecular rewiring in A. fumigatus, whereby Cys, GSH and SAM have become substrates for the biosynthesis of the aforementioned metabolites, along with playing a role in gliotoxin \u2018activation\u2019 and attenuation, leading to unexpected consequences for fungal metabolic systems (Owens et al., 2015). Finally, we introduce the concept of a \u2018cystathionine switch\u2019 in A. fumigatus which may play a role in fluxing thiol-containing metabolites toward different fates, depending on the prevailing cellular redox homeostatic requirements (Sheridan et al., 2016).

Furthermore, a Cys auxotroph mutant displayed reduced virulence in a murine model, indicating that Cys levels in the murine lung are insufficient to act as a sulfur source during infection (Amich et al., 2016). While MetR positively regulates sulfur assimilation, 4 genes (sconA, sconB, sconC, and sconD) act to negatively regulate sulfur assimilation in filamentous fungi. In A. nidulans, deletion of scon genes results in excessive accumulation of sulfur-containing amino acids.

SAM provides the methyl group for the majority of cellular methylation reactions, across all branches of life, and as such is known as the universal methyl donor (Struck et al., 2012). As noted, donation of the methyl group from SAM results in the formation of SAH (Figure 2). Relevantly, SAH is a potent inhibitor of methylation (Caudill et al., 2001), and dissipation of SAH is important to avoid impaired cellular methylation, otherwise elevated SAH may impede mycelial growth. Consequently, SAM/SAH is considered a useful indicator of the cellular methylation potential, and perturbation of SAM/SAH has been studied through the disruption of S-adenosylhomocysteinase activity (Liao et al., 2012). As S-adenosylhomocysteinase catalyses the hydrolysis of SAH, any disruption to its activity would be expected to increase SAH levels, and reduce the SAM/SAH ratio. This would therefore be expected to inhibit methylation (Caudill et al., 2001). It has also been demonstrated that inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteinase using 9-(S)-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-adenine (DHPA) in tobacco seeds resulted in global hypomethylation of DNA (Fulnecek et al., 2011). Phenotypically, this resulted in dosage-dependant developmental defects, linked to increased expression of floral organ identity genes. The authors concluded that tobacco seeds were particularly sensitive to accurate SAM/SAH levels at critical developmental periods. In fungi, Liao et al. (2012) investigated the effect of perturbed SAM/SAH in Cryphonectria parasitica. Deletion of the gene encoding S-adenosylhomocysteinase resulted in almost 10-fold increase in SAH abundance, and a twofold increase in SAM levels. This reduced the intracellular SAM/SAH from 2.63 to 0.53 and resulted in reduced radial growth, decreased asexual development and loss of pigmentation, proposed to be due to a decrease in DNA methylation. Regulation of intracellular SAM/SAH levels is therefore critical, as disruption can adversely affect tightly regulated gene expression, and potentially impede cell growth. How this is achieved in fungi capable of gliotoxin, BmGT and EGT biosynthesis (Cramer et al., 2006; Dolan et al., 2014; Sheridan et al., 2016), all of which are highly dependent on SAM utilization, and concomitant SAH generation (Owens et al., 2015), is only just becoming apparent \u2013 and potentially represents a new direction in the search for antifungal drug targets.", "Functionally, methylation is involved in signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation, gene silencing and secondary metabolite biosynthesis (Schubert et al., 2003) (Liscombe et al., 2012; Sarikaya-Bayram et al., 2014).

This would therefore be expected to inhibit methylation (Caudill et al., 2001). It has also been demonstrated that inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteinase using 9-(S)-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-adenine (DHPA) in tobacco seeds resulted in global hypomethylation of DNA (Fulnecek et al., 2011). Phenotypically, this resulted in dosage-dependant developmental defects, linked to increased expression of floral organ identity genes. The authors concluded that tobacco seeds were particularly sensitive to accurate SAM/SAH levels at critical developmental periods. In fungi, Liao et al. (2012) investigated the effect of perturbed SAM/SAH in Cryphonectria parasitica. Deletion of the gene encoding S-adenosylhomocysteinase resulted in almost 10-fold increase in SAH abundance, and a twofold increase in SAM levels. This reduced the intracellular SAM/SAH from 2.63 to 0.53 and resulted in reduced radial growth, decreased asexual development and loss of pigmentation, proposed to be due to a decrease in DNA methylation. Regulation of intracellular SAM/SAH levels is therefore critical, as disruption can adversely affect tightly regulated gene expression, and potentially impede cell growth. How this is achieved in fungi capable of gliotoxin, BmGT and EGT biosynthesis (Cramer et al., 2006; Dolan et al., 2014; Sheridan et al., 2016), all of which are highly dependent on SAM utilization, and concomitant SAH generation (Owens et al., 2015), is only just becoming apparent \u2013 and potentially represents a new direction in the search for antifungal drug targets.", "Functionally, methylation is involved in signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation, gene silencing and secondary metabolite biosynthesis (Schubert et al., 2003) (Liscombe et al., 2012; Sarikaya-Bayram et al., 2014). SAM provides the methyl group for the majority of cellular methylation reactions, across all branches of life, and as such is known as the universal methyl donor (Struck et al., 2012). As noted, donation of the methyl group from SAM results in the formation of SAH (Figure 2). Relevantly, SAH is a potent inhibitor of methylation (Caudill et al., 2001), and dissipation of SAH is important to avoid impaired cellular methylation, otherwise elevated SAH may impede mycelial growth. Consequently, SAM/SAH is considered a useful indicator of the cellular methylation potential, and perturbation of SAM/SAH has been studied through the disruption of S-adenosylhomocysteinase activity (Liao et al., 2012).

In other words, while GtmA links BmGT formation to the Methyl/Met cycle, it appears that GliT is the enzyme which not only mediates, but facilitates gliotoxin biosynthesis without adversely affecting sulfur metabolite homeostasis in A. fumigatus. So, although bis-thiomethylation of DTG via GtmA is an important factor in negative regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus (Dolan et al., 2014), it is not required for gliotoxin self-protection, although disruption of the SAM/SAH has been associated with gliotoxin sensitivity (Owens et al., 2015). A. fumigatus \u0394gliT, which demonstrates severe sensitivity to exogenous gliotoxin, exhibited decreased levels of SAM and increased levels of SAH. Absence of GliT results in increased GtmA activity due to increased availability of DTG, increased production of BmGT and a concurrent shift in SAM/SAH ratio (Owens et al., 2015). A. fumigatus \u0394gliK, which is also sensitive to gliotoxin and has attenuated GliT induction following exogenous gliotoxin exposure, also displayed altered SAM/SAH ratio in a similar manner to \u0394gliT (Owens et al., 2015). GliT therefore plays an important role in maintaining SAM/SAH homeostasis following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin in A. fumigatus and absence of GliT leads to decreased SAM/SAH ratio, which contributes to gliotoxin toxicity in \u0394gliT and \u0394gliK (Owens et al., 2015). Furthermore, quantitative proteomic analysis of A. fumigatus\u0394gliK, following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin, detected increased abundance of the Methyl/Met cycle enzymes, cobalamin-independent methionine synthase MetH/D, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase MTHFR/MtrA. Altered SAM/SAH was also observed in A. fumigatus\u0394gliK upon gliotoxin exposure. These observations clearly inferred Met depletion consequent to gliK deletion and gliotoxin presence, possibly due to the observed intracellular accumulation of the bis-glutathionylated intermediate 2 (Figure 3). Thus, a number of unforeseen interactions are emerging between primary and so-called secondary metabolism, which may result in new anti-fungal drug target identification. Since SAM is essential for many cellular transmethylation reactions (e.g., epigenetic regulation) (Strauss and Reyes-Dominguez, 2011), and SAH may be an inhibitor of cellular methyltransferases (Burgos et al., 2012), there may be significant antifungal drug target potential associated with the overproduction of BmGT or inhibition of GliK activity- both of which may cause SAM dissipation. In addition, gliotoxin, or specific reactions required for its biosynthesis, have also been shown to influence the formation of other sulfur-containing metabolites, like EGT (Gallagher et al., 2012; Sheridan et al., 2016), and finally, the activity of gliotoxin against fungi is revealing even further interactions within biological systems- most recently involving zinc homeostasis (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018).", "Overall, these findings lead to the conclusion that GliT not only catalyzes formation of gliotoxin, but simultaneously prevents the dysregulation SAM/SAH and consequential deleterious impacts of elevated SAH, production of toxin Hcy and depletion of Met (Owens et al., 2015). In other words, while GtmA links BmGT formation to the Methyl/Met cycle, it appears that GliT is the enzyme which not only mediates, but facilitates gliotoxin biosynthesis without adversely affecting sulfur metabolite homeostasis in A. fumigatus. So, although bis-thiomethylation of DTG via GtmA is an important factor in negative regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus (Dolan et al., 2014), it is not required for gliotoxin self-protection, although disruption of the SAM/SAH has been associated with gliotoxin sensitivity (Owens et al., 2015). A. fumigatus \u0394gliT, which demonstrates severe sensitivity to exogenous gliotoxin, exhibited decreased levels of SAM and increased levels of SAH. Absence of GliT results in increased GtmA activity due to increased availability of DTG, increased production of BmGT and a concurrent shift in SAM/SAH ratio (Owens et al., 2015). A. fumigatus \u0394gliK, which is also sensitive to gliotoxin and has attenuated GliT induction following exogenous gliotoxin exposure, also displayed altered SAM/SAH ratio in a similar manner to \u0394gliT (Owens et al., 2015).

Indeed, the importance of Zn\u2014S interactions for cell biology leads us to consider the existence of intricate transcriptional regulatory networks to coordinate sulfur metabolism and zinc homeostasis, particularly under zinc-limiting conditions. Transcriptomic analyses carried out to ascertain the homeostatic and adaptive response to zinc starvation in S. cerevisiae (Lyons et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2008) and in the filamentous fungal pathogen A. fumigatus (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018), both grown in zinc-limiting versus zinc-replete media with sulfate as only source of sulfur, have revealed that zinc starvation negatively influenced sulfate assimilation. In S. cerevisiae, the expression of MET3, MET14, and MET16, which encode the enzymes that catalyze the first three reactions for sulfate assimilation, is repressed under zinc starvation (Wu et al., 2009). However, the expression of these genes is repressed indirectly by Zap1, which is the transcriptional regulator of zinc homeostasis in S. cerevisiae, because it induces the expression of MET30 (Wu et al., 2009), which encodes an F-box protein of the SCFMet30 complex involved in the inactivation of the Met4 transcription factor that induces directly the expression of MET3, MET14, and MET16 when the Met or SAM level is low (Rouillon et al., 2000). In A. fumigatus the expression level of metR, the ortholog of S. cerevisiae MET4, is slightly reduced under zinc starvation (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). In addition, the expression level of cysB, the ortholog of MCY1 in S. cerevisiae that encodes a mitochondrial cysteine synthase, is also slightly reduced under zinc starvation (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). As noted above, the MetR transcription factor specifically induces genes required for sulfate assimilation in A. fumigatus (Amich et al., 2013), whereas the mitochondrial cysteine synthase CysB catalyzes the incorporation of S2\u2013 coming from sulfate reduction into O-acetylserine to generate Cys (Brzywczy et al., 2007). Currently, it is unclear whether metR and cysB repression is exerted directly or indirectly by ZafA, which is the major transcriptional regulator of zinc homeostasis in A. fumigatus (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018, 2019), although the presence of two ZR-like motifs (i.e., Zinc Response consensus motifs) at 2000 and 1272 bp upstream the translation start codon (TSC) of metR and a ZR-like motif at 318 bp upstream the TSC of cysB indicates that a direct ZafA-mediated repression of these genes is possible.

In addition, the two genes more highly induced by zinc starvation in A. fumigatus (i.e., AFUA_7G06790/yctA and AFUA_4G03930/cysX) (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018), exhibit a significant similarity with proteins involved in sulfur metabolism. The YctA protein of A. fumigatus is similar to the yeast Yct1 protein, which seems to function as a Cys transporter located in the endoplasmic reticulum (Kaur and Bachhawat, 2007), whereas the CysX protein, which has no yeast ortholog, and is predicted to be located in peroxisomes, shows a limited similarity with the CysB of A. fumigatus (E-value = 5 \u00d7 10\u20139).

Hence, it is highly relevant that expression of gli genes is tightly regulated under zinc-limiting conditions.", "The major regulator of gliotoxin biosynthesis is the GliZ zinc binuclear (Zn2Cys6) transcription factor (Bok et al., 2006). Although it has not been formally shown, it is very likely that GliZ induces gene expression through binding to the TCRGHNDCCGW quasi-palindromic motif (R = A or G; H = A or C or T; D = A or G or T; W = A or T), which is present in the promoter region of gtmA and all gli genes, except gliZ and gliA, and is very similar to the TCGGNNNCCGA sequence reported previously by others investigators (Fox et al., 2008). In addition, although it is unknown whether GliZ induces the expression of its own encoding gene and whether the transcription activation activity of GliZ is influenced directly by DTG and/or gliotoxin, it is well known that gliotoxin (including that of exogenous origin) enhances its own biosynthesis (Cramer et al., 2006). Interestingly, the gliT expression level is only slightly reduced in a \u0394gliZ strain in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin, whereas the expression level of gliA reduces dramatically in a \u0394gliZ strain following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin (Schrettl et al., 2010), despite the fact that gliA lacks putative GliZ binding motifs in its promoter region. In addition, gliA and gliZ are not expressed in A. fumigatus \u0394gliP (Cramer et al., 2006). Therefore, in addition to GliZ, other transcription factors must influence gliT expression in a GliZ-independent manner, whereas gliA expression must depend directly on one or more transcription factors other than GliZ, provided that GliZ enhances the expression of the gli genes required exclusively for gliotoxin biosynthesis rather than for efflux, which is the most likely function of GliA (Wang et al., 2014). In this regard, it has been reported recently that the ZafA transcription factor, under zinc-limiting conditions, induces the expression of gliA, gliT and gliZ, whereby the induction level of gliA was >100-fold higher than that of gliT or gliZ (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). The promoter regions of all gli genes in the gli cluster of A. fumigatus (strain Af293) harbor just one ZR consensus motif to which ZafA can bind and five ZR-like motifs (i.e., Zinc Response consensus motifs that have one or two substitutions out of the conserved core sequence) (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). Interestingly, the only ZR consensus motif plus one ZR-like motif are located in the gliZ promoter at 822 and 776 bp, respectively, upstream of its TSC. In the promoter of both gliM and gliT there is a ZR-like motif located respectively at 124 and 483 bp upstream of the TSC, whereas in the gliA promoter there are two ZR-like motifs located at 455 and 508 bp upstream of its TSC (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). It is important to point out that the AFUA_6G09730/gliF-AFUA_6G09740/gliT intergenic sequence, which presumably functions as a divergent promoter, is only 302 bp long as annotated in the Af293 genome database. Therefore, the only ZR motif of gliT would not be located in the predicted gliF-gliT divergent promoter region but within the putative coding sequence of gliF (i.e., 181 bp downstream of its predicted translation start site). However, this finding raises questions about both the putative (negative) influence of ZafA on gliF transcription under zinc-limiting conditions and the accurate prediction of the translation start site for gliF. In this regard, it could be possible that the actual gliF translation start site is located at 699 bp rather than at 303 bp from the gliT translation start site and that gliF encoded a GliF protein with 113 amino acids less than expected. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the two ZafA-binding motifs in the gliA promoter are located 130 and 183 bp upstream of the binding site for the GipA C2H2 transcription factor (positioned at 316 bp upstream of the gliA TSC) (Schoberle et al., 2014). It has been reported that GipA induces gliA and gliP expression in the presence of GliZ, whereas only the induction of gliA by GliZ depends on GipA, which led the authors to hypothesize that GliZ and GipA worked together at the same binding site (Schoberle et al., 2014). However, bearing in mind that the gliA promoter lacks of an obvious GliZ binding motif, the correlation between gliZ expression and gliotoxin biosynthesis, the essential role of ZafA for gliA expression during zinc starvation and the close proximity of the ZafA and GipA binding sites in the gliA promoter, it would appear more feasible that GipA, whose activity could also be influenced by the intracellular amount of gliotoxin, plays a role as a modulator of the ZafA-mediated induction of gliA under zinc starvation to adjust the gliA expression level to the intracellular amount of gliotoxin. Lastly, it is notable that the liquid medium routinely used for induction of gliotoxin biosynthesis (i.e., Czapek-Dox) provides a zinc-limiting culture condition (Saleh et al., 2018), which strongly suggests that zinc starvation could be the primary stimulus that triggers the ZafA-mediated induction of gliZ expression and, hence, gliotoxin biosynthesis, whereas the function of GliZ would be dedicated to maintain steady expression levels of the gli genes and gliotoxin biosynthesis while zinc starvation persists. In addition, it is remarkable that the genes required for self-protection against the noxious effects of DTG and/or gliotoxin (i.e., gliA, gliT, and gtmA) (Dolan et al., 2015) are strongly induced under zinc starvation (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). However, the lack of ZR-like motifs in the gtmA promoter suggests that gtmA expression under zinc-limiting conditions must be induced indirectly by ZafA through some unknown factor. In either case, the biological rationale that underlies the relationship between biosynthesis of the sulfur metabolite gliotoxin and zinc starvation is unknown. However, the report by Saleh et al. (2018) about the capacity of DTG to eject Zn2+ ions from zinc-dependent metalloproteins, represents a significant finding that will allow investigation of the biological role of gliotoxin in the context of regulating zinc homeostasis which, simultaneously, will broaden the potential practical applications of this fascinating compound.", "The major regulator of gliotoxin biosynthesis is the GliZ zinc binuclear (Zn2Cys6) transcription factor (Bok et al., 2006). Although it has not been formally shown, it is very likely that GliZ induces gene expression through binding to the TCRGHNDCCGW quasi-palindromic motif (R = A or G; H = A or C or T; D = A or G or T; W = A or T), which is present in the promoter region of gtmA and all gli genes, except gliZ and gliA, and is very similar to the TCGGNNNCCGA sequence reported previously by others investigators (Fox et al., 2008). In addition, although it is unknown whether GliZ induces the expression of its own encoding gene and whether the transcription activation activity of GliZ is influenced directly by DTG and/or gliotoxin, it is well known that gliotoxin (including that of exogenous origin) enhances its own biosynthesis (Cramer et al., 2006). Interestingly, the gliT expression level is only slightly reduced in a \u0394gliZ strain in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin, whereas the expression level of gliA reduces dramatically in a \u0394gliZ strain following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin (Schrettl et al., 2010), despite the fact that gliA lacks putative GliZ binding motifs in its promoter region. In addition, gliA and gliZ are not expressed in A. fumigatus \u0394gliP (Cramer et al., 2006). Therefore, in addition to GliZ, other transcription factors must influence gliT expression in a GliZ-independent manner, whereas gliA expression must depend directly on one or more transcription factors other than GliZ, provided that GliZ enhances the expression of the gli genes required exclusively for gliotoxin biosynthesis rather than for efflux, which is the most likely function of GliA (Wang et al., 2014). In this regard, it has been reported recently that the ZafA transcription factor, under zinc-limiting conditions, induces the expression of gliA, gliT and gliZ, whereby the induction level of gliA was >100-fold higher than that of gliT or gliZ (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). The promoter regions of all gli genes in the gli cluster of A. fumigatus (strain Af293) harbor just one ZR consensus motif to which ZafA can bind and five ZR-like motifs (i.e., Zinc Response consensus motifs that have one or two substitutions out of the conserved core sequence) (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). Interestingly, the only ZR consensus motif plus one ZR-like motif are located in the gliZ promoter at 822 and 776 bp, respectively, upstream of its TSC. In the promoter of both gliM and gliT there is a ZR-like motif located respectively at 124 and 483 bp upstream of the TSC, whereas in the gliA promoter there are two ZR-like motifs located at 455 and 508 bp upstream of its TSC (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). It is important to point out that the AFUA_6G09730/gliF-AFUA_6G09740/gliT intergenic sequence, which presumably functions as a divergent promoter, is only 302 bp long as annotated in the Af293 genome database. Therefore, the only ZR motif of gliT would not be located in the predicted gliF-gliT divergent promoter region but within the putative coding sequence of gliF (i.e., 181 bp downstream of its predicted translation start site). However, this finding raises questions about both the putative (negative) influence of ZafA on gliF transcription under zinc-limiting conditions and the accurate prediction of the translation start site for gliF. In this regard, it could be possible that the actual gliF translation start site is located at 699 bp rather than at 303 bp from the gliT translation start site and that gliF encoded a GliF protein with 113 amino acids less than expected. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the two ZafA-binding motifs in the gliA promoter are located 130 and 183 bp upstream of the binding site for the GipA C2H2 transcription factor (positioned at 316 bp upstream of the gliA TSC) (Schoberle et al., 2014). It has been reported that GipA induces gliA and gliP expression in the presence of GliZ, whereas only the induction of gliA by GliZ depends on GipA, which led the authors to hypothesize that GliZ and GipA worked together at the same binding site (Schoberle et al., 2014). However, bearing in mind that the gliA promoter lacks of an obvious GliZ binding motif, the correlation between gliZ expression and gliotoxin biosynthesis, the essential role of ZafA for gliA expression during zinc starvation and the close proximity of the ZafA and GipA binding sites in the gliA promoter, it would appear more feasible that GipA, whose activity could also be influenced by the intracellular amount of gliotoxin, plays a role as a modulator of the ZafA-mediated induction of gliA under zinc starvation to adjust the gliA expression level to the intracellular amount of gliotoxin. Lastly, it is notable that the liquid medium routinely used for induction of gliotoxin biosynthesis (i.e., Czapek-Dox) provides a zinc-limiting culture condition (Saleh et al., 2018), which strongly suggests that zinc starvation could be the primary stimulus that triggers the ZafA-mediated induction of gliZ expression and, hence, gliotoxin biosynthesis, whereas the function of GliZ would be dedicated to maintain steady expression levels of the gli genes and gliotoxin biosynthesis while zinc starvation persists. In addition, it is remarkable that the genes required for self-protection against the noxious effects of DTG and/or gliotoxin (i.e., gliA, gliT, and gtmA) (Dolan et al., 2015) are strongly induced under zinc starvation (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). However, the lack of ZR-like motifs in the gtmA promoter suggests that gtmA expression under zinc-limiting conditions must be induced indirectly by ZafA through some unknown factor. In either case, the biological rationale that underlies the relationship between biosynthesis of the sulfur metabolite gliotoxin and zinc starvation is unknown. However, the report by Saleh et al. (2018) about the capacity of DTG to eject Zn2+ ions from zinc-dependent metalloproteins, represents a significant finding that will allow investigation of the biological role of gliotoxin in the context of regulating zinc homeostasis which, simultaneously, will broaden the potential practical applications of this fascinating compound.", "The major regulator of gliotoxin biosynthesis is the GliZ zinc binuclear (Zn2Cys6) transcription factor (Bok et al., 2006). Although it has not been formally shown, it is very likely that GliZ induces gene expression through binding to the TCRGHNDCCGW quasi-palindromic motif (R = A or G; H = A or C or T; D = A or G or T; W = A or T), which is present in the promoter region of gtmA and all gli genes, except gliZ and gliA, and is very similar to the TCGGNNNCCGA sequence reported previously by others investigators (Fox et al., 2008). In addition, although it is unknown whether GliZ induces the expression of its own encoding gene and whether the transcription activation activity of GliZ is influenced directly by DTG and/or gliotoxin, it is well known that gliotoxin (including that of exogenous origin) enhances its own biosynthesis (Cramer et al., 2006). Interestingly, the gliT expression level is only slightly reduced in a \u0394gliZ strain in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin, whereas the expression level of gliA reduces dramatically in a \u0394gliZ strain following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin (Schrettl et al., 2010), despite the fact that gliA lacks putative GliZ binding motifs in its promoter region. In addition, gliA and gliZ are not expressed in A. fumigatus \u0394gliP (Cramer et al., 2006). Therefore, in addition to GliZ, other transcription factors must influence gliT expression in a GliZ-independent manner, whereas gliA expression must depend directly on one or more transcription factors other than GliZ, provided that GliZ enhances the expression of the gli genes required exclusively for gliotoxin biosynthesis rather than for efflux, which is the most likely function of GliA (Wang et al., 2014). In this regard, it has been reported recently that the ZafA transcription factor, under zinc-limiting conditions, induces the expression of gliA, gliT and gliZ, whereby the induction level of gliA was >100-fold higher than that of gliT or gliZ (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). The promoter regions of all gli genes in the gli cluster of A. fumigatus (strain Af293) harbor just one ZR consensus motif to which ZafA can bind and five ZR-like motifs (i.e., Zinc Response consensus motifs that have one or two substitutions out of the conserved core sequence) (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). Interestingly, the only ZR consensus motif plus one ZR-like motif are located in the gliZ promoter at 822 and 776 bp, respectively, upstream of its TSC. In the promoter of both gliM and gliT there is a ZR-like motif located respectively at 124 and 483 bp upstream of the TSC, whereas in the gliA promoter there are two ZR-like motifs located at 455 and 508 bp upstream of its TSC (Vicentefranqueira et al., 2018). It is important to point out that the AFUA_6G09730/gliF-AFUA_6G09740/gliT intergenic sequence, which presumably functions as a divergent promoter, is only 302 bp long as annotated in the Af293 genome database. Therefore, the only ZR motif of gliT would not be located in the predicted gliF-gliT divergent promoter region but within the putative coding sequence of gliF (i.e., 181 bp downstream of its predicted translation start site). However, this finding raises questions about both the putative (negative) influence of ZafA on gliF transcription under zinc-limiting conditions and the accurate prediction of the translation start site for gliF. In this regard, it could be possible that the actual gliF translation start site is located at 699 bp rather than at 303 bp from the gliT translation start site and that gliF encoded a GliF protein with 113 amino acids less than expected. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the two ZafA-binding motifs in the gliA promoter are located 130 and 183 bp upstream of the binding site for the GipA C2H2 transcription factor (positioned at 316 bp upstream of the gliA TSC) (Schoberle et al., 2014).

EGT therefore appears to play an important role in conidiation and conidial health in N. crassa. However, no role for EGT in the mycelia of N. crassa was detected. Pluskal et al. (2014) generated an EGT null mutant (\u0394egt1) and a strain producing trace amounts of EGT (\u0394egt2) in S. pombe. Phenotypic analysis of these strains revealed no differences between the mutants and wild-type. Thus, EGT does not appear to play any role in protecting S. pombe against H2O2 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Metabolic analysis revealed no changes in the levels of metabolites in either strains, except for EGT, and hercynylcysteine sulphoxide in \u0394egt2. Thus, the function of EGT in S. pombe is currently unclear. Bello et al.

An increase in GSH levels was not observed in \u0394egtAAfS77 compared to AfS77, because low levels of gliotoxin production in AfS77 results in higher basal levels of GSH compared to ATCC26933. This meant that a metabolic adjustment was not required in the absence of EGT as GSH levels were already sufficient.", "FIGURE 5Proposed interaction between EGT, GSH and gliotoxin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus.

Deletion of gliK resulted in abrogated gliotoxin biosynthesis and increased levels of EGT (Gallagher et al., 2012). As discussed previously, this was speculated to be caused by the interruption of the gliotoxin biosynthetic pathway directly following the incorporation of GSH, resulting in a \u201cGSH sink.\u201d Thus, we propose that gliotoxin and EGT biosynthesis are interlinked, with a possible involvement of GSH, which infers that A. fumigatus must carefully balance production of gliotoxin, GSH and EGT. As a result, disruption of one biosynthetic pathway may result in alterations in the other two. All three metabolites are redox-active molecules and, as such, the levels of each may alter to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. As demonstrated in \u0394egtA26933, abrogation of EGT biosynthesis resulted in a shift in the redox state of the cell, which required the alteration of gliotoxin and GSH biosynthesis to compensate (Figure 5). The biosynthetic pathways of gliotoxin, GSH are EGT are also linked metabolically, as Cys provides the thiol group for all three; directly in the case of EGT and GSH, and via GSH in the case of gliotoxin (Figure 5). Additionally, the biosynthesis of both gliotoxin and EGT contains methyltransferase steps, requiring SAM as a co-factor. Thus, Cys availability (and therefore sulfur) will impact biosynthesis of all three, while levels of SAM will affect EGT and gliotoxin biosynthesis. Production of these metabolites must therefore be balanced against the availability of Cys and SAM. SAM levels are of particular interest in EGT biosynthesis as 3 moles of SAM are required for every 1 mol of EGT produced. The importance of Cys and SAM availability for these metabolic adjustments was emphasized by the observation of a \u201ccystathionine switch,\u201d as demonstrated in \u0394egtA26933. During quantitative proteomic analysis under basal conditions, cystathionine \u03b3-synthase (CGS; AFUA_7G01590) was undetectable in \u0394egtA26933 compared to ATCC26933, while cystathionine \u03b2-lyase (CBL; AFUA_4G03950) exhibited a log2 3.1-fold increase in abundance in \u0394egtA26933 compared to ATCC26933 under ROS conditions (Figure 6). This suggests that A. fumigatus \u0394egtA26933 can switch from directing Cys toward GSH biosynthesis under basal conditions, to producing SAM to effect EgtA-catalyzed abortive His trimethylation which would ordinarily enable EGT biosynthesis under ROS conditions. Cystathionine therefore appears to be at the nexus of the metabolic response to EGT absence which infers a hitherto unknown but prominent role for cystathionine in directing the cellular metabolic thiol flux (Sheridan et al., 2016).", "The interplay between gliotoxin, GSH and EGT biosynthesis was also evident in \u0394gliK.
