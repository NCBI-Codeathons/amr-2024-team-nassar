["The study investigates the antibiotic resistance (AR) profiles and genetic determinants in three strains of guaiacol-producing Alicyclobacillus spp. isolated from orchard soil and pears. Their phenotypic characteristics, such as spore formation; resistance to different factors, including drugs or disinfectants; or production of off-flavor compounds, can affect the taste and aroma of spoiled products. Food and beverages are potential vectors for the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, which is a growing health concern; thus, microorganisms in food and beverages should not be a potential source of drug resistance to consumers. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was utilized to identify antibiotic resistance genes, metabolic pathways, and elements associated with guaiacol and halophenol production. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing revealed that all strains were susceptible to eight out of nine tested antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and vancomycin) but exhibited high resistance to erythromycin. Analysis indicated that the erythromycin resistance gene, ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase A (RsmA), was intrinsic and likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The comprehensive genomic analysis provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in Alicyclobacillus spp., highlighting the potential risk of these bacteria as vectors for antibiotic resistance genes in the food chain. This study expands the understanding of the genetic makeup of these spoilage bacteria and their role in antimicrobial resistance dissemination.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Alicyclobacillus spp. are common, spoiling, nonpathogenic, Gram (+), spore-forming, thermo-acidophilic bacteria. They are found in various natural and anthropogenic environments, such as soils, hot springs, mine waters, different fruits, juices, and beverages, as they have the ability to survive in acidic, high temperature, and high-pressure conditions [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] This genus includes species that produce off-flavors and antiseptic-, smoky-, and medicinal-tasting compounds, such as guaiacol and halophenols, 2,6-dibromophenol, and 2,6-dichlorophenol [1,3,11]. Currently, 29 species of Alicyclobacillus are known [4,6,11], with 9 of them reported to produce guaiacol: A. acidophilus, A. acidoterrestris, A. daucy, A. herbarius, A. cycloheptanicus, A. pomorum, A. contaminans, some strains of A. hesperidum, and (as recently reported) A. fastidiosus [11].", "Alicyclobacillus spp. are common, spoiling, nonpathogenic, Gram (+), spore-forming, thermo-acidophilic bacteria.

Consequently, most studies have focused on identifying and characterizing their growth, germination, behavior, adaptation, metabolite production, and control measures [1,2,3,11,12,13,14,15,16]. Agricultural fields and fertilized orchards may serve as hotspots for the duplication of genes that confer drug resistance, facilitating their transfer to soil bacteria and, subsequently, the food chain. This pathway could allow resistance determinants to reach the human body, making it crucial to uncover potential antibiotic resistance (AR) transmission pathways and the critical mechanisms involved in antibiotic resistance. Limited information is available regarding antibiotic susceptibility among Alicyclobacillus spp. Aulitto et al. [2] identified the brcC gene involved in bacitracin resistance in two A. mali genomes. They also reported that A. mali FL18 exhibited resistance to ampicillin, bacitracin, kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. Based on genomic analysis, they hypothesized that such a broad spectrum of antibiotic resistance is associated with the expression of multiple multidrug efflux transporters. The potential for food and beverages to act as vectors for the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes is a growing health concern [17,18]. The removal of antibiotics from the market in accordance with Regulation (EC) N 1831/2003 has underscored the need to reduce antimicrobial resistance in the food chain [18]. Microorganisms in food and beverages should not be a source of drug resistance to consumers. Resistance to antimicrobial agents can be intrinsic, as natural phenotypic traits typical of all strains of all species, or acquired through additional genes carried on mobile genetic elements (plasmids or transposons) or mutations of indigenous genes [17,19].", "Alicyclobacillus spp. pose a significant concern for the food and beverage industry due to their potential to cause substantial economic losses.

Antibiotic resistance predates the 20th-century \u201cantibiotic era\u201d. Prokaryotic antibiotic resistance genes have been found in environments minimally affected by human activity. For instance, the Sul2\u2013strA\u2013strB gene cluster was identified in a 1200- to 1400-year-old Antarctic ice core sample [23]; genes conferring resistance to \u03b2-lactams, tetracycline, and glycopeptides were found in 30,000-year-old Beringian permafrost sediments [24]. Additionally, aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and macrolide resistance factors were isolated from Tibetan glacial lake sediments and soil [25]. Genes encoding resistance to standard antibiotics in these samples were associated with efflux pumps, distinct from the modern antibiotic resistome. The natural source of AR genes is environmental bacteria, especially Actinomycetota [26,27,28]. Since metabolic pathways for antibiotic synthesis are estimated to be 200 to 500 million years old, antibiotic resistance must be of similar age to counterbalance the antibiotic effects [29,30,31].", "One of the key mechanisms for the formation of new genes, including antibiotic resistance genes, is amplification and subsequent mutations, as shown for trimethoprim [20], sulfonamides [21], and \u03b2-lactams [22].

In contrast, acquired resistance poses a greater risk for horizontal dissemination, enabling rapid inactivation of selected antibiotics through degradation, export from the cell via efflux systems, or alteration of the antibiotic\u2019s target site [19]. However, the distinction between intrinsic and acquired resistance may be blurred; due to the action of transposases or integrases, resistance factors may transfer between chromosomes to plasmids, and the ability to transmit genes horizontally can be gained or lost. An additional important factor in the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance is that if the genes associated with antibiotic resistance are located on high-copy-number plasmids, this type of amplification enables faster evolution and increased resistance to the agent. Bacteria in heterogeneous environments can develop antibiotic resistance faster than bacteria living in homogeneous environments, especially when the potential relationship between AR and flagella and chemotaxis can be found through efflux mechanisms, biofilm formation, or mobile genetic elements [32]. Piskovsky et al., 2023, suggest that bacterial motility can facilitate dispersal on the surface, which may lead to greater nutrient availability and potentially higher antibiotic resistance. Bacterial swarming is the best-understood relationship between cell motility and the ability of bacteria to cope with antibiotics. Swarming is a form of group motility on surfaces where cells are particularly resistant to antibiotic stress. Reduced exposure of individual cells to antibiotics, leads to tolerance of antibiotics. In addition to swarming, other connections between bacterial motility and the antibiotic landscape have been reported. In particular, antibiotics have been shown to induce motor responses.

The VanT is a membrane-bound serine racemase that converts L-Ser to D-Ser, resulting in D-Ser being used for peptidoglycan synthesis. The VanW protein is possibly involved in antibiotic target alteration, but its mode of action is unknown. In all three analyzed strains downstream of the vanT gene, are three genes encoding alanine dehydrogenase, dipeptidase, and permease, which strongly resemble parts of van resistance operons found in other bacteria [35].

Additionally, the permease gene mentioned above does not show any resemblance to any known van genes. The region encoding part of the putative van operon is limited by IS21 upstream and by IS110 downstream and is not functional. Downstream IS110, there are two genes, a sensor histidine kinase and an OmpR superfamily response regulator transcription factor, which functionally resemble vanS and vanR genes, respectively.

Gene rsmA is homologous to ermC encoded by Bacillus spp. The Erm family of adenine-N(6) methyltransferases confer resistance to macrolide\u2013lincosamide\u2013streptogramin B antibiotics via alteration of their target, as they are responsible for the demethylation of the adenine residue at position 2085 in 23S rRNA interfering with the antibiotic binding [37].", "One CRISPR array was identified in each of the strains: KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002 (Table 2, Figure 1). Concerning transposable elements, 52 IS were identified in the genome of KKP 3000 and 14 in the genome of the two other strains (Table S1). Furthermore, 5 incomplete prophages were annotated for KKP 3000 and 7 for KKP 3001 and KKP 3002 (Table S2). AlienHunter was used to pinpoint regions containing mobile elements. To this end, 121, 97, and 98 regions were identified in the genome of KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002, respectively. Accordingly, 76 elements related to mobile element transfer, replication, and integration were identified by mobileOG in the genome of KKP 3000 and 92 in the chromosome of KKP 3001 and of KKP 3002 (Tables S3\u2013S5). Five strict hits (<70% identity) for transferable antibiotic resistance genes were found in the genome of the strains, as shown in Table S6. Specifically, all three strains code for qacG, FosBx1, VanT, and VanW, which may confer resistance to disinfectant agents and antiseptics, as well as glycopeptides and Fosfomycin (Table S6). QacG protein acts as a proton-dependent efflux, and FosBx1 is an Mn+ dependent fosfomycin thiol transferase. The VanT is a membrane-bound serine racemase that converts L-Ser to D-Ser, resulting in D-Ser being used for peptidoglycan synthesis. The VanW protein is possibly involved in antibiotic target alteration, but its mode of action is unknown. In all three analyzed strains downstream of the vanT gene, are three genes encoding alanine dehydrogenase, dipeptidase, and permease, which strongly resemble parts of van resistance operons found in other bacteria [35]. The CARD database confirmed the alanine dehydrogenase gene as a distant analog of VanH in the vanF cluster; the dipeptidase gene found downstream vanT gene in analyzed strains does not show any resemblance to known vanX genes that encode dipeptidase in vancomycin resistance operons. Additionally, the permease gene mentioned above does not show any resemblance to any known van genes. The region encoding part of the putative van operon is limited by IS21 upstream and by IS110 downstream and is not functional. Downstream IS110, there are two genes, a sensor histidine kinase and an OmpR superfamily response regulator transcription factor, which functionally resemble vanS and vanR genes, respectively. At the protein sequence level, the response regulator shows significant similarity to VanR and the kinase to VanS in various clusters. The same two genes were identified in direct proximity to the putative vanW gene. It is possible the described genes were parts of the functional van operon, which was transferred and disrupted by transposition events. Evidence for the acquisition of these genes through HGT were provided by AlienHunter. Of note, the same HGT region contains the gene fosBx1. According to CARD, this gene is chromosomally encoded in Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., while mobile fosfomycin resistance genes have been identified in the genomes of clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae, including members of the Escherichia and Salmonella species [36]. Furthermore, genes coding for ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase A (RsmA) that could confer resistance to erythromycin were identified in the genome of the three strains (KFAPOJEI_01910, PKEAFELD_04479, PLKKBLCC_04475), that were not correlated with mobile or transposable elements.

To this end, proteins associated with the guaiacol production from vanillin were annotated in the chromosomes of the three strains (Table S7). The metabolic pathway for the production of guaiacol from vanillin involves two consecutive enzymatic reactions; the transformation of vanillin to vanillic acid performed by vanillin dehydrogenase, and of vanillic acid to guaiacol by vanillic acid decarboxylase [39]. Local blastp was performed to determine the presence of the genes involved in these enzymatic reactions. All three strains possess the gene coding for benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in the first step of the transformation (44% sequence identity and 66% positive substitutions).

The nucleotide sequences of known A. acidoterrestris vdc clusters [11] were compared to genomic sequences of strains, KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002.

Conclusions", "This study determined the antibiotic susceptibility of three novel Alicyclobacillus spp. strains isolated from orchard soil and pear both in vitro and in silico. The strains Alicyclobacillus spp. KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002 were susceptible to most of the studied antibiotics, excluding erythromycin, to which high resistance was observed. The erythromycin resistance was attributed to the presence of the rsmA gene in all three genomes; however, no correlation between antibiotic resistance genes and mobile or transposable elements was found. Furthermore, we identified and characterized the arrangement of the vdc operon, which may be involved in the guaiacol production. By analyzing the structure of the operon in the three novel strains and other guaiacol producers, we arrived at the hypothesis that the divergence among the strains may be a result of duplication events that occurred later in time. However, this does not affect their guaiacol production capability. Notably, operons for flagellar assembly and chemotaxis were located, which may be part of the adaptational mechanisms of these strains that will be further explored. Finally, the strains present low Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) with other members of the Alicyclobacillus genus, exhibiting the highest identity to A. fastidiosus strains, which was still lower than the species cut-off.
