Amides simultaneously kill bacteria or cause stagnant growth and have a positive inhibitory impact.42", "As demonstrated by our earlier research, formamide is among the best medications for treating pathogens that are resistant to medications.

Amides simultaneously kill bacteria or cause stagnant growth and have a positive inhibitory impact.42", "Amides contain a hydrophilic binding site for bacterial enzyme proteins. Additionally, in order to evaluate the efficacy of this stent, we also looked at N, O, and S heterocyclic formamides. Further, we studied the N, O, and S heterocycles carboxamides like 2-aryl-4-chlorophenyl-5-arylthiophene-2-carboxylates43\nN-(4-bromophenyl)furan-2-carboxamide,37\nN-(4-methylpyridin-2-yl) Thiophene-2-Carboxamide 4-bromo-N-(5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzamide16,44 to study the effectiveness of these scaffolds. The drug is effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as resistant strains of Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli. The importance of heterocyclic formamide in antibacterial action was discovered. In the present world, synthetic small molecules play a crucial role in drug development for reasons related to the economy and the environment. As a result, we created a molecule that permits the chemical to grow in bacterial cells by adding a linear alkyl group. When the N-heterocyclic amide moiety becomes hydrophilic, it may attach itself to the proteins of bacteria. Some of the thiophene and sulfonamide derivatives that were reported to exhibit anti-bacterial activities are given in Figure 6. Moreover, sulfonamides have more polar surface area and better hydrogen bond acceptors.45 Then, we envisioned the principle of a drug molecule containing a lipophilic tail and polar head. So, we synthesized a series of sulfonamides containing lipophilic tail and arylation of 5-bromo-N-propylthiophene-2-sulfonamides to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the synthesized compounds against NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae. Our motivation for this work was the biological significance of sulfonamides. The in-silico experiments further validated our findings.\nFigure 6Some reported antibacterial that contain thiophene and sulfonamide moieties. The blue encircled moieties represent the sulphonamide functional group that is common in various commercially available antibacterial agents eg, Sulphanilamide, Sulfisoxazole and Sulfathiazole.

In addition, thiophene (Red encircled moiety) containing compounds have also been reported as antibacterial agents and this moiety also exhibited strong interactions with the target proteins.46\u201351", "Amides contain a hydrophilic binding site for bacterial enzyme proteins. Additionally, in order to evaluate the efficacy of this stent, we also looked at N, O, and S heterocyclic formamides. Further, we studied the N, O, and S heterocycles carboxamides like 2-aryl-4-chlorophenyl-5-arylthiophene-2-carboxylates43\nN-(4-bromophenyl)furan-2-carboxamide,37\nN-(4-methylpyridin-2-yl) Thiophene-2-Carboxamide 4-bromo-N-(5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzamide16,44 to study the effectiveness of these scaffolds. The drug is effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as resistant strains of Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli. The importance of heterocyclic formamide in antibacterial action was discovered. In the present world, synthetic small molecules play a crucial role in drug development for reasons related to the economy and the environment. As a result, we created a molecule that permits the chemical to grow in bacterial cells by adding a linear alkyl group. When the N-heterocyclic amide moiety becomes hydrophilic, it may attach itself to the proteins of bacteria. Some of the thiophene and sulfonamide derivatives that were reported to exhibit anti-bacterial activities are given in Figure 6. Moreover, sulfonamides have more polar surface area and better hydrogen bond acceptors.45 Then, we envisioned the principle of a drug molecule containing a lipophilic tail and polar head. So, we synthesized a series of sulfonamides containing lipophilic tail and arylation of 5-bromo-N-propylthiophene-2-sulfonamides to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the synthesized compounds against NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae. Our motivation for this work was the biological significance of sulfonamides. The in-silico experiments further validated our findings.\nFigure 6Some reported antibacterial that contain thiophene and sulfonamide moieties. The blue encircled moieties represent the sulphonamide functional group that is common in various commercially available antibacterial agents eg, Sulphanilamide, Sulfisoxazole and Sulfathiazole. Molecular docking studies revealed that this functional group exhibited the maximum interactions with the target proteins.

So, we synthesized a library of compounds (4a-g) by the arylation of 3b via SMC coupling in moderate yields (56\u201372%). But they do have not more promising activities like 3b. It may be due to adding an extra aryl ring, which may cause steric hindrance upon attachment to the bacterial enzyme pocket. The in-silico studies also revealed that the target compound 3b showed interactions other than standard inhibitors, such as water bridging. Moreover, it showed hydrophobic pi-donor with Zinc 302; therefore, it is concluded that 3b proved to be a more potent drug than a standard inhibitor. These studies have demonstrated that sulfonamide is a promising class of antibiotics that can combat antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.", "In this study, we successfully synthesized 5-bromo-N-alkylthiophene-2-sulfonamides (3a-c) in good yields (62\u201378%) and found the compound (3b) as a potential drug candidate having zone inhibition (23\u00b11.5mg/mL), MIC (0.39 \u03bcg/mL) and MBC (0.78 \u03bcg/mL) against NDM producing K. pneumoniae ST147.
