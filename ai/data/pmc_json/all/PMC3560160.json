Results depicted are depicted as MFI over isotype control and represent the mean \u00b1 SD of 7- 9 separate experiments. Additional file 1: Figure S3. Induction of allogeneic T-cell proliferation by JY/WT and BTZ-resistant JY cells. T cell stimulatory capacity of the short term treatment (24 hours) of BTZ JY/WT (\u00b1 10nM BTZ), JY/35 (\u00b1 35nM BTZ) and JY/100 (\u00b1 100nM BTZ). Results depicted are means \u00b1 SD of 4 separate experiments.", "Click here for file", "Click here for file", "Acknowledgements", "Acknowledgements", "The authors would like to thank Dr. Saskia A.
