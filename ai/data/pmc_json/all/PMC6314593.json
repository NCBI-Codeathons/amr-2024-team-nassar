["Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.", "\u2021 These authors are co-first authors on this work.", "Plant cell walls are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, collectively known as lignocellulose. Microorganisms degrade lignocellulose to liberate sugars to meet metabolic demands. Using a metagenomic sequencing approach, we previously demonstrated that the microbiome of the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is replete with genes that could encode lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Here, we report the identification, synthesis and partial characterization of four novel genes from the porcupine microbiome encoding putative lignocellulose-degrading enzymes: \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase, \u03b2-xylosidase, and endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase. These genes were identified via conserved catalytic domains associated with cellulose- and hemicellulose-degradation. Phylogenetic trees were created for each of these putative enzymes to depict genetic relatedness to known enzymes. Candidate genes were synthesized and cloned into plasmid expression vectors for inducible protein expression and secretion. The putative \u03b2-glucosidase fusion protein was efficiently secreted but did not permit Escherichia coli (E. coli) to use cellobiose as a sole carbon source, nor did the affinity purified enzyme cleave p-Nitrophenyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG) substrate in vitro over a range of physiological pH levels (pH 5\u20137). The putative hemicellulose-degrading \u03b2-xylosidase and \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes also lacked in vitro enzyme activity, but the affinity purified endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase protein cleaved a 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl xylobioside substrate in acidic and neutral conditions, with maximal activity at pH 7. At this optimal pH, KM, Vmax, and kcat were determined to be 32.005 \u00b1 4.72 \u03bcM, 1.16x10-5 \u00b1 3.55x10-7 M/s, and 94.72 s-1, respectively. Thus, our pipeline enabled successful identification and characterization of a novel hemicellulose-degrading enzyme from the porcupine microbiome. Progress towards the goal of introducing a complete lignocellulose-degradation pathway into E. coli will be accelerated by combining synthetic metagenomic approaches with functional metagenomic library screening, which can identify novel enzymes unrelated to those found in available databases.", "Data Availability", "All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.

Lignocellulose is made of three carbohydrate polymers; lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, with lignin being the most abundant [3]. Lignin polymers are covalently linked to the other structural polysaccharides, hindering the ability of carbohydrate acting enzymes (CAZymes) to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose [4]. Current industrial extraction methods include subjecting lignocellulose to high temperatures, high pressures, and strong acids and bases to remove lignin and enable processing of hemicellulose and cellulose polysaccharides [4, 5].

However, diverse bacterial populations are known to secrete enzymes into the gut that work cooperatively to degrade lignocellulose [34, 35]. Our goal was to provide a platform to discover these cooperative enzymes from different microbes.

Thus, the pipeline will likely fail to identify greatly divergent proteins with desirable properties. It may also identify putative enzymes that appear to have conserved functional domains but lack the function predicted by homology. By contrast, functional metagenomic library screens rely on functional assays for gene discovery. Thus, functional metagenomics provides a convenient approach to new gene discovery that nicely complements sequence-based approaches, but with greater potential for discovery of truly novel genes that don\u2019t resemble those in existing databases. Recently, using functional metagenomics, Cheng, et. al. discovered three novel \u03b2-galactosidase enzymes, two of which had conserved domains, and one of which was part of a previously undiscovered enzyme family [36].
