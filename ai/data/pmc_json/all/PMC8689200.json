["The Escherichia coli yobA\u2013yebZ\u2013yebY (AZY) operon encodes the proteins YobA, YebZ, and YebY. YobA and YebZ are homologs of the CopC periplasmic copper-binding protein and the CopD putative copper importer, respectively, whereas YebY belongs to the uncharacterized Domain of Unknown Function 2511 family. Despite numerous studies of E.\u00a0coli copper homeostasis and the existence of the AZY operon in a range of bacteria, the operon's proteins and their functional roles have not been explored. In this study, we present the first biochemical and functional studies of the AZY proteins. Biochemical characterization and structural modeling indicate that YobA binds a single Cu2+ ion with high affinity. Bioinformatics analysis shows that YebY is widespread and encoded either in AZY operons or in other genetic contexts unrelated to copper homeostasis. We also determined the 1.8\u00a0\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of E.\u00a0coli YebY, which closely resembles that of the lantibiotic self-resistance protein MlbQ. Two strictly conserved cysteine residues form a disulfide bond, consistent with the observed periplasmic localization of YebY. Upon treatment with reductants, YebY binds Cu+ and Cu2+ with low affinity, as demonstrated by metal-binding analysis and tryptophan fluorescence. Finally, genetic manipulations show that the AZY operon is not involved in copper tolerance or antioxidant defense. Instead, YebY and YobA are required for the activity of the copper-related NADH dehydrogenase II. These results are consistent with a potential role of the AZY operon in copper delivery to membrane proteins.", "Keywords", "Abbreviations", "Edited by Joseph Jez", "Copper is an essential prokaryotic micronutrient that serves as a cofactor for key enzymes involved in respiration and redox defense such as cytochrome c oxidase, NADH dehydrogenase II (NDH-2), and superoxide dismutase (1, 2). However, copper is also toxic if present in high concentrations and/or in the wrong cellular compartments, partly because of copper-mediated generation of free radicals via the Fenton reaction and disruption of iron\u2013sulfur clusters (3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, bacteria employ a variety of resistance and regulation mechanisms that allow copper delivery to designated target proteins, while also affording protection from copper overload (2, 6).", "Copper resistance mechanisms primarily involve two chromosomally encoded multicomponent systems, Cue (Cu efflux) and Cus (Cu sensing). The Cue system consists of the periplasmic multicopper oxidase CueO, the membrane-embedded ATP-driven copper efflux pump CopA, and the transcriptional regulator CueR, which upregulates the expression of CueO and CopA in response to elevated copper concentrations (7, 8, 9). The Cus system includes the tripartite CusABC complex, which spans the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane. CusABC functions as a proton gradient\u2013driven efflux pump, exporting Cu+ either directly from the cytosol or from the periplasm with the aid of the periplasmic protein CusF (10, 11). The Cus system responds to high copper concentrations via regulation by the CusRS two-component system (12).", "The plasmid-borne Cop/Pco (copper resistance or plasmid-borne copper resistance) genes represent a third major bacterial copper handling system that includes at least six proteins, CopABCDRS (13, 14). Unlike the Cue and Cus systems, the roles of the individual Cop proteins are not well understood. CopB and CopD have been proposed to import copper into the periplasm and cytoplasm, respectively (15), whereas CopA is a periplasmic multicopper oxidase (16) and CopC is a periplasmic copper-binding protein (17) suggested to work in concert with CopD (15). Copper-inducible expression of these proteins is regulated by the CopRS two-component system. While gene disruption studies have linked these operons to copper resistance (14, 18), expression of the CopC and CopD proteins alone confers copper hypersensitivity (15), suggesting an import function. Genes encoding CopC and CopD are found together or as fusions in the genomes of a range of bacteria in the absence of the other cop genes present in the Cop/Pco plasmid-encoded resistance operons (19, 20, 21, 22). One CopCD fusion protein, Bacillus subtilis YcnJ, has been implicated in import by genetic disruption studies (20). While pathways of bacterial copper import to the cytoplasm have not been investigated extensively because of the extracytoplasmic localization of most cuproenzymes, recent data suggest that some extracytoplasmic cuproenzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase and periplasmic copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, are metallated by copper that is first imported to the cytoplasm and then exported back to the periplasm (23, 24, 25, 26).", "Genes encoding CopC and CopD homologs are also found on the Escherichia coli chromosome. These proteins are designated YobA (CopC homolog) and YebZ (CopD homolog), and along with a third protein, YebY (Domain of Unknown Function 2511 [DUF2511]) are encoded by the AZY operon (27). Two transcriptional initiation sites homologous to the copper-responsive \u201ccopper boxes\u201d of the pco resistance operon (28) are present at positions -34 and -22. Notably, unlike the pco, cop, and cus gene clusters, the AZY operon is also regulated by the small noncoding RNA, FnrS. Under anaerobic conditions, FnrS negatively regulates the AZY operon and numerous additional genes mainly involved in respiration and antioxidant defense (29, 30). Given that E.\u00a0coli has been the focus of numerous copper homeostasis studies, it is surprising that the AZY operon proteins have rarely been mentioned in the literature (17, 31). Despite the presence of this operon in many strains of E.\u00a0coli and in other proteobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria, its physiological role and the proteins involved have not been investigated. Here, we present an initial characterization of the YobA\u2013YebZ\u2013YebY system, including bioinformatics analysis of the YebY family, determination of the YobA and YebY metal-binding properties, the high-resolution crystal structure of YebY, and a possible physiological role of the AZY operon. The combined findings provide new insight into the function of this operon.", "Results", "Results", "Model structure and metal-binding properties of YobA", "Model structure and metal-binding properties of YobA", "Model structure and metal-binding properties of YobA", "YobA is a member of the CopC family (PF04234) of periplasmic copper-binding proteins.

SeMet-YebY crystallized readily, and the 1.8\u00a0\u00c5 resolution structure was solved using Se single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing (Table\u00a01). The space group is P21 with 12 monomers in the asymmetric unit arranged as dimers. The monomer structure comprises an antiparallel four-stranded \u03b2 sheet surrounded by four \u03b1 helices. As anticipated, the C-terminal cysteine (Cys113) forms a disulfide bond with a cysteine at the C terminus of the second \u03b2-strand (Cys48), stabilizing a compact fold (Fig.\u00a04, A and B). Alignment of the structure with the NMR structure of the only previously characterized family member, MlbQ (26.9% amino acid identity) (37, 40), reveals a strong similarity with an alignment RMSD of 1.84\u00a0\u00c5 for 294 atoms and a disulfide bond in the same location (Fig.\u00a04C). While there are slight differences in some of the secondary structure elements, the only major difference between the two proteins is the length. The first 58 residues of MlbQ, which include a 34-residue amino-terminal lipoprotein signal peptide, are unstructured (not shown in Fig.\u00a04C). The unstructured residues following the signal peptide are presumably a linker between the membrane anchor and the folded domain. In contrast, the first secondary structure element begins at position 25 in the full-length YebY sequence. Thus, the first sequentially and structurally conserved residues are Trp37 (YebY) and Trp71 (MlbQ).

The oxidation rate of NADH in the presence of membranes prepared from cells lacking NDH-2 (\u0394ndh) was nearly identical to that observed in buffer (Fig.\u00a07, green trace), corroborating previous reports that in such early exponential-phase cultures, NDH-2 is the main NADH oxidase (49, 50).

The peptides were eluted with a linear 180\u00a0min gradient of 5 to 28%, a 15\u00a0min gradient of 28 to 95%, and 25\u00a0min gradient at 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid in water at flow rates of 0.15\u00a0\u03bcl/min. MS was performed by Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometer (Thermo) in a positive mode (m/z 300\u20131800, resolution 120,000 for MS1 and 15,000 for MS2) using repetitively full MS scan followed by collision-induced dissociation (higher energy collisional dissociation at 27 normalized collision energy) of the 30 most dominant ions (>1 charges) selected from the first MS scan.

Oxidation of methionine and protein N terminus acetylation were accepted as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl on cysteine was accepted as static modifications. The minimal peptide length was set to six amino acids, and a maximum of two miscleavages was allowed. The data were quantified by label-free analysis using the same software. Peptide- and protein-level false discovery rates were filtered to 1% using the target-decoy strategy. Protein tables were filtered to eliminate the identifications from the reverse database, common contaminants, and single-peptide identifications.", "The MS data were analyzed with the MaxQuant software, version 1.5.2.8 for peak picking and identification using the Andromeda search engine, searching against the E.\u00a0coli proteome from the UniProt database with mass tolerance of 6\u00a0ppm for the precursor masses and 20\u00a0ppm for the fragment ions.
