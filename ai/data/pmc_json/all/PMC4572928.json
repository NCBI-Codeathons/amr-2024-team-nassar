["These authors contributed equally to this work.", "Antimicrobial agents are urgently needed to tackle the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. An important source of new antimicrobials is the large repertoire of cryptic gene clusters embedded in microbial genomes. Genome mining revealed a napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the chromosome of Streptomyces roseosporus NRRL 15998. The cryptic gene cluster was activated by constitutive expression of a foreign activator gene ssaA from sansanmycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. strain SS. Expression of the gene cluster was verified by RT-PCR analysis of key biosynthetic genes. The activated metabolites demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against the highly refractory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and characterization of the metabolites led to the discovery of eight acetylated mureidomycin analogues. To our surprise, constitutive expression of the native activator gene SSGG_02995, a ssaA homologue in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998, has no beneficial effect on mureidomycin stimulation. This study provides a new way to activate cryptic gene cluster for the acquisition of novel antibiotics and will accelerate the exploitation of prodigious natural products in Streptomyces.", "Mureidomycins (mureidomycin A, B, C and D), initially isolated from Streptomyces flavidovirens12, belong to the uridyl peptide antibiotics which also include pacidamycins from Streptomyces coeruleorubidus3, napsamycins from Streptomyces sp. DSM 59404, and sansanmycins from Streptomyces sp. strain SS5. The uridyl peptide antibiotics share a common structural scaffold, an unique 3\u2032-deoxy-4\u2032,5\u2032-enamino-uridine nucleoside linked via an enamide bond to a pseudotetra- or pentapeptide backbone6. Mureidomycins are more closely related to napsamycins. The main difference between them is that mureidomycins contain m-tyrosine (m-Tyr), and napsamycins contain bicyclic 6-hydroxy-tetrahydro-isoquinoline carboxylic acid (Htia) in the N-terminal of the peptide skeleton (Fig. 1a). Acting as competitive inhibitors of bacterial phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase (translocase I, annotated as MraY), mureidomycins exert potent inhibitory activity against the highly refractory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa7. It is noteworthy that mureidomycin C is active against P. aeruginosa resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, and it is also effective in treating P. aeruginosa infection in mice7.", "The gene clusters for napsamycin, pacidamycin and sansanmycin biosynthesis have been cloned891011. Comparison of these gene clusters showed that organization of genes in clusters of napsamycin and sansanmycin has a striking resemblance, while the genetic organization of the pacidamycin gene cluster is different12. The napsamycin gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces sp. DSM 5940, and heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1154 led to the production of both napsamycins and mureidomycins, suggesting that they share the same biosynthetic pathway8. Genome mining revealed a similar gene cluster embedded in the chromosome of Streptomyces roseosporus NRRL 15998, and the gene cluster has been cloned from S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 via phage \u03d5BT1 integrase-mediated site-specific recombination13. The existence of the gene cluster indicated that S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 has the full biosynthetic capacity to produce napsamycins and/or mureidomycins. However, the production of napsamycins/mureidomycins or related compounds has not been reported. Therefore, the gene cluster of interest has been considered as silent in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998.", "The alarming rise in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance poses a serious public health threat, and it has coincided with a dwindling supply of new antibiotics6. Sequencing of several Streptomyces genomes revealed the presence of a large number of cryptic secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters, which represents an important source for the discovery of new antibiotics14. Currently, several methods have been generally used for the activation of cryptic gene clusters15. Among them, two most commonly used methods are heterologous expression of gene clusters in different host strains and genetic manipulation of cluster-situated regulator (CSR) genes. Genetic manipulation of CSR genes, simply to overexpress activators or delete repressors, is a straightforward and effective strategy15. A giant cryptic type I modular PKS gene cluster of Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 23877 was induced by overexpression of a Large ATP binding of the LuxR (LAL) family regulatory gene, leading to the discovery of four unusual glycosylated macrolides16. Similarly, expression of a cryptic gene cluster was triggered by the overexpression of a StrR-like regulatory gene, followed by identification of a type III glycopeptides17. Deletion of scbR2 and its homologue jadR2 activated the normally cryptic type I polyketide synthase gene cluster in S. coelicolor and jadomycin gene cluster in Streptomyces venezuelae1819.", "Here, we report the activation of a cryptic mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster and identification of eight acetylated mureidomycin analogues. The activation of mureidomycin production in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 was achieved by constitutive expression of ssaA from Streptomyces sp. strain SS. It is surprising that constitutive expression of SSGG_02995, a ssaA homologue in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998, has no positive effect on mureidomycin production. This work provides the strategy to activate cryptic gene cluster by overexpression of a foreign activator gene, and will accelerate studies on the biosynthesis and pathway engineering of mureidomycins.", "Results", "Results", "Analysis of the napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998", "Analysis of the napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998", "Analysis of the napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998", "Genome mining revealed a cryptic napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the supercont 3.1 genomic scaffold of S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 (GenBank accession number DS999644.1).

SSGG02995 and its orthologues contain an N-terminal fork head-associated (FHA) domain and a C-terminal LuxR-type helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. Further examination of SSGG02995 in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 showed that variations were mainly found in the FHA domain of SSGG02995, while the DBD domain remains essentially the same (Supplementary Fig. S2). It is plausible that SSGG02995 lost the ability to activate mureidomycin production due to amino acid substitutions in its FHA domain. This may explain why the mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster remains silent in several well-developed surrogate hosts. However, the regulatory mechanism of the aberrant SSGG02995 remains unknown.", "We have identified eight acetylated mureidomycin analogues. Previous study suggested that NpsB, an N-acetyltransferase, is responsible for the formation of N-acetylmureidomycin B from mureidomycin B and acetyl-CoA12. In this study, the expression of SSGG_02979, a npsB homologue in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998, was increased significantly in Sros-hA. We therefore speculated that SSGG_02979 is responsible for the accumulation of acetylated mureidomycin analogues in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998. The N-acetylation reaction was proposed to contribute to a self-resistance of napsamycin in the producer strain12, and similar N-acetyltransferase-mediated reaction was reported to be responsible for self-resistance to the antimicrobial peptide edeine of Brevibacillus brevis Vm421. However, the role of acetylation in mureidomycin self-resistance remains elusive until further experimental validation. Moreover, the substrate promiscuity of NRPSs was observed with variations at AA4 and/or AA5 of mureidomycin (Fig. 7). Similar observations were also found at different amino acid positions in the biosynthesis of pacidamycin and sansanmycin2223. The substrate promiscuity of NRPSs is responsible for the diversity of these uridyl peptide antibiotics. It can also be explored for the generation of novel analogues by precursor-directed biosynthesis2223. With the activation of mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998, the same strategy could be used for generation of novel mureidomycin analogues, and systematic structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies can be carried out to evaluate their biological activities thereafter. If necessary, the NRPSs may be engineered to have a preference for amino acid substrates which can be incorporated to produce mureidomycin analogues with improved anti-Pseudomonas activity.", "We have identified eight acetylated mureidomycin analogues.
