["Abstract", "Protoberberine alkaloids are a group of tetracyclic isoquinoline compounds known for their well-established antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The richness and diversity of protoberberine alkaloids accumulated in the Coptis genus necessitate a comprehensive examination of the biosynthetic machinery to understand their ecological significance. Here, from Coptis chinensis we identified CcCYP719A1, which could install a methylenedioxy bridge on either ring A or ring D of the protoberberine backbone, thus diverging metabolite flux towards the biosynthesis of various protoberberine components. We also obtained CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3, which underwent positive selection after diverging from CcCYP719A1 and maintained specific catalytic activity on ring D. Further, we resolved the biosynthetic pathway of jatrorrhizine by identifying two demethylases, which could also modulate protoberberine composition by removing the C-3 methyl group and methylenedioxy bridge of ring D, allowing demethylated metabolites to be redirected into different routes. Moreover, we characterized 2-O-methyltransferase CcOMT1 and flavin-dependent oxidase CcTHBO, respectively responsible for the commonly observed 2-O-methylation and aromatic ring-C assembly in protoberberine alkaloids. Overall, this study reveals an interconnected metabolite network from which diverse protoberberine alkaloids originate. It provides valuable insights into the existence of undiscovered protoberberine components, and paves the way for the targeted production of desired protoberberine components for potential therapeutic development.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Throughout history, plants with beneficial bioactivities have been sought after and consumed as medicinal remedies. Ancient pharmacological texts, which documented the usage of herbal medicines, are invaluable resources that have significantly influenced modern pharmacology and the development of novel pharmacophores. A notable example is the discovery of artemisinin, an anti-malaria natural product identified from Artemisia annua L., with historical usage dating back over 2000 years for its anti-infective properties, as recorded in the Shennong\u2019s Classic of Materia Medica [1, 2]. In addition to A. annua, numerous other medicinal herbs with excellent therapeutic properties have been passed down through a thousand years of practice. One distinctive example is Coptidis Rhizoma, generally prepared from the rhizome of Coptis chinensis Franch., C. deltoidea C. Y. Cheng et Hsiao, or C. teeta Wall [3]. Culturally, Coptidis Rhizoma is renowned for its intensely bitter taste and characteristic yellow staining. Pharmacologically, it has been an essential ingredient in many ancient pharmacological recipes for treating inflammation and various gastrointestinal ailments [4]. Modern phytochemical and pharmacological research has revealed that the primary active constituents of Coptidis Rhizoma are a group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) featuring the 5,6-dihydrodibenzo[a,g]quinolizinium system, collectively known as protoberberine alkaloids (Fig. 1A) [5, 6]. Although protoberberine alkaloids are broadly found in various plant families, such as Ranunculaceae, Papaveraceae, Berberidaceae, Menispermaceae, and Rutaceae, species of the Coptis genus appear to be outstanding producers of protoberberine alkaloids in terms of quantity and diversity [4, 7]. Over 20 protoberberine components have been found in Coptis species, the total content ranging from 5 to 10% [8, 9]. Yet our knowledge about the physiological role of protoberberine alkaloids in the survival and fitness of Coptis species remains limited. The ecological significance of the lineage-specific increase in the abundance and diversity of protoberberine is also unknown. Addressing these questions would require a comprehensive understanding of protoberberine alkaloid biosynthesis.", "Throughout history, plants with beneficial bioactivities have been sought after and consumed as medicinal remedies.

Among them, the biosynthetic pathway of berberine has been elucidated (Fig. 1B). (S)-Scoulerine, the common precursor of protoberberine alkaloids, first undergoes 9-O-methylation by (S)-scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase (SOMT) to generate (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine [10], which is then subjected to methylenedioxy bridge installation by CYP719A1 (canadine synthase) [11]. Finally, berberine is produced from (S)-canadine through oxidation catalyzed by tetrahydroberberine oxidase (THBO) [12, 13]. On this basis, the biosynthetic pathway of columbamine was determined by identifying the oxidation of (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine to generate columbamine by (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase (THPO) [14]. Further, the biosynthetic pathway for palmatine was determined by characterizing columbamine O-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of columbamine to palmatine (Fig. 1B) [15]. In contrast, both coptisine and epiberberine contain a methylenedioxy bridge on ring D of the protoberberine backbone, distinct from the methylenedioxy bridge of berberine on ring A, suggesting another CYP719 enzyme is responsible for their biosynthesis. The elucidation of the sanguinarine biosynthetic pathway showed that two CYP719 enzymes, cheilanthifoline synthase (CYP719A5) and stylopine synthase (CYP719A2), identified from Eschscholzia californica, convert (S)-scoulerine into (S)-stylopine [16, 17]. It is likely that epiberberine and coptisine are respectively derived from (S)-cheilanthifoline and (S)-stylopine, and their complete biosynthetic pathways are yet to be established (Fig. 1B, dashed arrows). An exhaustive search for the potential methylenedioxy bridge-installing enzyme from the C. chinensis genome resulted in the identification of six candidates [18, 19]. Subsequent biochemical assays only determined one candidate (Cch00017825) that can install a methylenedioxy bridge on ring A, leaving the putative CYP719 enzyme for ring D unaccounted for [19]. Compared with the above-mentioned protoberberine alkaloids, jatrorrhizine lacks an O-methylation modification on the hydroxyl group of C-3, which is already installed on (S)-scoulerine. This discrepancy has raised the question of whether (S)-scoulerine is a biosynthetic precursor for jatrorrhizine. Surrounding this, various hypotheses have been made with regard to the branching point from which the biosynthesis of jatrorrhizine diverges [20, 21]. However, to date, none of these hypotheses has been validated through the identification of corresponding biosynthetic enzymes or intermediates from jatrorrhizine-producing plants.", "Six major protoberberine alkaloids have been identified in C. chinensis, namely berberine, columbamine, palmatine, epiberberine, coptisine, and jatrorrhizine [5].

To investigate the structural basis for their different substrate selectivity, we employed AlphaFold to predict the 3D structures of both CcCYP719A1 and CcCYP719A2. Employing molecular docking analysis, we discovered that (S)-scoulerine could bind in two distinct orientations in the catalytic pocket of CcCYP719A1 with similar binding energy (Supplementary Data Fig. S4). On the other hand, (S)-scoulerine adopts a slanted position in CcCYP719A2, with its hydroxyl group and methoxy group of ring D directed towards the catalytic heme (Supplementary Data Fig. S4). Notably, the active site of CcCYP719A1 contains residues such as Thr111, Thr120, Glu288, Ile360, and Phe474, which, when compared with their counterparts in CcCYP719A2 (His123, Ser135, Glu303, Leu376, and Leu490), offer less steric hindrance to the protoberberine scaffold, resulting in greater substrate binding flexibility (Fig. 2D). This flexibility allows the substrate to orient either ring A or ring D towards the catalytic heme, accounting for the observed substrate promiscuity of CcCYP719A1. Moreover, His123, Phe230, and Phe299 in CcCYP719A2 appear to play a crucial role in positioning and stabilizing the substrate through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions with the tetracyclic ring. However, the corresponding residues in CcCYP719A1 (Ile215, Phe284, and Thr111) are unable to achieve the same effect (Fig. 2E). Additionally, the modeling of (S)-cheilanthifoline and (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine in CcCYP719A2 displayed a similar slanted conformation, with their respective ring D positioned towards the catalytic site. Taken together, these factors exclude the potential activity of CcCYP719A2 on ring A of protoberberine alkaloid, resulting in its specific cheilanthifoline synthase activity (Supplementary Data Fig. S4).", "Genomic information reported earlier demonstrated that CcCYP719A4\u2013CcCYP719A6 are clustered with CcCYP719A1 on chromosome 3, suggesting that they might have originated from a tandem duplication event. In contrast, CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3 are located on chromosomes 4 and 9, respectively [19]. This arrangement implies that CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3 may have originated from a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event. To further explore the evolutionary relationships of the characterized CYP719 enzymes in this study, a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using multiple sequence alignments of CYP719 genes identified from various plant families (Fig. 2F). CcCYP719A1 shares close phylogeny with its ortholog CYP719A1 from Coptis japonica. However, a previous study as well as our own enzyme assays have indicated that CYP719A1 only exhibits canadine synthase activity (Supplementary Data Fig. S5) [11].

The close phylogeny of CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3 with CYP719A18 and CYP719A19, and their identical activity, indicate that the two pairs of orthologs diverged and subfunctionalized from their respective paralogs CcCYP719A1 and CYP719A1 before the divergence of C. japonica and C. chinensis.

This discrepancy therefore becomes the most critical issue in elucidating jatrorrhizine biosynthesis, regarding whether (S)-scoulerine is a precursor of jatrorrhizine. If (S)-scoulerine is not a precursor of jatrorrhizine, the biosynthesis of jatrorrhizine must have diverged from the isoquinoline common pathway as early as norcoclaurine, which is the condensation product of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (Supplementary Data Fig. S14). This indicates that downstream tailoring enzymes should accept the unmethylated substrates in parallel to serve for jatrorrhizine biosynthesis. However, no unmethylated intermediate derived from (S)-norcoclaurine has been reported, leaving this assumption weakly supported. Alternatively, if (S)-scoulerine is indeed the precursor of jatrorrhizine, a demethylase is required to remove the O-methylation on C-3 at some point along the pathway. In fact, enzymes from several families have been reported to catalyze demethylation reactions [28\u201331]. Notably, the biosynthesis of morphine, another type of BIA, also involves demethylation steps. Its biosynthetic intermediates thebaine and codeine can be transformed by codeine O-demethylase (CODM), a 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase, to produce oripavine and morphine, respectively [32].

When (S)-scoulerine was used as the substrate, CODM successfully produced the expected demethylated scoulerine, confirming the reliability of our bioassay system (Supplementary Data Fig. S15). Interestingly, another demethylation product was observed in the reaction mixture of Cc6DM2 and Cc6DM3. This product shares the same molecular mass as the demethylated scoulerine generated by CODM, but showed a slightly earlier elution time in the HPLC analysis, indicating it was likely the C-10 demethylated product of (S)-scoulerine (Supplementary Data Fig. S15). When (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine was incubated with Cc6DM2 or Cc6DM3, a demethylation product different from (S)-scoulerine was produced; the MS2 spectrum of the demethylation product indicates that the demethylation occurs on C-3 (Fig. 4A and B, Supplementary Data Fig. S16). However, none of the demethylase candidates showed activity towards columbamine (Supplementary Data Fig. S17). In the case of palmatine, only a trace amount of transformation was observed in the overnight reaction mixture of Cc6DM2 or Cc6DM3. The retention time and MS2 spectrum of the product matched that of authentic jatrorrhizine (Supplementary Data Fig. S18). Since only a trace amount of palmatine was converted into jatrorrhizine, it is likely that palmatine is not the natural substrate for the demethylases. Overall, these results strongly suggest that jatrorrhizine biosynthesis branches from the demethylation of (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine. To be converted to jatrorrhizine, demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine needs to be methylated on C-2 and oxidized on ring C. Based on the assembly logic of epiberberine, we propose that CcOMT1 and CcTHBO are responsible for the transformation from demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine to jatrorrhizine. Subsequently, we purified demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine from the Cc6DM3 assay and tested it with both CcTHBO and CcOMT1. The results showed that both enzymes could utilize demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine as substrate, producing (S)-tetrahydrojatrorrhizine (also known as corypalmine) and demethyleneberberine, respectively (Fig. 4C and D). Further oxidation of (S)-tetrahydrojatrorrhizine by CcTHBO and methylation of demethyleneberberine by CcOMT1 both led to the generation of jatrorrhizine, as confirmed by comparison with an authentic jatrorrhizine (Fig. 4E and F).
