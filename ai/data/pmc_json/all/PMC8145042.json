["The pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) superfamily, identified in 1998, has grown to nearly 39,000 sequences from over 3300 species. PRPs, recognized as having at least eight contiguous pentapeptide repeats (PRs) of a consensus pentapeptide sequence, adopt a remarkable structure, namely, a right-handed quadrilateral \u03b2-helix with four consecutive PRs forming a single \u03b2-helix coil. Adjacent coils join together to form a \u03b2-helix \u201ctower\u201d stabilized by \u03b2-ladders on the tower faces and type I, type II, or type IV \u03b2-turns facilitating an approximately \u221290\u00b0 redirection of the polypeptide chain joining one coil face to the next. PRPs have been found in all branches of life, but they are predominantly found in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria have existed on earth for more than two billion years and are thought to be responsible for oxygenation of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Filamentous cyanobacteria such as Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120 may also represent the oldest and simplest multicellular organisms known to undergo cell differentiation on earth. Knowledge of the biochemical function of these PRPs is essential to understanding how ancient cyanobacteria achieved functions critical to early development of life on earth. PRPs are predicted to exist in all cyanobacteria compartments including thylakoid and cell-wall membranes, cytoplasm, and thylakoid periplasmic space. Despite their intriguing structure and importance to understanding ancient cyanobacteria, the biochemical functions of PRPs in cyanobacteria remain almost completely unknown. The precise biochemical function of only a handful of PRPs is currently known from any organisms, and three-dimensional structures of only sixteen PRPs or PRP-containing multidomain proteins from any organism have been reported. In this review, the current knowledge of the structures and functions of PRPs is presented and discussed.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The first description of a pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) was reported in 1995, when Haselkorn and coworkers identified a gene from the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc (formerly Anabaena) sp. strain PCC 7120, which, when mutated, altered the composition of glycolipids encasing the heterocysts, among other alterations (Figure 1) [1]. They named the gene heterocyst-specific glycolipids-directing protein K (hglK) for the role that the gene played in localization of glycolipids to heterocysts. The protein encoded by the hglK gene, HglK, was predicted to contain four trans-membrane spanning regions and an unusual alanine- and leucine-rich pentapeptide repeat (PR) region made up of 36 PRs with the consensus sequence AXLXX [1]. Therefore, HglK was the first PRP to be associated with a putative biochemical function. To date, however, the precise mechanism for the role that HglK plays in regulating glycolipid localization to heterocysts remains unknown.", "The first description of a pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) was reported in 1995, when Haselkorn and coworkers identified a gene from the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc (formerly Anabaena) sp. strain PCC 7120, which, when mutated, altered the composition of glycolipids encasing the heterocysts, among other alterations (Figure 1) [1].

They observed that PRPs were most commonly found in cyanobacteria [2]. The authors also proposed a model of PRP structures, rightly predicting that PRPs would adopt a right-handed \u03b2 helical architecture; however, they predicted a triangular-shaped helix, which would prove to be in error once the first three-dimensional structures of PRPs were determined several years later.", "In 1998, Bateman et al.

In 2001, Montero et al. identified a gene mfpA that encoded a PRP that conferred a new mechanism of fluoroquinoline resistance to M. smegmatis [5]. The protein encoded by the mfpA gene resulted in a low level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacine [5]. Hegde et al. [6] identified a 183-amino acid MfpA homolog from M. tuberculosis (MtMfpA) encoded by the Rv3361c gene that was 67% identical to the 192-residue M. smegmatis MfpA protein. In 2005, Hegde et al. [6] reported the three-dimensional structure of MfpA from M. tuberculosis revealing it to be a PRP made up of eight complete PR coils composed of a mixture of type II and type IV \u03b2 turns (Figure 4). MfpA was the first PRP to have its three-dimensional structure solved. Hegde et al. reported that MfpA expression in vivo conferred resistance to the antibiotic fluoroquinolone. Fluoroquinolines are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs that interfere with DNA replication in bacteria, leading to bacterial cell death. Fluoroquinolines exert their antibacterial activity by interfering with the normal function of the type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV. These enzymes normally cut the genomic DNA to allow supercoiling and then ligate the DNA to stabilize the supercoiled DNA. Fluoroquinoline acts by inhibiting the ligase activity of these enzymes and leaving the nuclease activity intact, resulting in accumulation of single- and double-strand breaks that leads to disrupted DNA replication and cell death. Fluoroquinoline acts by binding reversibly to the gyrase-DNA complexes and stabilizing the covalent enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphate ester that is normally a transient intermediate in the topoisomerase reaction. Hegde et al. reported that the three-dimensional structure of MfpA exhibited a size, shape and electrostatic surface similar to that of B-form DNA, and concluded that its mechanism of action was due to DNA mimicry [6]. Since fluoroquinoline only binds to DNA gyrase-DNA complexes, binding of MfpA to DNA gyrase blocks fluoroquinoline binding to DNA gyrase-DNA complexes, thus interfering with the bactericidal activity of fluoroquinoline [6].", "In the early 2000s, with the growing antibiotic resistance of M. tuberculosis to two bactericidal compounds, isoniazid and rifampicin [27], fluoroquinolines had become the most common new antibiotic therapy to treat M. tuberculosis infections [6,27].

MfpA was the first PRP to have its three-dimensional structure solved. Hegde et al. reported that MfpA expression in vivo conferred resistance to the antibiotic fluoroquinolone. Fluoroquinolines are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs that interfere with DNA replication in bacteria, leading to bacterial cell death. Fluoroquinolines exert their antibacterial activity by interfering with the normal function of the type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV. These enzymes normally cut the genomic DNA to allow supercoiling and then ligate the DNA to stabilize the supercoiled DNA. Fluoroquinoline acts by inhibiting the ligase activity of these enzymes and leaving the nuclease activity intact, resulting in accumulation of single- and double-strand breaks that leads to disrupted DNA replication and cell death. Fluoroquinoline acts by binding reversibly to the gyrase-DNA complexes and stabilizing the covalent enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphate ester that is normally a transient intermediate in the topoisomerase reaction. Hegde et al. reported that the three-dimensional structure of MfpA exhibited a size, shape and electrostatic surface similar to that of B-form DNA, and concluded that its mechanism of action was due to DNA mimicry [6].

Superposition of the SopA and NleL crystal structures indicated that the PR and N-lobe domains maintain a fixed relative orientation, the C-lobes can adopt different orientations relative to the PR and N-lobe, perhaps but due to their different functional requirements [52].

The electrostatic surface potential contained large patches of clustered positive and negative charge that are poised to interact with charged binding partners. Potential clues regarding the function of Alr1298 were investigated by analyzing the gene cluster to which the alr1298 gene belonged since the genes in a cluster possibly belonged to a common operon that often share related functions [64,65,66]. The gene cluster contains three genes preceding and three genes following alr1298. Alr1295 was found to be conserved in 14 of 15 aligned genomes and encoded a prohibitin, which generally act as inhibitors to cell proliferation. In cyanobacteria, prohibitins have been linked to thylakoid biogenesis and membrane synthesis. Alr1297 was annotated as an ABC transport system. Alr1299 was predicted to be involved in purine metabolism, metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The other genes were unannotated. Given the proximity of the alr1298 gene to an annotated prohibitin, it is possible that Alr1298 plays a role in cell proliferation and thylakoid biogenesis. A genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that alr1298 was upregulated following nitrogen starvation, ref [67] peaking at a 4x increase at eight hours post nitrogen starvation.

Discussion", "Despite their intriguing structure, and variations therein, the large size of their Pfam superfamily with nearly 39,000 members, and their relative abundance in one of the most ancient and important organisms on earth, i.e., oxygenic cyanobacteria, the biochemical function of PRPs remains remarkably elusive. To date, there are only two examples where the explicit biochemical function of a PRP is known, as discussed in this review. The first cellular function being that of conferring antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinoline antibiotics through the biochemical function of acting as DNA gyrase inhibitors, such as MfpA and the Qnr family of proteins, that exert their function by acting as a DNA mimic, binding to the complex of DNA gyrase and DNA, and blocking binding of fluoroquinoline to the DNA gyrase DNA complex, and therefore blocking its antibiotic activity. The second clear function is seen in SV2C that functions as a BoNT/A receptor in the synaptic vesicles of neurons. In this activity, the BoNT/A toxin binds to the SV2C PRP luminal domain of a synaptic vesicle neurotransmitter membrane protein, with the binding interaction mediated by a dovetailing of the \u03b2-strands of the BoNT/A neurotoxin with an exposed \u03b2-strand edge of the PRP luminal domain, resulting in the formation of an extended \u03b2-sheet that spans and crosses over the PRP luminal domain and the BoNT/A neurotoxin molecule. This completes the list of examples for which a PRP or a PRP domain of a larger protein is known to carry out a specific biochemical function that directly involves the PRP structure itself. From there, our understanding of PRP function becomes less clear. We have seen that PRP domains are present in the SopA ubiquitination inhibitor whose biochemical function is to bind to TRIM56 and TRIM65 and block the host immune response of interferon production that would normally stimulate proteasome targeting of the bacterial proteins as part of the host immune response to infection; however, the PRP domain of SopA does not directly interact with the targeted TRIM proteins leaving the precise function of the PRP domain of SopA in question. From here, a biochemical function has been associated with a few other PRPs, e.g., the prototypical HglK protein was associated with localization of glycolipids to the heterocyst outer layer, but the structure of HglK is unknown and the precise biochemical function of HglK remains unknown. The same is true for RfrA, for which a putative role in regulating an uncharacterized manganese uptake system was proposed, but the structure of RfrA and the nature of the putative manganese uptake system remains uncharacterized. Similarly, HetL has been shown to play a role in regulating heterocyst differentiation, and the structure of HetL has been determined, but no connection between the structure and the proposed biochemical function has been elucidated. The remaining structure/function space of the PRP superfamily remains completely uncharacterized.", "Despite their intriguing structure, and variations therein, the large size of their Pfam superfamily with nearly 39,000 members, and their relative abundance in one of the most ancient and important organisms on earth, i.e., oxygenic cyanobacteria, the biochemical function of PRPs remains remarkably elusive. To date, there are only two examples where the explicit biochemical function of a PRP is known, as discussed in this review. The first cellular function being that of conferring antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinoline antibiotics through the biochemical function of acting as DNA gyrase inhibitors, such as MfpA and the Qnr family of proteins, that exert their function by acting as a DNA mimic, binding to the complex of DNA gyrase and DNA, and blocking binding of fluoroquinoline to the DNA gyrase DNA complex, and therefore blocking its antibiotic activity. The second clear function is seen in SV2C that functions as a BoNT/A receptor in the synaptic vesicles of neurons. In this activity, the BoNT/A toxin binds to the SV2C PRP luminal domain of a synaptic vesicle neurotransmitter membrane protein, with the binding interaction mediated by a dovetailing of the \u03b2-strands of the BoNT/A neurotoxin with an exposed \u03b2-strand edge of the PRP luminal domain, resulting in the formation of an extended \u03b2-sheet that spans and crosses over the PRP luminal domain and the BoNT/A neurotoxin molecule. This completes the list of examples for which a PRP or a PRP domain of a larger protein is known to carry out a specific biochemical function that directly involves the PRP structure itself. From there, our understanding of PRP function becomes less clear. We have seen that PRP domains are present in the SopA ubiquitination inhibitor whose biochemical function is to bind to TRIM56 and TRIM65 and block the host immune response of interferon production that would normally stimulate proteasome targeting of the bacterial proteins as part of the host immune response to infection; however, the PRP domain of SopA does not directly interact with the targeted TRIM proteins leaving the precise function of the PRP domain of SopA in question. From here, a biochemical function has been associated with a few other PRPs, e.g., the prototypical HglK protein was associated with localization of glycolipids to the heterocyst outer layer, but the structure of HglK is unknown and the precise biochemical function of HglK remains unknown.

Similarly, HetL has been shown to play a role in regulating heterocyst differentiation, and the structure of HetL has been determined, but no connection between the structure and the proposed biochemical function has been elucidated. The remaining structure/function space of the PRP superfamily remains completely uncharacterized.", "What we can deduce at this point regarding the structure and function of PRPs, and multi-domain proteins containing PRP domains, is that in some cases the function is a consequence of the shape and electrostatic surface potential of the PRP, as is observed in the case of DNA mimicry in MfpA [6] and the Qnr family of proteins [3,30,34,35,37,38,39,40,41]. In other cases, the PRP domain makes a direct interaction with another protein to mediate its function, such as with the SV2C-LD binding to BoNT/A [58,59,60,61]. In other cases, the PRP domain simply acts as a scaffold to provide a surface to support binding interactions with another protein, as was observed in the ubiquitin E3 ligases [44,49]. We have seen that variations on the PRP scaffold structure can play functional roles, such as the extra-\u03b2-helix loop excursions observed in some Qnr-family proteins, such as QnrB1 [18,33] and AhQnr [20], which appear to play critical roles in guiding interactions with the DNA gyrase. We have also observed many subtle variations in Rfr fold structures that may turn out to be important to function, including small bulges that project from the \u03b2-helix structure, variations in the compositions of the \u03b2-turns, i.e., the mixture of type I, type II, and type IV \u03b2 turns, which cause subtle changes in the \u03b2-helix dimensions or \u03b2-helix twist [21], as well as the presence or absence of N-terminal or C-terminal capping \u03b1-helices, and whether or not the PRP constitutes a domain in a multidomain protein.", "What we can deduce at this point regarding the structure and function of PRPs, and multi-domain proteins containing PRP domains, is that in some cases the function is a consequence of the shape and electrostatic surface potential of the PRP, as is observed in the case of DNA mimicry in MfpA [6] and the Qnr family of proteins [3,30,34,35,37,38,39,40,41].
