["Antibiotic-producing microorganism can develop strategies to deal with self-toxicity. Cytorhodins X and Y, cosmomycins A and B, and iremycin, are produced as final products from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666. These C-7 reduced metabolites show reduced antimicrobial and comparable cytotoxic activities relative to their C-7 glycosylated counterparts. However, the biosynthetic mechanisms and relevant enzymes that drive C-7 reduction in cytorhodin biosynthesis have not yet been characterized. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a reductase, CytA, that mediates C-7 reduction of this anthracycline scaffold; CytA endows the producer Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666 with a means of protecting itself from the effects of its anthracycline products. Additionally, we identified cosmomycins C and D as two intermediates involved in cytorhodin biosynthesis and we also broadened the substrate specificity of CytA to clinically used anthracycline drugs.", "Chun Gui et al. identify CytA, a reductase involved in C-7 reduction during the biosynthesis of cytorhodin, as an anthracycline antibiotic. This study suggests that CytA may protect its producer bacteria by inactivating anthracycline drugs.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Antibiotic producing bacteria that produce toxic agents can develop and employ resistance mechanisms to survive the effects of their products; several major defensive strategies have come to light and these include: efflux pumps, chemical modifications, prodrugs, compound sequestration, subcellular localization, and target modifications/self-resistant protein variants1.

These compounds consist of a linear tetracyclic polyketide backbone and most are hydroxylated or glycosylated at the C-7 position. Naturally occurring C-7 reduced anthracycline antibiotics are relatively rare (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). A total of 14 anthracycline antibiotics were purified from marine-derived Streptomyces sp.

Microbial conversions of anthracycline antibiotics by bacterial strains (Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli) suggest that these reactions are NADH-dependent and require anaerobic or semi-anaerobic conditions10,13.

CytA was overexpressed as an N-terminally His6-tagged soluble protein and purified to homogeneity by Ni affinity chromatography (Fig.\u00a02a). HHpred analysis revealed that CytA is a flavin-dependent protein but the purified protein is colorless. The activity of CytA was first investigated using substrates 6\u20139 and \u03b5-rhodomycinone (10) under aerobic conditions. Reactions with CytA were conducted at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a volume of 100\u2009\u03bcL consisting of 50\u2009mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 25\u2009\u03bcM substrate, 0.5\u2009\u03bcM CytA, and 20\u2009\u03bcM NADH. Reactions with boiled CytA served as controls; all reactions were carried out in parallel to ensure reaction consistency. Reactions were terminated by addition of twofold volume of methanol. As expected, CytA failed, under aerobic conditions to modify any of the substrates 6\u201310. Carrying out the same reactions using rigorously degassed solutions (see \u201cMethods\u201d) afforded very different results. The absence of O2 enabled CytA to readily convert 6 to 3 and 7 to 4 (Fig.\u00a02b) as revealed by HPLC analyses and comparisons with standards (for 3 and 4) as well as LC-HRESIMS analyses for each reaction. Under no conditions were deglycosylated or dehydrated intermediates ever observed in CytA reactions. The absence of any such intermediates supports CytA\u2019s ability to reductively cleave the C-7 C\u2013O bonds of 6 and 7; CytA appears to not require hydrolytic or dehydrative chemistries en route to C-7 reduction. On the heels of this finding we then determined the kinetic parameters of CytA using 6 and 7 as substrates.

This observation strongly suggests that C-7 deglycosylation markedly limits anthracycline bioactivities and that this reaction, especially in light of our findings with CytA, likely constitutes an important self-preservation mechanism for microbial producers of these secondary metabolites.Table 2Antimicrobial activities of compounds 1\u201313.CompoundMIC values (\u03bcg/mL)BSSA1SA2BTEF12224221214430.50.250.1250.250.0640.250.250.1250.250.03588816860.060.030.0050.1250.00170.030.010.0050.1250.00288488498444810>32>32>32>32>3211>32>32>32>32>3212>32>32>32>32>3213>32>32>32>32>32Van0.50.510.50.25Amp44842BS\nB. subtilis BS01, SA1\nStaphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, SA2\nStaphylococcus aureus 745524 BT\nB.\nthuringiensis BT01, EF\nE. faecalis ATCC 29212, Van Vancomycin, Amp Ampicillin, Van and Amp served as positive controls.

In the presence of O2, the initially added electron is transferred from the reduced anthracycline to O2 to return the starting quinone; elimination chemistry at the C-7 center is averted (Fig.\u00a02c).", "Microbial transformations and/or exogenous redox enzymes identified in previous studies revealed that several anthracycline antibiotics can be converted to their non-toxic 7-deoxyanthracycline congeners (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). In this study, we discovered an uncharacterized enzyme that drives the deoxy reduction process. Inactivation of cytA in Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666 impaired the production of C-7 reduced products. Additionally, in vitro studies with purified CtyA revealed its ability to cleave cosmomycins C and D and a set of clinically used drugs with C-7 sugar moieties. Therefore, we conclude that CytA is responsible for degrading cosmomycins C and D to their less active products cosmomycins A and B in the cytorhodin biosynthetic pathway (Fig.\u00a04). The CytA-catalyzed reaction involves anaerobic one electron reduction of the anthracycline quinone ring, using NADH as a cofactor; the absence of O2 and longevity of the reduced species enables loss of the trisaccharide sugar moiety. This elimination produces a quinone methide intermediate and subsequent tautomerization by C-7 protonation leads to the formation of the 7-deoxyaglycone. This mechanism of anthracycline detoxification appears to complement previously reported soil-bourne bacterial detoxification systems that rely on respiratory electron transport complex I-like multi-enzyme complexes11. We also demonstrated that this enzyme-catalyzed deglycosylation constitutes a mechanism of self-resistance for the antibiotic-producing microbes; that this chemistry has the potential to alter clinically relevant agents was also shown. Hence, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a single enzyme endogenous to the producer that mediates reductive cleavage of anthracycline antibiotics; these studies suggest that CytA plays a key role in both microbial and mammalian mechanisms of anthracycline resistance. Further compounding the importance of these findings is that the CytA homologs AclJ, NivJ, and CinSSBG_00486 are all members of the nitroreductase family which carry out similar chemistries. These enzymes are widespread in Actinobacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis but are not yet characterized. Thus, beyond its clear relevance to understanding mechanisms of anthracycline resistance, CytA likely provides us a previously unreported tool by which to further our understanding of nitroreductases that have a clear bearing on human medicine.Fig. 4Proposed cytorhodin biosynthetic pathway.", "Microbial transformations and/or exogenous redox enzymes identified in previous studies revealed that several anthracycline antibiotics can be converted to their non-toxic 7-deoxyanthracycline congeners (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04).
