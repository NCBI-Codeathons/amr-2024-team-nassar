["N-Oxides of heterocyclic compounds are the focus of medical chemistry due to their diverse biological properties. The high reactivity and tendency to undergo various rearrangements have piqued the interest of synthetic chemists in heterocycles with N-oxide fragments. Quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides are an example of an important class of heterocyclic N-oxides, whose wide range of biological activity determines the prospects of their practical use in the development of drugs of various pharmaceutical groups. Derivatives from this series have found application in the clinic as antibacterial drugs and are used in agriculture. Quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides present a promising class for the development of new drugs targeting bacterial infections, oncological diseases, malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and amoebiasis.

H. Zhang et al. conducted QSAR analysis for antimycobacterial activity using CoMFA and CoMSIA models [89]. The results of 3D-QSAR modeling identified several critical requirements for the structure of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides for their antituberculosis properties. This indicates the specificity of the binding of this class of compounds to intracellular targets important for inhibiting pathogen growth. Electron-withdrawing and sterically bulky substituents, particularly halogen atoms, at position 7 of the quinoxaline are preferred for increasing antimycobacterial activity.
