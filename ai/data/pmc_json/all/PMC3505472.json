In order to perform a general comparison between technologies, i.e., microarrays vs mRNA-Seq, the correlation of data within the same technology was used as a reference for the correlations between technologies. The highest correlation (0.68) among comparisons of mRNA-Seq data to microarray data was higher than the highest correlation between arrays (0.52, Roche vs. TIGR v1). This points to the fact that RNA sequencing data are less affected by technological bias, which is confirmed by the scatter plot comparing both mRNA-Seq datasets (Figure 5).", "Comparison between A. fumigatus transcriptome and proteome", "Comparison between A. fumigatus transcriptome and proteome", "Comparison between A. fumigatus transcriptome and proteome", "In order to analyse a possible correlation between transcripts and protein abundances as well as fold-changes, mRNA-Seq data, microarray data and the proteome data of the A. fumigatus wild-type and \u0394mpkA mutant strain were compared.
