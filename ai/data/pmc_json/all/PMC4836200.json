The capacity to suppress disease is attributed to Pf-5's production of a large spectrum of antibiotics, which is controlled by complex regulatory circuits operating at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In this study, we analyzed the genomic sequence of Pf-5 for codon usage patterns and observed that the six rarest codons in the genome are present in all seven known antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters. In particular, there is an abundance of rare codons in pltR, which encodes a member of the LysR transcriptional regulator family that controls the expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes. To test the hypothesis that rare codons in pltR influence pyoluteorin production, we generated a derivative of Pf-5 in which 23 types of rare codons in pltR were substituted with synonymous preferred codons. The resultant mutant produced pyoluteorin at levels 15 times higher than that of the wild-type Pf-5. Accordingly, the promoter activity of the pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene pltL was 20 times higher in the codon-modified stain than in the wild-type. pltR has six AGA codons, which is the rarest codon in the Pf-5 genome. Substitution of all six AGA codons with preferred Arg codons resulted in a variant of pltR that conferred increased pyoluteorin production and pltL promoter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of tRNAUCUArg, the cognate tRNA for the AGA codon, significantly increased pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. A bias in codon usage has been linked to the regulation of many phenotypes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes but, to our knowledge, this is the first example of the role of a rare codon in the regulation of antibiotic production by a Gram-negative bacterium.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Intensive efforts have been made in the past decades to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of antibiotic biosynthesis because of the important roles of antibiotics in agriculture and medicine. In bacteria, genes responsible for biosynthesis, efflux, and regulation of an antibiotic are typically grouped together in the genome as gene clusters. Expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes is often tightly controlled at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by pathway-specific regulators, which commonly are encoded by genes located within the biosynthetic gene cluster, and global regulators encoded by genes distributed distally in the genome (Gross and Loper, 2009).", "Intensive efforts have been made in the past decades to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of antibiotic biosynthesis because of the important roles of antibiotics in agriculture and medicine.

The genetic code is degenerate: 18 of the 20 standard amino acids are encoded by multiple synonymous codons and the usage frequencies of synonymous codons within a genome differ from one another (Chaney and Clark, 2015; Ling et al., 2015). Codon usage is thought to influence protein expression and activity through a variety of mechanisms, including alterations in translational rate and accuracy, co-translational protein folding and interaction with other cellular components during translation, and the stability of mRNA structure (Subramaniam et al., 2013; Chaney and Clark, 2015; Ling et al., 2015; Quax et al., 2015; Rahmen et al., 2015; Supek, 2016). In many organisms, strongly-expressed genes have more common codons than do weakly-expressed genes, and the cognate tRNAs for common codons are usually at relatively high abundance in the cell (Ikemura, 1985; Elf et al., 2003). Compared with the more commonly-used codons, rare synonymous codons are generally believed to be translated more slowly due to the lower level of cognate tRNA (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1989; Letzring et al., 2010). Biased codon usage is involved in diverse microbial functions including photosynthesis (Peden, 1999), stress response (Chan et al., 2012), colony differentiation (Nguyen et al., 2003), lipopolysaccharide synthesis (Daniels et al., 1998), expression of integrase proteins involved in bacteriophage DNA integration and excision (Zahn and Landy, 1996), and expression of type I fimbriae (Tinker and Clegg, 2001). UUA, the rarest codon in the genome of the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor, is present in several antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters and has a well-established role in the regulation of antibiotic production (Chandra and Chater, 2008). A mutation in bldA, which encodes the cognate tRNA for the UUA codon in S. coelicolor (Lawlor et al., 1987), has no obvious effect on vegetative growth but abolishes expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes and the production of antibiotics such as actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin, methylenomycin, and a calcium-dependent antibiotic (Guthrie and Chater, 1990). The dependence of antibiotic production on bldA can be relieved by substituting the UUA rare codon with a synonymous codon in genes regulating the biosynthesis of these antibiotics. For example, the biosynthesis of actinorhodin requires the pathway-specific activator gene actII-ORF4, which contains the UUA rare codon. Substitution of the UUA codon with the synonymous UUG codon in actII-ORF4 allows actinorhodin biosynthesis in bldA mutants (Fern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 1991). To date, however, the role of codon usage in regulation of secondary metabolism in Gram-negative bacteria is virtually unknown.", "Biased usage of codons is a well-established mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria (as reviewed in Ling et al., 2015; Quax et al., 2015).

The plt cluster consists of genes with regulatory, biosynthetic, and transport functions (Figure 2A; Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999). It has been noted that pltR, which encodes a LysR family regulator required for transcriptional activation of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes, has a higher frequency of rare codons than do the other genes in the plt gene cluster (Figure 2C; Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999). pltR contains all 61 amino acid-encoding codons except CGT, a preferred Arg codon with a usage frequency of 9.2 codons per 1000 codons (Table 3). To determine if the rare codons in pltR influence pyoluteorin production, we made a derivative of Pf-5 having a modified pltR in which 35 different types of rare codons were substituted with preferred synonymous codons, resulting in alterations to 126 of the 343 codons in pltR (Figure 3A). Among the 35 optimized codons, 23 were completely substituted (Table 3). 12 codons were partially substituted (Table 3) because complete codon modification was predicted to result in complex secondary structures of DNA oligonucleotides that were difficult to synthesize. The resultant codon-modified strain, LK298, produced 15 times more pyoluteorin than did the wild-type strain Pf-5 (Figure 3B). The final cell density of the 24 h culture of LK298 was slightly lower than the wild-type (Figure 3B), which is consistent with our previous observation of an inverse relationship between the amount of pyoluteorin produced in a Pf-5 culture and the culture's final cell density (Kidarsa et al., 2011).

Approximately 2% of the genes in the genomes of Streptomyces spp. have the UUA codon (Li et al., 2007) whereas ca. 15% of the genes in the Pf-5 genome have the AGA codon (Table 2). In S. coelicolor, nine genes, which comprise 6.2% of the 145 UUA-containing genes in the genome, are involved in the antibiotic biosynthesis (Bentley et al., 2002; Li et al., 2007). In contrast, 24 genes, which comprise only 2.6% of the 917 AGA-containing genes of Pf-5, are involved in the biosynthesis of known antibiotics (Table 2). Other AGA-containing genes have diverse predicted cellular functions, including motility, polysaccharide synthesis, stress response, type II and VI secretion systems (Figure 6, Supplemental file 2). Therefore, the AGA rare codon may play a more general role in the physiology of Pf-5 compared to the relatively focused function of the UUA codon in antibiotic production and development in Streptomyces spp. In line with that prediction, mutations in bldA, which encodes the only tRNA for the UUA codon of Streptomyces spp. (Lawlor et al., 1987), can be selected for and the mutant can persist in laboratory cultures. In contrast, our efforts to delete the tRNAArg encoding gene PFL_3991 from the chromosome of Pf-5 were unsuccessful, possibly due to an essential role of this tRNA in the bacterium. Additionally, the influence of UUA codon on antibiotic production by Streptomyces spp. is primarily through pathway-specific transcriptional regulators encoded by genes containing the UUA codon (Chater and Chandra, 2008). In contrast, the AGA rare codon is present not only in the pathway-specific regulator pltR, but also in the structural and export genes in the plt gene clusters as well as genes dispersed in the Pf-5 genome that are associated with pyoluteorin production (Figure 2). Thus, biased codon usage has a role in the antibiotic production in both P. protegens and Streptomyces spp., but these two known examples of codon usage for regulation of antibiotic production have important differences.", "Our finding that biased AGA codon usage of pltR regulates pyoluteorin production of Pf-5 is consistent with the known role of biased codon usage of UUA in antibiotic production by Streptomyces spp., but also highlights distinctions between the phenomena in these bacteria. Approximately 2% of the genes in the genomes of Streptomyces spp. have the UUA codon (Li et al., 2007) whereas ca. 15% of the genes in the Pf-5 genome have the AGA codon (Table 2). In S. coelicolor, nine genes, which comprise 6.2% of the 145 UUA-containing genes in the genome, are involved in the antibiotic biosynthesis (Bentley et al., 2002; Li et al., 2007). In contrast, 24 genes, which comprise only 2.6% of the 917 AGA-containing genes of Pf-5, are involved in the biosynthesis of known antibiotics (Table 2). Other AGA-containing genes have diverse predicted cellular functions, including motility, polysaccharide synthesis, stress response, type II and VI secretion systems (Figure 6, Supplemental file 2). Therefore, the AGA rare codon may play a more general role in the physiology of Pf-5 compared to the relatively focused function of the UUA codon in antibiotic production and development in Streptomyces spp. In line with that prediction, mutations in bldA, which encodes the only tRNA for the UUA codon of Streptomyces spp. (Lawlor et al., 1987), can be selected for and the mutant can persist in laboratory cultures. In contrast, our efforts to delete the tRNAArg encoding gene PFL_3991 from the chromosome of Pf-5 were unsuccessful, possibly due to an essential role of this tRNA in the bacterium. Additionally, the influence of UUA codon on antibiotic production by Streptomyces spp. is primarily through pathway-specific transcriptional regulators encoded by genes containing the UUA codon (Chater and Chandra, 2008). In contrast, the AGA rare codon is present not only in the pathway-specific regulator pltR, but also in the structural and export genes in the plt gene clusters as well as genes dispersed in the Pf-5 genome that are associated with pyoluteorin production (Figure 2). Thus, biased codon usage has a role in the antibiotic production in both P. protegens and Streptomyces spp., but these two known examples of codon usage for regulation of antibiotic production have important differences.", "In this work, we focused on the AGA rare codons of pltR and their roles in pyoluteorin production but our bioinformatic screening suggests that rare codons are likely to influence the production of many antibiotics in Pf-5. AGA is present in biosynthesis gene clusters for toxoflavin, orfamide, rhizoxin, pyrrolnitrin and DAPG, in addition to pyoluteorin (Figure 1, Table 2). For example, rzxB, the first gene of the rhizoxin gene cluster, has seven AGA codons. Additionally, both prnA and prnD, the first and last genes in the pyrrolnitrin gene cluster, have an AGA codon. It would be interesting to investigate the potential role of codon usage in pyrrolnitrin production, as the pyrrolnitrin gene cluster lacks a pathway-specific regulator and little is known about factors controlling production of this antibiotic. In addition to the codon AGA, other rare codons may also play a role in the regulation of antibiotic production by Pf-5. For example, codon UUA, with a usage frequency of 0.8 per 1000 codons in the genome, is the second rarest codon in Pf-5 but is present in pltR, phlF and toxR, which encode pathway-specific regulators for the production of pyoluteorin, DAPG and toxoflavin, respectively (Nowak-Thompson et al., 1994, 1999; Philmus et al., 2015). The UUA codon was modified to synonymous optimal codons in LK298 and LK364 (Table 3), which have a higher production of pyoluteorin and pltL promoter activity than does the wild-type (Figure 3B). Investigations into the regulatory roles of rare codons on antibiotic production by Pf-5 will improve our understanding of codon usage mechanisms and the regulation of bacterial antibiotic production.", "In this work, we focused on the AGA rare codons of pltR and their roles in pyoluteorin production but our bioinformatic screening suggests that rare codons are likely to influence the production of many antibiotics in Pf-5.

An example is provided by a recent codon usage analysis in E. coli, which showed that rare codons in the yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) gene have no obvious impact on the protein synthesis rate in amino acid-rich media, but significantly affect the translation rate under amino acid-starvation conditions (Subramaniam et al., 2013). In the rhizosphere, bacteria like Pf-5 live in dynamic environments influenced by nutrients from root exudates, physical properties of the soil, and interactions with other microbes. The presence of large numbers of rare codons in pltR may allow Pf-5 to regulate the production of pyoluteorin, which is known to play a role in microbial interactions (Howell and Stipanovic, 1979; Brodhagen et al., 2004), over the range of fluctuating environmental conditions the bacterium encounters in its natural habitats. We also recognize that AGA and other rare codons are present not only in antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters, but also many other genes with diverse predicted functions in the genome of Pf-5. Future research on the regulatory roles of rare codons in antibiotic production and the expression of other phenotypes will further advance our knowledge of how Pseudomonas spp. coordinate diverse cellular functions with the antibiotic production.", "Codon usage provides a key mechanism by which microorganisms respond to environmental perturbations (Ling et al., 2015).
