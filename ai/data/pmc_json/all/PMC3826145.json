["Dithiolopyrrolones are a class of antibiotics that possess the unique pyrrolinonodithiole (4H-[1,2] dithiolo [4,3-b] pyrrol-5-one) skeleton linked to two variable acyl groups. To date, there are approximately 30 naturally occurring dithiolopyrrolone compounds, including holomycin, thiolutin, and aureothricin, and more recently thiomarinols, a unique class of hybrid marine bacterial natural products containing a dithiolopyrrolone framework linked by an amide bridge with an 8-hydroxyoctanoyl chain linked to a monic acid. Generally, dithiolopyrrolone antibiotics have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against various microorganisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and even parasites. Holomycin appeared to be active against rifamycin-resistant bacteria and also inhibit the growth of the clinical pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus N315. Its mode of action is believed to inhibit RNA synthesis although the exact mechanism has yet to be established in vitro. A recent work demonstrated that the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri employs an RNA methyltransferase for self-resistance during the holomycin production. Moreover, some dithiolopyrrolone derivatives have demonstrated promising antitumor activities. The biosynthetic gene clusters of holomycin have recently been identified in S. clavuligerus and characterized biochemically and genetically. The biosynthetic gene cluster of thiomarinol was also identified from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SANK 73390, which was uniquely encoded by two independent pathways for pseudomonic acid and pyrrothine in a novel plasmid. The aim of this review is to give an overview about the isolations, characterizations, synthesis, biosynthesis, bioactivities and mode of action of this unique family of dithiolopyrrolone natural products, focusing on the period from 1940s until now.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "There is an urgent need for new antibiotics with novel cellular targets. Though resistance to existing antibiotics is increasing at an alarming rate, only four new structural classes of antibiotics have been introduced to the clinic in the last 50 years [1,2,3]. Dithiolopyrrolones are a group of potent antibiotic natural products that have been found in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. They consist of a unique pyrrolinonodithiole (4H-[1,2] dithiolo [4,3-b] pyrrol-5-one) chromophore [4]. Since the isolation of the first member of this family aureothricin (1) from a soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. 26A over 65 years ago [5], this class of molecules has intrigued numerous research groups not only for their unique chemical structures and their antibacterial/antifungal activities but also the chemical logic and regulation of the biosynthesis. Many members of this family have already showed strong broad-spectrum activities towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, Yeast, Fungi and even parasites [6]. Holomycin (9) appeared to inhibit the rafamycin-resistant bacteria. It also acts as antibacterial agent toward clinical pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus N315. Its mode of action has been long attributed to inhibit the activity of bacterial RNA polymerase although the exact mechanism remained to be elucidated in vitro. In the last two decades, there has been an increasing interest in both synthetic and pharmacological investigations of this unique class of molecules due to the emerging significance of aryl-containing dithiolopyrrolone as antiproliferative agents [7].", "There is an urgent need for new antibiotics with novel cellular targets.

Later on, holomycin and N-propionyl derivative 10 (Figure 2) were isolated from mutant strains of Streptomyces sp. P662 [13] and Streptomyces clavuligerus [29]. Interestingly, the wild types of these two Streptomyces strains are also producers of cephamycin C, a potent \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, which is biologically synthesized from aminoadipic acid, cysteine and valine [29,30,31]. The wild type Streptomyces sp. P6621 was found to produce cephamycin C [32] but does not produce 9 and 10. Chemical mutagenesis led to generate the mutant Streptomyces sp. P6621-7N49 that only produces half the amount of cephamycin C with the production of 9 and 10 [32]. It was proposed that the production of 9 and 10 decrease the pool of cysteine available for cephamycin C biosynthesis and thus diminishes the level of cephamycin C produced. Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC27064 has capacity to produce two clinically important antibiotics, the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic cephamycin C [33] and the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid [34]. Similar to the above case, the production of holomycin 9 in the wild type S. clavuligerus is not detectable. The mutant strain IT1, generated by UV mutagenesis of the parent strain of S. clavuligerus, led to overproduction of holomycin [29]. It was proposed that the unstable genetic element affect the production of holomycin [35]. Holomycin was also found from marine Streptomyces sp.

Recent efforts on the biosynthetic pathways of holomycin and thiomarinols have just started to uncover the intriguing aspects of the underlying chemical logic, regulation and resistance of this class of molecules. This review article has covered the natural product discovery, synthesis, bioactivity and biosynthesis of this class of natural products in the first time over sixty years. Further progress in this class of molecules will be to understand the biochemistry of the formation of the pyrrolone chromophore and the timing of N-methylation in thiolutin-type of molecules, and to ascertain the exact antibacterial mode of action, which will facilitate a greater understanding of this promising class of antibacterial and antitumor agents.", "Acknowledgements", "HD thanks the financial supports from the School of Natural and Computing Sciences, University of Aberdeen.
