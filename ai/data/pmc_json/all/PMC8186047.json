However, this development did not become a global issue until antibiotic abuse in medicine and animal husbandry became more widespread [2\u20134]. Antibiotic resistance dramatically increased in the 1980s and 1990s due to a discovery void. The progressive increase of antibiotic resistance and the decline in research and development of antibiotics combined to produce the current crisis [5]. Since there have been few developments in the creation of new antibiotic classes for many years, bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to those that are currently in use [1, 6]. The targets of antibiotics are diverse; protein synthesis, DNA replication, RNA synthesis and the cell membrane are common targets [4]. Antibiotics with novel targets need to be developed for replacing the existing drugs.", "Antibiotic resistance was first discovered in the 1940s, when it was observed that bacteria were become increasingly resistant to measures taken against them [1].

Therefore, increasing the structural diversity of antimicrobial compounds becomes important. Estimates of all possible small molecules are pegged at 1063 distinct molecules, of which many may not be accessible by synthesis [8]. Only a small fraction of these molecules are biologically relevant [9]. However, natural compounds offer better chances of finding bioactive molecules with entirely new chemical scaffolds than combinatorial chemistry libraries, since they have evolved to be bioactive, and can often enter cells via transmembrane transporters rather than by passive diffusion [10]. Statistical analysis reveals the continuing trend of chemical novelty in natural products as de-replication tools are increasingly being implemented [11]. In this context, shifting to less known bacterial phyla, rather than over-represented phyla such as the Actinobacteria might increase diversity of the antibiotics identified by prospecting [12]. The goal of our study is to identify novel bacteria that yield potentially novel compounds, which may become starting points to develop more specific and potent antibiotics.", "The \u03b2-lactam core structure is part of a number of antibiotic classes, but \u03b2-lactam resistance is widespread and is conferred by over 300 types of \u03b2-lactamases, of which 200 are able to hydrolyze extended spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics [7].
