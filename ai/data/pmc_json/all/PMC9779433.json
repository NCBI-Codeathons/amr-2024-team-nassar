["Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are among the most clinically successful antimicrobials. GPAs inhibit cell-wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria via binding to lipid II. Natural GPAs are produced by various actinobacteria. Being themselves Gram-positives, the GPA producers evolved sophisticated mechanisms of self-resistance to avoid suicide during antibiotic production. These self-resistance genes are considered the primary source of GPA resistance genes actually spreading among pathogenic enterococci and staphylococci. The GPA-resistance mechanism in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus\u2014the producer of the last-resort-drug teicoplanin\u2014has been intensively studied in recent years, posing relevant questions about the role of Tei3 sensor histidine kinase. In the current work, the molecular properties of Tei3 were investigated. The setup of a GPA-responsive assay system in the model Streptomyces coelicolor allowed us to demonstrate that Tei3 functions as a non-inducible kinase, conferring high levels of GPA resistance in A.\u00a0teichomyceticus. The expression of different truncated versions of tei3 in S.\u00a0coelicolor indicated that both the transmembrane helices of Tei3 are crucial for proper functioning. Finally, a hybrid gene was constructed, coding for a chimera protein combining the Tei3 sensor domain with the kinase domain of VanS, with the latter being the inducible Tei3 ortholog from S. coelicolor. Surprisingly, such a chimera did not respond to teicoplanin, but indeed to the related GPA A40926. Coupling these experimental results with a further in silico analysis, a novel scenario on GPA-resistance and biosynthetic genes co-evolution in A.\u00a0teichomyceticus was hereby proposed.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) [1], particularly dalbaheptides [2], belong to a clinically relevant group of natural compounds produced by soil-dwelling and mycelium-forming Gram-positive actinobacteria, traditionally named actinomycetes [3,4]. As with other natural compounds, genes responsible for the biosynthesis of GPAs are grouped in large biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [5]. GPAs are successfully utilized to treat severe infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) staphylococcal and enterococcal strains. Two natural and three semisynthetic GPAs are currently approved for clinical use [3,6,7]. Natural first-generation GPAs are vancomycin and teicoplanin, produced by the actinobacteria Amycolatopsis orientalis (various strains) [8] and Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121 [9], respectively. Vancomycin was introduced in clinics first (in 1958), followed by teicoplanin (1988) in Europe and then in Japan (1998) [3]. Semisynthetic second-generation GPAs include telavancin\u2014a vancomycin derivative [10], oritavancin\u2014a derivative of the natural GPA chloroeremomycin [11], and dalbavancin\u2014a derivative of the other natural GPA, A40926 [12].", "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) [1], particularly dalbaheptides [2], belong to a clinically relevant group of natural compounds produced by soil-dwelling and mycelium-forming Gram-positive actinobacteria, traditionally named actinomycetes [3,4].

Peculiarly, resistance mechanisms in GPA producers and pathogens are very similar [17]. It is likely that pathogens acquired GPA resistance genes from GPA producers, or more generally from non-producing actinobacteria, where GPA resistance determinants are abundant [18,19]. GPAs interact with d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) termini of the nascent peptidoglycan (PG), impeding upstream transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions and consequently blocking cell wall biosynthesis [20]. The resistance mechanisms shared between GPA producers and pathogens lead to the modification of the d-Ala-d-Ala termini, reducing the affinity of GPAs for their target. d-Ala-d-Ala termini in PG precursors are replaced by d-Ala-d-lactate (d-Lac) [17,21] or truncated to a single d-Ala residue [22,23,24]. The first mechanism requires a three-gene operon\u2014vanHAX, where vanH codes for a d-Lac dehydrogenase responsible for generating a d-Lac pool, vanX\u2014for a d,d-dipeptidase whose role is reducing the intracellular pool of d-Ala-d-Ala [25,26], and vanA\u2014for a d-Ala-d-Lac ligase [21,27]. The second involves a single d,d-carboxypeptidase named VanY, which trims the terminal d-Ala residue. In both cases, PG precursors still undergo transpeptidation reactions, but this process is not affected by GPAs [22,23,24]. The expression of vanY or vanHAX might be constitutive or inducible. The latter requires a two-component regulatory system consisting of a sensor histidine kinase (SHK) and a transcriptional response regulator (RR), also known as VanS and VanR, respectively [28,29,30,31]. VanS can specifically recognize extracellular GPAs and phosphorylate VanR, which, in turn, activates the expression of other van genes [29,30,31,32,33].", "Although GPAs of both generations are still clinically useful, resistant pathogens are inevitably emerging [13,14,15,16].

MEGA 11 was used for the analysis [58]. Evolution was inferred by using the JTT matrix-based model [59]. A discrete \u03b3 distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories). Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap-support values derived from 1000 replications. Five clades were delineated on this tree (A\u2013E); clades correlated with substrate- and regiospecificity of GTFs. Veg36-OLZ52430-AIG79202 seemed to be a clade of few additional irrelevant GTFs coded nearby the corresponding BGCs. Notably, Tei1 (marked with \u201cGlcNAc-AA6 (!)\u201d label) appeared in the clade (A) grouping GTFs attaching either d-glucose or GlcNAc to aglycone AA4, while the enzyme was experimentally shown to attach GlcNAc to aglycone AA6. \u201c(?)\u201d signs indicate presumed regiospecificity (lack of experimental evidence).", "In contrast, the GPA resistance phenotype is commonly constitutive in GPA producers, as it was shown in A. teichomyceticus and Am. balhimycina [34]. In Am. balhimycina, vanHAX orthologs are the main contributors to GPA resistance [40,60]. However, vanHAX are not situated within the borders of balhimycin BGC (as commonly occurs in the other actinomycetes producing GPAs), and they are not co-localized with vanRS orthologs [40]. Hence, the expression of vanHAX is devoid of vanRS-mediated regulation and is constitutive. It should be noted that Am. balhimycina also possesses additional GPA-resistance mechanisms that are not van-mediated [61].", "In contrast, the GPA resistance phenotype is commonly constitutive in GPA producers, as it was shown in A. teichomyceticus and Am. balhimycina [34].

Tei3 SHK initially responded to des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin (modeled with A40926 in the experiment presented in this work) (Figure 7) and it was probably inducible. A further two alternative scenarios are possible. The first implies that the non-inducibility of Tei3 evolved as an adaptation to the appearance of Tei1 because A. teichomyceticus was required to rapidly gain constitutive GPA resistance as Tei3 was unable to sense teicoplanin. The second scenario implies that Tei3 in the des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin producer became non-inducible at the first place, consequently giving the BGC room for further evolution and structural changes of the produced GPA. Considering that, in the first hypothesis, fewer mutations would probably be required to give Tei3 constitutive properties than to remodel its SD, the second scenario is more likely in our opinion. Hence, mutations leading to the non-inducibility of Tei3 might have served as a preadaptation, which allowed teicoplanin to emerge in its current form, carrying the GlcNAc residue at AA6 (Figure 7).", "If our reconstruction of the evolution of Tei1/Tei10* is correct, the ancestor of the teicoplanin BGC coded the biosynthesis of des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin, which structurally resembles A40926 and was recognized by the Tei3 SD.
