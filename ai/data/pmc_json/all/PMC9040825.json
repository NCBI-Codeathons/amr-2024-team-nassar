Despite many attempts to understand intrinsic antibiotic resistance, many of the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In this study, we found that iron supplementation promoted antibiotic resistance in Streptomyces coelicolor. Iron-promoted resistance occurred specifically against bactericidal antibiotics, irrespective of the primary target of antibiotics. Transcriptome profiling revealed that some genes in the central metabolism and respiration were upregulated under iron-replete conditions. Iron supported the growth of S. coelicolor even under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of potassium cyanide, which reduces aerobic respiration of cells, iron still promoted respiration and antibiotic resistance. This suggests the involvement of a KCN-insensitive type of respiration in the iron effect. This phenomenon was also observed in another actinobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis. Taken together, these findings provide insight into a bacterial resistance strategy that mitigates the activity of bactericidal antibiotics whose efficacy accompanies oxidative damage by switching the respiration mode.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Antibiotic resistance is one of the threatening problems in public health. More than 700,000 people die of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria annually (1, 2). The main mechanisms of antibiotic resistance are reduction in the drug influx, enhancement of the drug efflux, inactivation of the drug, and modification of the drug target (3\u20135). In addition to these quintessential resistance mechanisms that are often acquired by spontaneous mutation and/or horizontal gene transfer, recent studies suggest that the intrinsic physiological responses could affect the efficacy of not just a single antibiotic but multiple antibiotics, although they are not directly associated with the antibiotic mode of action (6, 7). For example, the stringent response involving (p)ppGpp alarmone contributes to antibiotic resistance (8, 9): inactivation of the genes for (p)ppGpp synthesis sensitizes the bacterial cells to different classes of antibiotics, allowing enhanced antibiotic efficacy in experimental infections. Production of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can induce antibiotic resistance, and the chemicals that inhibit H2S production render the bacterial cells hypersusceptible to antibiotics (10). Moreover, alterations in the anabolic and/or catabolic pathways could also affect the efficacy of multiple antibiotics, although they are ultimately affected by the inhibitory or lethal activity of the antibiotics (11, 12). These physiological responses are regarded as the intrinsic resistance mechanisms that function irrespective of the primary targets of antibiotics and are relatively conserved among bacterial species (13).", "Antibiotic resistance is one of the threatening problems in public health.

As vigorous antibiotic producers, streptomycetes are inevitably equipped with specialized resistance mechanisms to protect themselves specifically from endogenously produced antibiotics (15, 16). Nevertheless, the intrinsic or generalized resistance mechanisms have not been well defined in Streptomyces spp. except for a few examples. In Streptomyces coelicolor, a model organism for Streptomyces biology (17), a transcriptional regulator (WblC/WhiB7) is known to control intrinsic resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics similar to its role in the pathogenic actinomycete bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (18, 19). It is noteworthy that the WblC/WhiB7 regulon includes not only the specialized resistance genes for drug efflux and modification but also genes for more general functions to confer resistance by modifying ribosome and translation machinery, gene transcription, and metabolism (18). Thus, more complicated resistance determinants that this antibiotic-producing bacterium exploits deserve further research to elucidate the mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to antibiotics.", "The Streptomyces species are well-studied soil-dwelling bacteria famous for producing many commercially available antibiotics and other clinically important drugs (14).

Based on the possible link between the growth inhibitory effect of kanamycin and the SodF depletion that is usually caused by reduced iron availability as an iron-sparing response (21), we hypothesized that kanamycin-induced growth inhibition might be attributed to iron starvation. To test for this, we examined whether the bacterial susceptibility to kanamycin could be circumvented simply by iron repletion.

This was also verified by measuring the growth and determining the MICs of kanamycin in the presence of iron. As shown in Fig.\u00a01B, growth inhibition by kanamycin gradually disappeared as more iron was supplemented in liquid culture, whereas growth was not affected at all by the iron treatment in the absence of kanamycin.

Interestingly, iron-induced resistance was observed only against polymyxin B (Fig.\u00a02C), which interferes with the membrane integrity of the Gram-negative bacteria and a few Gram-positive bacteria by direct interaction with some negatively charged components of the cell envelope (24). We first ruled out the possibility that kanamycin and polymyxin B could directly affect iron availability by determining the intracellular iron levels and the expression levels of the iron-responsive genes (Fig.\u00a0S3). A common feature of kanamycin and polymyxin B that distinguishes them from the other antibiotics is that both of them are bactericidal, whereas the others are bacteriostatic (Fig.\u00a02B and C). We then examined whether iron promotes resistance to other bactericidal aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, streptomycin, and neomycin.

As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, KCN at its sublethal concentration (0.5\u2009mM) reduced respiration in all samples by about 2-fold. However, even in the presence of KCN, iron still promoted respiration significantly, suggesting the involvement of a KCN-insensitive type of respiration in the iron effect. We then examined the effect of KCN on the viability of cells treated with bactericidal antibiotics (kanamycin and polymyxin B) in the presence and absence of iron. Figure\u00a05B shows that iron-promoted survival against bactericidal antibiotics (kanamycin and polymyxin B) was decreased under 0.5\u2009mM KCN, as assessed by measuring the number of CFU.

Actinomycetes are generally aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria and are predominantly found in soil. Since those deeper areas in soil are deemed short of oxygen and thus hypoxic (29), an alternative or microaerophilic respiration mode might be necessary for those aerobic bacteria to survive limited oxygen availability, as previously suggested for S. coelicolor (30). Oxygen is also thought to be limited near the center of the densely grown mycelial network. Moreover, iron metabolism might be also important for those bacteria thriving in soil, because soil is highly rich in iron compared to other natural habitats (20). For S. coelicolor and other soil actinomycetes that have well been adapted to such iron-rich hypoxic soil environments, iron-adapted respiration might be one of those strategies for survival. Although the precise modes by which S. coelicolor supports vegetative growth under hypoxic and iron-replete conditions need to be determined, our study makes it clear that the iron-induced alteration of respiration to enhance NADH oxidation lies behind the promotion of intrinsic resistance to bactericidal antibiotics in actinobacteria such as S. coelicolor and M. smegmatis.", "In this study, we demonstrated that increased intracellular iron promotes intrinsic antibiotic resistance through altered respiration in two actinobacterial species, S. coelicolor and M. smegmatis.

The altered respiration might involve cytochrome bd oxidase produced from the cydAB operon upregulated by iron. Although our data showed that cydAB mutation did not change the iron effect in S. coelicolor (see Fig.\u00a0S6 in the supplemental material), there still remains a possibility that the cytochrome bd oxidase may play some role, considering that mutations sometimes accompany compensating changes to compromise their effects. It was previously reported that the cydA mutant of M. smegmatis was highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and the antileprotic antibiotic clofazimine (31), corroborating the potential contribution of cytochrome bd oxidase and possibly some other alternative oxidases (26) to the intrinsic antibiotic resistance in these bacterial species.", "The effect of KCN on reducing the magnitude of NADH oxidation and cell survival under bactericidal antibiotics suggests that the altered respiration induced by iron could consist of multiple changes in respiratory pathways for NADH oxidation, differing in KCN sensitivity.

Despite some controversy about the exact nature of the culprit molecules, it has been shown that the killing effect of bactericidal antibiotics relies on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during aerobic respiration (27, 32). Recent studies also demonstrated that aerobic respiration makes the growing bacteria more susceptible to bactericidal antibiotics and facilitates eradication of persisters induced by the antibiotics (33, 34). A recent report revealed that an anaerobic respiration mode using nitrate as the final electron acceptor promotes intrinsic resistance to polymyxin B in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35). This might be able to obviate the ROS generation that occurs during oxygen respiration in this bacterium. Likewise, it can be postulated that S. coelicolor and M. smegmatis, both of which are known as strict aerobic bacteria (36), could support the anaerobic type of respiration in an iron-rich soil environment. It has been demonstrated that S. coelicolor can utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor (37). However, nitrate respiration did not allow growth under anaerobic conditions but only maintained proton motive force enough to support dormancy, such as in spores (30). It has been postulated that alternative electron acceptors may be involved in generating proton motive force under hypoxic or anaerobic conditions, especially considering the more than 200 uncharacterized oxidoreductases in the S. coelicolor genome (17, 37). In this study, we have shown that iron can enhance respiration and hence the growth of S. coelicolor even under anaerobic conditions (Fig.\u00a04C).

This iron-mediated toxicity has been exploited as an antibiotic adjuvant or inhibitor (38), as reported in some studies showing that iron could enhance antibiotic-dependent cell death and that decreasing iron concentrations led to increased antibiotic resistance (39\u201341). In contrast, some studies reported the opposite effect of iron, such that the efficacy of antibiotics was enhanced by iron chelators (42) and that an increased iron supply induced resistance to antibiotics (43). Considering the nature of iron as a two-edged sword, this apparent discrepancy might be associated with the differential availabilities and biological accessibilities of iron that depend on the microorganisms and/or the growth conditions. However, considering that kanamycin is one of the second-line antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs for the treatment of extensively drug-resistant TB (44), some precaution may be needed in the use kanamycin or related bactericidal antibiotics for TB patients, whose lungs usually contain more iron than those of healthy individuals (45).
