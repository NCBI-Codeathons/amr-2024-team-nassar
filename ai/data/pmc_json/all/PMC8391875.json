["Metabolic engineering substantially aims at the development of more efficient, robust and industrially competitive microbial strains for the potential applications in food, fermentation and pharmaceutical industries. An efficient lab scale bioprocess was developed for high level fermentative production of L-alanine using metabolically engineered Pediococcus acidilactici BD16 (alaD+). Computational biology tools assisted the designing of a synthetic alaD gene cassette, which was further cloned in shuttle vector pLES003 and expressed using an auto-inducible P289 promoter. Further, L-alanine production in the recombinant P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain was carried out using fed-batch fermentation under oxygen depression conditions, which significantly enhanced L-alanine levels. The recombinant strain expressing the synthetic alaD gene produced 229.12 g/L of L-alanine after 42 h of fed-batch fermentation, which is the second highest microbial L-alanine titer reported so far. After extraction and crystallization, 95% crystal L-alanine (217.54 g/L) was recovered from the culture broth with an enantiomeric purity of 97%. The developed bioprocess using recombinant P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) is suggested as the best alternative to chemical-based commercial synthesis of L-alanine for potential industrial applications.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The global market value of amino acids, especially the nonessential ones, has enhanced significantly over the years owing to their humungous industrial applications [1]. L-Alanine, though a non-essential amino acid, has extensive food, pharmaceutical and veterinary applications [2,3]. It is an FDA-approved food additive and nutritional supplement, mainly used as a low-calorie sweetener, a fat substitute and as an ingredient of therapeutic formulations for treating hypoglycemia, liver diseases, prostate hypertrophy and urea cycle disorders [4,5,6]. It is widely used as a hair and skin conditioning agent and as an ingredient in cosmetics and several personal care products [7,8].
