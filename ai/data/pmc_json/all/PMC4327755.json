["A diverse and versatile spectrum of metabolic activities among isolates of fluorescent Pseudomonas putida indicates their adaptability to various niches. These polyhydroxybutyrate producing and phosphate solubilizing isolates showed a high level of functional and genetic versatility among themselves. One of the potential P. putida isolate P132 can contribute as a candidate agent for both biocontrol and PGPR applications. Identified as one of the most efficient PHB producer and phosphate solubilizer, in vitro detection of P132 showed the presence of genes for phenazine, pyrrolnitrin, pyoluteorin and 2,4 diacetylphloroglucinol along with polyhydroxyalkanoate.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Pseudomonas putida are ubiquitous bacteria frequently present in water, in soils, and especially in the plant rhizosphere (Timmis 2002; Dos Santos et al. 2004).

Phosphate solubilization is one of the direct mechanisms (Rodr\u00edguez and Fraga 1999; Mayak et al. 2004; Shahzad et al. 2010) and production of antibiotics such as 2,4-diacetyl phloroglucinol (DAPG), phenazine, pyoluteorin and pyrrolnitrin against pathogenic fungi and bacteria is among indirect mechanisms of PGPR (Ramamoorthy et al. 2001; McSpadden Gardener B 2008). Apart from primary and secondary metabolite production, certain fluorescent Pseudomonads (especially P. putida) are suitable as whole-cell biocatalyzers for the production of several value-added industrial compounds such as biodegradable and biocompatible polyesters called polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) or polyhydroxybutyrates (PHB). It accumulates as discrete granules and is used as storage material for carbon and for reducing equivalents by P. putida. This property has been widely exploited for their targeted biosynthesis in this organism (Hoffmann and Rehm 2004). Different strains of P. putida such as P. putida KT2440, P. putida GPo1, P. putida S12, etc. have been investigated for its capacity to accumulate PHAs and PHBs from different carbon sources (Durner et al. 2001; Hartmann et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2007; Meijnen et al. 2008).

All the isolates of P. putida were positive for cytochrome oxidase. Isolates showed variability for traits such as gelatin liquefaction, casein hydrolysis, lipolytic activity, nitrate reduction and antibiotic sensitivity test. Of the 24 P. putida, 9 isolates (37.5\u00a0%) showed proteolytic activity (casein hydrolysis) by inducing clear zones around the cells on skim milk agar medium, 7 isolates (29.17\u00a0%) showed lipolytic activity, 14 isolates (58.33\u00a0%) were negative for nitrate test and 10 isolates (41.67) gave positive result for nitrate test (of which 6 isolates P23, P43, P59, P80, P144 and P174 were positive before addition of zinc and 4 isolates P187, P191, P192 and P207 showed positive response after addition of zinc). Only three isolates P56, P130 and P191 were positive for phenylalanine test as indicated by appearance of green color after addition of few drops of 10\u00a0% aq. ferric chloride to the cultures grown in phenyl alanine amended medium. Lecithinase production was observed as opaque precipitate around colonies of four P. putida isolates viz. P59, P80, P123 and P166 resulting in lecithin positive result in egg yolk medium. Blazevic et al. (1973) reported some diagnostic tests for differentiation of P. fluorescens and P. putida isolates. P. aeruginosa is the only fluorescent pseudomonads that can grow at 42\u00a0\u00b0C whereas P. fluorescens grow at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. In the present investigation none of the isolates showed growth at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 42\u00a0\u00b0C. A shortened gelatin test can differentiate P. fluorescens (positive) from P. putida (negative). Present result correlated with this fact except the isolates P2, P3, P45, P144, P192 and P207 which liquefies gelatin. P. fluorescens and P. putida are very sensitive to low levels of kanamycin and resistant to carbenicillin, a pattern just the opposite of that obtained with P. aeruginosa. All the isolates were resistant to antibiotic carbenicillin and sensitive to kanamycin. However, isolates P56 and P174 were tolerant to both the antibiotics (Table\u00a03). Several strains within the family Pseudomonadaceae such as P. putida S12 show significant intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics (Kieboom and de Bont 2001). Blazevic et al. (1973) further suggested that the shortened test for nitrate reduction, then, together with the marked sensitivity to kanamycin and resistance to carbenicillin would provide a rapid means of accurately identifying P. fluorescens and P. putida and separating them from P. aeruginosa.

All the isolates of P. putida were positive for cytochrome oxidase. Isolates showed variability for traits such as gelatin liquefaction, casein hydrolysis, lipolytic activity, nitrate reduction and antibiotic sensitivity test. Of the 24 P. putida, 9 isolates (37.5\u00a0%) showed proteolytic activity (casein hydrolysis) by inducing clear zones around the cells on skim milk agar medium, 7 isolates (29.17\u00a0%) showed lipolytic activity, 14 isolates (58.33\u00a0%) were negative for nitrate test and 10 isolates (41.67) gave positive result for nitrate test (of which 6 isolates P23, P43, P59, P80, P144 and P174 were positive before addition of zinc and 4 isolates P187, P191, P192 and P207 showed positive response after addition of zinc). Only three isolates P56, P130 and P191 were positive for phenylalanine test as indicated by appearance of green color after addition of few drops of 10\u00a0% aq. ferric chloride to the cultures grown in phenyl alanine amended medium. Lecithinase production was observed as opaque precipitate around colonies of four P. putida isolates viz. P59, P80, P123 and P166 resulting in lecithin positive result in egg yolk medium. Blazevic et al. (1973) reported some diagnostic tests for differentiation of P. fluorescens and P. putida isolates. P. aeruginosa is the only fluorescent pseudomonads that can grow at 42\u00a0\u00b0C whereas P. fluorescens grow at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. In the present investigation none of the isolates showed growth at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 42\u00a0\u00b0C. A shortened gelatin test can differentiate P. fluorescens (positive) from P. putida (negative). Present result correlated with this fact except the isolates P2, P3, P45, P144, P192 and P207 which liquefies gelatin. P. fluorescens and P. putida are very sensitive to low levels of kanamycin and resistant to carbenicillin, a pattern just the opposite of that obtained with P. aeruginosa. All the isolates were resistant to antibiotic carbenicillin and sensitive to kanamycin. However, isolates P56 and P174 were tolerant to both the antibiotics (Table\u00a03). Several strains within the family Pseudomonadaceae such as P. putida S12 show significant intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics (Kieboom and de Bont 2001). Blazevic et al. (1973) further suggested that the shortened test for nitrate reduction, then, together with the marked sensitivity to kanamycin and resistance to carbenicillin would provide a rapid means of accurately identifying P. fluorescens and P. putida and separating them from P. aeruginosa.

All the isolates of P. putida were positive for cytochrome oxidase. Isolates showed variability for traits such as gelatin liquefaction, casein hydrolysis, lipolytic activity, nitrate reduction and antibiotic sensitivity test. Of the 24 P. putida, 9 isolates (37.5\u00a0%) showed proteolytic activity (casein hydrolysis) by inducing clear zones around the cells on skim milk agar medium, 7 isolates (29.17\u00a0%) showed lipolytic activity, 14 isolates (58.33\u00a0%) were negative for nitrate test and 10 isolates (41.67) gave positive result for nitrate test (of which 6 isolates P23, P43, P59, P80, P144 and P174 were positive before addition of zinc and 4 isolates P187, P191, P192 and P207 showed positive response after addition of zinc). Only three isolates P56, P130 and P191 were positive for phenylalanine test as indicated by appearance of green color after addition of few drops of 10\u00a0% aq. ferric chloride to the cultures grown in phenyl alanine amended medium. Lecithinase production was observed as opaque precipitate around colonies of four P. putida isolates viz. P59, P80, P123 and P166 resulting in lecithin positive result in egg yolk medium. Blazevic et al. (1973) reported some diagnostic tests for differentiation of P. fluorescens and P. putida isolates. P. aeruginosa is the only fluorescent pseudomonads that can grow at 42\u00a0\u00b0C whereas P. fluorescens grow at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. In the present investigation none of the isolates showed growth at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 42\u00a0\u00b0C. A shortened gelatin test can differentiate P. fluorescens (positive) from P. putida (negative). Present result correlated with this fact except the isolates P2, P3, P45, P144, P192 and P207 which liquefies gelatin. P. fluorescens and P. putida are very sensitive to low levels of kanamycin and resistant to carbenicillin, a pattern just the opposite of that obtained with P. aeruginosa. All the isolates were resistant to antibiotic carbenicillin and sensitive to kanamycin. However, isolates P56 and P174 were tolerant to both the antibiotics (Table\u00a03). Several strains within the family Pseudomonadaceae such as P. putida S12 show significant intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics (Kieboom and de Bont 2001). Blazevic et al. (1973) further suggested that the shortened test for nitrate reduction, then, together with the marked sensitivity to kanamycin and resistance to carbenicillin would provide a rapid means of accurately identifying P. fluorescens and P. putida and separating them from P. aeruginosa.

utilized xylose, dextrose, galactose, melibiose, mannose, xylitol, esculin and citrate but exhibited varying degree of utilization towards other carbon sources such as fructose, trehalose, l-arabinose, arabitol and malonate. These isolates did not utilize lactose, maltose, raffinose, sucrose, inulin, sodium gluconate, glycerol, salicin, dulcitol, inositol, sorbitol, mannitol, adonitol, arabitol, erythritol, \u03b1-methyl-d-gluconate, rhamnose, cellobiose, melezitose, \u03b1-methyl-d-mannoside, ONPG, d-arabinose and sorbose. Isolate P56 did not utilize xylose, galactose, melibiose, mannose and xylitol which were utilized by all other 23 P. putida isolates (Table\u00a03). Numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics revealed polymorphism among P. putida isolates. All 24 P. putida isolates were grouped into 3 major phenons at 0.76 similarity coefficient level (Fig.\u00a01). The similarity coefficient range among 24 P. putida isolates was 0.39\u20131.00. Phenons 1, 2 and 3 consist a total of 17, 4 and 2 isolates, respectively. Isolate P56 did not fall into any of the phenogram and revealed all together distinct identity. Differential utilization of carbon sources by isolates of P. putida as identified by Hi-carbohydrate\u2122 kit test may play an important role in adapting to a variety of crop plants and soil types. Xylose being second to glucose in natural abundance is a promising candidate substrate for bacterial growth (Beall et al. 1991). Carbohydrates serve as primary substrate for the synthesis of many important metabolites and commercial products by microorganisms. Meur et al. (2012) reported that sequential feeding of relatively cheap carbohydrates such as xylose is a practical way to achieve more cost-effective medium-chain-length (mcl) PHA production. Reduction in cost can be achieved using two kinds of carbon sources, one for biomass production and the other for synthesis of PHA. Metabolite utilization diversity is also important because changes in their composition may affect the patterns and activities of rhizobacterial populations which are dependent upon rhizospheric nutrients for growth. Broad spectrum carbon source utilization among P. putida isolates in the present study may help in developing and designing stimulators for specific application.Fig.\u00a01Phenogram of 24 P. putida isolates based on their carbon source utilization profiles", "All the P. putida isolates utilized xylose, dextrose, galactose, melibiose, mannose, xylitol, esculin and citrate but exhibited varying degree of utilization towards other carbon sources such as fructose, trehalose, l-arabinose, arabitol and malonate.

Differential utilization of carbon sources by isolates of P. putida as identified by Hi-carbohydrate\u2122 kit test may play an important role in adapting to a variety of crop plants and soil types.

In an alkaline environment P. putida have been reported to produce medium-chain-length (R)-3-hydroxyalkanoates (Wang et al. 2007). In the present investigation all the 24 P. putida isolates gave positive result for PHB accumulation in Sudan Black B qualitatively screening test in glucose-supplemented nutrient agar medium. Madison and Huisman (1999) have also reported that these biopolymers are accumulated as inclusions (PHA granules) in the bacterial cytoplasm in response to inorganic nutrient limitations, generally, when the microbes are cultured in the presence of an excess carbon source. However, there was significant difference in quantitative analysis of all the isolates which ranged from 6.17 to 14.35\u00a0mg/ml. Variation was significant at both 0.01 and 0.05 levels. The lowest observed value was for isolate P130 and the highest was for isolate P2. Isolates P43, P56 and P187 also produced significantly higher amounts of PHB as compared to other isolates (Table\u00a04). Expenditures for large-scale production of PHA are almost evenly divided among carbon source, fermentation process and separation process (Sun et al. 2007; Elbahloul and Steinb\u00fcchel 2009).

Our work reports that all the 24 putida isolates utilized relatively cheaper carbohydrates such as xylose, dextrose, galactose, melibiose and mannose.

There is variability among isolates for PHB production and release of inorganic phosphate which can be further exploited to select potential isolate for industrial, biocontrol and plant growth promoting applications. All the isolates (except P56) were amplified with polyhydroxyalkanoate gene-specific primer PhaJ but the variability in PHB production may be because of the fact that synthesis of PHB is pathway-dependent and environment-dependent. Also it is a multi-gene-dependent process which necessitates requirement for more number of primers for screening.
