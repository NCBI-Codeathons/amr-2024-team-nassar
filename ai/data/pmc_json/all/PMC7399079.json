We have interrogated extracts from fungal fermentations to find Cryptococcus-inhibiting natural products using assays for growth inhibition, differential thermosensitivity, and synergy with existing antifungal drugs. Extracts from fermentations of strains of Discosia rubi from eastern Texas showed anticryptococcal bioactivity with preferential activity in agar zone of inhibition assays against C. neoformans at 37\u00b0C versus 25\u00b0C. Assay-guided fractionation led to the purification and identification of chaetoglobosin P as the active component of these extracts. Genome sequencing of these strains revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with chaetoglobosin biosynthesis and \u03b2-methylation of the tryptophan residue. Proximity of genes of the actin-binding protein twinfilin-1 to the chaetoglobosin P and K gene clusters suggested a possible self-resistance mechanism involving twinfilin-1 which is consistent with the predicted mechanism of action involving interference with the polymerization of the capping process of filamentous actin. A C. neoformans mutant lacking twinfilin-1 was hypersensitive to chaetoglobosin P. Chaetoglobosins also potentiated the effects of amphotericin B and caspofungin on C. neoformans.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Cryptococcus species are among the most common causes of invasive fungal infections globally. There are an estimated 220,000 cases cryptococcosis annually and with mortality rates for patients with cryptococcal meningitis ranging from 10 to 70% (Rajasingham et al., 2017; Benedict et al., 2018). Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii most often cause disease in people with compromised immune function. As many as a third of all HIV/AIDS-associated deaths are due to cryptococcal disease, exceeding the number due to tuberculosis. Current treatments are limited to few antifungal agents (amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole), with no new therapies introduced in the past few decades. These options remain unsatisfactory because of their toxicity, inability to reliably eradicate the fungal pathogen, and the emergence of drug resistance (Brown et al., 2012; Perfect, 2017). Even when treated, cryptococcosis is further complicated by high recurrence rates and the need for long-term suppressive therapy. Furthermore, the few antifungal agents currently in clinical development have not been chosen based on effectiveness against Cryptococcus (Perfect, 2017; Van Daele et al., 2019). We hypothesize that a Cryptococcus-centric screening approach can result in identification of metabolites not generally detected in the well-worn Candida albicans-centric antifungal discovery paradigm (Xu et al., 2018). Therefore, new agents displaying anti-cryptococcal activity with minimal mammalian toxicity would be high priority objectives.", "Cryptococcus species are among the most common causes of invasive fungal infections globally.

The characteristic feature of cytochalasins is a substituted isoindole scaffold fused with a macrocyclic ring derived from a highly reduced polyketide backbone and an amino acid. Chaetoglobosins are biosynthesized from the amino acid tryptophan that is the source of the 10-(indol-3-yl) group fused to a non-aketide. Although biological effects of chaetoglobosins range widely, they are best known as microfilament-targeting molecules, and consequently they interfere with various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, intracellular motility, and exo- and endocytosis (Scherlach et al., 2010; Trendowski, 2014; Chen et al., 2020).

Cultures on malt-yeast extract and oatmeal-wheatgerm agar grew as light to dark gray to olive-gray wooly colonies (Supplementary Figures S1A\u2013C). The mycelia eventually formed patches of black stromatic tissue after one to two weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A\u2013E). Black sporodochial conidiomata formed on some of these stromata after 4\u20135 weeks. The internal surfaces of the conidiomata were lined with a dense layer of cylindrical conidiogenous cells. The conidia arise by holoblastic conidiogenesis, and conidia succeed from the conidiogenous locus by fission of a double septum. The conidia were thin-walled, colorless, 15\u201321 \u00d7 2\u20135 \u03bcm, mostly 3-septate, with a truncate basal scar, and with two or one subapical filiform setulae up 12 \u03bcm long arising from the concave side of the conidia (Supplementary Figures S1E,H). Their morphological features were typical of fungi of the genus Discosia (Sutton, 1980; Nag Raj, 1993).

The identity of the ITS region of these strains with the type strain of D. rubi was 99.8% (100% coverage). The sequences of the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2), the translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (tef-1\u03b1), and \u03b2-tubulin (tub2) genes from the type strain of D. rubi showed 100, 100, and 99.3% identity, respectively, to the corresponding genes from genome sequences of TTI-0863 and TTI-0885. Furthermore, cultural characteristics, conidiogenesis, and conidial morphology were very similar to that described for D. rubi (Liu F. et al., 2019; Supplementary Figures S1F\u2013H). Thus, we concluded that TTI-0863 and TTI-0885 were conspecific with D. rubi. However, we should qualify this identification by noting that nearly 100 species have been described in the genus Discosia (Sutton, 1980; Nag Raj, 1993).

Similarly, we hypothesized that twf1 deletion mutants would lack an intact actin capping complex and be hypersusceptible to the effects of chaetoglobosins. Consistent with this hypothesis, a C. neoformans strain with a loss of function mutation in the predicted twf1 gene (CNAG_03864) displayed a strikingly reduced MIC at 37\u00b0C for chaetoglobosin P (<0.39 \u03bcg/mL, compared to 6.25 \u03bcg/mL for wild-type parent).
