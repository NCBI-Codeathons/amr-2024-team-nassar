["The interrogation of single cells has revolutionised biology and medicine by providing crucial unparalleled insights into cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Flow cytometry (including fluorescence-activated cell sorting) is one of the most versatile and high-throughput approaches for single-cell analysis by detecting multiple fluorescence parameters of individual cells in aqueous suspension as they flow past through a focus of excitation lasers. However, this approach relies on the expression of cell surface and intracellular biomarkers, which inevitably lacks spatial and temporal phenotypes and activities of cells, such as secreted proteins, extracellular metabolite production, and proliferation. Droplet microfluidics has recently emerged as a powerful tool for the encapsulation and manipulation of thousands to millions of individual cells within pico-litre microdroplets. Integrating flow cytometry with microdroplet architectures surrounded by aqueous solutions (e.g., water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsion and hydrogel droplets) opens avenues for new cellular assays linking cell phenotypes to genotypes at the single-cell level. In this review, we discuss the capabilities and applications of droplet flow cytometry (DFC). This unique technique uses standard commercially available flow cytometry instruments to characterise or select individual microdroplets containing single cells of interest. We explore current challenges associated with DFC and present our visions for future development.", "This work reviews recent advances in the integration of emulsion microdroplets and flow cytometry technologies, so-called droplet flow cytometry (DFC), for high-throughput single-cell analysis.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Single-cell analysis plays an essential role in revealing the differences of individual cells in structure and function.1,2 The adaption of single-cell techniques has highlighted critical cell-to-cell heterogeneity, identified rare sub-populations of functional importance and discovered unique characteristics of individual cells.3,4 Flow cytometry (FC) has been widely used as a versatile and powerful technique to interrogate single cells, offering automated, quantitative, high-throughput and multi-parameter characterisation of cell phenotypes and activities.5,6 In this technique, individual cells suspended in a fluid flow are directed to pass through a laser beam one by one and then measured based on the resulting scatter or emission of light energy from fluorescence molecules.
