["Antibiotic resistance poses a tremendous threat to human health. To overcome this problem, it is essential to know the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in antibiotic-producing and pathogenic bacteria. This paper deals with this problem from four points of view. First, the antibiotic resistance genes in producers are discussed related to their biosynthesis. Most resistance genes are present within the biosynthetic gene clusters, but some genes such as paromomycin acetyltransferases are located far outside the gene cluster. Second, when the antibiotic resistance genes in pathogens are compared with those in the producers, resistance mechanisms have dependency on antibiotic classes, and, in addition, new types of resistance mechanisms such as Eis aminoglycoside acetyltransferase and self-sacrifice proteins in enediyne antibiotics emerge in pathogens. Third, the relationships of the resistance genes between producers and pathogens are reevaluated at their amino acid sequence as well as nucleotide sequence levels. Pathogenic bacteria possess other resistance mechanisms than those in antibiotic producers. In addition, resistance mechanisms are little different between early stage of antibiotic use and the present time, e.g., \u03b2-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Lastly, guanine + cytosine (GC) barrier in gene transfer to pathogenic bacteria is considered. Now, the resistance genes constitute resistome composed of complicated mixture from divergent environments.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The introduction of antibiotics once reduced human morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases dramatically. For example, human morbidity and mortality by tuberculosis were greatly reduced after the introduction of streptomycin and kanamycin. However, the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria reverted the situation drastically once again. Moreover, the situation of multidrug resistance is getting worse and worse. WHO calls attention to the infections especially by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and blood poisoning and foodborne diseases, where these infections are becoming harder and sometimes impossible to treat [1]. Antibiotic resistance is mainly due to efflux of antibiotics by transporters, prevention of interaction of antibiotics with target by mutation, modification and protection of target, and modification of antibiotics. These mechanisms result from the inherent structural or functional resistant characteristics, the acquired resistance by mutational change or horizontal gene transfer, and the adaptive antibiotic resistance [2,3,4]. The fact that even before the rediscovery of penicillin resistant bacteria were reported suggests strongly that at least some resistance traits were intrinsically present in their genomes [5,6]. Together with the natural conception that antibiotic-producers should possess the self-resistance mechanisms for the prevention of their suicide, it was hypothesized that the genes for antibiotic modifying enzymes evolved in the antibiotic-producing bacteria and were transferred to pathogenic bacteria through transformation, transduction or conjugation [7,8,9]. This hypothesis has been accepted without dispute until recently [10]. However, the long-time misuse and overuse of antibiotics have resulted in the widespread dissemination of antibiotics as well as antibiotic resistance genes all over the environment, not only in sewage and wastewater treatment plants, hospital effluents, aquaculture, agricultural and slaughterhouse waste, but also in surface waters, soils, and so on. Consequently, multidrug resistance traits have migrated reciprocally among the various bacteria residing in these environments [11,12,13,14]. This review paper summarizes first the antibiotic resistance genes in producing bacteria from the point of view of antibiotic biosynthesis. Then the resistance genes in pathogenic bacteria are compared with those in the producers.

Aminoglycosides", "On the basis of the mechanism of action, antibiotics can be classified into six categories: protein synthesis inhibitors, cell wall synthesis inhibitors, DNA synthesis inhibitors, DNA intercalators, RNA synthesis inhibitors, and others. Protein synthesis is one of the major targets for antibiotics in the cell, and can be divided into four distinct phases: initiation, elongation, termination and recycling [15,16,17]. Aminoglycoside antibiotics belong to the protein synthesis inhibitors, and are grouped into 4,6-disubstitued 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS)-containing (kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, and others), 4,5-disubstitued DOS-containing (neomycin, paromomycin, lividomycin, and others), 4-monosubstitued DOS-containing (apramycin) aminoglycosides, and others (streptomycin, spectinomycin, hygromycin B, kasugamycin, and others). These aminoglycosides exert their antimicrobial action by binding primarily to helix 44 of 16S rRNA of the small subunit of bacterial ribosome in the decoding region (A-site) and secondarily to helix 69 of 23S rRNA of the large subunit, leading to the induction of translational misreading and inhibition of the translocation reaction [18,19,20]. In addition, streptomycin, one of the atypical aminoglycosides, interacts with the backbone phosphates and ribose hydroxyl groups. One characteristic of aminoglycoside antibiotics is that they are considered as a bactericidal class of antibiotics [18,21], in contrast to the fact that most antibiotics that target the ribosome such as macrolides, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic [22,23,24].

The antimicrobial activities of these 4,6- and 4,5-disubstituted and monosubstituted DOS-containing aminoglycosides are compromised by methylation of G1405 or A1408 in helix 44 of 16S rRNA [51].", "Streptomycin is the first antibiotic isolated from Actinobacteria and the first aminoglycoside antibiotic [52]. Different from the aminoglycosides described above, streptomycin binds to the four nucleotides of 16S rRNA (Nos. 13, 526, 915, and 1490) and lysine45 of protein S12, and thereby its antibacterial activity is not affected by the methylation of G1405 and A1408 [53]. The biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned as 90kb DNA fragment [54,55] (GB No. AJ862840). It contains three putative phosphotransferase genes (strA/aphD/SGR_5932, strK/SGR_5938, and aphE/SGR_249) and two ABC-type transporter genes (strV/SGR_5915 and strW/SGR_5916) located adjacent to the cluster. In addition, one putative aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (SGR_292) and four RNA methyl-transferases are detected (SGR_1654, SGR_1886, SGR_4020, and SGR_6774). Not all but at least some of these proteins are implicated in the self-resistance in the producer [56] (GB No. NC_010572). The biosynthetic gene cluster of an aminocyclitol aminoglycoside antibiotic spectinomycin was cloned from S. spectabilis and other Streptomyces species [57,58] (GB No. EU255259). An aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, SpcN and an RNA methyltransferase, SpcM, were proposed to be involved in the self-resistance [57,58]. Hygromycin B is an aminocyclitol antibiotic that binds to discrete sites on the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis [59]. The biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned from S. hygroscopicus [60,61] (GB No. AJ628642). The self-resistance-related proteins, HygA (phosphotransferase) and transporters (HygV and HygW), are detected within the cluster. Hygromycin A, structurally distinct from hygromycin B, is an antibiotic isolated from S. hygroscopicus and inhibits the peptidyltransferase reaction of protein synthesis. The biosynthetic gene cluster of 31.5kb DNA fragment was cloned [62]. Hyg21, a phosphotransferase, and Hyg19 and Hyg28, transporters, were proposed to be involved in the self-resistance [62,63]. Istamycin produced by S. tenjimariensis is an aminoglycoside antibiotic composed of two units. FmrT consisting of 211 amino acid residues was proposed to be the rRNA methyltransferase involved in the self-resistance [64]. Three transporter genes (steF24.1, steF24.27c, and steO22.6) were speculated within the cluster. Istamycin is also acetylated by kasugamycin-producing S. kasugaensis [65]. However, the relation of the acetylation to the self-resistance in the istamycin-producer has not been clarified. Kasugamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic mainly used for the prevention of the growth of a fungus causing rice blast disease, and specifically inhibits translation initiation [66]. Acetyltransferase activity was reported to be involved in the self-resistance in kasugamycin-producing S. kasugaensis [65]. In addition, the ABC transporter genes, kasKLM, are responsible for the self-resistance [67]. Fortimicin (astromicin) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Micromonospora olivasterospora. The biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned (GB No. AJ628421) and, fmrO encoding 16S rRNA methyltransferase (GB No. CAF31555) was assumed to play a role in the self-resistance [68]. Validamycin is a fungicidal aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by S. hygroscopicus var. limoneus. It is used as an inhibitor of trehalase. The biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned [69] (GB No. DQ223652). A putative transporter (VldJ) is present within the cluster. A derivative of aminoglycoside, acarbose was isolated from Streptomyces diastaticus as an amylase inhibitor [70]. It is now widely used for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [71]. However, nothing has been reported on its antimicrobial activity. The biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned [72] (GB No. AM409314). Acarbose kinase, GacK, and three transporters, GacX, GacY, and Gac W, are present within the cluster. GacK was reported to be implicated in the intracellular inactivation of acarbose [72]. Acarbose is conceived to have a dual role for the producer, that is, that it inhibits \u03b1-glucosidic enzymes of competitors and functions as a carbophor for the uptake of glucose or starch molecules in the producer. Although the streptothricin class antibiotics, streptothricin and nourseothricin, show a broad antimicrobial activity, their characteristic delayed toxicity interrupts their clinical application. The cloned biosynthetic gene cluster comprises genes for an acetyltransferase (orfE) and two transporters (orfW and orfX). These proteins are supposed to be involved in the self-resistance [73,74,75] (GB Nos. AB684619 and AB684620).

In contrast, that in pathogenic bacteria not only affects their own existence, but also affords threatening effects on human and livestock. The resistance mechanism of pathogenic bacteria to aminoglycoside antibiotics includes aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, the mutation and the modification of the ribosomal target, and efflux pumps [78,79]. However, the most widely disseminated means of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics is the inactivation by their modifying enzymes. Among the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, acetyltransferases, phosphotransferases and nucleotidyltransferases especially adenylyl transferases are clinically important, resistance-related enzymes. Aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases (AACs) are divided into four major groups based on the position of acetylation: AAC(1), AAC(2\u2032), AAC(3), and AAC(6\u2032) [26,80]. Another novel type of aminoglycoside modifying enzyme, the enhanced intracellular survival (Eis) protein, was identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [81]. Unlike other AACs, Eis and its homologues acetylate multiple amino groups of aminoglycosides and are distributed in Mycobacterium and other Actinobacteria [82]. Moreover, Eis proteins are composed of more than 400 amino acid residues and, their amino acid sequences and the crystal structures are completely different from those of other AACs [83]. It is hypothesized that the antibiotic modifying enzymes in pathogenic bacteria were evolved from those in antibiotic-producing bacteria [7,8,9]. Here this hypothesis is re-evaluated from the point of amino acid sequence similarities of AACs, revealing that it is not necessarily true (Table S2 and Figure S1). The amino acid sequences of AAC(3)s in pathogenic bacteria such as AAC(3)-IIa (GB Nos. are in the parentheses; CAA31895), AAC(3)-IIIb (AAA25682), AAC(3)-IVa (CAA25642), AAC(3)-IIb (AAA26548), AAC(3)-IIc (CAA38525), AAC(3)-IIIa (CAA39184), AAC(3)-IIIc (AAA25683), and AAC(3)-VIa (AAA16194) are closely similar to those of aminoglycoside-producers (AAA88552, AAA26685, AAA25334, and BAA78619). For example, E values between AAA88552 (type VII AAC(3) from S. rimosus subsp. paromomycinus, a paromomycin-producer) and CAA31895, AAA25682, CAA25642, AAA26548, CAA38525, CAA39184, AAA25683, and AAA16194 are 2.9e-31, 1.4e-31, 1.8e-09, 1.2e-26, 1.1e-34, 1.3e-36, 6.8e-32, and 3.8e-24, respectively (Table S2 and Figure S1A). However, the nucleotide sequence similarities (E values) between sequence of an aminoglycoside producer (AAA88552) and those of pathogenic bacteria (CAA31895 and AAA25682) are 11 and 0.42 (identities are 56.0% and 57.4%, and similarities are 66.1% and 66.9%), respectively, reflecting the different guanine+cytosine contents of these bacteria.

Instead, AAC(3)-Ia (AAO49599) shows a slight similarity to glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferases from Aspergillus fumigatus (2VEZ-A, E = 5.4e-02) and Trypanosoma brucei (3I3G-B, E = 2.0e-02) (Table S2); AAC(3)-Ib (AAA88422) shows a slight similarity to ribosomal protein S18-alanine N-acetyltransferase of E. coli (NP_418790, E value = 0.039), and N-\u03b1-acetyltransferase 20 isoform a of H. sapiens (NP_057184, E value = 0.098); and AAC(3)-Ic (CAD53575) shows a slightly similarity to acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase (NAT) superfamily protein of Arabidopsis thaliana (NP_001190321, E value = 2e-05), and N-acetyltransferase 8 of Mus musculus (NP_075944, E value = 0.010), suggesting that AAC(3)s in the pathogenic bacteria are evolutionally related not only to acetyltransferases of aminoglycoside-producing bacteria but also to other types of acetyltransferases of bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Even between AAA88552 (AAC3 of a paromomycin-producer) and CAA31895 (AAC3 of plasmid pWP113a), similarity value E is 7.1 at their nucleotide sequence level instead of 2.9e-31 at their amino acid sequence level. As described above, the paromomycin-producer S. rimosus possesses two aminoglycoside acetyltransferase genes located far outside the biosynthetic gene cluster. One of them AAA88552/CAG44462 is AAC (3) and the amino acid sequence is very similar to other AAC enzymes from aminoglycoside producers, indicating that the amino acid sequence is not influenced by the location (Figure S1A).", "AAC(6)s in pathogenic bacteria form three clusters (B, D and E in Figure S1) in the phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of their amino acid sequence homology.

Furthermore, amino acid sequences in cluster B show relatively high homology to aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferase AAC(6\u2032)-Ii from various species of Enterococcus; those in cluster D exhibit relatively high homology to acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (NP_201544, E value = 0.003), diamine acetyltransferase 2 isoform 3 from H. sapiens (NP_597998, E value = 3e-04), and GNAT family N-acetyltransferase from Microcystis aeruginosa (WP_012265151, E value = 2e-04); and those in cluster E exhibit relatively high homology to those of acyl-CoA N-acetyltransferase from Clostridioides difficile (YP_001087683, E value = 0.018), spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase from B. subtilis (NP_390537, E value = 0.006), and lysine N-acetyltransferase from M. tuberculosis (YP_009358719, E value = 1e-06); suggesting again that the aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, AAC(6)s, in the pathogenic bacteria are evolutionally related not only to acetyltransferases of aminoglycoside-producing bacteria but also to other types of acetyltransferases of bacteria, plants and mammals. In other words, pathogenic bacteria had evolved the resistance genes from their divergent original proto-resistance genes and/or resistance-related and resistance-unrelated genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer [84,85]. The arrangement of the genes near AAC(3)-IId in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA34 (WP_000557454) is completely different from that (CAH58703) in S. fradiae, a neomycin-producer (Figure S2A,B). However, the identity (E value) of the amino acid sequences between WP_000557454 and CAH58703 is 3.1e-31, suggesting that these two are highly similar at their amino acid sequence level (Figure S1 and Table S2), although these two species are completely different in taxonomical classification. On the other hand, acetyltransferases from Actinobacterial species are divided into four groups: aminoglycoside 3-acetyltransferases, streptothricin-acetyltransferases, aminoglycoside 6-acetyltransferases, and Eis proteins.

Before achievement of such level of resistance, bacterial cells use efflux pumps or efflux transporters as the first line of defense against antibiotics. The antibiotic transporters are divided into five families: the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family, the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family and the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family [90,91]. These transporters function as a network, that is, more than one transporters are involved in the exclusion of one xenobiotic such as antibiotics and pollutants [92,93]. Therefore, the antibiotic efflux transporters are only a part of an overall detoxifying system consisting of a large range of coordinated membrane proteins. This is reflected in the diversity of the transporters implicated in the aminoglycoside self-resistance. Figure S5 shows a phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of the amino acid sequences of the transporters implicated in the aminoglycoside self-resistance (Table S1). The tree is divided into four clusters: cluster A, cluster B, cluster C, and cluster D. The cluster C is further divided into four sub-clusters: C1, C2, C3, and C4.

Mutations at G2057 and C2611, sometimes in combination with A2058 or A2059, have been detected in Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus. In addition, mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins L4 and L22, which contact macrolides in the ribosome-macrolide complexes [148], confer resistance to macrolides in various pathogenic bacteria [149]. This type of mutations includes not only amino acid exchange, but also deletion and insertion.

Because most bacteria have multiple rRNA copies, mutations in rRNA conferring tetracycline resistance are usually found in bacteria with low rRNA copy numbers, such as Propionibacterium acnes, Helicobacter pylori, Mycoplasma bovis, and S. pneumoniae. For example, S. pneumoniae with mutations C1054T and T1062G/A in 16S RNA is resistant to tigecycline when four genomic copies of 16S rRNA are mutated. Mutations in the rpsJ encoding the 30S ribosomal subunit protein S10 are also reported to confer resistance to tetracyclines in S. pneumoniae [168]. Mutations in rpsJ are described in various clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the same authors described nonsense mutations in spr1784 encoding a 16S rRNA methyltransferase resulting in tetracycline resistance in S. pneumoniae [168]. Tetracycline ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs) are GTPases with significant sequence and structural similarity to elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu. They are found both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most common RPPs are TetO and TetM. The sequence similarity values between OtrA from tetracycline producer S. rimosus (GB No.ALS03934) and TetM from E. faecalis (GB No.CAA63530), and TetO from Campylobacter jejuni (AAA23033) are 5e-79 and 2.2e-80 at the amino acid sequence level, and 2.1e-38 and 3.7e-47 at the nucleotide sequence level, respectively, indicating that these proteins are closely related each other. It is assumed that RPPs like TetM and TetO have originated in the tetracycline producers. The most common tetracycline-specific efflux pumps are members of the major facilitator superfamily transporters. They are classified in seven groups. The group 1 pumps such as TetA and TetB possess 12 transmembrane segments and distribute mostly in Gram-negative bacteria. The group 2 pumps like TetK and TetL contain 14 transmembrane segments and are present mostly in Gram-positive bacteria [91]. The amino acids of TetK and TetL from Gram-positive bacteria have some sequence similarity to those of OtrB, CtcR, and Ctc2 from tetracycline producers, showing that the similarity values Es are in the range of 1e-05 to 1e-09.

They are classified into five groups according to their chemical structures: penicillins, cephalosporins/cephamycins, clavulanic acid, thienamycin, nocardicin A and sulfazecin. Penicillin was isolated in 1929 as the first antibiotic by Fleming [188], and rediscovered in 1940 by Chain et al. [189] and in 1941 by Abraham et al. [190]. Penicillins and cephalosporins/cephamycins are produced by bacteria as well as fungi, whereas other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are produced by bacteria [191,192,193].

Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of a various kind of \u03b2-lactamases from pathogenic bacteria with antibacterial activity and was isolated from S. clavuligerus [204,205].

E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria show intrinsic resistance to vancomycin which results from the permeability barrier imposed by the outer membrane as described above [257].", "On the contrary, in the pathogenic bacteria the first VRE were reported in 1988 [254], and now they are ubiquitously distributed in hospitals as well as in the environment throughout the world. The major resistance mechanism is due to two causes: the first is the substitution of the target d-Ala-d-Ala residues in the peptidoglycan by low affinity termini (d-Ala-d-Lac or d-Ala-d-Ser) and the second is the removal of d-Ala-d-Ala precursors [255]. Ten types of glycopeptide resistance determinants have been reported. Among them, VanA and VanB genotypes predominate worldwide. The VanA type resistance element was originally detected on a plasmid in an E. faecium clinical isolate, and its prevalence has occurred not only in enterococci but also in MRSA, resulting in almost no therapeutic avenues to treat these pathogenic bacteria now. The second type of resistance is mediated by the cooperative function of VanX and VanY which is located adjacent to vanHAX gene cluster. However, this type of resistance is rare comparing to VanA and VanB types. It is interesting that the resistance gene organization in enterococci is very similar to that in the glycopeptide producers [256] and, in addition, the amino acid sequences of these proteins in enterococci are extremely similar to those in glycopeptide producers and the related Actinobacteria.

Lantibiotics and Cyclic Peptides", "3.4. Lantibiotics and Cyclic Peptides", "3.4. Lantibiotics and Cyclic Peptides", "Lantibiotics are members of bacteriocins and belong to a group of ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified peptides containing unusual amino acids including the thioether amino acids such as lanthionine. They are produced by certain Gram-positive bacteria, and in general have a desirable feature of low likelihood of promoting the development of bacterial resistance and low cytotoxicity at antimicrobial concentration [290,291,292]. The first lantibiotic, nisin, was discovered in the 1920s and has been used as a food preservative for several decades. Lantibiotics are classified into type A and type B peptides based on their chemical structures and functional properties. Type A lantibiotics are elongated, cationic peptides up to 34 residues in length, whereas type B lantibiotics are globular peptides up to 19 residues in length. Type A lantibiotic nisin binds to and forms a complex with lipid II, a precursor of cell wall peptidoglycan, resulting in the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. Moreover, nisin increases the membrane permeability to lead to the pore formation and the release of ions and small molecules from the target bacteria [293]. Nisin is shown to have antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and some Gram-negative pathogens. In addition, nisin is suggested to influence multisets of host immune cells [294]. Type A lantibiotics such as nisin, subtilin, and sublancin, also inhibit the germination of spores from Bacillus and Clostridium species. Type B lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by forming a complex with lipid II but does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane [295]. The biosynthetic gene cluster for nisin was cloned [296] (GB No.HM219853). The eleven genes required for nisin biosynthesis are located in the gene cluster on Tn7276. nisFEG located at the end of the cluster encode putative transporter proteins and nisI within the cluster encodes a nisin-binding lipoprotein that is involved in immunity. The gene cluster for type AI lantibiotic subtilin was cloned from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii ATCC 6633 [297]. Compared to nisin, the subtilin gene cluster lacks the gene corresponding to nisP, which codes for an extracellular subtilisin-like protease involved in precursor processing. Four genes spaIFEG located within the cluster are implicated in the immunity. spaT encoding a transporter is also within the cluster. Type AI lantibiotic microbisporicin produced by actinomycetes Microbispora corallina contains chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroproline residues. It shows antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, and inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis by binding to lipid II, and some activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, Moraxella catarrhalis, and H. influenza, although the exact mechanism remains to be clarified. The biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and characterized [298] (GB No.HM536998). Four transporter/immunity genes (mibT, mibU, mibE, mibF) are identified within the cluster. Type AII lantibiotic lacticin 481 forms a complex with lipid II and inhibits PBP1b-catalyzed peptidoglycan biosynthesis [299]. The biosynthetic gene cluster for lacticin 481 was cloned and characterized [300]. Four genes lctTFEG within the cluster are involved in drug transporter or immunity. Among them, at least three genes lctFEG are necessary to provide immunity to lacticin 481. The gene corresponding to nisI is missing in the cluster. The type AII bacteriocin sublancin 168 differs from other lantibiotics of this group due to the presence of two disulfide linkages [301]. The mechanism of action of sublancin is also different from other lantibiotics, that is, that sublancin negatively affects DNA replication, transcription and translation without affecting cell wall biosynthesis [302]. The gene cluster was cloned from B. subtilis 168 [301]. The ABC transporter gene (sunT) and immunity protein gene (sunI) are located within the cluster. The phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system is involved in the sensitivity to the glucosylated sublancin [303]. Cinnamycin isolated from S. cinnamoneus belongs to the type B lantibiotics, and binds to phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner layer of the plasma membrane, inducing membrane reorganization such as membrane fusion and the alteration of morphology of the membrane [304]. The gene cluster was cloned and characterized [305]. Two component transporter genes cinT and cinH are located in the middle of the cluster.

They are produced by certain Gram-positive bacteria, and in general have a desirable feature of low likelihood of promoting the development of bacterial resistance and low cytotoxicity at antimicrobial concentration [290,291,292]. The first lantibiotic, nisin, was discovered in the 1920s and has been used as a food preservative for several decades. Lantibiotics are classified into type A and type B peptides based on their chemical structures and functional properties. Type A lantibiotics are elongated, cationic peptides up to 34 residues in length, whereas type B lantibiotics are globular peptides up to 19 residues in length. Type A lantibiotic nisin binds to and forms a complex with lipid II, a precursor of cell wall peptidoglycan, resulting in the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. Moreover, nisin increases the membrane permeability to lead to the pore formation and the release of ions and small molecules from the target bacteria [293]. Nisin is shown to have antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and some Gram-negative pathogens. In addition, nisin is suggested to influence multisets of host immune cells [294]. Type A lantibiotics such as nisin, subtilin, and sublancin, also inhibit the germination of spores from Bacillus and Clostridium species.

The eleven genes required for nisin biosynthesis are located in the gene cluster on Tn7276. nisFEG located at the end of the cluster encode putative transporter proteins and nisI within the cluster encodes a nisin-binding lipoprotein that is involved in immunity. The gene cluster for type AI lantibiotic subtilin was cloned from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii ATCC 6633 [297]. Compared to nisin, the subtilin gene cluster lacks the gene corresponding to nisP, which codes for an extracellular subtilisin-like protease involved in precursor processing. Four genes spaIFEG located within the cluster are implicated in the immunity. spaT encoding a transporter is also within the cluster. Type AI lantibiotic microbisporicin produced by actinomycetes Microbispora corallina contains chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroproline residues.

Among them, at least three genes lctFEG are necessary to provide immunity to lacticin 481. The gene corresponding to nisI is missing in the cluster. The type AII bacteriocin sublancin 168 differs from other lantibiotics of this group due to the presence of two disulfide linkages [301]. The mechanism of action of sublancin is also different from other lantibiotics, that is, that sublancin negatively affects DNA replication, transcription and translation without affecting cell wall biosynthesis [302].

However, human pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae confer inherent resistance against lantibiotics such as nisin.

Tallysomycin and zorbamycin are members of bleomycin family antitumor antibiotics. Their biosynthetic gene clusters were cloned from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus and S. flavoviridis, respectively [340,341]. The gene cluster for tallysomycin contains one each of the genes for ABC transporter (tlmT), the tallysomycin-binding protein (tlmA) and an N-acetyltransferase (tlmB), whereas that for zorbamycin contains three genes for ABC transporters (orf36, orf37 and orf38) and the zorbamycin-binding protein (zbmA) within the clusters but lacks the zorbamycin acetyltransferase gene. Interestingly, BlmB and TlmB acetylate the metal-free forms of four bleomycin family members, that is, bleomycin, phleomycin, tallysomycin and zorbamycin, and BlmB can provide resistance to zorbamycin in S. flavoviridis, a zorbamycin-producer [342]. Bleomycin can be metabolically inactivated in normal and tumor cells by bleomycin hydolases. These hydrolases are widely distributed in mammals, yeast, and bacteria [343]. DNA strand breaks caused by oxidative damage can be repaired by polynucleotide kinase 3\u2032-phosphatase, the pnkp gene product [344].

However, no resistance-related gene is detectable. Interestingly, S. griseus NBRS13350 has two genes encoding tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases (SGR_2702 and SGR_3809). Among them, the SGR_3809 gene encodes an indolmycin-resistant enzyme. Moreover, a cDNA 93% identical in sequence to SGR_3809 was detected in S. griseus ATCC12648, the indolmycin producer, indicating that an auxiliary tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase has a role in the self-resistance [386].", "Rebeccamycin and staurosporine are the indolocarbazole type antibiotics produced by Actinobacteria. Rebeccamycin, a halogen-containing natural product, shows antibacterial and antitumor activities. It inhibits DNA topoisomerase I, suppresses myosin light chain kinase production and induces claudin-5 expression [379]. The biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned from Saccharothrix (Lechevalieria) aerocolonigenes [380,381]. RebT and RebU were reported to be involved in the self-resistance/secretion. The indolocarbazole staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of a variety of protein kinases such as protein kinase C and cyclin-dependent protein kinase. It induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and activation of caspase-3. The biosynthetic gene clusters were cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 [382] and S. clavuligerus ATCC27064. No gene related to the resistance/transporter has been detectable within and adjacent to the gene cluster in both Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 and S. clavuligerus ATCC27064.

The fact that no gene related to the self-resistance is detectable in these species suggests that these genes were deleted or missing at the beginning from the genome due to the unnecessity for their existence because of the lack of antimicrobial activity.

Adaptive resistance can emerge as a result of concentration gradient and contact with sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics [4]. Among three mechanisms, antibiotic resistances acquired by horizontal gene transfer poses a major threat to human and livestock [478,479]. To establish the successful transfer from donor bacteria to recipient bacteria, that reside in various environments, by transformation, transduction or conjugation [7,8,9], it is necessary to overcome the barrier of GC-content between bacterial species [480,481,482,483,484]. These authors described that a large excess of synonymous GC\u2192AT mutation over AT\u2192GC mutations arises across a broad range of phylogenetically diverse species, that in a wide variety of bacterial species, the evolution of GC-content by recombination tends to increase the probability of fixation of AT\u2192GC mutations, and homologous recombination via GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a crucial factor universally influencing the nucleotide content of genes and genomes, and that genes capable of conferring antibiotic resistance are not easily transferred to human pathogens, especially if selection is absent. That is that the GC-content of the genome is a result of complex shuffling of various DNA fragments by mutation, recombination and selection. As a result of these phenomena, GC-contents in the genomes distribute broardly from 16.5% of Carsonella ruddii to 74.9% of Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans in bacterial species [485,486]. However, recent analyses of gene transfer to E. coli using 200 genes in human pathogens varying widely in resistance mechanisms, targeted antibiotic classes, and phylogenetic dissemination revealed that sequence composition such as codon adaptation index (CAI), GC-content, N-terminal mRNA-folding energy, and gene length is not a major functional barrier, but resistance mechanism and phylogenetic origin are more important determinants deciding the functional compatibility and fitness of the antibiotic resistance genes in the recipient bacteria [147]. Furthermore, phylogenetic relatedness of the donor and the recipient species affects the functional compatibility and fitness cost of newly acquired genes. These results are supported by the analyses of the antibiotic resistance gene distribution in 17 important human pathogens [484]. Considering these results, it is possible to conclude that the environments surrounding the antibiotic resistance in human and livestock have changed from the early antibiotic phase to the newer antibiotic phase. At the early antibiotic phase, even though the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes happened among the antibiotic producing soil bacteria, non-producing environmental bacteria and the clinic pathogens, the frequency and the technique including mobile genetic elements are more restricted and regulated. Moreover, it sometimes is possible to predict the future environment encompassing the antibiotic resistance. However, as the usage and the classes of antibiotics have been enlarged and entered into a new generation, the resistome is getting more and more complex and sophisticated and, is also entering into a new generation [468,469]. In addition, it is going harder and harder to predict the future of antibiotic resistance [487,488].
