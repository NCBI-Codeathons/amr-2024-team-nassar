["Grafting can overcome problems with soil sensitivity, enhance plant stress tolerance, improve product quality, and increase crop yield and value. This paper reviews the various mechanisms of vegetable grafting, the graft survival process and its influencing factors, the practical applications of grafting, and the molecular regulation of grafting in vegetables. The importance of germplasm and rootstock interactions, the mechanization of vegetable grafting, and future aspects, including intelligence and digitalization, are discussed.", "Grafting\u2014the process whereby a branch or bud (termed a \u201cscion\u201d) from one plant is joined with the stem or root (commonly known as \u201crootstock\u201d) of another organism within the same species\u2014plays an instrumental role in artificial plant propagation. Cross-pollinated flora often pose challenges in the preservation and inheritance of beneficial traits from the maternal line due to interference from paternal DNA. However, grafting can effectively circumvent these issues. By purposefully amalgamating shoots or buds from superior specimens onto a compatible rootstock, it is possible to perpetuate the favorable genotypic traits of the maternal plant. This procedure results in the generation of economically beneficial clones that embody the preferred traits of the maternal genotype [1,2]. This fusion of distinct plant elements fosters the growth of an integrative plant, combining attributes from both progenitor organisms.", "Grafting technology has garnered considerable attention in recent years, finding extensive application spanning horticulture, agriculture, and biology. It offers a versatile platform to investigate a broad spectrum of research areas, including floral initiation [3], bud proliferation [4], elucidation of heavy metal detoxification mechanisms, understanding of nutritional status [5], studies of soil-borne diseases [6], exploration of small RNA mobility, and examination of post-transcription silencing signals [7,8]. Its crucial role in elucidating the functioning of messenger RNA molecules [7] highlights its importance as a prime agricultural strategy. The technique serves to enhance crop yield, augment product quality, and augment crop resilience against various environmental stressors, leading to substantive economic acceleration.", "In this review, we will provide a detailed discourse on the multifarious processes and mechanisms incumbent in vegetable grafting.

DAD1 (DEFECTIVE IN ANTHER DEHISCENCE 1) regulates JA biosynthesis and is suppressed by ARF6 and ARF8, reflecting the influence of auxin concentration on grafting [111] (Figure 2). It has been shown that SlWOX4 (WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEODOMAIN 4, WOX4) is essential for vascular reconnection during grafting and may function as an early indicator of graft failure [112]. WOX4 acts redundantly with WOX14 in the regulation of vascular cell division [113]. Expression of ATHB7 (ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX 7) and ATHB8 are influenced by ABA during vascular system formation and are specifically expressed in the differentiating xylem.
