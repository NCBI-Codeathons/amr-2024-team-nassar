["The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "ABSTRACT", "In the past century, microbial natural products have proven themselves to be substantial and fruitful sources of anti-infectives. In addition to the well-studied Actinobacteria, understudied bacterial taxa like the Gram-negative myxobacteria have increasingly gained attention in the ongoing search for novel and biologically active natural products. In the course of a regional sampling campaign to source novel myxobacteria, we recently uncovered new myxobacterial strains MCy12716 and MCy12733 belonging to the Myxococcaceae clade. Early bioactivity screens of the bacterial extracts revealed the presence of bioactive natural products that were identified as angiolam A and several novel derivatives. Sequencing of the corresponding producer strains allowed the identification of the angiolam biosynthetic gene cluster, which was verified by targeted gene inactivation. Based on bioinformatic analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster, a concise biosynthesis model was devised to explain angiolam biosynthesis. Importantly, novel angiolam derivatives uncovered in this study named angiolams B, C, and D were found to display promising antiparasitic activities against the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum in the 0.3\u20130.8 \u00b5M range.", "IMPORTANCE", "IMPORTANCE", "The COVID-19 pandemic and continuously emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have recently raised awareness about limited treatment options against infectious diseases. However, the shortage of treatment options against protozoal parasitic infections, like malaria, is much more severe, especially for the treatment of so-called neglected tropical diseases. The detection of anti-parasitic bioactivities of angiolams produced by MCy12716 and MCy12733 displays the hidden potential of scarcely studied natural products to have promising biological activities in understudied indications. Furthermore, the improved biological activities of novel angiolam derivatives against Plasmodium falciparum and the evaluation of its biosynthesis display the opportunities of the angiolam scaffold on route to treat protozoal parasitic infections as well as possible ways to increase the production of derivatives with improved bioactivities.", "The COVID-19 pandemic and continuously emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have recently raised awareness about limited treatment options against infectious diseases.

According to the similarities of both sequences, the ang BGC comprises a total of 14 genes spanning a 78.5 kb region. Detailed analysis of the genes in the ang BGC in MCy12733 was carried out by BLAST searches against the NCBI database (see below and Tables S20 and S21; Fig. S3). Interestingly, the genome of P. caerfyrddinensis CA032A, the closest described relative of MCy12733, harbors genes coding for proteins highly similar to the ones of the putative ang BGC. While these genes are present in the same order in both strains, P. caerfyrddinensis lacks the PKS-NRPS core as well as angF, encoding an acyl-CoA/acyl-ACP dehydrogenase. Therefore, it is somewhat likely the ang BGC only consists of the biosynthetic core angA-angE and angF or also includes the flanking genes ang1-ang6 upstream and ang7-ang8 downstream the core region that might also perform relevant functions for angiolam biosynthesis.", "BLAST searches of angA-angE against draft genomes (Sebastian Walesch, unpublished data) of the known angiolam-producing strains Pyxidicoccus fallax An d30 (24, 25) and P. fallax An d48 (26) indicated the presence of the BGC but divided into several contigs due to poor DNA sequence quality.
