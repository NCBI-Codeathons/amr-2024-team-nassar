The biocontrol Agrobacterium radiobacter K84 secretes the Trojan Horse antibiotic agrocin 84 that is selectively transported into the plant pathogen A. tumefaciens and processed into the toxin TM84. We previously showed that TM84 employs a unique tRNA-dependent mechanism to inhibit leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), while the TM84-producer prevents self-poisoning by expressing a resistant LeuRS AgnB2. We now identify a mechanism by which the antibiotic-producing microbe resists its own toxin. Using a combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that AgnB2 evolved structural changes so as to resist the antibiotic by eliminating the tRNA-dependence of TM84 binding. Mutagenesis of key resistance determinants results in mutants adopting an antibiotic-sensitive phenotype. This study illuminates the evolution of resistance in self-immunity genes and provides mechanistic insights into a fascinating tRNA-dependent antibiotic with applications for the development of anti-infectives and the prevention of biocontrol emasculation.", "The bacterium Agrobacterium radiobacter K84 secretes an antibiotic that is transported into the plant pathogen A. tumefaciens and processed into the toxin TM84. Here, the authors identify a mechanism whereby the antibiotic-producing microbe resists its own toxin.", "Microbes that produce antimicrobial agents often prevent cell suicide by co-expressing self-immunity proteins that employ a variety of different resistance mechanisms1. Genes encoding self-immunity proteins can also act as a source of antibiotic resistance in the environment when they are horizontally transferred to microbial pathogens2. This threatens not only the successful treatment of human pathogens but also prevention of important animal and crop diseases3. One mechanism of self-immunity is to encode resistant variants of the enzyme targeted by the antibiotic. A fascinating example of such an antibiotic-producing organism is Agrobacterium radiobacter strain K84, which is used as a biocontrol agent of the plant pathogen A. tumefaciens that causes plant tumours in a number of agriculturally important species456. The biocontrol produces the \u2018Trojan Horse' antibiotic agrocin 84 (refs 7, 8, 9) that mimics a plant tumour-derived substrate to gain entry by subterfuge into the pathogen1011, where it is processed into a toxin termed TM84 (refs 10, 12) (Figs 1 and 2a). We recently identified the molecular target of TM84 in A. tumefaciens as leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRSAt) which catalyses an essential first step in protein synthesis12. To prevent cell suicide, A. radiobacter K84 contains a second, non-essential LeuRS, termed AgnB2, which is resistant to TM84 (refs 12, 13, 14) (Fig. 1). The agnB2 gene is encoded on the 44\u2009kb plasmid pAgK84, along with all the genes required to biosynthesize agrocin 84 (refs 14, 15). Importantly, horizontal gene transfer of the pAgK84 plasmid from A. radiobacter K84 to the pathogen has been previously reported to occur in the field, resulting in agrocin 84-resistant strains of A. tumefaciens encoding the agnB2 gene51617. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which AgnB2 provides immunity to agrocin 84 is crucial for combating antibiotic resistance.", "The molecular target of TM84, LeuRSAt, is an essential enzyme that specifically ligates leucine to its cognate tRNALeu isoacceptors, a critical step before protein synthesis at the ribosome. The aminoacylation of tRNALeu is catalysed in a two-step mechanism in all LeuRSs: in the tRNA-independent first step, leucine is activated by ATP to form the essential obligate intermediate leucyl-adenylate (Leu-AMP) that is stably bound to the enzyme. In the second step, a bound tRNALeu repositions its CCA 3\u2032-end into the LeuRS active site where activated-leucine is transferred to the tRNA. The essential catalytic nature of LeuRSs, and the 19 other canonical aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs), has led to these enzymes emerging as prominent targets for anti-pathogens1819, ranging in the prevention of fungal diseases in humans20 to bacterial plant pathogens12. A substantial amount of work has been performed on stable analogues of aminoacyl-adenylates that bind tightly to an AARS active site, and preventing activation of the amino acid with ATP2122. However, these molecules often cannot be transported efficiently into cells and can lack discrimination between microorganism and the intended host18.", "We recently showed that TM84 does not behave like other stable aminoacyl-adenylate analogues but, instead, employs a unique tRNA-dependent inhibition mechanism2324. TM84 binds only weakly to the LeuRS-active site on its own and requires the presence of tRNALeu to form a tight binding ternary inhibition complex23. The X-ray crystal structure of the Escherichia coli LeuRSEc\u00b7tRNALeu\u00b7TM84 ternary complex shows TM84 bound in the Leu-AMP-binding site of the catalytic domain. The tRNALeu is bound to LeuRS in an \u2018aminoacylation-like' conformation with the CCA 3\u2032-end of the tRNALeu entering into the active site with the terminal adenosine hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) directly with TM84 (ref. 23). The positioning of the tRNALeu acceptor stem is accompanied with a substantial movement of the catalytic K619MSK622S motif. The K619 sidechain bonds to the penultimate tRNALeu cytidine base, while K622 extends across the adenylate analogue and interacts with the phosphate of TM84 via a non-bridging oxygen. The repositioning of the Lys-Met-Ser-Lys-Ser (KMSKS) loop and tRNALeu combine to effectively bury the bound TM84, thus explaining how the presence of tRNALeu induces the tight binding of LeuRSs to TM84.", "AgnB2 exhibits a high degree of resistance to TM84 (ref. 12) despite the close similarity of TM84 to Leu-AMP (Fig. 2a) and the need for AgnB2 to adopt a true aminoacylation complex as exhibited in a recent LeuRSEc\u00b7tRNALeu\u00b7Leu-AMS crystal structure25. These observations raise the question of how does AgnB2 achieve resistance to TM84 without dramatically interfering with the catalysis of the aminoacylation reaction. This is particularly intriguing as primary sequence alignments of AgnB2 and TM84-sensitive LeuRSs show a high similarity of residues, including catalytic motifs (except a single Q instead of M at the KMSKS motif). Here, we examine the TM84 resistance mechanisms employed by AgnB2 using both thermodynamics and steady-state enzyme kinetics. We also present the X-ray crystal structure of AgnB2 in complex with tRNALeu and a stable leucyl-adenylate analogue and reveal tertiary interactions unique to AgnB2. We finally identify key TM84 immunity determinants in AgnB2 and the TM84-sensitive LeuRSAt and show that it is possible to partially inter-convert the TM84 sensitivity properties of these enzymes.", "Results", "Results", "Analysis of AgnB2 steady state enzyme kinetics", "Analysis of AgnB2 steady state enzyme kinetics", "Analysis of AgnB2 steady state enzyme kinetics", "The ability of AgnB2 to discriminate between TM84 and the obligate reaction intermediate Leu-AMP prompted us to examine differences between the two molecules. As shown in Fig. 2a, TM84 contains a stable N-acyl phosphoamidate bond, instead of the reactive phosphoanhydride linkage in Leu-AMP. In addition, TM84 has a deoxy-arabinose sugar group, instead of a ribose with subsequent loss of a 3\u2032-hydroxyl (OH) and a repositioned 2\u2032-OH above the sugar ring, and replacement of the primary amine with another OH group.

Another important interaction observed in the structure is the C-terminal domain interaction with the variable loop of Agrobacterium tRNALeu (Supplementary Fig. 4a). A comparison of the aminoacylation and editing states in LeuRSEc, shows the C-term domain coupled to the variable arm of E. coli tRNALeu rotates significantly upwards towards the catalytic domain in the aminoacylation state.
