Although both scientific research and industrial production of rifamycins have lasted for decades, little is known about the regulation of the export of this important antimycobacterial antibiotic. Here in this study, RifQ was proved to directly bind to the rifP promoter to repress its transcription. As RifP was a rifamycin pump protein, RifQ therefore repressed the export of rifamycin. Besides, we also found the RifQ-mediated regulation to rifP could be relieved by Rif_B, indicating Rif_B as an allosteric compound to induce the conformational change of RifQ. Based on the findings above, we concluded a feed-back model to illustrate the regulation of the rifamycin B export in A. mediterranei S699.", "Export of antibiotics is an important means for the producer to reduce the intracellular antibiotic concentration as well as its toxicity.
