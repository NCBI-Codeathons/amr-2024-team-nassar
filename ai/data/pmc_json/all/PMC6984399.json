The genetic modification of plant growth\u2010promoting rhizobacteria may provide a novel way to use natural bacteria as microbial inoculants. In this study, the root\u2010colonizing strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf\u20105 was genetically modified to act as a biocontrol agent and biofertilizer with biological nitrogen fixation activity. Genetic inactivation of retS enhanced the production of 2,4\u2010diacetylphloroglucinol, which contributed for the enhanced antifungal activity. Then, the entire nitrogenase island with native promoter from Pseudomonas stutzeri \nDSM4166 was introduced into a retS mutant strain for expression. Root colonization patterns assessed via confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that GFP\u2010tagged bacterial were mainly located on root surfaces and at the junctions between epidermal root cells. Moreover, under pathogen and N\u2010limited double treatment conditions, the fresh weights of seedlings inoculated with the recombinant retS mutant\u2010nif strain were increased compared with those of the control. In conclusion, this study has innovatively developed an eco\u2010friendly alternative to the agrochemicals that will benefit global plant production significantly.", "In this study, the root\u2010colonizing strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf\u20105 was genetically modified to act as a biocontrol agent and biofertilizer with biological nitrogen fixation activity.

Plant growth\u2010promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) are a better alternative than agrochemicals for the promotion for plant growth and suppression of phytopathogens through both direct and indirect mechanisms (Khalid et\u00a0al., 2013; Antweiler et\u00a0al., 2017; Pandin et\u00a0al., 2017). The direct mechanisms involve biological nitrogen fixation, phytohormone production, phosphate solubilization and iron chelating siderophore production (Vessey, 2003; Ryu et\u00a0al., 2004; Ahemad, 2014), while the major indirect mechanisms include biocontrol activity through the secretion of antifungal metabolites (Kim et\u00a0al., 2011; Bhattacharyya and Jha, 2012), and the induction of plant defence systems such as systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and induced systemic resistance (ISR; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). Some PGPR have biocontrol properties, while other strains effectively uptake nutrients to positively regulate plant growth and development.

Pseudomonas protegens Pf\u20105 (formerly Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf\u20105) was isolated from the cotton rhizosphere, which typically protects plants from diseases caused by plant pathogens (Howell and Stipanovic, 1979, 1980; Xu and Gross, 1986; Rodriguez and Pfender, 1997; Sexton et\u00a0al., 2017). At least 6% of the genome of P.\u00a0protegens Pf\u20105 is involved in secondary metabolite production (Paulsen et al., 2005), including that of pyrrolnitrin (Howell and Stipanovic, 1979, 1980), 2,4\u2010diacetylphloroglucinol (Nowak\u2010Thompson et\u00a0al., 1994), pyoluteorin (Howell and Stipanovic, 1980), hydrogen cyanide (Kraus and Loper, 1992), rhizoxin analogues (Loper et\u00a0al., 2008) and toxoflavin (Philmus et\u00a0al., 2015). The production of these antibiotics requires the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway (Haas and D\u00e9fago, 2005; Lapouge et\u00a0al., 2008). The GacS/A system, a two\u2010component regulatory system, comprises a sensor kinase GacS, a transcriptional regulator GacA and small regulatory RNA (Brencic et\u00a0al., 2009). Upon autophosphorylation, GacS senses a signal and transfers its phosphate to GacA (Brencic et\u00a0al., 2009). Phosphorylated GacA then positively regulates the expression of small regulatory RNAs that bind to the repressor proteins RsmA/E, thereby relieving translational repression on target genes encoding biocontrol factors (Valverde et\u00a0al., 2003; Kay et\u00a0al., 2005; Reimmann et\u00a0al., 2005; Lapouge et\u00a0al., 2008).

RetS sensors have a negative effect on the expression of GacA\u2010controlled sRNA genes. The combination of RetS and GacS has been proven to prevent the phosphorylation of GacA, which subsequently leads to obstructions of the Gac/Rsm pathway (Goodman et\u00a0al., 2004; Gooderham and Hancock, 2009; Workentine et\u00a0al., 2009; Quecine et\u00a0al., 2015).

The compounds C1 and C2 were vastly increased by threefold~fourfold (C1), 20~30\u2010fold (C2) in the retS mutant compared with the wild\u2010type strain (Fig.\u00a01C). The antifungal activity of the retS mutant was more significant, as revealed by the zone of inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani (Fig.\u00a01C and D), compared with those of the wild\u2010type strain (Fig.\u00a01D). Antifungal activity was also assessed with Botrytis cinereal; however, the activity against Botrytis cinereal was unaffected in the retS mutant (data not shown). To investigate the antifungal activity of the produced compounds against Rhizoctonia solani, compounds C1 and C2 were purified by preparative HPLC (Fig.\u00a0S2) and susceptibility testing was performed (Fig.\u00a02). Compound C2 showed excellent growth inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani (Fig.\u00a02A), while compound C1 did not have any significant antifungal activity against the tested fungi (date not shown). Compound C2 had a large peak at 270\u00a0nm and a small peak at 330\u00a0nm, identical to those of 2,4\u2010DAPG (Fig.\u00a02B); in addition, the m/z value and maximum absorption wavelength data for C2 were also comparable to 2,4\u2010DAPG. Enhanced the production of 2,4\u2010DAPG and antifungal activity was further revealed by the inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani growth in 6\u2010well plates (Figs\u00a01 and 2). The production of pyoluteorin (19.5\u00a0min; Fig.\u00a0S3), orfamide A (26.7\u00a0min; Fig.\u00a0S4), orfamide B (27.3\u00a0min; Fig.\u00a0S4) and orfamide C (26.1\u00a0min; Fig.\u00a0S4) were also identified by HPLC/MS. However, no significant differences in the production of these compounds were found in the retS mutant. These results suggest that retS could increase 2,4\u2010DAPG production in P.\u00a0protegens Pf\u20105, similar to P.\u00a0protegens CHA0 and P.\u00a0fluorescens FD6 (Humair et\u00a0al., 2009; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015). To obtain multifunctional P.\u00a0protegens capable of nitrogen fixation and enhanced antifungal production, the retS mutant Pf\u20105 was used as the chassis for the introduction of nif genes.", "Figure 1Influence of the retS gene on the production of antibiotics in P.\u00a0protegens Pf\u20105.
