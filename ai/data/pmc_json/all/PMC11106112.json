["Abstract", "Abstract", "Flow cytometry has made a significant contribution to the study of several complex fundamental mechanisms in plant cytogenetics, becoming a useful analytical tool to understand several mechanisms and processes underlying plant growth, development, and function. In this study, the genome size, DNA ploidy level, and A-T/G-C ratio were measured for the first time for two genotypes of chia, Salvia hispanica, an herbaceous plant commonly used in phytotherapy and nutrition. This study also evaluated, for the first time by flow cytometry, the capacity to produce organic acids of tissues stained with LysoTracker Deep Red after elicitation with either yeast extract or cadmium chloride. Rosmarinic acid content differed between the two chia varieties treated with different elicitor concentrations, compared with non-elicited plant material. Elicited tissues of both varieties contained a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with non-elicited cultures, and cadmium chloride at 500 \u03bcM was much better than that at 1000 \u03bcM, which led to plant death. For both genotypes, a dose-response was observed with yeast extract, as the higher the concentration of elicitor used, the higher rosmarinic acid content, resulting also in better results and a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with cadmium chloride. This study demonstrates that flow cytometry may be used as a taxonomy tool, to distinguish among very close genotypses of a given species and, for the first time in plants, that this approach can also be put to profit for a characterization of the cytoplasmic acid phase and the concomitant production of secondary metabolites of interest in vitro, with or without elicitation.", "Flow cytometry has made a significant contribution to the study of several complex fundamental mechanisms in plant cytogenetics, becoming a useful analytical tool to understand several mechanisms and processes underlying plant growth, development, and function.

Thus, the mechanisms of genome size evolution and the relationship between genome size and geographic and ecological factors are presently the object of intense research, and there is a need for methods that will provide a thorough understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic traits of various species. Flow cytometry (FCM) is one such method, and its use is currently generating a large interest among plant researchers. FCM allows a fast and accurate study of genome size and ploidy levels, while simultaneously enabling to efficiently detect even small differences in DNA content. In this respect, although nuclear DNA content or genome size is an important character in the evaluation of biodiversity, these parameters have only been estimated for a rather small number of species to date (Ochatt 2008; Kelly and Leitch 2011; McKinnon 2018). The first applications of ploidy focused mainly on crop plants, and plant breeding dominates in this area. The three main areas of applied studies by FCM are the characterization of ploidy level in analyzed plant material; the control of ploidy stability at various stages during breeding programs, including in vitro culture; and the testing of desired cytotypes following their hybridization and/or ploidy manipulation (Sree Ramulu et al. 1986; Barto\u0161 et al. 2005; Loureiro et al. 2008; Ochatt et al. 2011; Ochatt and Segui-Simarro 2021).

It is an herbaceous plant, belonging to the genus Salvia (sage) in the family Lamiaceae (Cahill 2003; Ayerza and Coates 2005; Motyka et al. 2021, 2022, 2023a, b), which includes about 900 species that occur almost all over the world, mainly in North, Central, and South America; in South Africa and Southeast Asia; and also in Europe (Lu and Yeap Foo 2002; Cahill 2003; Das 2017). The current 10th edition of European Pharmacopoeia (2020) presents monographs of raw materials obtained from various species of Salvia spp., namely, S. lavandulifolia (lavender sage), S. miltiorrhiza (red root sage or red sage), S. officinalis (medical sage), S. sclarea (clary sage), and S. triloba (Greek sage). All monographs confirm that Salvia spp. are valuable medicinal species, with health-promoting properties used in therapeutic treatments (Perry et al. 2010; Motyka et al. 2023a, b). In S. hispanica, the main raw materials obtained are chia seeds (Salviae hispanicae semen), which have been used for ages in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in traditional Latin American Medicine (Cahill 2003; Melo et al. 2019; S\u00e1nchez-Vel\u00e1zquez et al. 2022) Nowadays, other parts of S. hispanica plants, mainly the sprouts, leaves, flowers, and herb, are also becoming increasingly popular in many sectors of the food, pharmaceutical, and therapeutic industries (Kojima 1996; Hasler 1998; Arai 2002; Motyka et al. 2022, 2023a, b). Nonetheless, chia seeds remain the most well-known product from S. hispanica, which has been approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and whose market position is well-established, since they are an important ingredient in food production (Bresson et al. 2009; EFSA NDA Panel 2019). Interestingly, though, it is noteworthy that S. hispanica is classified as a neglected plant in highly industrialized countries, while it is considered a valuable product for \u201cmedium- and high-income countries\u201d (Ochatt and Jain 2007; Alkhatib et al. 2017; Ali and Rahut 2019). Nowadays, chia seeds are gaining popularity and are valued for their nutritional qualities. They are a source of protein, dietary fiber, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. The special health properties of chia seeds are determined by the presence of omega-3 fatty acids. Moreover, chia seeds owe their bioactive potential to the presence of antioxidant phenolic compounds (Oteri et al. 2022; Agarwal et al. 2023; Ferreira et al. 2023). Polyphenols, mainly cinnamic acid derivatives and flavonoids, are responsible for the antioxidant activity of chia seeds (Knez Hrn\u010di\u010d et al. 2019; Aja and Haros 2022; Ghafoor et al. 2022; Agarwal et al. 2023).", "Chia, Salvia hispanica L., is gaining popularity for its valuable medicinal properties.

On the other hand, a higher CD concentration (1000 \u03bcM) negatively affected the further growth and rosmarinic acid production in both varieties in vitro (Table 2). CD at 1000 \u03bcM was too strong and caused gradual decay/death and growth stoppage of the explants. YeE enhanced rosmarinic acid production at both concentrations used compared with the control.

In vitro cultures of S. hispanica obtained from KruKam had larger and greener leaves compared with genotype Bio Planet. KruKam grew more densely and had more branches, while Bio Planet genotype had more, thin, and taller stems. The application of 500 \u03bcM CD resulted in the maintenance of a similar appearance of in vitro cultures of both tested S. hispanica genotypes. On the other hand, a higher CD concentration (1000 \u03bcM) negatively affected the further growth and rosmarinic acid production in both varieties in vitro (Table 2). CD at 1000 \u03bcM was too strong and caused gradual decay/death and growth stoppage of the explants. YeE enhanced rosmarinic acid production at both concentrations used compared with the control. Moreover, after YeE elicitation with both 500 and 1000 mg/L, in vitro cultures of S. hispanica from both genotypes developed a more robust root system (Supplemental Fig. S2).

Likewise, tissues developed in vitro grew faster and exhibited a larger G-C content than the in vivo grown plants. In addition, from the results obtained with the different dyes used and applying the formulae described, the A-T% and G-C%, then the A-T/G-C ratio for the genotypes of S. hispanica studied was calculated, as detailed in Table 2. The G-C% values found when the pea cv. Cameor was used as reference were always slightly higher than those obtained for other Salvia species (Siljak-Yakovlev et al. 2010), but results were consistently reproducible with both genotypes analyzed, strengthening the usefulness of this approach for the taxonomical distinction between closely related genotypes. Eliciting tissue and cell cultures of medicinal plants in vitro is an efficient strategy to improve their ability to produce secondary metabolites, which is subsequently assessed by various physico-chemical methods as a standard practice. In this work, for the first time in plants, the acid phase of the cytoplasm of such cultured tissues was analyzed by flow cytometry using the stain LysoTracker Deep Red (LyDR) as an indirect measurement of their capacity to produce organic acids of medicinal interest, such as rosmarinic acid. LyDR is a cell-permeable, non-fixable, red fluorescent dye that stains lysosomes and other acidic compartments within cells such as autolysosomes. Avrahami et al. (2013) used LyDR to demonstrate relatively large elevations in pH as LyDR is a single wavelength dye, whereby any change observed in the amount of emitted light will result either from an increase in pH or from a change in the number and/or area of the lysosomes. In this respect, the interest in using the LyDR probe resides in its high selectivity for acidic organelles compared with other classical dyes such as neutral red or acridine orange (Chazotte 2011). The results obtained with the flow cytometry analyses of LyDR-stained tissues of chia of both genotypes revealed that, naturally, their cytoplasm acid phase was higher in vitro than in vivo, while Bio Planet produced more organic acids than KruKam (Fig. 4). It was also apparent that there were differences in terms of elicitation of acid phase between YeE and CD; YE1000 appeared to improve the acid phase in terms of median and surface area of the peaks obtained as compared with the in vivo and in vitro controls and also as compared with CD. Moreover, CD generally proved to be deleterious, since their viability was decreased at both 500 mM and 1000 mM as determined microscopically with FDA staining (data not shown). However, CD500 resulted in a 25% increase of the acid phase compared with the in vitro control.Fig. 3Comparison of in vivo and in vitro material of the two genotypes analyzed with CA3Table 2Comparison of G-C% between species of the genus SalviaTaxaCountry of origin of seedsGC%ReferencesS. brachyodonCroatia (Peljesac Peninsula)38.52Siljak-Yakovlev et al.

Likewise, tissues developed in vitro grew faster and exhibited a larger G-C content than the in vivo grown plants. In addition, from the results obtained with the different dyes used and applying the formulae described, the A-T% and G-C%, then the A-T/G-C ratio for the genotypes of S. hispanica studied was calculated, as detailed in Table 2.

The results also revealed that the rosmarinic acid content differs between the two S. hispanica varieties treated with different elicitors at different concentrations (Table 3). For both genotypes, CD at a concentration of 500 \u03bcM was better than that of 1000 \u03bcM in terms of rosmarinic acid production. The use of YeE as an elicitor resulted in better results and a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with CD. The use of either elicitor at a lower concentration (500 \u03bcM CD, 500 mg/L YeE) resulted in a significant increase in rosmarinic acid content compared with the higher concentration used (1000 \u03bcM CD, 1000 mg/L YeE) as well as to the control. The content of rosmarinic acid was highest (4651.5 mg/100 g DW) for genotype KruKam elicited with CD at 500 \u03bcM and was more than 5 times higher than in the control (881.09 g/100 g DW). For genotype Bio Planet elicited with 500 \u00b5M CD, the content of rosmarinic acid was 3020.82 mg/100 g DW, i.e., almost 4 times higher compared with the non-elicited control (838.14 g/100 g DW). An inverse dependence was observed for tissues elicited with CD as a higher CD concentration significantly decreased rosmarinic acid content in both S. hispanica genotypes. Thus, in KruKam elicited with 1000 \u03bcM CD, the content of rosmarinic acid was 868.41 mg/100 g DW, i.e., almost 6 times lower compared with 500 \u03bcM CD and roughly the same rosmarinic acid content as found in the non-elicited microshoots. Conversely, for YeE, a higher concentration of elicitor resulted in a higher rosmarinic acid content in both S. hispanica genotypes. Upon elicitation with YeE at 1000 mg/L, the rosmarinic acid content was 3135.47 mg/100 g DW for KruKam and 4081.19 mg/100 g DW for Bio Planet, which was 2.5\u20135 times higher than that for the non-elicited cultures. Application of YeE at a lower concentration (500 mg/L) also increased rosmarinic acid content in both genotypes compared with the control, but to a lesser extent. Thus, for genotype KruKam, the content of rosmarinic acid was 1696.00 mg/100 g DW, twice that of the control, while for genotype Bio Planet elicited with YeE at concentration of 500 mg/L, the rosmarinic acid content was 2929.18 mg/100 g DW, hence 3.5 times that of non-elicited cultures. Table 3 shows that, in terms of the content of rosmarinic acid, elicitation with CD at 500 \u03bcM was better than that with 1000 \u03bcM for both genotypes of S. hispanica.

This has been studied mostly on Streptomyces (Medema et al. 2010), but the observations made can be safely extended to higher plants.

On the other hand, the influence of abiotic stress signals on secondary metabolites production in plants is well established for more than a decade (Akula and Ravishankar 2011). Moreover, it is beyond speculation that an increased G-C% in the genome will imply a larger production of secondary metabolites of interest, as observed with the in vitro tissues of KruKam and Bio Planet chia compared with tissues from in vivo grown plants of the same genotype. In vitro cultures obtained from the two genotypes of S. hispanica have a higher rosmarinic acid content compared with those found in plant material obtained from in vivo conditions (Motyka et al. 2023a, b). Rosmarinic acid content in non-elicited in vitro cultures for KruKam genotype (881.09 mg/100 g DW) was 4.5 times higher than that in tissues from in vivo grown plants of the same genotype (198.53 mg/100 g DW). For genotype Bio Planet obtained in vitro, the content of rosmarinic acid (838.14 mg/100 g DW) was almost 5 times higher compared with in vivo conditions (175.28 mg/100 g DW). In addition, elicited tissues of each genotype of S. hispanica contained a higher content of rosmarinic acid than non-elicited cultures, and this study proved that for both genotypes, CdCl2 at the lower concentration (500 \u03bcM) was better, whereas for YeE, the higher the concentration of elicitor used, the higher rosmarinic acid content.", "Although debated for a long time, it is accepted today that GC pairs are generally more stable than AT pairs, and GC-rich genomes are more adapted to high temperatures than AT-rich genomes (Hu et al. 2022).

The positive effect of elicitors on the production of secondary metabolites was also confirmed by other studies conducted on in vitro cultures of various species of Salvia (Attaran Dowom et al. 2022; Grzegorczyk-Karolak et al. 2022; Radomir et al. 2023; Rostami et al. 2022; Shoja et al. 2022; Szymczyk et al. 2021). The stimulation of rosmarinic acid production and accumulation by elicitors such as YeE has also been observed in the cell cultures of other plant species, including Orthosiphon aristatus (Mizukami et al. 1992), Lithospermum erythrorhizon (Sumaryono et al. 1991; Mizukami et al. 1993), Coleus blumei (Szabo et al. 1999), Zingiber officinale callus cultures (Ali et al. 2018), and Polygonum multiflorum beard root cultures (Ho et al. 2018). In a study conducted on hairy root cultures of S. miltiorrhiza to test the impact of adding YeE or silver ions (Ag+) on rosmarinic acid production, Yan et al. (2006) showed that the effect of elicitors on rosmarinic acid content depended on the elicitor type and dosage. Both elicitors increased rosmarinic acid accumulation as well as total phenolic content in hairy root cultures, but the synthesis was more significantly affected by YeE, in a concentration-dependent manner. The stimulating effect of YeE was stronger at larger doses, of 200 and 400 mg/L attaining 1.5- and 1.6-fold of the rosmarinic acid contents in the control after 4 and 8 days, respectively. Maximum amounts of rosmarinic acid were obtained in the presence of 200 mg/L YeE and at 15 mM Ag+. Moreover, the hairy root growth (root weight) was enhanced by the addition of YeE (200 mg/L) but not significantly affected by the addition of Ag+ (15 mM) (Yan et al. 2006). Sahu et al. (2013) also confirmed the positive eliciting effects of YeE, salicylic acid (SA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJa) on the rosmarinic acid production in shoot cultures of Solenostemon scutellarioides (Lamiaceae). Addition of MeJa (50 \u00b5M) and SA (50 \u00b5M) caused a 1.7- and 1.4-fold increase in rosmarinic acid accumulation within 24 h, respectively, while addition of YeE (100 \u00b5g/mL) showed a 1.5-fold increase in rosmarinic acid content after 72 h compared with non-elicited plants. YeE was found to be significantly effective between 50 and 100 \u00b5g/mL, and rosmarinic acid content remained nearly constant between days 1 and 3. Maximum rosmarinic acid concentration was achieved with 100 \u00b5g/mL YeE on day 3 (Sahu et al. 2013). Goncharuk et al.

LyDR is a highly selective red stain comprising of a fluorophore linked to a weak base which is only partially protonated at a neutral pH and can hence freely pass across the cell membrane and label acid organelles in living cells at nanomolar concentrations. LyDR has been used several times in microscopic studies, e.g., for the detection of autophagy-associated lysosomal activity in tissues of Drosophila such as the fat body, midgut, salivary gland, and ovary, but also in Drosophila cell cultures (DeVorkin and Gorski 2014). Importantly, studies using LyDR to date concerned animal cells only, and this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report on its use with higher plant cells and its analysis with flow cytometry.

An increased production of rosmarinic acid leads to a decrease of the cytoplasm pH and simultaneously generates a stress for the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, the use of elicited material allows to see if there are differences in the production of secondary metabolites and also whether they are a response to stress (Al-Khayri et al. 2023). This increased production of rosmarinic acid would also entail an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, in turn, imply an improved antioxidant activity to maintain redox homeostasis of the cytoplasm (Cruz de Carvalho 2008), cell membrane integrity (Traber and Stevens 2011), and, by extension, cell viability.

Today, the application of FCM to determine the ploidy level of tissues and plants after they have been manipulated in vitro or treated with mitogens has become commonplace. Moreover, FCM allows to reliably evaluate the ploidy level, nuclear DNA content, and division frequency (through detailed analysis of the cell cycle) for a comprehensive characterization of plants, tissues, and regenerants. This study shows that FCM may also be used as a taxonomy tool, to distinguish among very close genotypes of a given species and, for the first time in plants, that this approach can also be put to profit for a characterization of the cytoplasmic acid phase and the concomitant production of secondary metabolites of interest by LyDR-stained cells in vitro, with or without yeast extract (YeE) or cadmium chloride (CD) elicitation. Plant in vitro cultures of S. hispanica can be an innovative and useful source of secondary metabolites, as they contain almost 5 times more rosmarinic acid compared with plant material grown in vivo. The rosmarinic acid content differed between tissues of two S. hispanica varieties obtained in vivo and in vitro, treated with different elicitors at different concentrations. Elicited tissues of each genotype of S. hispanica had a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with non-elicited cultures. This study demonstrates that for both genotypes, CD was better at the lower concentration (500 \u03bcM), while the reverse was observed for YeE where the higher concentration of elicitor used resulted in the higher rosmarinic acid content in the plant tissue tested.", "In conclusion, the studies aiming to unravel some of the most complex fundamental mechanisms underlying plant cytogenetics have been significantly aided by FCM.
