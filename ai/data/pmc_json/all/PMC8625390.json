["Antibiotics are majorly important molecules for human health. Following the golden age of antibiotic discovery, a period of decline ensued, characterised by the rediscovery of the same molecules. At the same time, new culture techniques and high-throughput sequencing enabled the discovery of new microorganisms that represent a potential source of interesting new antimicrobial substances to explore. The aim of this review is to present recently discovered nonribosomal peptide (NRP) and polyketide (PK) molecules with antimicrobial activity against human pathogens. We highlight the different in silico/in vitro strategies and approaches that led to their discovery. As a result of technological progress and a better understanding of the NRP and PK synthesis mechanisms, these new antibiotic compounds provide an additional option in human medical treatment and a potential way out of the impasse of antibiotic resistance.", "1.

Their discovery is due both to chance and to the ingenuity of Alexander Fleming, who noticed that Penicillium notatum inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus colonies.

Industrial production came over 10 years later, led by Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain, using Penicillium chrysogenum [2].

This was based on his experiments on \u201cantibiosis\u201d. In 1939, Dubos discovered gramicidin, the first clinically used antibiotic [3]. This experimental design inspired researchers to develop new methods to discover antibiotics. Waksman established a platform that consists of screening mainly soil-derived bacteria, particularly Actinomycetes [4], and identified actinomycin and streptomycin. These efforts opened the door to the \u201cgolden age of antibiotic discovery\u201d [5]. Pharmaceutical companies have continued to apply these approaches to extract and purify most of the antibiotics used today, such as erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, rifamycin, and others [6]. In the 1960s, the rate of discovery of new antibiotics dropped sharply due to the high rate of rediscovery and the difficulties of characterising unknown compounds.

These secondary metabolites have been reengineered to be used by humans in order to combat several infectious diseases.

Erythromycin polyketide synthase is encoded by three genes, eryAI, eryAII, and eryAIII, which code for three multienzymatic polypeptide 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthases, DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3, respectively. Each of these giant proteins contain domains or catalytic sites [12]. Erythromycin is synthetised according to the biosynthesis mode of type I PKS. Type I PKS is a multifunctional enzyme organised into several modules (Figure 1). Each module contains three core domains necessary for the definition of type 1 PKS, namely acyl transferase (AT), ketosynthase (KS), and acyl carrier protein (ACP). The biosynthesis mode of type I PKS is linear. An acyl-coenzyme A is used as substrate and is selected by the AT. ACP, then, transfers the acyl-coenzyme A into the next module, and KS catalyses a Claisen condensation between acyl-coenzyme A and the growing polyketide chain attached to the ACP domain (Figure 1). Recent studies have questioned the definition of modules in polyketide synthase based on evolutionary analysis [20]. The authors show that domains that migrate together over the course of evolution of PKS assembly lines do not correspond to the known definitions of modules [21]. Two other types of PKS biosynthesis are known: type II and type III PKS [22]. The type II PKS is iterative; it is composed of two core domains: heterodimeric KS (KS and chain length factor subunits) and an ACP. Type II PKS usually acts by loading an \u03b1-carboxylated precursor onto an ACP, which is transferred to the active site of a KS for Claisen condensation and iterative lengthening using malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to result in a poly-\u03b2-keto chain [23]. This enzymatic machinery is responsible for the synthesis of aromatic polyketide such as tetracycline. Type III PKS are ACP independent and iterative homodimeric enzymes, composed of a single domain KS that plays the main role in the biosynthesis of natural products [24]. Type III PKSs are structurally less complex than type I or II PKSs and at least 15 families of type III PKSs have been identified to date [25].", "Inspired by the study of the biosynthesis of actinorhodin, [16] researchers identified the erythromycin BGC using different strategies, including sequencing adjacent parts of the gene coding for erythromycin resistance [17], looking for sequences similar to fatty acid sequence and other PKS enzymes [17], or mutated genes involved in the synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB) [18,19].

NRPS are multienzyme machineries that assemble peptides with diverse structures and functionalities [26]. Therefore, the amino acid substrate is activated by adenylation and thioesterification at specific reactive thiol groups, the peripheral cysteines of the multienzyme, on the same model of the fatty acid synthase. An intrinsic 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine carrier was considered to interact with the thioesterified amino acids, ensuring a step-by-step elongation of the peptide product in a series of transpeptidation and transthiolation reactions. Therefore, NRPS are organised into distinct modular sections, each composed of catalytic domains with different functions. Three domains are considered as core and are essential for peptide elongation: adenylation (A) domains, peptidyl carrier protein or thiolation (PCP or T) domains, and condensation (C) domains [27]. The A domain is involved in the selection and activation of amino acid substrates with adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP), and it ligates it to the adjacent PCP domain to be incorporated into the NRP [28]. A domains are, therefore, involved in the large diversity of the NRP structure by selecting not only the 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids but also nonproteinogenic amino acids [13,29]. A domains own a specific code composed of 10 amino acids, which are responsible for substrate binding [30]. Some bioinformatics tools are able to predict the substrate to be selected by an amino acid by A domains and, therefore, the NRP amino acid composition [31,32,33]. C domains catalyse amide bond formation between amino acids and the growing peptide; they have a conserved HHxxxDG motif. This conserved motif is essential for the peptide bond formation [34]. Bioinformatic analyses revealed subclasses that are classified depending on the condensation between acceptor and donor and noncanonical members of the C superfamily [35]. The PCP domains transport the substrate between the different NRPS modules [35]. PCP domains must be post-translationally modified by the addition of the 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine (PPT) to a conserved serin residue of the conserved GGXS motif [35]. The PCP domain does not play an active role in catalysis, but it has a central role in NRPS function.

It goes without saying that any bacterium secreting an antibiotic must have in its genome the means to protect itself from the harmful effects of its own weaponry. According to this principle of self-protection against its own antimicrobial metabolites, bacteria should harbour in their genomes the genes encoding for resistance to these antibiotics. Resistance-guided genome mining is an interesting approach, which has led to the identification of BGCs of some already known natural products, and to the discovery of new natural products [58]. Natural antimicrobial substances have different modes of action in order to inhibit growth or induce the death of microorganisms with which the producing bacteria compete in a given environment. These molecules may act by inhibiting DNA replication and transcription, RNA translation, protein synthesis, the proteasome, or the cell wall synthesis. Yet, these target sites of action are consistently present in the antibiotic-producing microorganism, making them vulnerable to the products they have synthesised [59]. With the aim of self-protection, the BGC responsible for antibiotic synthesis usually contains immunity or resistance genes to the synthesised compounds [60]. While trying to find BGCs, it would be consistent to search for a resistance or immunity gene included in a BGC [61]. Furthermore, the mechanism of resistance predicted from the resistance gene can help to characterise the precise mode of action of the potential antibiotic molecule. Thus, Kling et al.

The authors have verified that the synthesised structures do not look like any existing listed natural product. No similar metabolites could be identified previously using classical fermentation methods alone [80]. Thus, this approach opens up a new line of research for antibiotics. Vila-Farres et al. (2017) [82] synthesised a peptide with an antifungal activity inspired by a cluster found in the genome of Xenorhabdus nematophila, which could not be detected by culture methods. In the same study, Vila-Farres et al.

The synthesised peptide, named paenimucillin A, also showed limited activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Further modifications made by changing the N-acyl at the N-terminal acyl led to the new compound gaining activity against multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii, while retaining limited toxicity. This new syn-BNP was named paenimucillin C and showed encouraging results in skin wound infections on multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in a rat model [83]. This approach was revealed to be particularly amenable, while drawing inspiration from known BGCs, and it may also offer the possibility of optimising syn-BNP activity. Given the potential of this method in discovering new antibiotics, the use of classical fermentation or the culture of bacteria did not appear to be relevant. Thus, databases such as NCBI and genome sequencing became a source for the discovery of new antibiotics. Moreover, the laboratory conditions required to generate any experimental resistance against these syn-BNP products did not yield satisfactory results [83]. These findings are very encouraging, because they guarantee that these future pharmaceutical products are effective, secure, and immune to bacterial resistance.", "The results obtained from these studies are very promising with regards to the search for antibiotics. The authors have verified that the synthesised structures do not look like any existing listed natural product. No similar metabolites could be identified previously using classical fermentation methods alone [80]. Thus, this approach opens up a new line of research for antibiotics. Vila-Farres et al. (2017) [82] synthesised a peptide with an antifungal activity inspired by a cluster found in the genome of Xenorhabdus nematophila, which could not be detected by culture methods. In the same study, Vila-Farres et al. (2017) synthesised a peptide based on an NRPS found in the genome of Paenibacillus mucilaginosus strain K02, which has been shown to be active against Gram-positive bacteria [82]. The synthesised peptide, named paenimucillin A, also showed limited activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Further modifications made by changing the N-acyl at the N-terminal acyl led to the new compound gaining activity against multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii, while retaining limited toxicity. This new syn-BNP was named paenimucillin C and showed encouraging results in skin wound infections on multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in a rat model [83]. This approach was revealed to be particularly amenable, while drawing inspiration from known BGCs, and it may also offer the possibility of optimising syn-BNP activity.

There are two cases in this situation, first the BGC may be expressed, but the product cannot be characterised and remains unknown; second, the BGC is not expressed, and naturally, the product remains unknown and uncharacterised. This situation of known BGC but unknown product [84] is a frustrating one, because the product that would be pharmacologically interesting might never be characterised. Sometimes, culture or molecular techniques can lead to the expression of BGCs that may have potent antimicrobial activity.", "A multitude of NRPS-PKS BGCs have been characterised by bioinformatic software, yet it continues to be very tedious in some cases to prove that those clusters result in products with antimicrobial activity.

Streptomyces sp. KCB13F003 was studied for the first time in search of potential new compounds through LC-MS screening. These investigations led to the discovery of two new cyclic depsipeptides and ulleungamides A and B [85]. Streptomyces sp. KCB13F003 genome analysis has revealed multiple putative BGCs, including one NRPS BGC adjacent to the halogenase gene that encodes chlorinated hexapeptides [86]. As this compound was not detected under standard culture conditions, the authors tried different culture media to induce the expression of BGC. They succeeded in isolating two NRP compounds named ulleungmycins A and B. These compounds display an activity against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including quinolone and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. More sophisticated methods could achieve this goal, such as heterologous expression and the use of engineered promoter or action on transcript regulators [87]. Thus, Streptomyces roseosporus, a well-known microorganism for the synthesis of daptomycin an NRP antibiotic, was found to harbour more than 20 BGCs in its genome [88]. Some of these NRPs, including arylomycins, napsamycins, and stenothricins, were able to be characterised thanks to advances in mass spectrometry and networking analysis [89]. S. roseosporus NRRL 15998 harbour a silent BGC type I PKS homolog to the incednine BGC, which was activated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology and led to the discovery of auroramycin [88].

Conclusions", "The search for new antimicrobial compounds has been neglected by the pharmaceutical industry [90] over the past decade, while antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens has become an issue of increasing concern [91]. The World Health Organization has published a list of human pathogens for which antibiotics are urgently needed [92]. The search for new antibiotics using culture-dependant methods to fight antimicrobial resistance slowed down [90]. Despite the fact that a large variety of NRPS-PKS BGCs exists in the environment around us [93], it is estimated that we only know 10% of the secondary metabolites and less than 1% of the global consortium of microbial producers [94]. Efforts in metagenomic exploration, the discovery of new bacterial species and genome analysis (Figure 2) must be carried out in order to discover new antibiotics representing an alternative solution to available treatment options. Technological advances and a better understanding of NRPS-PKS BGCs have made it possible to implement various approaches to target compounds that may be of interest to researchers. In addition, increasingly powerful analytical tools are available online, as well as databases, which can provide access to a huge amount of genomic data. These in silico approaches facilitate the identification of bacteria to be tested as priority. Furthermore, culture-independent methods [81,82,83] are an interesting way of circumventing difficulties, such as bacteria availability, problems related to culture, and silent BGCs. However, culture under multiple conditions, imitating reality as much as possible, remains a powerful tool for the expression of BGCs. To conclude, the combined use of these methods will expand our knowledge about the NRPS-PKS repertoire and will consequently enable the development of new antibiotics to fight antimicrobial resistance.", "The search for new antimicrobial compounds has been neglected by the pharmaceutical industry [90] over the past decade, while antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens has become an issue of increasing concern [91].
