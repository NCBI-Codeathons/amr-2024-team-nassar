It is generally conserved between globally distributed Y. pestis strains, but Y. pestis subsp. microtus biovar caucasica strains circulating within populations of common voles in Georgia and Armenia were reported to carry a single substitution of alanine to serine. We investigated polymorphism of the Caf1 sequences among other Y. pestis subsp. microtus strains, which have a limited virulence in guinea pigs and in humans. Sequencing of caf1 genes from 119 Y. pestis strains belonging to different biovars within subsp. microtus showed that the Caf1 proteins exist in three isoforms, the global type Caf1NT1 (Ala48 Phe117), type Caf1NT2 (Ser48 Phe117) found in Transcaucasian-highland and Pre-Araks natural plague foci #4\u20137, and a novel Caf1NT3 type (Ala48 Val117) endemic in Dagestan-highland natural plague focus #39. Both minor types are the progenies of the global isoform. In this report, Caf1 polymorphism was analyzed by comparing predicted intrinsic disorder propensities and potential protein-protein interactivities of the three Caf1 isoforms. The analysis revealed that these properties of Caf1 protein are minimally affected by its polymorphism. All protein isoforms could be equally detected by an immunochromatography test for plague at the lowest protein concentration tested (1.0 ng/mL), which is the detection limit. When compared to the classic Caf1NT1 isoform, the endemic Caf1NT2 or Caf1NT3 had lower immunoreactivity in ELISA and lower indices of self- and cross-protection. Despite a visible reduction in cross-protection between all Caf1 isoforms, our data suggest that polymorphism in the caf1 gene may not allow the carriers of Caf1NT2 or Caf1NT3 variants escaping from the Caf1NT1-mediated immunity to plague in the case of a low-dose flea-borne infection.", "Data Availability", "All relevant data are within the paper and all files with sequences of the caf1 genes are available from the GenBank database (accession numbers KP641181.1-KP641299.1).", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics of human plague are caused by Yersinia pestis subsp. pestis strains that possess universal hypervirulence for a wide range of mammals and are ubiquitously distributed [1\u20134].

This index represents the difference in challenge dose required to cause death in immunized versus na\u00efve animals (Table 2). Similar data were obtained from the analysis of survival curves (Fig 4). Taking into account that infected fleas can contain up to 5000 Y. pestis CFU, but the median number of transmitted bacteria is 82 CFU [2], we can predict that the immunity induced by Caf1NT1 isoform is sufficient for protection from a low-dose flea-borne infection caused not only by a strain with the same isoform, but also by isolates producing Caf1NT2 and Caf1NT3 variants.

We can speculate that this phenomenon may be due to the different terms of antibody-titer measurement after the first and second immunizations, i.e. post-immunization-exposure increase from the four to six weeks was sufficient for onset of depletion of humoral immune response. Another supposition is that the antibody titers measured by ELISA went down after the booster immunizations might be due to the action of regulatory cells. Noteworthy, they were higher after the first vaccination with the NT1 isoform, suggesting that this standard vaccine protein has a superior immunogenicity compared to the minor isoforms. However, after the boost, this difference substantially disappeared, indicating that NT2 and NT3 proteins can also be used for a vaccine, given that immunization is performed in two subsequent injections. These two seemingly less immunogenic isoforms may in fact prove to be better vaccines and induce a longer lasting immunity to Y. pestis due to a lower capacity to induce regulatory cells [64].
