In addition to the anticoccidial activity of these compounds, polyether ionophores also contain antibacterial properties. Resistance to the polyether ionophore narasin was recently shown to exist on mobile plasmids in Enterococcus faecium and the resistance mechanism was suggested to be associated with a two-gene operon encoding an ABC-type transporter. In this study we demonstrate that the genes encoding the putative narasin resistance mechanism confers reduced susceptibility to the polyether ionophores narasin, salinomycin and maduramicin, but not to monensin and suggest that this resistance mechanism should be referred to as NarAB. Importantly, NarAB does not affect the susceptibility of E. faecium to any of the tested antimicrobial compounds that are used in clinical medicine. However, we show that conjugation in the presence of certain polyether ionophores increases the number of vancomycin resistant E. faecium suggesting that narasin and certain other polyether ionophores can contribute to the persistence of VRE in poultry populations.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Polyether ionophores are used worldwide as feed additives in conventional rearing of poultry to control coccidiosis caused by the genus Eimeria (Kadykalo et al., 2018). In addition to the anticoccidial activity of polyether ionophores, they also possess antibacterial activity, mainly against Gram-positive bacteria. Until recently, it was assumed that there was no genetically encoded resistance mechanism to polyether ionophores, and that reduced susceptibility of bacteria to these compounds was due to a phenotypic adaptation (Simjee et al., 2012). However, it has been shown that resistance to the polyether ionophore narasin can be transferred between strains of enterococci by conjugation (Nilsson et al., 2012), proving the existence of a genetically encoded narasin resistance mechanism. Evidence has also emerged suggesting that narasin resistance might be associated with an operon encoding an ABC-type membrane transporter (Nilsson et al., 2016), but this has not yet been directly confirmed experimentally.", "Polyether ionophores are used worldwide as feed additives in conventional rearing of poultry to control coccidiosis caused by the genus Eimeria (Kadykalo et al., 2018).

During the last decades, feed supplemented with monensin and narasin have been used for rearing of turkeys and broilers, respectively. In the Norwegian program for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in the veterinary and food production sectors (NORM-VET), narasin has been included in the test panel for enterococci from different animals and food products. Surveillance data from 2002 to 2018 show that a high proportion of Enterococcus faecium isolates from poultry (25\u201391%) display reduced susceptibility to narasin (Norm/Norm-Vet, 2001\u20132014). Interestingly, all available vancomycin resistant E. faecium (VRE) from NORM-VET are also narasin resistant (Norm/Norm-Vet, 2001\u20132014). Narasin resistant bacteria as such are not considered to be a great problem, since narasin is currently not used in human medicine. However, it is not established if the narasin resistance mechanism offers cross-resistance to medically important antimicrobials. It has also been shown that narasin resistance and vancomycin resistance can be physically linked on transferrable plasmids (Sletvold et al., 2008; Nilsson et al., 2016), which indicates that use of narasin can co-select for vancomycin resistance. Vancomycin is used for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (Alvarez et al., 2016), and is classified by WHO as a critically important antimicrobial for human medicine (WHO, 2017).", "The polyether ionophores: monensin, narasin, maduramicin, salinomycin, and lasalocid are approved for use as feed additives in Norway (VKM, 2015).

In the early 1990s, a community reservoir of VRE was discovered in Europe, which raised concern for the public health (van Belkun et al., 1996; Endtz et al., 1997). It is believed it emerged as a result of widespread use of the glycopeptide avoparcin in animal husbandry (Aarestrup, 1995; Klare et al., 1995a, b; Aarestrup et al., 2000). Consequently, avoparcin was banned as a feed additive in Norway and the EU in 1995 and 1997, respectively. For unclear reasons, a VRE reservoir still exists in animal populations in many European countries, more than 20 years after the avoparcin ban. However, the use of polyether ionophores as a feed additive overlapped and/or succeeded the use of avoparcin in poultry feed (Grave et al., 2004; Kaldhusdal et al., 2016). Considering the close association between narasin resistance and vancomycin resistance (Norm/Norm-Vet, 2001\u20132014; SVARM, 2011, 2013) it is possible that the use of narasin (or other polyether ionophores) in animal husbandry has contributed to maintaining the VRE reservoir in animals in Europe. Due to a decision by the Norwegian broiler industry, broilers have been reared without in-feed anticoccidials since 2016. This may have contributed to a dramatic reduction in narasin resistant isolates in broilers in 2018 (Norm/Norm-Vet, 2019). Turkeys on the other hand, still receive in-feed monensin and the proportion of narasin-resistant E. faecium isolates from turkeys remained on a high level in 2018 (Norm/Norm-Vet, 2019). This suggests that monensin promotes persistence of narasin-resistant E. faecium in turkeys and that the narasin resistance mechanism reduces the bacterial susceptibility to monensin. However, although resistance to monensin has been described in the literature (Newbold et al., 1993; Callaway and Russell, 1999; Houlihan and Russell, 2003), cross-resistance between monensin and narasin has not been detected (Butaye et al., 2000). This study characterizes the ABC-type transporter associated with narasin resistance, and demonstrates that it confers resistance to narasin, salinomycin and maduramicin, but not to monensin or selected antimicrobials currently used in human medicine. In addition, we show that polyether ionophores can influence the outcome of horizontal gene transfer of vancomycin resistance determinants, supporting the notion that they can contribute to spread of vancomycin resistance and persistence of VRE in poultry populations.", "Vancomycin resistant E. faecium are a major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide and the incidence of serious infections caused by this opportunistic pathogen increases in many countries (Contreras et al., 2019).

The narAB operon occurs on pVEF3 (Nilsson et al., 2016), a sequenced and partially characterized plasmid from an E. faecium strain isolated from poultry in Norway (Sletvold et al., 2008). Sletvold et al. (2008) cloned a putative ABC-type transporter encoded by an operon located between nucleotides 4658 and 6675 on pVEF3. The authors did not detect activity conferring resistance to any of the 27 tested antimicrobial compounds by this construct in E. faecium. However, the narAB operon of pVEF3 is located between 37290 and 39808 (Sletvold et al., 2008; Nilsson et al., 2016), and this operon was never characterized. A resistance mechanism against a polyether ionophore was identified in 1994 when a genomic library of Streptomyces longisporoflavus was screened in Streptomyces lividans for tetronasin resistance determinants (Linton et al., 1994). This screen identified an operon containing the genes tnrB2 and tnrB3, encoding an ABC-type membrane transporter that might be involved in self-resistance in the tetronasin producing bacterium. The tetronasin resistance mechanism has not been further characterized. Monensin resistance can develop in bacteria upon exposure to the antimicrobial compound (Newbold et al., 1993; Callaway and Russell, 1999; Houlihan and Russell, 2003). Monensin resistance has been attributed to thickening of the cell envelope and appears to be reversible when bacteria are growing in the absence of monensin. So far, monensin resistance has not been linked to a genetic determinant.", "Previous publications report attempts to characterize polyether ionophore resistance mechanisms.

Analyses of the DNA sequences of narA and narB and the corresponding amino acid sequences did not reveal essential differences that could explain the observed differences in narasin susceptibility. Analyses of the upstream regions of narAB from three isolates revealed 20 nucleotide differences that could affect transcription of narAB. In line with this, our transcriptional analysis displayed a trend of higher transcription of narAB in the WT1402 compared to WT1190 and WT2608 and in Tc1402 compared to Tc2608, however, the difference in expression was not statistically significant (Student\u2019s t-test; p > 0.05). We observed a twofold difference in MIC of narasin between Tc1402 and Tc2608. Based on these results, we cannot rule out that differences in the upstream region of narAB affects expression of the resistance mechanism. The difference in MIC of narasin between WT1402 and WT2608 is bigger than the difference in narasin MIC between Tc1402 and Tc2608 suggesting that not only the promoter region, but also the genetic background of the E. faecium strains affect the narasin susceptibility. Interestingly, when the narAB operons of WT1402 and WT2608 were cloned together with the upstream regions into pREG45, the constructs conferred identical narasin susceptibility of SE34. This may indicate that unknown factors on the respective wild type plasmids encoding narAB can influence the susceptibility to narasin.", "The E. faecium isolates included in this study are all positive for the narAB operon, but display different susceptibility to narasin.

In addition, a statistically significant correlation between narasin resistance and bacitracin resistance has been reported (VKM, 2015). However, we clearly show that NarAB does not directly confer resistance to any of the tested clinically used antimicrobials. This indicates that observed epidemiological association between narasin resistance and resistance to clinically used antimicrobials is likely due to co-occurrence of multiple resistance mechanisms in the same isolate. On the other hand, NarAB confer increased tolerance to salinomycin and maduramicin, demonstrating that the resistance mechanism is not specific for narasin. Cross-resistance between narasin and salinomycin has previously been shown in E. faecium isolates from farm animals (Butaye et al., 2000, 2001). Remarkably, NarAB does not affect the susceptibility of E. faecium (SE34) to monensin. This is interesting since surveillance data from NORM-VET demonstrated high prevalence of narasin resistant E. faecium in the Norwegian turkey population that receive monensin, but not narasin as a feed additive (Norm/Norm-Vet, 2019). In addition, we have previously shown that broiler feed, free of antimicrobial compounds significantly reduces the narasin-resistant population of E. faecium compared to narasin containing feed (Simm et al., 2019). This raises the question why narasin-resistant variants constitute a large proportion of the E. faecium population in turkeys, since there does not seem to be an obvious selection pressure.", "It has previously been suggested that narasin resistance could be linked with resistance to medically important antimicrobials (Norm/Norm-Vet, 2001\u20132014; Nilsson et al., 2012, 2016), and a physical linkage between narasin resistance and vancomycin resistance has been demonstrated (Sletvold et al., 2008; Nilsson et al., 2016).

It has also been shown that the resistance mechanisms to narasin and vancomycin can exist on the same plasmids and can be co-transferred between E. faecium strains (Sletvold et al., 2008; Nilsson et al., 2012, 2016). We show that in two of five cases, narasin resistance and vancomycin resistance co-existed in the transconjugants following conjugation between a vancomycin and narasin resistant donor and a vancomycin and narasin susceptible recipient. The resistance profiles of the transconjugants indicate that vancomycin and narasin resistance were co-transferred from VRE isolates to a plasmid-free E. faecium strain (Table 3). However, the recipient background of the transconjugants was not confirmed by molecular methods, which is a weakness of the experiment. Nonetheless, the experiment supports the previous findings that vancomycin and narasin resistance determinants occasionally co-exist on transferrable plasmids (Nilsson et al., 2012), and strengthen the hypothesis that narasin can promote persistence of vancomycin resistance in the E. faecium population (Simm et al., 2019). To further corroborate this notion narasin stimulated the occurrence of vancomycin resistant transconjugants in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 3). Interestingly, this was also the case for salinomycin and maduramicin, but not monensin, indicating that the resistance mechanism NarAB supports horizontal gene transfer under relevant selection pressure. Thereby, the use of in-feed narasin, salinomycin, and maduramicin may not only promote persistence of VRE in the E. faecium population of animals, but also promote dissemination of vancomycin resistance in the gut-microbiota of animals. Considering this, the justification for the widespread use of polyether ionophores as additives in animal feed should be re-evaluated.", "We showed in a previous study that all VRE available in the biobank of the Norwegian Veterinary Institute are also resistant to narasin (Simm et al., 2019).
