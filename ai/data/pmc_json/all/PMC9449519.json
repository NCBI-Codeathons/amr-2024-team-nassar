Infection caused by Alternaria iridiaustralis and 10 other significant fungal diseases can be successfully inhibited by VOCs produced by an identified and screened endophytic strain L1 (Bacillus velezensis). This study revealed the in vivo and in vitro biocontrol effects of VOCs released by B. velezensis L1 on A. iridiaustralis, a pathogenic fungus responsible for rot of wolfberry fruit. The inhibition rates of VOCs of B. velezensis L1 on the mycelial growth of A. iridiaustralis in vitro were 92.86 and 90.30%, respectively, when the initial inoculum concentration on the plate was 1 \u00d7 109 colony forming unit (CFU)/ml. Spore germination and sporulation were 66.89 and 87.96%, respectively. VOCs considerably decreased the wolfberry\u2019s disease index and decay incidence in vivo. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the morphological and structural characteristics of A. iridiaustralis could be altered by VOCs. Ten VOCs were identified through headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry. Pure chemical tests revealed that 2.3-butanedione had the strongest antifungal effects, totally inhibiting A. iridiaustralis in wolfberry fruit at a 60 \u03bcl/L concentration. The theory underpinning the potential application of VOCs from B. velezensis is provided herein. This is also the first study to document the antifungal capabilities of the B. velezensis strain on postharvest wolfberry fruit.", "GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT", "GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L) is gradually becoming one of the most popular functional fruits worldwide as it is rich in nutrients and phytochemicals (Wenli et al., 2021). Wolfberry has anticancer, antioxidant, antiaging, blood sugar control, and immune-enhancing properties. Therefore, this fruit is widely used in food and medicine fields (Zhou et al., 2017; Yajun et al., 2019). However, wolfberry fruit is highly perishable because of its susceptibility to various postharvest pathogenic diseases. Fungal diseases are the main cause of postharvest losses of wolfberry fruits. Particularly, Alternaria sp. are the most common postharvest pathogenic fungi of wolfberry fruits and can significantly reduce the fruit value and shelf life, causing severe economic losses (Yuan et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2017).", "Wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L) is gradually becoming one of the most popular functional fruits worldwide as it is rich in nutrients and phytochemicals (Wenli et al., 2021).

On the other hand, chemical fungicides have a substantial inhibitory effect on pathogenic fungi, but their long-term and large-scale use leads to deposition of residues in the environment and resistance of pathogenic fungi (Mari et al., 2016).

Arrarte et al. (2017) revealed that VOCs released by Candida sake can control decay of apples caused by postharvest pathogens. Similarly, Oro et al. (2018) found that VOCs from Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae can inhibit pathogenic fungi that cause rot in strawberries and control postharvest diseases.

(2018), VOCs from the B. velezensis strain may prevent sporulation of B. cinerea in peppers. This agrees with the findings obtained for B. velezensis L1. Additionally, the regrowth of A. iridiaustralis was reduced by the VOCs from B. velezensis L1. The effects of VOCs on B. cinerea were comparable to those of Pseudomonas fluorescens ZX (Zhong et al., 2021). This might be because VOCs disrupt the pathogenic fungi\u2019s natural morphological structure and interfere with their normal proliferation. However, the damage appears to be lost with a reduction in VOC concentration, possibly because of the robust recovery and reproductive capacity of the fungi. According to SEM analysis, the VOCs from B. velezensis L1 can severely damage the morphology of A. iridiaustralis.

Calvo et al. (2020) reported that the B. velezensis strain inhibits mycelial growth and sporulation and is not pathogenic to humans after use. However, the VOCs concentration was not considered in their study. Myo et al.

The effect of VOC concentrations on the prevention, occurrence, and severity of diseases is of great value for the postharvest preservation of fruits and vegetables (Sharifi and Ryu, 2016). These concentrations were influenced by different numbers of LB plates. With an increase in concentration, the disease status of wolfberry fruits inoculated with the pathogenic fungus A. iridiaustralis changed significantly. Wang et al. (2021c) also confirmed that a certain concentration of VOCs produced by P. fluorescens ZX can significantly control gray mold in citrus and inhibit decay development. When VOCs reach a certain concentration, the growth of pathogenic fungi in fruits is completely inhibited, resulting in the best control effect. This suggests that it is entirely feasible to utilize VOCs produced by antagonistic microorganisms as potential BCAs. More importantly, VOCs also have an excellent control effect on fruits that rot naturally after harvest, inhibited all pathogenic fungi that caused the disease, which greatly prolongs the storage time of wolfberry.

Among the components identified, 2,3-butanedione had the strongest inhibitory effect on pathogenic fungi both in vitro and in vivo. 2,3-Butanedione could reduce the rot disease index of wolfberry fruit.

(2021) showed that 2,3-butanedione had the strongest inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth of F. verticillioides. 2,3-Butanedione is a naturally occurring, safe and edible volatile alpha-diketone often used in food additives and flavors because of its good flavor. Pathogenic fungi are very sensitive to even very low concentrations of VOC, and therefore, this VOC is considered a promising compound for postharvest preservation (Zheng et al., 2020). 2-Pentanone, 2-heptanone, and acetoin are the most common and abundant VOCs in many strains (Wu et al., 2015; Lazazzara et al., 2021). As observed in our study, they have little impact on the hyphal development of pathogenic fungi. However, VOCs are usually complex in composition, and their inhibitory effects often do not depend on a single active ingredient (Wang et al., 2021c). Few studies have investigated the optimal application and activity of the combination of VOC. Thus, whether the main components in these VOCs are synergistically involved in the antifungal effect deserves further investigation. 1-Hydroxy-2-propanone, cyclohexanone, methyl 2-methylbutanoate, 2-pentylfuran and 2-methylpropyl butan were found to be produced by the B. velezensis strain for the first time. However, they showed no antifungal activity against A. iridiaustralis in the tests.
