["Many Bacillus species are essential antibacterial agents, but their antibiosis potential still needs to be elucidated to its full extent. Here, we isolated a soil bacterium, BP9, which has significant antibiosis activity against fungal and bacterial pathogens. BP9 improved the growth of wheat seedlings via active colonization and demonstrated effective biofilm and swarming activity. BP9 sequenced genome contains 4282 genes with a mean G-C content of 45.94% of the whole genome. A single copy concatenated 802 core genes of 28 genomes, and their calculated average nucleotide identity (ANI) discriminated the strain BP9 from Bacillus licheniformis and classified it as Bacillus paralicheniformis. Furthermore, a comparative pan-genome analysis of 40 B. paralicheniformis strains suggested that the genetic repertoire of BP9 belongs to open-type genome species. A comparative analysis of a pan-genome dataset using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Cluster of Orthologous Gene groups (COG) revealed the diversity of secondary metabolic pathways, where BP9 distinguishes itself by exhibiting a greater prevalence of loci associated with the metabolism and transportation of organic and inorganic substances, carbohydrate and amino acid for effective inhabitation in diverse environments. The primary secondary metabolites and their genes involved in synthesizing bacillibactin, fencing, bacitracin, and lantibiotics were identified as acquired through a recent Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event, which contributes to a significant part of the strain`s antimicrobial potential. Finally, we report some genes essential for plant-host interaction identified in BP9, which reduce spore germination and virulence of multiple fungal and bacterial species. The effective colonization, diverse predicted metabolic pathways and secondary metabolites (antibiotics) suggest testing the suitability of strain BP9 as a potential bio-preparation in agricultural fields.", "Graphical Abstract", "ga1", "ga1", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Bacillus strains are a widespread clade of bacteria inhabiting diverse niches and could be isolated e.g., from soil, water, plant rhizosphere, mammals, and humans [1].

Formula 2 of the GGDC is the only function appropriate to analyze draft genomes and further delineate the species level based on dDDH. The type strain genome server (TYGS) pipeline was used according to the default parameters [65], [66]. The threshold value over 70% indicates that the strains are similar. The obtained dDDH and ANI values are listed in Table S7. The BP9 genome showed a dDDH of 57% with DSM-13/ATCC-14580 genome, a value lower than the threshold, but 92.6% with type strain KJ-16, suggesting the BP9 strain belonged to the paralicheniformis group. The calculated ANI values of BP9 with KJ-16 using ANIb and FastANI also revealed 98.90% and 98.91% identity, respectively, further proving the results obtained from different sources for identification (Table S7).", "A phylogenetic tree for delineation of B. paralicheniformis BP9 was constructed using the maximum likelihood (mL) method containing 28 Bacillus species, including six B. licheniformis and seven B. paralicheniformis strains with Paenbacillus polymyxa M1 as outgroup.

Furthermore, we calculated the average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of different strains using JSpecies [33] to confirm the findings from phylogenetic analysis. The results revealed two distinct groups of selected B. licheniformis and B. paralicheniformis strains indicated in red, showing 100% identity with their respective group. Based on ANI data, Bacillus subtilis, and other strains were also separated into distinct clades as indicated by the heatmap (Fig. 4 B), and strains with ANI values >\u200995% are considered the same species [33].

The PHI-base blast results revealed 724 genes interacting with variable fungal or bacterial strains, including some tested in Fig. 1. BP9 is necessary for host-pathogen interaction in monocot and eudicot plant hosts. Seventy-five genes for host-pathogen interaction were identified in BP9 regarding monocot hosts, while 85 genes were found for the eudicots. BP9 can use these proteins to interact, resulting in reduced virulence or spore germination with the respective pathogens (Fig. 8). In monocots, relevant pathogens like Parastagonospora nodorum, Fusarium proliferatum, Magnaporthe oryzae, and Xanthomonas oryzae could be influenced by those 75 specific genetic determinants (proteins) in BP9. Among eudicots hosts, important pathogens like Botrytis cinerea, P. aeruginosa, P. syringae, Salmonella enterica, Dickeya dadantii, Ralstonia solanacearum, Pseudomonas victoria, Erwinia amylovora, and Xanthomonas campestris will be affected resulting in reduced spore germination and virulence during interaction with BP9 (Fig. 8). These plant host interaction (PHI) proteins could particularly impede the virulence and pathogenicity. However, identified genes (proteins) for primates and rodent-related pathogens indicate that a probiotic effect might also exist against several human pathogens (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Multiple genes identified in BP9 provide resistance against plant pathogens potentially susceptible based on putative antibiotic pathways.

The significant antimicrobial activity against different fungal pathogens, especially Conellia sp., Phytophthora, and Botrytis sp., indicates that the BP9 contains diverse secondary metabolites to suppress pathogenic fungi of the different phyla. The Gram-negative P. syringae (Pst-DC3000) was also inhibited, suggesting that BP9 is equally effective against bacterial pathogens of different types and its potential application in disease suppression. Some tested PGPR characters, including siderophore, EPS, protease casein degradation, and catalase, were consistent with previous studies [22], indicating the significant ability of the paralicheniformis strain to produce multiple compounds during the interaction, which is also necessary for its adaptation. Besides the strain BP9, B. paraliceniformis Bac84 was also reported to possess peptides capable of inhibiting Pseudomonas syringae, Staphylococcus sp, Clostridium sp., Listeria sp., and Salmonella sp. strains [75], [76].", "This study underpins the antibiosis activity of B. paralicheniformis BP9 invitro against fungi and bacteria.

However, the more accurate the phylogenetic reconstruction, the more genetic data like genome sequence to separate groups. The inter-species phylogenetic cohesion of a group such as Bacillus was examined using 802 concatenated core genes. This analysis allowed for the discrimination between B. licheniformis and B. paralicheniformis, ultimately classifying the BP9 into the paralicheniformis group. In addition, the silicon investigations suggest that the BP9 strain has undergone explicit evolutionary adaptations under selective pressures. Although the phylogenetic analysis does not separate the strains based on habitat, the identified exchanged fragments (genes) during adaptation indicate their co-evolution with plants, plant-pathogenic bacteria, and fungi [79]. The unique phage-related genes, IS elements, transposases, lyases, phosphatases, and Type II and VII (Esat/EssB) secretion systems in BP9 reflect the effective adaptation in various niches and discriminate it from other strains (Fig. 5B). The presence of the plant peptides class of compounds contributes to the significant antagonistic activity of such strains for such a range of pathogenic microbes [74], [80], [81], [82]. Siderophore biosynthesis makes the BP9 strain competitive in iron-scarce conditions, improving the strain's fitness capacity. The identified genes of phages help transmit antibiotic resistance and virulence genes by inserting their genome into the host DNA, hence playing a significant role in bacterial evolution [56]. They may also become lysogens by reproducing themself and killing their temporary host organism.
