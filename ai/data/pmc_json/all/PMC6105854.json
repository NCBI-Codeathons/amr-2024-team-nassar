Analysis of the tunicamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chartreusis reveals new insights into tunicamycin production and immunity. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 62:e00130-18. https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.00130-18.", "ABSTRACT", "The tunicamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chartreusis consists of 14 genes (tunA to tunN) with a high degree of apparent translational coupling. Transcriptional analysis revealed that all of these genes are likely to be transcribed as a single operon from two promoters, tunp1 and tunp2. In-frame deletion analysis revealed that just six of these genes (tunABCDEH) are essential for tunicamycin production in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor, while five (tunFGKLN) with likely counterparts in primary metabolism are not necessary, but presumably ensure efficient production of the antibiotic at the onset of tunicamycin biosynthesis. Three genes are implicated in immunity, namely, tunI and tunJ, which encode a two-component ABC transporter presumably required for export of the antibiotic, and tunM, which encodes a putative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase. Expression of tunIJ or tunM in S. coelicolor conferred resistance to exogenous tunicamycin. The results presented here provide new insights into tunicamycin biosynthesis and immunity.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "The tunicamycins are fatty acyl nucleoside antibiotics produced by several actinomycetes, mostly Streptomyces species, including Streptomyces chartreusis (1, 2). They consist of a unique 11-carbon core (tunicamine) decorated with uracil, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and variable fatty acyl moieties (Fig. 1). They are potent inhibitors of cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria, where they target MraY, which is required for the production of the peptidoglycan precursor Lipid I (3, 4), and TarO, MnaA, and Cap5P, which are involved in teichoic acid biosynthesis (5). They also inhibit protein N-glycosylation in eukaryotes (6), targeting dolichyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetyl-glucosaminyl-phosphotransferase (DPAGT1, also known as GlcNAc-1-P transferase) and resulting in severe toxicity. While the bacterial (e.g., MraY) and human (DPAGT1) targets are similar, in principle, it may be possible to design tunicamycin variants that specifically inhibit the bacterial proteins. A better understanding of tunicamycin biosynthesis and of the genes responsible for the individual steps in its production could play an important role in the delivery of such analogues. In an earlier work, we cloned and sequenced the tunicamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (tun) from S. chartreusis, expressed it heterologously in Streptomyces coelicolor, and proposed a biosynthetic pathway based largely on homology of the encoded gene products with proteins of known function (7). The cluster contains 14 genes, tunA to tunN, with many apparently translationally coupled to the preceding gene (Fig. 1). Subsequent in vitro studies of TunA and TunF combined with the deletion of tunB provided experimental evidence for their specific roles in tunicamycin biosynthesis (8). Here, we report mutational analyses of the other 13 genes in the tun cluster, which, together with transcriptional characterizations, provide new insights into tunicamycin biosynthesis and immunity.", "The tunicamycins are fatty acyl nucleoside antibiotics produced by several actinomycetes, mostly Streptomyces species, including Streptomyces chartreusis (1, 2).

Of the others, tunFGKLN all have putative roles also carried out by homologues involved in primary metabolism, potentially explaining their nonessentiality. This would require that the primary metabolic enzymes were capable of substituting for their Tun counterparts if the latter were indeed present in the hypothetical tunicamycin biosynthetic complex (see above); alternatively, the complex might only contain the essential enzymes, TunABCDEH. The presence of tunFGKLN within the tun gene cluster may be to ensure adequate precursor supply and/or flux at the onset of tunicamycin production, feeding the likely critical C-C bond-forming step (tunFGN) and efficient acylation from the endogenous fatty acid pool during biosynthesis (tunKL) (see Fig. 7 and references 7, 8 for a detailed discussion of tunicamycin biosynthesis). Indeed, deletion of tunF, tunG, or tunK resulted in a reproducible reduction in antibiotic activity (Fig. 4). The ability of the tunL mutant clone to produce tunicamycin in S. coelicolor M1152 contrasts with the results reported by Chen et al. (12), where tunicamycin production was abolished when a tunL-deleted gene cluster was introduced into Streptomyces lividans TK24. However, since TunL is a putative phospholipid phosphatase with homologues encoded by the S. coelicolor genome (e.g., SCO1102 and SCO0402) that are likely involved in primary metabolism, it is conceivable that this disparity reflects differences in the heterologous hosts and growth conditions used in the two studies. Given the very low level of tunicamycin production in the tunF mutant, it is also possible that a homologous host epimerase (e.g., SCO3137 and/or SCO2988) is responsible for partial suppression of tunF oblation. The deletion analysis reported here rules out the previously assigned role for TunM in tunicamycin biosynthesis (8). However, the ability of tunM to confer resistance to tunicamycin in S. coelicolor, and the increased levels of tunicamycin susceptibility observed after deletion of tunM from the tun gene cluster in S. coelicolor, suggest that it may instead play a role in immunity in the producing organism. Intriguingly, TunM encodes a putative SAM-dependent methyltransferase and, although unprecedented to our knowledge, it is conceivable that it mediates its effect by modification of intracellular tunicamycin to provide an immunity mechanism, although such a nonreversible modification would require a corresponding demethylation for activation, perhaps after export. Conceivably, such demethylation enzymes might exist in the natural host's key target organisms. Alternatively, self-resistance might be mediated by methylation of endogenous enzyme (or other molecular) targets of the antibiotic (or indeed by modification of one of their substrates in a manner that would afford sufficient substrate protection to prevent tunicamycin from binding to any corresponding complex).", "The deletion analysis reported here and previously (8) has demonstrated that of the 14 genes contained within the tun gene cluster just six (tunABCDEH) are essential for tunicamycin production in S. coelicolor, each of which can be assigned a likely biosynthetic role Fig. 7) (7, 8), while tunI and tunJ are required for immunity.
