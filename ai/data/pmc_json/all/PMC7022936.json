["Gliotoxin is an important epipolythiodioxopiperazine, which was biosynthesized by the gli gene cluster in Aspergillus genus. However, the regulatory mechanism of gliotoxin biosynthesis remains unclear. In this study, a novel Zn2Cys6 transcription factor DcGliZ that is responsible for the regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis from the deep-sea-derived fungus Dichotomomyces cejpii was identified. DcGliZ was expressed in Escherichia coli and effectively purified from inclusion bodies by refolding. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that purified DcGliZ can bind to gliG, gliM, and gliN promoter regions in the gli cluster. Furthermore, the binding kinetics and affinity of DcGliZ protein with different promoters were measured by surface plasmon resonance assays, and the results demonstrated the significant interaction of DcGliZ with the gliG, gliM, and gliN promoters. These new findings would lay the foundation for the elucidation of future gliotoxin biosynthetic regulation mechanisms in D. cejpii.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Marine-derived fungi can produce diverse natural products with different bioactives and have become a more and more important resource of leading compounds over the past years [1]. Diketopiperazine derivatives show a wide range of biological activities, including antiviral, antituberculosis, anticancer, and antibacterial activities [2,3]. Plinabulin, a synthetic diketopiperazine analogue derived from marine fungus Aspergillus sp. CNC-139, has entered phase III clinical studies for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, indicating the bright prospect of gliotoxin derivatives in drug development [4,5,6]. Gliotoxin, derived from fungi, is a typical epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) toxin with a disulphide-bridged cyclic dipeptide, and is responsible for the cytotoxicity [7,8]. Moreover, gliotoxins and their derivates can utilize the disulfide bond of ETP compounds to mediate redox homeostasis or the modification of proteins, including nuclear factor-kB, triphosphopyridine nucleotide (NADPH) oxidase, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase, and glutaredoxin [9]. In addition to the diverse extraordinary structures and bioactivities of gliotoxins, the biosynthesis pathways of gliotoxins and relevant genes have been identified in Aspergillus fumigatus, which would provide theoretical guidance for multiple functional genomic studies in other fungi [8,9].", "Marine-derived fungi can produce diverse natural products with different bioactives and have become a more and more important resource of leading compounds over the past years [1].

The non-ribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by gliP gene catalyzes diketopiperazine scaffold formation, the first biosynthetic reaction in a gliotoxin biosynthesis pathway [10]. Subsequently, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase encoded by gliC catalyzes the hydroxylation at the \u03b1-carbon of L-Phe [11]. Then, glutathione S-transferase (GST) encoded by the gliG promotes the sulfurization of gliotoxin biosynthetic imtermediates; GST is known for its ability in the catalyzation of carbon\u2013sulfur bond formation, as opposed to detoxification [12,13]. After the process by the enzymes of GliK and GliJ, the \u03b3-glutamyl moieties are removed [14,15]. The carbon\u2013sulfur lyase expressed by the gliI gene then catalyzes the intermediate to generate a notorious epidithiol moiety [16]. After the catalysis of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (GliF or GliC) and GliH (function remains elusive), the N-methyltransferase encoded by gliN or gliM functions as a freestanding amide to promote amide methylation and confer stability on ETP [17,18]. Finally, the oxidoreductase GliT-mediated disulfide bridge closure might be a prerequisite for the formation of gliotoxins, and the major facilitator superfamily transporter GliA also plays an important role in exporting the toxins to prevent the harmful effect of gliotoxin on hosts [9,19].", "The putative gene cluster (gli) of gliotoxin is composed of 13 genes that encode crucial enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of various gliotoxins and their derivatives in A. fumigatus [9].

GtmA (or termed TtmA) is encoded outside the gli cluster and functions as a bis-thiomethyl transferase for the conversion of dithiogliotoxin to bisdethiobis (methylthio) gliotoxin (BmGT), which mainly attenuates the formation of disulfide bridge closure [20]. Other non-gli clusters encoding transcription factors, including the global regulator laeA, C2H2 regulator mtfA, bZIP transcription factor rsmA, and APSES family transcription factor stuA, can regulate the biosynthesis of gliotoxins and their derivatives to some extent [9]. The critical transcription factor GliZ encoded by the gliZ gene in the gli cluster is a sequence-specific DNA-binding binuclear zinc cluster (Zn2Cys6) protein, which is uniquely found in fungi. GliZ is a positive regulator that is indispensable in the gliotoxin biosynthesis [21]. Moreover, the overexpression of the gliZ gene leads to the accumulation of gliotoxins and their derivatives, and the gliZ deletion impedes the production of gliotoxins. The binding site (TCGGN3CCGA) of GliZ is usually located within the promoter region of the gli cluster [7,21,22,23]. Although the regulatory function of gliZ has been preliminarily demonstrated through in vivo experiments, the specific promoter and the evaluation of binding affinities between gli gene promoters and GliZ remain obscure.

Thus, the 3D structure of Zn2Cys6 was modeled using SWISS-MODEL and PyMol for understanding the binding mechanism. Although the function of GliZ has been identified by the deletion or overexpression of gliZ gene for the mediation of gliotoxin production in vivo [21], the specific binding site in the promoter region of the gli cluster genes remains obscure.
