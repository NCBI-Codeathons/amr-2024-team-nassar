["Abstract", "The ongoing arms race between bacteria and phages has forced bacteria to evolve a sophisticated set of antiphage defense mechanisms that constitute the bacterial immune system. In our previous study, we highlighted the antiphage properties of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are naturally secreted by Streptomyces. Successful inhibition of phage infection was achieved by addition of pure compounds and supernatants from a natural producer strain emphasizing the potential for community-wide antiphage defense. However, given the dual functionality of these compounds, neighboring bacterial cells require resistance to the antibacterial activity of aminoglycosides to benefit from the protection they confer against phages. In this study, we tested a variety of different aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms acting via drug or target (16S rRNA) modification and demonstrated that they do not interfere with the antiphage properties of the molecules. Furthermore, we confirmed the antiphage impact of aminoglycosides in a community context by coculturing phage-susceptible, apramycin-resistant Streptomyces venezuelae with the apramycin-producing strain Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. Given the prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance among natural bacterial isolates, this study highlights the ecological relevance of chemical defense via aminoglycosides at the community level.", "In this study, we showed that various aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms do not affect the antiphage properties of these molecules and highlighted the ecological relevance of aminoglycoside-mediated defense in bacterial communities by coculturing phage-susceptible, apramycin-resistant Streptomyces venezuelae with apramycin-producing Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Owing to the constant threat of viral predation exerted by bacteriophages (or phages), bacteria have evolved an extensive repertoire of antiphage defense mechanisms. In recent years, advancements in high-throughput bioinformatics and experimental approaches have expanded our understanding of bacterial antiphage defense to over a hundred different systems, unveiling an unexpectedly rich portfolio of systems and mechanisms (Georjon and Bernheim 2023). While previous knowledge of antiphage mechanisms was largely confined to restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas systems targeting invading nucleic acids, recent discoveries have exposed remarkably intricate bacterial immune strategies. These include systems that rely on intracellular signal transduction facilitated by cyclic (oligo-)nucleotides and systems recognizing conserved structural patterns in viral proteins or RNAs to initiate immune responses (Cohen et\u00a0al. 2019, Ofir et\u00a0al. 2021, Tal et\u00a0al. 2021, Gao et\u00a0al. 2022, Tal and Sorek 2022). Recent studies also revealed several mechanisms that are shared among cells within a microbial community. These communal defenses encompass the extrusion of membrane vesicles serving as a phage decoy, quorum sensing-based activation of defense systems, biofilm formation, and secretion of antiphage small molecules (Luthe et\u00a0al. 2023).", "Owing to the constant threat of viral predation exerted by bacteriophages (or phages), bacteria have evolved an extensive repertoire of antiphage defense mechanisms.

The natural producers usually possess self-resistance mechanisms to prevent autotoxicity (Hopwood 2007), thereby conferring them a fitness advantage over other microorganisms (Tyc et\u00a0al. 2017). Shortly after their discovery, bacterial secondary metabolites emerged as a pivotal breakthrough to combat bacterial and fungal infections or applications in chemotherapy (Al-Shaibani et\u00a0al. 2021). Their production is usually closely linked to the multicellular life cycle of Streptomyces. When conditions are favorable, spores germinate and develop into a vegetative mycelium in response to adverse conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, Streptomyces sacrifices parts of this vegetative mycelium via programmed cell death, supplying nutrients for the erection of aerial hyphae, which further differentiate into chains of spores. Typically, this developmental switch to reproductive growth aligns with the onset of secondary metabolite production, presumably to protect released nutrients from competing soil organisms (Fl\u00e4rdh and Buttner 2009, McCormick and Fl\u00e4rdh 2012, Schlimpert and Elliot 2023). Interestingly, recent studies indicate that bacterial small molecules also exhibit antiphage activity (Hardy et\u00a0al. 2023). The Streptomyces-derived, naturally secreted anthracyclines doxo- and daunorubicin, which are primarily recognized as anticancer drugs, have been shown to efficiently inhibit infection of dsDNA phages, presumably by specifically intercalating into phage DNA (Kronheim et\u00a0al. 2018). In our previous report, we expanded the repertoire of known antiphage molecule classes by demonstrating the antiphage properties of aminoglycoside antibiotics in widely divergent bacterial hosts (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022, Hardy et\u00a0al. 2023).", "Soil-dwelling bacteria of the genus Streptomyces are sophisticated producers of bioactive compounds endowed with antibacterial, antifungal, or even anticancer properties (Barka et\u00a0al. 2016).

While different aminoglycosides exhibit varying specificity for distinct regions on the ribosomal A-site, they all induce a conformational change leading to the promotion of mistranslation by inducing codon misreading upon the delivery of aminoacyl transfer RNA. Despite the initial recognition of their antiphage properties as early as the 1960s (Brock et\u00a0al. 1963, Schindler 1964, Bowman 1967), the exploration of these features in the context of bacterial antiphage immunity was not further pursued. In-depth analysis of this observation using aminoglycoside-resistant strains revealed a strong inhibition of phage infection by addition of pure apramycin as well culture supernatant (=spent medium) of the natural apramycin producer Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius (suborder Pseudonocardineae, order Actinomycetales) (Tamura et\u00a0al. 2008), hinting toward an ecological relevance of such chemically mediated antiphage defense via aminoglycosides. Their secretion into the environment could create an antiviral microenvironment, thereby providing a chemical defense against phages at the community level (Hardy et\u00a0al. 2023, Luthe et\u00a0al. 2023). However, in order to benefit from this, neighboring cells or mycelial structures must possess resistance mechanisms to counteract the antibacterial impact of the compound without abolishing the antiphage effect. For aminoglycosides, three main resistance mechanisms are currently known including aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AME) for drug modification, 16S rRNA methyltransferases for target site modification, and increased export or decreased uptake (Garneau-Tsodikova and Labby 2016).

In a previous study, we showed the inhibition of phage infection for a broad range of aminoglycoside antibiotics by using strains resistant to the respective molecules (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022). In case of the used model aminoglycoside apramycin belonging to the subclass of aminoglycosides with mono-substituted 2-desoxystreptamin (2-DOS) ring (Krause et\u00a0al. 2016), this resistance mechanism relied on the acetylation of the 3\u2032 amino group of the 2-desoxystreptamin ring via aminoglycoside N(3)\u2010acetyltransferase AAC(3)-IVa (Magalhaes and Blanchard 2005) (Fig.\u00a01A).

Supplementing of S. tenebrarius \u0394aprD4 spent medium to infection assays of the apramycin-resistant S. venezuelae strain carrying the methyltransferase KamB showed a similar extent of phage inhibition than the wild type spent medium.

Contrary to this, deletion of aprU encoding an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and deletion of aprP encoding a putative creatinine amidohydrolase showed comparable amplification kinetics than the control infection without any supplementation, although slightly lower maximal phage titers were detected.

Natural ecosystems are considered to harbor a reservoir of antibiotic resistances genes, stemming from both, anthropogenic transfer of antibiotics and resistance genes as well as the presence of natural aminoglycoside producers such as Streptomyces and Micromonospora spp. residing in soil (Tripathi and Cytryn 2017, Durand et\u00a0al. 2019). Gene transfer events are facilitated by the frequent localization of such resistance genes on mobile genetic elements, allowing broadening of the resistance spectrum (Pradier and Bedhomme 2023). Given the molecular versatility of aminoglycosides confirmed in this study, the acquisition of resistance becomes not only advantageous as defense against the chemical warfare exerted by the secretion of aminoglycosides, but could ensure concurrent protection from phages as already discussed in our previous review article (Hardy et\u00a0al. 2023). The prevalence of aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria in natural habitats puts further emphasis on the ecological significance of such chemical antiphage defense. However, taken into account the predominance of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations and the existence of local extremes in the soil environment (Fajardo et\u00a0al. 2009), one can infer that such community-wide antiphage defense is constrained to mutualistic interactions within the genetic kin or between different species. The latter is thought to be facilitated by increased horizontal gene transfer events of aminoglycoside resistance genes in the presence of low antibiotic concentrations (Cairns et\u00a0al. 2018). Overall, this would add to the notion of the pan-immune system describing antiphage defense as a shared community resource (Bernheim and Sorek 2020).", "As recently demonstrated by Pradier and Bedhomme (2023), aminoglycoside-resistance genes are widely distributed among all biomes, with the soil playing a pivotal role in AME gene transfer events. Natural ecosystems are considered to harbor a reservoir of antibiotic resistances genes, stemming from both, anthropogenic transfer of antibiotics and resistance genes as well as the presence of natural aminoglycoside producers such as Streptomyces and Micromonospora spp. residing in soil (Tripathi and Cytryn 2017, Durand et\u00a0al. 2019).

Antibiotic production is typically linked to the morphological differentiation to aerial mycelium in order to protect released nutrients of sacrificed mycelial parts from other terrestrial competitors (Bibb 2005, van der Meij et\u00a0al. 2017). To enhance colony-wide fitness, this antibiotic production can be coordinated by a division of labor, involving the differentiation into an altruistic subpopulation specialized in antibiotic production (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2020, Zhang et\u00a0al. 2022), which in turn is facilitated by the genomic instability of Streptomyces at the chromosomal arms (Bentley et\u00a0al. 2002, Thibessard and Leblond 2014). Given the clonal nature of the Streptomyces colonies, secretion of aminoglycosides might play a pivotal role in shielding susceptible segments of the colony against both bacterial competitors and phage predation.", "An additional aspect, which reinforces the role of aminoglycosides as \u201cpublic goods\u201d in antiphage defense, is the natural growth phenotype as well as the temporal onset and organization of antibiotic production in Streptomyces spp. These multicellular growing microorganisms are characterized by a complex developmental program, starting with the germination of a spore and the establishment of a vegetative mycelium, which further develops into aerial hyphae and spores upon nutrient depletion (Bush et\u00a0al. 2015, Schlimpert and Elliot 2023).

According to assays with the different S. tenebrarius mutant strains and purified apramycin biosynthetic intermediates, the antiphage effect occurred at a late step of the biosynthetic pathway (Fig.\u00a03). This could be due to either differences in the intracellular interaction with phage amplification or in the uptake of the respective molecules. Modification via acetylation or phosphorylation reduces the amount of positively charged amino groups at neutral pH or even adds a negative charge to the cationic aminoglycosides, which could affect their interaction with the negatively charged components of the bacterial surface for uptake (Taber et\u00a0al. 1987). In the case of the in vitro acetylated apramycin, the interference with phage infection was less pronounced in the early stages of infection, but comparable to the in vivo modification in the long-term, supporting the hypothesis of a reduced uptake of the molecules when modified in vitro. The same could apply to the phosphorylated apramycin accumulating in the \u0394aprZ mutant, possibly explaining the delayed phage-inhibiting effect. These considerations highlight the importance of discriminating between differences in molecule uptake and a potential antiphage property exerted at the intracellular level (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022). As discussed previously, investigations into the mechanism of action suggest that the inhibition of phage infection occurs early, between the injection and replication stages. While the precise molecular target remains unclear, it may involve direct targeting of the injected, yet unreplicated, phage DNA and/or interference with the phage DNA injection process (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022). Aminoglycosides are known to bind to the bacterial cell membrane and subsequently accumulate within the cell via electron-transport mediated processes, EDPI and EDPII (Krause et\u00a0al. 2016). Using fluorescently labeled antibiotics, the membrane-bound and EDPII elements were shown to constitute a substantial proportion of the overall fluorescence levels tightly bound to E. coli cells (Sabeti Azad et\u00a0al. 2020). In cells expressing resistance genes, one could reasonably expect to predominantly encounter the membrane-bound fraction of aminoglycosides. This anticipation stems from the premise that the disruption of membrane integrity and the subsequent diffusive entry of the drug, typically induced by mistranslated proteins during EDPII, might not occur in the presence of resistance mechanisms.", "In addition to the ecological relevance, this study provides structural insights into the antiphage effect of these compounds.

Although the clinical use of aminoglycosides declined with the introduction of other classes of antibiotics such as cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, the global spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens has led to a renewed demand for this class of antibiotics, frequently for combinatory treatments (Krause et\u00a0al. 2016).
