["(Contributed by Teruhiko Beppu, m.j.a.)", "Streptomyces griseus, a well-known industrial producer of streptomycin, is a member of the genus Streptomyces, which shows a complex life cycle resembling that of fungi. A-factor, a C13\u03b3-butyrolactone compound, was discovered as a self-regulatory factor or a bacterial hormone to induce morphological differentiation and production of secondary metabolites, including streptomycin, in this organism. Accumulating evidence has revealed an A-factor-triggered signal cascade, which is composed of several key steps or components. These include: (i) AfsA catalyzing a crucial step of A-factor biosynthesis, (ii) the A-factor-specific receptor (ArpA), which acts as a transcriptional repressor for adpA, (iii) adpA, a sole target of ArpA, which encodes a global transcriptional activator AdpA, and (iv) a variety of members of the AdpA regulon, a set of the genes regulated by AdpA. A-factor is biosynthesized via five reaction steps, in which AfsA catalyzes acyl transfer between a \u03b2-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein and the hydroxyl group of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The receptor ArpA, belonging to the TetR family, is a homodimer, each subunit of which contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and an A-factor-binding pocket. The three-dimensional structure and conformational change upon binding A-factor are elucidated, on the basis of X-ray crystallography of CprB, an ArpA homologue. AdpA, belonging to the AraC/XylS transcriptional activator family, binds operators upstream from the promoters of a variety of the target genes and activates their transcription, thus forming the AdpA regulon. Members of the AdpA regulon includes the pathway-specific transcriptional activator gene strR that activates the whole streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster, in addition to a number of genes that direct the multiple cellular functions required for cellular differentiation in a concerted manner. A variety of A-factor homologues as well as homologues of afsA/arpA are distributed widely among Streptomyces, indicating the significant role of this type of molecular signaling in the ecosystem and evolutional processes.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The Gram-positive, soil-inhabiting, filamentous bacterial genus Streptomyces shows a characteristic life cycle with complex morphological development resembling that of filamentous fungi.

By using the chemically synthesized optically active 3R-form of tritium-labeled A-factor, a specific binding protein was identified in the cytoplasmic fraction of S. griseus.30) The protein, named ArpA, binds A-factor in the molar ratio of 1:1 with a dissociation constant, Kd, of 0.7 nM. The small Kd value is consistent with the effective concentration of A-factor in vivo (10\u22129 M) and comparable to those of eukaryotic hormone receptors. Involvement of the binding protein in the A-factor signal transduction as an A-factor receptor was suggested by properties of a mutant, S. griseus 2247, deficient in the A-factor binding activity, in which both streptomycin production and sporulation were markedly higher than those of the parental strain.31) Although a receptor-negative mutant had initially been expected to show loss of these phenotypes, the observed positive effects of the mutation apparently implied that the binding protein did work as a receptor in a negative manner or as a repressor responding to A-factor. The assumption turned out to be true; ArpA binds the promoter region of the target gene (later identified as adpA) and represses its transcription in the early growth stage when the concentration of A-factor is still low. When A-factor reaches a critical concentration, it binds the ArpA that has bound the promoter of adpA and dissociates the ArpA from the DNA to switch on expression of the necessary functions for cellular differentiation. Intracellular localization of AfsA suggests that A-factor diffuses freely through the membrane to induce signal transduction.", "ArpA was purified from a cell-lysate of S. griseus, and on the basis of its partial amino acid sequence, the arpA gene, encoding a 276-amino-acid protein with a calculated Mr of 29.1 kDa, was cloned.13) The A-factor-binding activity was observed with a homodimer of ArpA. The N-terminal portion of the protein contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, which suggests that it exerts its regulatory function for the various phenotypes by directly binding to a certain DNA sequence(s) in a key gene(s). Oligonucleotides specifically bound by ArpA were selected from a pool of chemically synthesized random-sequence oligonucleotides by rounds of a binding/immuno-precipitation/amplification procedure or SELEX by using histidine-tagged ArpA and anti-ArpA antibody.

In vitro experiments with the consensus binding site showed that ArpA binds the target site in the absence of A-factor, and does not bind the target in the presence of A-factor at concentrations more than 32 nM.32) In addition, exogenous addition of A-factor to the ArpA-DNA complex caused immediate dissociation of ArpA from the DNA.", "ArpA was purified from a cell-lysate of S. griseus, and on the basis of its partial amino acid sequence, the arpA gene, encoding a 276-amino-acid protein with a calculated Mr of 29.1 kDa, was cloned.13) The A-factor-binding activity was observed with a homodimer of ArpA.

This is a famous mechanism, in which conformational changes of mRNA to disclose a ribosome-binding site and the initiation codon determine the translational level of gene expression of the MLS resistance gene. He got a position as Assistant Professor at Department of Agricultural Chemistry, The University of Tokyo in 1981, where he was further promoted as Associate Professor in 1987 and Professor in 1994. He was Director of the Biotechnology Research Center of The University of Tokyo from 2003 to 2005. His research field has been microbial biotechnology, especially focusing on the regulation and application of antibiotic production by actinomycetes. He has served as President of the Society for Actinomycetes, Japan since 2004. He was awarded the Sumiki-Umezawa Memorial Award in 1991, the Society for Actinomycetes, Japan Award in 1993, the Kei Arima Memorial Award from the Japan Bioindustry Association in 2004, and the Japan Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry Society Award in 2006.", "", "Profile", "Teruhiko Beppu was born in 1934 in Tokyo.

His research activity during this period covered rather wide fields from basic and applied microbiology to enzymology and eukaryotic cell biology, the accomplishments of which are exemplified by (i) the first cloning and expression of calf prochymosin cDNA for production as a milk-coagulant in cheese industry, (ii) discovery of unique bioactive microbial products, such as trichostatin (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) and leptomycin (an inhibitor of nuclear pore transport), and (iii) rediscovery of A-factor and elucidation of its mechanism to control cellular differentiation in the streptomycin-producing bacterium, Streptomyces griseus. In the last topic, Prof. S. Horinouchi, the coauthor of this review article, had been a close coworker since almost its beginning.
