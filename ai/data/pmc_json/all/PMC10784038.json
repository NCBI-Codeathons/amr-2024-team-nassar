Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a key and difficult challenge in the prevention and treatment of TB. Early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis of DR-TB is essential for selecting appropriate and personalized treatment and is an important means of reducing disease transmission and mortality. In recent years, imaging diagnosis of DR-TB has developed rapidly, but there is a lack of consistent understanding. To this end, the Infectious Disease Imaging Group, Infectious Disease Branch, Chinese Research Hospital Association; Infectious Diseases Group of Chinese Medical Association of Radiology; Digital Health Committee of China Association for the Promotion of Science and Technology Industrialization, and other organizations, formed a group of TB experts across China. The conglomerate then considered the Chinese and international diagnosis and treatment status of DR-TB, China\u2019s clinical practice, and evidence-based medicine on the methodological requirements of guidelines and standards. After repeated discussion, the expert consensus of imaging diagnosis of DR-PB was proposed. This consensus includes clinical diagnosis and classification of DR-TB, selection of etiology and imaging examination [mainly X-ray and computed tomography (CT)], imaging manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis. This expert consensus is expected to improve the understanding of the imaging changes of DR-TB, as a starting point for timely detection of suspected DR-TB patients, and can effectively improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and achieve the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB.", "Keywords:", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Tuberculosis (TB) ranks 13th in the world as a cause of death (1).

More than 90% of the causative bacteria of human pulmonary TB is human-type M.tb. M.tb has the characteristics of pleomorphism, acid resistance, slow growth, and strong resistance (5). M.tb has complex bacterial components, mainly including lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides. Lipoids account for 50\u201360% and are related to tissue necrosis, caseous liquefaction, cavity occurrence, and TB allergic reactions in TB. The source of infection of M.tb is mainly sputum carrier particles, which is spread through droplets (6), and the susceptible population include those with low resistance, such as those with weak self-resistance, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and malnutrition (7). TB is an ancient disease, but its incidence remains high today. One of the main reasons is the prevalence of drug-resistant (DR) M.tb. The main reasons for drug resistance are as follows: (I) change of the structure and composition and the permeability of the cell wall, the drug permeability decreases, resulting in drug resistance; (II) mutations in genes encoding drug targets or enzyme genes related to drug activity on the M.tb genome produce degraded or inactivated enzymes, resulting in drug resistance (8); (III) bacteria exposed to low doses of drugs for a longer period of time can activate transporters and then overexpress them, leading to irreversible phenotypic drug resistance and eventually genetic drug resistance (9). The emergence of DR-PTB makes the diagnosis and treatment of TB more difficult, or even leads to treatment failure, resulting in the emergence of more chronic sources of infection that are difficult to cure. Therefore, in order to better control the TB epidemic, it is crucial to detect DR-TB early and provide timely and effective treatment.", "The main pathogen causing human TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), which includes 4 types: human, bovine, African, and murine.

PTB is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. The global TB report released by WHO in 2022 pointed out that an estimated 187,000 AIDS patients worldwide would die from TB in 2021 (1). In the early stage of AIDS, the chest imaging features of patients infected with M.tb are not different from those of other patients with DS-PTB. However, in the middle and late stages of AIDS, as the count of CD4+ T lymphocytes continues to decrease, the imaging manifestations become increasingly atypical, and the lesions have diverse shapes, involving multiple lobes and lung segments, and usually appear as atypical infiltrates and miliary lesions. Mediastinal lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion are more common, whereas cavitation, nodules, old fibrous lesions and lymph node calcification are relatively less common (83,84) (Figure 7).", "AIDS patients\u2019 immune function is impaired or defective and they often co-exist with opportunistic infections.

NTM infection firstly induce the formation of granulomas in the terminal bronchioles, and then spread through the bronchi, and the airway muscle layer is destroyed. The airway becomes narrowed or even blocked, resulting in thin-walled cavities (85) (Figure 8). Thick-walled cavities appear in patients with PTB, whereas thin-walled cavities in NTM lung disease are often surrounded by satellite lesions distributed in segments or lobes (90).
