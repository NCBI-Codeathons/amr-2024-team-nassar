["Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most complex global health challenges today: decades of overuse and misuse in human medicine, animal health, agriculture, and dispersion into the environment have produced the dire consequence of infections to become progressively untreatable. Infection control and prevention (IPC) procedures, the reduction of overuse, and the misuse of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine are the cornerstones required to prevent the spreading of resistant bacteria. Purified drinking water and strongly improved sanitation even in remote areas would prevent the pollution from inadequate treatment of industrial, residential, and farm waste, as all these situations are expanding the resistome in the environment. The One Health concept addresses the interconnected relationships between human, animal, and environmental health as a whole: several countries and international agencies have now included a One Health Approach within their action plans to address AMR. Improved antimicrobial usage, coupled with regulation and policy, as well as integrated surveillance, infection control and prevention, along with antimicrobial stewardship, sanitation, and animal husbandry should all be integrated parts of any new action plan targeted to tackle AMR on the Earth. Since AMR is found in bacteria from humans, animals, and in the environment, we briefly summarize herein the current concepts of One Health as a global challenge to enable the continued use of antibiotics.", "1.

Such a perspective also encompasses the environment, which is clearly tied to humans and animals and likewise a potential source of new resistant microorganisms. In addition, antibiotics are often used for nonmedical uses, such as beekeeping, ethanol production, horticulture, in antifouling paints to prevent barnacle build-up on boat hulls, and food preservation [2]. Unfortunately, while society now takes antibiotics for granted, it has been shown that knowledge and attitudes regarding antibiotic use can be, and must be, improved and that improved knowledge may help reduce the misconceptions and misguided expectations contributing to inappropriate antibiotic use [3,4].", "Several interconnected human, animal, and environmental habitats can contribute to the emergence, evolution, and spread of AMR, and it is essential to recognize that the health of people is tightly connected to the health of animals, that diseases are transmitted from humans to animals and vice versa, and that AMR must therefore be tackled in both.

In addition to ARGs, higher abundances of mobile genetic elements were found in city samples, as well as some biocide/metal resistance genes. Acinetobacter comprised up to 29% of the 16S rRNA reads, and a strong correlation was found between the abundance of Acinetobacter and the OXA-58 carbapenemase gene [88]. Other experiences from India confirmed these data, and integrated plans to protect water should clearly be implemented soon [89,90,91].", "The counterpoint of any human activities potentially releasing whatever ARG in the environment is that MDR bacteria or even pathogens excreted or eliminated via effluents and sewage can re-contaminate humans and animals [92] even during recreational activities, and this must be taken into account when frail or immunosuppressed patients get in close contact with these environments [93,94,95].", "The counterpoint of any human activities potentially releasing whatever ARG in the environment is that MDR bacteria or even pathogens excreted or eliminated via effluents and sewage can re-contaminate humans and animals [92] even during recreational activities, and this must be taken into account when frail or immunosuppressed patients get in close contact with these environments [93,94,95].", "Surprisingly, even remote environments or the sponge microbiota may host AMR genes or plasmids [84,96], and novel antibiotic resistance determinants have been also discovered in forest and grassland soil metagenomes [97], thus hosting diverse and novel resistance genes that may be harnessed by phylogenetically distinct bacteria and may act as a reservoir of functional resistance genes [98]. The occurrence of MDR bacteria in wildlife is clearly influenced by many and different factors that have not yet been fully understood [99,100]. Most research has focused on measuring concentrations of antibiotics and characterizing the abundance and diversity of ARGs and MDR bacteria in the environment, but there has been limited empirical research on whether humans are exposed to this, and whether exposure can lead to measurable impacts on human health [101].", "Surprisingly, even remote environments or the sponge microbiota may host AMR genes or plasmids [84,96], and novel antibiotic resistance determinants have been also discovered in forest and grassland soil metagenomes [97], thus hosting diverse and novel resistance genes that may be harnessed by phylogenetically distinct bacteria and may act as a reservoir of functional resistance genes [98].
