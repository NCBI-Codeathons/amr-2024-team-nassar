["Summary", "The toxoflavin (Txn), broad host range phytotoxin produced by a variety of bacteria, including Burkholderia glumae, is a key pathogenicity factor of B. glumae in rice and field crops. Two bacteria exhibiting Txn\u2010degrading activity were isolated from healthy rice seeds and identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva and Agrobacterium sp. respectively. The genes stdR and stdA, encoding proteins responsible for Txn degradation of both bacterial isolates, were identical, indicating that horizontal gene transfer occurred between microbial communities in the same ecosystem. We identified a novel Txn\u2010quenching regulation of bacteria, demonstrating that the LysR\u2010type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) StdR induces the expression of the stdA, which encodes a Txn\u2010degrading enzyme, in the presence of Txn as a coinducer. Here we show that the bacterial StdRTxn\u2010quenching regulatory system mimics the ToxRTxn\u2010mediated biosynthetic regulation of B. glumae. Substrate specificity investigations revealed that Txn is the only coinducer of StdR and that StdA has a high degree of specificity for Txn. Rice plants expressing StdA showed Txn resistance. Collectively, bacteria mimic the mechanism of Txn biosynthesis regulation, employ it in the development of a Txn\u2010quenching regulatory system and share it with neighbouring bacteria for survival in rice environments full of Txn.", "Here we show that the bacterial StdR/Txn\u2010quenching regulatory system mimics the ToxR/Txn\u2010mediated biosynthetic regulation of Burkholderia glumae. Schematic of the novel Txn\u2010quenching gene regulation identified in two Txn\u2010resistant bacteria, Sphingomonas adhesiva and Agrobacterium sp., isolated from rice seeds. Exogenous Txn (double hexagon shape) binds to StdR, resulting in StdRTxn complex\u2010dependent activation of the expression of stdA, resulting in Txn quenching.", "Microb. Biotechnol.

Yellow Txn exhibits antibiotic activity against a variety of bacteria, fungi and plants and has mammalian toxicity (Latuasan and Berends, 1961; Cox et al., 2000). This toxin is well known as a key virulence factor for bacterial grain rot of rice and wilt of many crop plants (Jeong et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004). The phytotoxicity of Txn was effective against a broad range of monocot and dicot plants (Koh et al., 2011). Furthermore, Txn has also been shown to demonstrate anticancer activity (Choi et al., 2013a,2013b). These findings led us to investigate the biodegradation and utilization of Txn. In this study, we isolated two bacteria, S. adhaesiva SG14 and Agrobacterium sp. AL14, with Txn\u2010degrading activity from healthy rice seeds. Surprisingly, even though the two bacteria belong to distinctly different genera, they shared identical nucleotide regions (stdR and stdA) that function in toxoflavin degradation. In this study, we confirmed that the stdAR genes can be transferred by conjugation. These results support the possibility that these bacteria have acquired and shared genes important in antibiotic\u2010Txn degradation through horizontal gene transfer to allow for survival in the same ecological niche. The Txn produced by B. glumae, causing rice grain rot, has antibacterial\u2010antifungal activity, so it is difficult for other microorganisms to survive when B. glumae is present. We isolated two Txn\u2010degrading bacteria in this study, as well as P. polymyxa JH02 with Txn\u2010degrading TflA in a previous study from healthy rice seeds (Koh et al., 2011), and these results suggest that Txn\u2010resistant bacteria are probably well established in the rice grain environment. In order to complete gene horizontal movement, it is necessary to have components including transposable elements, but there is currently no information on whether the stdRA genes are present in these components. It could be interpreted as the result of a war between a rice parasite that use Txn as a weapon and saprophytes trying to overcome it. In addition, it is analysing the extent of matching around two matching genes. Achieved through horizontal gene transfer, the acquisition of antibiotic resistance is necessary for survival in the ecological niche of agricultural animals and humans frequently treated with antibiotics against many bacterial pathogens (O\u2019Brien, 2002). Many variations among closely related bacterial genomes are due to gains and losses of genes that are acquired horizontally as well as to gene duplications and larger amplifications (Francino, 2012). Recently, many findings suggest that specific plasmid might be able to overcome horizontal transfer barriers including host range, phylogenetic and ecological habitat (Zrimec, 2020; Zurfluh et al., 2020).", "Microbial pigments are receiving more attention in current research as they are widely applied as natural food colourants, fires, antimicrobial agents and cytotoxic activity (Ramesh et al., 2019).

These results revealed that the StdR and StdA system operates only in the presence of Txn, so the energy costs for bacteria are efficiently decreased for adaptation to competitive environments to allow for survival in this ecological niche. Because Txn degradation is an energetically expensive process in the absence of Txn, bacteria use complicated regulatory networks to conserve energy and to compete for appropriate niches for survival. There are many other examples of similar regulatory systems, allowing genes to be expressed only when they are needed to utilize or degrade exogenous compounds, such as the use of lactose. In addition, in S. coelicolor, the two components VanRS regulate the expression of vancomycin resistance genes only when vancomycin is present (Hutchings et al., 2006). In the case of flagella biosynthesis, flagellum genes of bacteria are most likely regulated on multiple levels to conserve energy and to promote the transition between different bacterial developmental phases (Macnab, 1996; Kim et al., 2007; Zan et al., 2015).

However, reumycin does not act as a StdR coinducer and consequently does not induce stdA expression in vivo. The interaction of StdR with the DNA region of the stdA promoter is central to the control of stdA transcription. Currently, we do not have direct evidence of the interaction between StdR and the stdA promoter DNA region. To perform electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the StdR was overexpressed in E. coli.
