["Hygromycin A (HygA) binds to the large ribosomal subunit and inhibits its peptidyl transferase (PT) activity. The presented structural and biochemical data indicate that HygA does not interfere with the initial binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site, but prevents its subsequent adjustment such that it fails to act as a substrate in the PT reaction. Structurally we demonstrate that HygA binds within the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and induces a unique conformation. Specifically in its ribosomal binding site HygA would overlap and clash with aminoacyl-A76 ribose moiety and, therefore, its primary mode of action involves sterically restricting access of the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA to the PTC.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Hygromycin A (HygA) is a natural product of Streptomyces hygroscopicus first isolated in 1953 (1,2). It is endowed with promising biological activities and has a unique structure (Supplementary Figure S1) consisting of a furanose, cinnamic acid and aminocyclitol moiety (3). The biosynthetic pathway of HygA has been elucidated (4) and its total chemical synthesis has also been described (5\u20137). HygA has a relatively broad antimicrobial spectrum, displaying activity against gram-positive bacteria including mycobacteria and actinomycetes (3). In addition this molecule is also active against Serpulina (Treponema) hyodysenteriae (the agent of swine dysentery), leptospira and endomoeba (1,3). The limited activity of HygA against enteric gram-negative bacteria has been attributed to the efficient AcrA/B efflux pump operating in these organisms (8).", "Hygromycin A (HygA) is a natural product of Streptomyces hygroscopicus first isolated in 1953 (1,2).

Other translational steps, such as the enzymatic (EF-Tu dependent) binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site and the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the A to the P site were found to be unaffected by HygA (10).

Accordingly, experiments were carried out to determine to which extent this competition affects the binding of the entire aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. As seen from the results presented in Figure 5A HygA does not inhibit EF-Tu-dependent binding of Phe-tRNA to poly(U) programmed 70S ribosomes even in the presence of high HygA concentrations when measured by nitrocellulose filtration which assesses the association of the tRNA with ribosome. In comparison, similar concentrations of the known 30S A-site inhibitor, tetracycline, caused almost complete inhibition of the binding (Figure 5A). This finding is in agreement with the results of a previous study (10). However, when the A-site binding was followed by stopped-flow kinetics using fluorescently labeled Phe-tRNAphe (Prf16/17) (Figure 5B), which reflects not only tRNA binding but also its chemical environment, a clear effect of HygA was detected. In fact, unlike in the control samples in which the fluorescence intensity of the labeled tRNA increases and then decreases reflecting an initial binding of the ligand followed by its adjustment on the ribosome, the latter adjustment step was not observed in the samples containing HygA, as the fluorescence intensity remained high (Figure\u00a05B). Together these findings indicated that whereas HygA does not completely prevent tRNA binding to the A site it prevents the tRNA from reaching a fully accommodated state. In agreement HygA inhibits the PT reaction when assayed using both natural amino acid substrates (fMet and Phe) as well as the aminoacyl mimic, puromycin (Figure 5C and\u00a0D) (10). The HygA dose-response curves show that inhibition of mRNA translation and dipeptide formation are superimposable (Figure 5C) indicating that inactivation of the PT activity can fully account for the block of mRNA translation caused by this antibiotic. Namely HygA appears to be a powerful inhibitor of PT activity, binding tightly to the ribosome with respect to canonical A-site substrates and effectively blocking both the specific PT assay and the more general mRNA translation assay possibly from the first peptide bond that yields the \u2018initiation dipeptide\u2019. This could explain why the dose response curves for the inhibition of mRNA translation and dipeptide formation are essentially superimposable. This premise is supported by the observation of Guerrero and colleagues that HygA once bound to the ribosome cannot easily be washed away by sucrose gradients or gel filtration chromatography (10). The binding of HygA into the PTC is further indicated by the observation that HygA competes with the known A-site binding antibiotic chloramphenicol (Figure 6A; (10)) but it responds differently to a 23S rRNA mutation (G2061A) (47) that confers resistance to chloramphenicol. Namely an in vitro translation assay that utilizes ribosomes harboring the G2061A mutation (47) is sensitive to CAM but not HygA (Figure 6B). These results support the crystallographic studies that indicate HygA primarily interferes with the accommodation of the aminoacyl-tRNA's CCA end (acceptor domain) into the PTC thus blocking the PT reaction.", "The crystallographic data obtained in this study indicate that HygA binds within the PTC and thereby occludes the aminoacyl-A76 ribose moiety from the catalytic site (Figure 3).

These results support the crystallographic studies that indicate HygA primarily interferes with the accommodation of the aminoacyl-tRNA's CCA end (acceptor domain) into the PTC thus blocking the PT reaction.", "The crystallographic data obtained in this study indicate that HygA binds within the PTC and thereby occludes the aminoacyl-A76 ribose moiety from the catalytic site (Figure 3). Accordingly, experiments were carried out to determine to which extent this competition affects the binding of the entire aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. As seen from the results presented in Figure 5A HygA does not inhibit EF-Tu-dependent binding of Phe-tRNA to poly(U) programmed 70S ribosomes even in the presence of high HygA concentrations when measured by nitrocellulose filtration which assesses the association of the tRNA with ribosome. In comparison, similar concentrations of the known 30S A-site inhibitor, tetracycline, caused almost complete inhibition of the binding (Figure 5A). This finding is in agreement with the results of a previous study (10). However, when the A-site binding was followed by stopped-flow kinetics using fluorescently labeled Phe-tRNAphe (Prf16/17) (Figure 5B), which reflects not only tRNA binding but also its chemical environment, a clear effect of HygA was detected. In fact, unlike in the control samples in which the fluorescence intensity of the labeled tRNA increases and then decreases reflecting an initial binding of the ligand followed by its adjustment on the ribosome, the latter adjustment step was not observed in the samples containing HygA, as the fluorescence intensity remained high (Figure\u00a05B). Together these findings indicated that whereas HygA does not completely prevent tRNA binding to the A site it prevents the tRNA from reaching a fully accommodated state. In agreement HygA inhibits the PT reaction when assayed using both natural amino acid substrates (fMet and Phe) as well as the aminoacyl mimic, puromycin (Figure 5C and\u00a0D) (10). The HygA dose-response curves show that inhibition of mRNA translation and dipeptide formation are superimposable (Figure 5C) indicating that inactivation of the PT activity can fully account for the block of mRNA translation caused by this antibiotic. Namely HygA appears to be a powerful inhibitor of PT activity, binding tightly to the ribosome with respect to canonical A-site substrates and effectively blocking both the specific PT assay and the more general mRNA translation assay possibly from the first peptide bond that yields the \u2018initiation dipeptide\u2019. This could explain why the dose response curves for the inhibition of mRNA translation and dipeptide formation are essentially superimposable. This premise is supported by the observation of Guerrero and colleagues that HygA once bound to the ribosome cannot easily be washed away by sucrose gradients or gel filtration chromatography (10). The binding of HygA into the PTC is further indicated by the observation that HygA competes with the known A-site binding antibiotic chloramphenicol (Figure 6A; (10)) but it responds differently to a 23S rRNA mutation (G2061A) (47) that confers resistance to chloramphenicol. Namely an in vitro translation assay that utilizes ribosomes harboring the G2061A mutation (47) is sensitive to CAM but not HygA (Figure 6B). These results support the crystallographic studies that indicate HygA primarily interferes with the accommodation of the aminoacyl-tRNA's CCA end (acceptor domain) into the PTC thus blocking the PT reaction.", "Figure 5.The effect of HygA on aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A-site, transpeptidation and mRNA translation.

As these residues are positioned differently in the structures, e.g. A2602 acquires a different conformation in each of the models reported, while HygA retains the same binding position through all three complexes, they likely play a less important role for the binding of the antibiotic and their different positioning rather reflects their high sensitivity to the presence of PTC substrates (25,62).", "During the revision of the present article, a study describing the structures and mechanism of action of HygA on the ribosome was reported (61). The general conclusion of the two independent articles is essentially the same concerning HygA's mechanism of action. Moreover, a comparison of the HygA-bound structures of the D. radiodurans 50S subunit (this study) and E. coli 70S ribosome in two different states (70S alone, PDB accession code: 4Z3R and 70S plus mRNA, A- and P-site tRNAs, PDB accession code: 4Z3Q; Polikanov et\nal. (61)) reveals that the binding site of the antibiotic is nearly identical independent of the organism used for the ribosome preparation, the use of 50S subunits or 70S ribosomes or the presence of mRNA and tRNAs (Supplementary Figure S6).

This moiety has been modeled in a neo configuration in our study and in a myo configuration in the work of Polikanov et\u00a0al. (Supplementary Figure S6; (61)). From the discovery and initial characterization of HygA in the 1950's chemical and spectroscopic analysis have indicated that the aminocyclitol moiety is in the neo-configuration (5\u20137,38,63\u201367) as depicted in Supplementary Figure S1 and in the final model presented in this study. Indeed the neo-configuration is also presented in the schematic drawing of HygA in Figure 2E of Polikanov et\u00a0al. (61) but it is not maintained in the deposited structures (PDB accession code: 4Z3Q and 4Z3R). After communicating and sharing with Polikanov et al., the HygA structure we are reporting in this study, they acknowledged the appropriateness of the neo configuration and will accordingly update the deposited PDB entries as the neo configuration and indeed the HygA structure we are reporting nicely fits and results in good agreement also with their experimental data (Polikanov, Wilson and Blanchard, personal communication). It is important to note that when compared to the\u00a0myo\u00a0configuration, the\u00a0neo-configuration in our structure yields a different geometry and a slightly different pattern for the specific interactions of HygA with the ribosome; most obviously the potential interactions observed in this study between G2583 (N2) and C2573 (N4) with the oxygen atoms in the methylenedioxy ring of the aminocyclitol moiety (Figure 2C) which, are not in hydrogen bonding distance with any ribosomal element in the original model reported by Polikanov et\u00a0al. (61). In this context, we would like to comment that as indicated by Polikanov et al. (61) initial studies on the function of the methylenedioxy ring in HygA have suggested that this bridge could be important for the antimicrobial activity of HygA due to its ability to bias the aminocyclitol ring toward the twisted boat conformation (58,59,64). This hypothesis had been inferred from (i) spectroscopic and chemical analysis of HygA and its derivatives, which support the twisted boat conformation for HygA in solution (38) and (ii) the observation that methoxyhygromycin, which differs from HygA by the opening of the methylendioxy ring, acquires in solution a chair conformation and has an overall lower antimicrobial activity compared to HygA (68). In our complex, HygA readily acquires a chair like conformation. This result indirectly supports more recent in vivo and in vitro studies on the function of the methylenedioxy ring which confirm its importance for the potency of the drug but points at its function in affecting the antibiotic uptake into the cell rather than the inhibition of the peptidyltransferase center (60).", "The only main difference between the two studies concerns the specific stereochemistry of the aminocyclitol moiety of HygA (Supplementary Figure S6).
