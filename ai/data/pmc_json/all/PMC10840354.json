The control of antibiotic production typically involves different processes and molecular mechanism. Despite numerous efforts to improve antibiotic yields, joint engineering strategies for combining genetic manipulation with fermentation optimization remain finite. Lincomycin A (Lin-A), a lincosamide antibiotic, is industrially fermented by Streptomyces lincolnensis. Herein, the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp)-type regulator SLCG_4846 was confirmed to directly inhibit the lincomycin biosynthesis, whereas indirectly controlled the transcription of SLCG_2919, the first reported repressor in S. lincolnensis. Inactivation of SLCG_4846 in the high-yield S. lincolnensis LA219X (LA219X\u03944846) increases the Lin-A production and deletion of SLCG_2919 in LA219X\u03944846 exhibits superimposed yield increment. Given the effect of the double deletion on cellular primary metabolism of S. lincolnensis, Plackett-Burman design, steepest ascent and response surface methodologies were utilized and employed to optimize the seed medium of this double mutant in shake flask, and Lin-A yield using optimal seed medium was significantly increased over the control. Above strategies were performed in a 15-L fermenter. The maximal yield of Lin-A in LA219X\u03944846-2919 reached 6.56\u00a0g/L at 216\u00a0h, 55.1 % higher than that in LA219X at the parental cultivation (4.23\u00a0g/L). This study not only showcases the potential of this strategy to boost lincomycin production, but also could empower the development of high-performance actinomycetes for other antibiotics.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Antibiotics, which are bioactive secondary metabolites produced by the fermentation of actinomycetes, are extensively used in pharmacology, agriculture, and other fields [1]. Meanwhile, the biosynthesis of antibiotics is complex and depends on various factors, including intracellular gene expression, regulation of extracellular medium components, and process control [2,3]. Over the past few decades, most actinomycetes used for the industrial-scale production of antibiotics have been obtained via random mutagenesis programs [4,5]. In recent years, the modification of factors affecting antibiotic production and the optimization of fermentation process have been widely used to improve the yield of antibiotics [3,5,6]. Response surface methodology can avoid the drawbacks of classical methods and is an empirical technique for modeling and optimizing fermentation processes [7]. Recombinant DNA technologies are also efficient tools for increasing antibiotic yields in actinomycetes [8]. In Saccharopolyspora erythraea ZL1004, the P450 hydroxylase gene eryK and O-methyltransferase gene eryG were co-overexpressed for titer improvement of erythromycin [9]. Subsequently, fermentation process of the genetically engineered Sac. erythraea was optimized to improve the titer [10,11]. Therefore, combining genetic manipulation with fermentation engineering can enhance the biosynthetic yield of mutant strains, which is necessary for the industrial overproduction of antibiotics.", "Antibiotics, which are bioactive secondary metabolites produced by the fermentation of actinomycetes, are extensively used in pharmacology, agriculture, and other fields [1].

Changes in the quantity and activity of these regulators lead to variations in nutrient uptake and utilization [16,17].

With the standards of a |log2(FC)|\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 and p-value \u22640.05, 182 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (Fig. 3A). Among these DEGs, expression levels of 93 were downregulated and those of 89 were upregulated (Table S3), and the transcripts of some lincomycin biosynthetic genes were significantly upregulated in LA219X\u03944846-2919 in comparison to those in LA219X. Twenty DEGs were associated with carbohydrate transport and metabolism, inferring that the lack of SLCG_2919 and SLCG_4846 affected carbon uptake and assimilation (Fig. 3B). Several nitrogen metabolic genes were also significantly regulated (Fig. 3C). These data suggested that the inactivation of SLCG_4846 and SLCG_2919 altered cellular primary metabolism, including carbon and nitrogen metabolism, to affect the biosynthesis of lincomycin.Fig. 3Transcriptome analysis of LA219X\u03944846-2919.
