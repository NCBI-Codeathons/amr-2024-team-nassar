Their chemical structures were identified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 2D NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry, as well as comparisons with previously reported literatures. Among them, fusariumesters C\u2012F (2\u20135) are bis-alkenoic acid derivatives dimerized by an ester bond, while acetylfusaridioic acid A (6) and fusaridioic acid D (7) are alkenoic acid monomers. All the isolates were submitted to an antifungal assay against Candida albicans and the corn pathogen Exserohilum turcicum using the filter paper agar diffusion method. As a result, only compound 1 decorating with \u03b2-lactone ring turned out to be active against these two tested fungi. The broth microdilution assay against Candida albicans showed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 1 to be 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, while the minimum inhibitory concentration value of the positive control (naystatin) was 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. And the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value (21.23\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of 1 against Exserohilum turcicum was determined by analyzing its inhibition effect on the mycelial growth, using cycloheximide (IC50 = 46.70\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) as the positive control.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Candida albicans, as an opportunistic pathogenic fungus, normally maintain symbiosis with the human body in the skin, oral cavity, and gastrointestinal tract (Mishra and Koh, 2021). When the body\u2019s homeostasis is destroyed, C. albicans transforms into pathogenic fungi, causing various fungal diseases from superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic infections (Pappas et al., 2009; Hall and Noverr, 2017). According to statistics, four hundred thousand people are infected with C, albicans every year, and 75% of women suffer from vulvovaginal candidiasis at least once in their lives (Fidel et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2014; Rajendran et al., 2016). Even with drug treatment, the fatality rate of invasive C. albicans infection is still close to 40% (Lohse et al., 2018; Whitesell et al., 2019). Among immunocompromised people such as chemotherapy and organ transplantation, the mortality rate of fungal diseases caused by C. albicans is 33\u201350% (Krcmery et al., 2000; Winston, 1999; Levesque et al., 2015). Therefore, infections caused by C. albicans are still nonnegligible threats to human health.", "Candida albicans, as an opportunistic pathogenic fungus, normally maintain symbiosis with the human body in the skin, oral cavity, and gastrointestinal tract (Mishra and Koh, 2021).

However, the drug resistance of C. albicans caused by the widespread use of fluconazole is becoming an increasingly serious problem, and the discovery for new antifungal drugs has become more and more urgent (Whaley et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2021). Fungal secondary metabolites, as an important source of antifungal drugs (Baker et al., 2007; Di Santo, 2010; Cantrell et al., 2012; Schueffler and Anke, 2014), have attracted much more attention from the researchers. In the past 10\u00a0years, 25% of antifungal active compounds are derived from fungi (Aldholmi et al., 2019). Among all the fungal microbial resources, plant endophytic fungi were thought as the valuable resources for the discovery of antifungal agents (Uzma et al., 2018; Newman and Cragg, 2020). Recently, a program to discover antifungal constituents from endophytic fungi associated with characteristic food resources of Yunnan Province, China, was conducted in our lab. Accordingly, an antifungal screening of the strain fermentation extracts against C. albicans targeted an endophytic fungus from stems of tea trees, Scopulariopsis candelabrum KIB-int20. Secondary metabolites reported from the genus Scopulariopsis were mainly cyclodepsipeptides (such as scopularides A and B) and some dihydroquinolin-2-one-containing alkaloids (Yu et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2015; Elbanna et al., 2019). In this study, seven mono-/bis-alkenoic acid derivatives (1\u20137, Figure 1) were isolated from S. candelabrum KIB-int20 during a screening for antifungal secondary metabolites.

The IR spectrum of 2 displayed characteristic adsorptions for carbonyl groups and carbon-carbon double bonds at 1,712 and 1,620\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. The 13C NMR data (Table 2) of 2 showed 36 carbon resonances, and all signals appeared in pairs. Moreover, each pair of the signals closely resembled those of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018). Additionally, comparing the molecular weight (666 Da) of 2 with twice that of fusaridioic acid A (342 Da) yielded a difference of 18 Da. Accordingly, 2 was speculated to be an esterified dimer of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018). Further detailed analysis of its NMR data (Supplementary Figures S3\u20138) supported this hypothesis. Based on the literature report (Liu et al., 2018), two 13C NMR signals at \u03b4\nC 167.7 and \u03b4\nC 167.8 were obviously assigned as carboxylic acid carbonyls connecting to quaternary olefinic carbons, while signals at \u03b4\nC 173.8 and \u03b4\nC 172.4 were assigned as aliphatic carboxylic acid carbonyl groups or ester carbonyl groups. The methines at \u03b4\nC 68.8 and \u03b4\nC 68.9 were attributed to hydroxy-substituted ones. The two methylenes at \u03b4\nC 62.6 and \u03b4\nC 59.4 were assigned to be oxygen-bearing ones, and the small difference between their chemical shifts may due to the formation of an ester bond for one of these two carbons. The 1H NMR data (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3) of 2 revealed four olefinic proton signals at \u03b4\nH 5.56, 5.63, 5.71, 5.69.

The 1H NMR data of 2 also showed two overlapped doublets (\u03b4\nH 0.78 and 0.79) of methyls in the high field region (Supplementary Figure S3). Starting with these two above-mentioned methyl signals, two similar aliphatic carbon chains [7-Me(C-6)/C-7/C-8/C-9/C-10/C-11/C-12/C-13/13-CH2O and 7\u2032-Me(C-6\u2032)/C-7\u2032/C-8\u2032/C-9\u2032/C-10\u2032/C-11\u2032/C-12\u2032/C-13\u2032/13\u2032-CH2O, Figure 2] were deduced based on a combined analyses of its HSQC and 1H\u20131H COSY spectra. Lastly, the key HMBC correlations from the proton at \u03b4\nH 4.13 (one proton of 13-CH2OR) to the carbons of C-12, C-13, C-14 and C-14\u2032 demonstrated that two molecules of fusaridioic acid A were dimerized via the ester bond built by 13-CH2OH and the carboxylic acid group at C-14\u2032 (Figure 2).

Starting with these two above-mentioned methyl signals, two similar aliphatic carbon chains [7-Me(C-6)/C-7/C-8/C-9/C-10/C-11/C-12/C-13/13-CH2O and 7\u2032-Me(C-6\u2032)/C-7\u2032/C-8\u2032/C-9\u2032/C-10\u2032/C-11\u2032/C-12\u2032/C-13\u2032/13\u2032-CH2O, Figure 2] were deduced based on a combined analyses of its HSQC and 1H\u20131H COSY spectra. Lastly, the key HMBC correlations from the proton at \u03b4\nH 4.13 (one proton of 13-CH2OR) to the carbons of C-12, C-13, C-14 and C-14\u2032 demonstrated that two molecules of fusaridioic acid A were dimerized via the ester bond built by 13-CH2OH and the carboxylic acid group at C-14\u2032 (Figure 2). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was elucidated.", "Compound 2 (fusariumester C) was isolated as colorless oil. Its molecular formula was determined to be C36H58O11 by HR-ESI-MS analysis (m/z 665.3909 [M \u2012 H]\u2012, calcd for C36H57O11, 665.3906, Supplementary Figure S9), suggesting eight degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum of 2 displayed characteristic adsorptions for carbonyl groups and carbon-carbon double bonds at 1,712 and 1,620\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. The 13C NMR data (Table 2) of 2 showed 36 carbon resonances, and all signals appeared in pairs. Moreover, each pair of the signals closely resembled those of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018). Additionally, comparing the molecular weight (666 Da) of 2 with twice that of fusaridioic acid A (342 Da) yielded a difference of 18 Da. Accordingly, 2 was speculated to be an esterified dimer of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018). Further detailed analysis of its NMR data (Supplementary Figures S3\u20138) supported this hypothesis. Based on the literature report (Liu et al., 2018), two 13C NMR signals at \u03b4\nC 167.7 and \u03b4\nC 167.8 were obviously assigned as carboxylic acid carbonyls connecting to quaternary olefinic carbons, while signals at \u03b4\nC 173.8 and \u03b4\nC 172.4 were assigned as aliphatic carboxylic acid carbonyl groups or ester carbonyl groups. The methines at \u03b4\nC 68.8 and \u03b4\nC 68.9 were attributed to hydroxy-substituted ones. The two methylenes at \u03b4\nC 62.6 and \u03b4\nC 59.4 were assigned to be oxygen-bearing ones, and the small difference between their chemical shifts may due to the formation of an ester bond for one of these two carbons. The 1H NMR data (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3) of 2 revealed four olefinic proton signals at \u03b4\nH 5.56, 5.63, 5.71, 5.69. Detailed HMBC correlations associated with these four above-mentioned protons established the presence of two pairs of diene moieties conjugating with terminal carboxyls (the fragments from C-1 to C-6, and from C-1\u2032 to C-6\u2032, Figure 2). The 1H NMR data of 2 also showed two overlapped doublets (\u03b4\nH 0.78 and 0.79) of methyls in the high field region (Supplementary Figure S3). Starting with these two above-mentioned methyl signals, two similar aliphatic carbon chains [7-Me(C-6)/C-7/C-8/C-9/C-10/C-11/C-12/C-13/13-CH2O and 7\u2032-Me(C-6\u2032)/C-7\u2032/C-8\u2032/C-9\u2032/C-10\u2032/C-11\u2032/C-12\u2032/C-13\u2032/13\u2032-CH2O, Figure 2] were deduced based on a combined analyses of its HSQC and 1H\u20131H COSY spectra. Lastly, the key HMBC correlations from the proton at \u03b4\nH 4.13 (one proton of 13-CH2OR) to the carbons of C-12, C-13, C-14 and C-14\u2032 demonstrated that two molecules of fusaridioic acid A were dimerized via the ester bond built by 13-CH2OH and the carboxylic acid group at C-14\u2032 (Figure 2).

Examination of its detailed 13C NMR data with those of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018) suggested that 6 was the product of acetylation at 13-CH2OH in fusaridioic acid A. Key HMBC (Supplementary Figure S34) correlations from protons (\u03b4\nH 4.11 and 4.15) of 13-CH2O moiety to the carbonyl (\u03b4\nC 170.3) of the acetyl group supported this deduction (Figure 2). Like compound 2, the configurations of C-7 and C-13 in 6 were supposed to be 7R and 13S based on a thought of conserved biosynthetic logic. And the C-12 (12\u2032) absolute configurations in compounds 3, 4, 5, and 6 were determined to be 12R (12\u2032R), 12S (12\u2032R), 12S (12\u2032R), and 12R, respectively, by comparisons of their proton NMR data of H-12 (12\u2032) with literature reports (Supplementary Table S1).", "Fusaridioic acid D (7) was found to possess the molecular formula C18H30O5 from the HR-ESI-MS data (m/z 325.2023 [M\u2012H]\u2012, calcd for 325.2020 C18H29O5, Supplementary Figure S44), corresponding to an unsaturation index of four.

Compounds 2\u20137 showed no significant inhibitory activity against C. albicans, and only compound 1 could inhibit C. albicans (Supplementary Figure S49). The MIC value (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of 1 against C. albicans was then determined by broth microdilution techniques (Yu et al., 2016), using nystatin (MIC = 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) as the positive control (Supplementary Figure S46). As the previous references reported the antifungal activity of alkenoic acids against plant pathogens (Liu et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019), all the isolates were also submitted to an antifungal assay against three agricultural pathogenic fungi, Exserohilum turcicum, Curvularia lunata, and Fusarium oxysporum.

Among them, most of the alkenoic acid derivatives are acyclic, and seven of them are decorating with terminal lactone rings, including \u03b2-lactone (such as fusarilactone A, fusarilactone B, hymeglusin, fusarisolin A, and fusariumester B), \u03b3-lactone (such as fusarisolin B), and \u03b4-lactone (such as fusarilactone C). For these reported alkenoic acids, oxidative modifications (carboxylic acids or hydroxyls) often occur at C-1, C-12, Me-13, and C-14. The stereochemistry of acyclic alkenoic acids is usually conserved with 7R and 13S, while the stereochemistry of C-12 with a hydroxy modification is hybrid with R (eg, fusarisolin D, fusaridioic acid A, and fusariumester A2) or S (eg, fusariumester A1 and L-660282) configuration. Preliminary biosynthetic study of 1233A (equal to F-244, L-659, 699, or hymeglusin) revealed that alkenoic acids are built via a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) logic (Kumagai et al., 1992; Kato et al., 2020).
