["", "Lanthipeptides\nare ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally\nmodified peptides (RiPPs) that display a wide variety of biological\nactivities, from antimicrobial to antiallodynic. Lanthipeptides that\ndisplay antimicrobial activity are called lantibiotics. The post-translational\nmodification reactions of lanthipeptides include dehydration of Ser\nand Thr residues to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, a transformation\nthat is carried out in three unique ways in different classes of lanthipeptides.\nIn a cyclization process, Cys residues then attack the dehydrated\nresidues to generate the lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether\ncross-linked amino acids from which lanthipeptides derive their name.\nThe resulting polycyclic peptides have constrained conformations that\nconfer their biological activities. After installation of the characteristic\nthioether cross-links, tailoring enzymes introduce additional post-translational\nmodifications that are unique to each lanthipeptide and that fine-tune\ntheir activities and/or stability. This review focuses on studies\npublished over the past decade that have provided much insight into\nthe mechanisms of the enzymes that carry out the post-translational\nmodifications.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The name lanthipeptide\nis a short-hand nomenclature for lanthionine-containing\npeptides,1 with lanthipeptides having antimicrobial\nactivities historically called lantibiotics.2 A lanthionine is a bis-amino-bis acid in which two alanine residues\nare linked by a thioether group that connects their \u03b2-carbons\n(Figure 1). When incorporated\ninto a peptide chain via both the amino and acid groups, a lanthionine\nresults in a thioether cross-link.

Bicereucin is the first example of a two-component lanthipeptide\nwhere one of the components, bicereucin \u03b1, does not contain\n(Me)Lan as there are no cysteines in the precursor peptide (Figure 37).400 The second component, bicereucin \u03b2, contains\na single C-terminal Lan. Oddly, unlike what has been observed for\nother lanthipeptides, cyclization of this ring by BsjM is not stereoselective\nin vitro, but the cross-link in bicereucin \u03b2 is important to\nthe bioactivity. It is possible that the stereochemistry is not important\nin this case but the independent bioactivity of the two diastereomers\nhas not been evaluated. The lack of selectivity may be explained by\nthe fact that the bicereucin lanthipeptide synthetase BsjM lacks two\nof the Cys-Cys-His/Cys zinc ligands and active site His catalytic\nacid conserved in other LanCs and LanM cyclase domains. In other words,\nits cyclization active site appears disrupted. Recent genome mining\nhas shown that several LanMs lack some or all of these conserved active\nsite residues, and many of their substrates lack Cys suggesting coevolution\nof the LanA and LanM cyclization domain.35,368 These LanMs lacking conserved active site residues do not appear\nto cluster in the SSN (Figure 24). For example, both BsjM and NpnM, a LanM that also\nlacks the active site His acid and processes cysteine-free LanAs (see section 4.6.1), cluster\nseparately from each other but with LanMs featuring fully conserved\ncyclization active sites. It is important to note that the class III\nLanKC enzymes also lack these active site residues and yet catalyze\ncyclization (see section 5).

Interestingly,\nimmediately adjacent to the putative substrate gene is a lanB gene. The contig does not provide additional information, but another\n56-amino acid peptide from Streptomyces albulus CCRC11814\n(GenBank accession number EPY92828.1) differs in nine residues from\nSapT in its putative core region and is predicted to contain the same\n4-ring topology of SapT but also to have a fifth ring at its C-terminus\n(Figure 44B). Similarly,\nthis gene is flanked by a lanB gene, but the cluster\nalso clearly contains genes for a LanC and a standalone LanB C_terminal\ndomain protein (Pfam 14028; homologous to LanB glutamate elimination\ndomain, section 2.2), with the function of the latter unclear. Thus, it is very likely\nthat these gene clusters encode class I lanthipeptides and that SapT\nalso belongs in this class and not class III as previously assigned\nbased on bioactivity.54", "Figure 43Biosynthesis of SapB.\nFor clarity the process is drawn as first\ncomplete dehydration and then cyclization, but the order of the PTMs\nfor SapB is not actually known.", "Figure 43Biosynthesis of SapB.\nFor clarity the process is drawn as first\ncomplete dehydration and then cyclization, but the order of the PTMs\nfor SapB is not actually known.", "Figure 43Biosynthesis of SapB.\nFor clarity the process is drawn as first\ncomplete dehydration and then cyclization, but the order of the PTMs\nfor SapB is not actually known.", "Biosynthesis of SapB.\nFor clarity the process is drawn as first\ncomplete dehydration and then cyclization, but the order of the PTMs\nfor SapB is not actually known.", "Biosynthesis of SapB.\nFor clarity the process is drawn as first\ncomplete dehydration and then cyclization, but the order of the PTMs\nfor SapB is not actually known.", "Biosynthesis of SapB.\nFor clarity the process is drawn as first\ncomplete dehydration and then cyclization, but the order of the PTMs\nfor SapB is not actually known.", "Figure 44SapT (A) is predicted to be a class I lanthipeptide based on sequence\nalignment (B) with putative LanAs from S. reticuli and S. albulus that cluster with genes encoding\nputative LanB enzymes.

Second, for many family\nmembers, a series of congeners have been observed that contain differing\nnumbers of amino acids originating from the leader peptide at their\nN-termini. This observation was first made for the labyrinthopeptins;\nthe A1 and A3 congeners differ only in that A3 contains an additional\nAsp at its N-terminus (Figure 48).10 Subsequently, similar\nobservations have been made for erythreapeptin (five congeners with\ndifferent numbers of remaining leader peptide residues), avermipeptin\n(seven congeners), griseopeptin (two congeners), curvopeptin (five\ncongeners), stackepeptin (two congeners), and even SapB (two congeners).131,132,484 Similar observations have been\nmade for the class IV compounds venezuelin35 and streptocollin134 for which two variants\nof each were observed. Thus, it appears that the class III and IV\nlanthipeptides are generated by stepwise trimming of the leader peptides\nby currently unidentified amino peptidases. It is possible that for\nsome or all members, an N-terminal segment of the leader peptide is\nfirst removed in one step by a specific endopeptidase. Indeed, this\nscenario has been experimentally demonstrated for flavipeptin from Kribbella flavida. Its biosynthetic gene cluster contains\na prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) designated FlaP (note that it is not\na member of the LanP Ser proteases of the subtilisin family) that\nis predicted to be cytoplasmic.493 In vitro\nreconstitution of FlaP activity showed that the enzyme is specific\nfor cyclized FlaA. The enzyme cleaves mFlaA after Pro\u221212 but\ndid not act on linear FlaA or the leader peptide, and very slowly\nprocessed dehydrated FlaA. Hence, the rings are important for substrate\nrecognition. POPs were shown to be encoded in a small subset of class\nIII gene clusters,493 but quite a few class\nIII LanA substrates have Pro in their leader peptides, and hence cleavage\nby a POP and subsequent trimming by aminopeptidases could be a more\ngeneral pathway.
