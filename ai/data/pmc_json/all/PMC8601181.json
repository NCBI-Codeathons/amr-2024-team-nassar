["Summary", "Small peptides are a group of natural products with low molecular weights and complex structures. The diverse structures of small peptides endow them with broad bioactivities and suggest their potential therapeutic use in the medical field. The remaining challenge is methods to address the main limitations, namely (i) the low amount of available small peptides from natural sources, and (ii) complex processes required for traditional chemical synthesis. Therefore, harnessing microbial cells as workhorse appears to be a promising approach to synthesize these bioactive peptides. As an emerging engineering technology, synthetic biology aims to create standard, well\u2010characterized and controllable synthetic systems for the biosynthesis of natural products. In this review, we describe the recent developments in the microbial production of small peptides. More importantly, synthetic biology approaches are considered for the production of small peptides, with an emphasis on chassis cells, the evolution of biosynthetic pathways, strain improvements and fermentation.", "Small peptides are a group of bioactive compounds with low molecular weights and complex structures.

Among these applications, antimicrobial agents derived from natural products have developed rapidly since penicillin was first discovered (Singh and Barrett, 2006). The remaining challenge is that new antimicrobial compounds are still urgently needed because drug resistance inevitably occurs with the extensive use of antibiotics. Small peptides are a group of natural products with relatively low molecular weights (<\u200910\u2009kDa). These bioactive compounds can be classified into two main categories: ribosomally synthesized and post\u2010translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and non\u2010ribosomal peptides (NRPs; Dang and S\u00fcssmuth, 2017; Fig.\u20091). The biosynthesis of RiPPs requires two steps: ribosomal synthesis of the precursor peptide and posttranslational modifications (PTMs; Montalb\u00e1n\u2010L\u00f3pez et\u00a0al., 2020). Due to differences in structural features (e.g. lanthionine), RiPPs are divided into different subfamilies, such as lanthipeptides. The structural diversity endows RiPPs with a broad range of bioactivities, including antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral activities (Arnison et\u00a0al., 2013). NRPs are a diverse family of natural products that are synthesized by large enzyme complexes known as non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs; Podevels et\u00a0al., 2008). NRPs are structurally diverse secondary metabolites with a variety of biological activities that can be exploited as therapeutic agents, such as the antibiotic daptomycin and the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (Winn et\u00a0al., 2016).", "Natural products from plants or microorganisms are fertile sources of therapeutics and lead drugs, which have played a vital role in medicinal applications (Atanasov et\u00a0al., 2015).

Small peptides have promising prospects in the pharmaceutical industry due to their broad\u2010spectrum bioactivities, low toxicity and low propensity to induce the development of drug resistance, although further investigations are still needed to unravel their reliability (Barbosa et\u00a0al., 2015). However, (i) the amount of small peptides available from natural sources is extremely low, and the inefficient isolation and extraction methods increase the difficulty of accessing these peptides. For example, the yield of the lanthipeptide lichenicidin produced by Bacillus licheniformis have just reached 4\u20136\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 (Kuthning et\u00a0al., 2015), which has a huge gap compared with that of extracellular proteins, such as \u03b1\u2010amylase (17.6\u2009g\u2009l\u22121; Niu et\u00a0al., 2009). Meanwhile, (ii) bioactive peptides with sophisticated structures are particularly difficult to be produced using traditional chemical synthesis, which usually requires multiple reactions to introduce specific functional groups. As exemplified by lactocin S, a 34\u2010residue lanthipeptide was isolated from Lactobacillus sakei L45, its biosynthesis involved only two enzymatic steps (modification, cleavage), after the prepeptide was synthesized in ribosome (Skaugen et\u00a0al., 1997). The total synthesis of lactocin S required 71 steps using solid\u2010supported synthesis (Ross et\u00a0al., 2010). The intricate construction of cells may not only aid in normal cell metabolism but also serve as an arsenal to synthesize various secondary metabolites. In this regard, microbial production of bioactive peptides in diverse biosystems has been pursued as a potential approach. Although biosynthetic genes are ubiquitous in the currently sequenced genomes and transcriptomes of different microbes, the common feature of the complex biosynthetic mechanism remains unclear. In addition, compared to the other types of molecules, small peptide as a bioactive compound often triggers host immune responses, and its synthesis is thereby subjected to a more complicated regulation (Bartholomae et\u00a0al., 2017; Yang et\u00a0al., 2020). The manipulation of biosynthetic pathways encoded by large gene clusters is still a challenge due to the shortage of robust genetic tools and engineering strategy.

The native BGCs may be subjected to endogenous cellular regulation, which will affect the levels of gene expression within the biosynthetic pathway (Shao et\u00a0al., 2013). A controllable biological process that is based on the rewiring of BGCs with well\u2010characterized DNA parts is required to circumvent this limitation (Larroude et\u00a0al., 2018). This process might be facilitated by refactoring, in which native biosynthetic pathways are reassembled using genetic parts (Smanski et\u00a0al., 2016; Fig.\u20092b). During the process of refactoring, non\u2010coding genes and native regulatory elements within the BGC are removed. Furthermore, the uncharacterized regulatory elements within the coding DNA sequences (CDSs) will be identified and deleted by randomly assembling coding genes in silico. The remaining coding genes are obtained using DNA synthesis techniques. By refactoring the BGCs, the expression of genes is controlled using diverse biological parts, such as the promoter, RBS, terminator (Khalil and Collins, 2010). Expanded parts, such as insulators, are used to construct synthetic pathways because of their ability to increase the reliability of the functions of each part and to predict the behaviour of synthetic circuits in different genetic contexts (Lou et\u00a0al., 2012). The BGCs that are equipped with synthetic regulatory elements are theoretically relatively orthogonal, which would allow natural regulatory networks to be bypassed and force the expression of the controlled genes (Myronovskyi and Luzhetskyy, 2016). Another advantage is the potential application of high\u2010throughput techniques to the refactored BGCs for the optimization of biosynthetic pathways. For example, synthetic promoter libraries have been established to refactor the biosynthetic pathway for the production of desired products based on high\u2010throughput screening (Siegl et\u00a0al., 2013). Different promoters that vary in strength enable the optimization of BGC expression through a rational combinatorial strategy (Awan et\u00a0al., 2017). MacPherson et\u00a0al. constructed a series of short synthetic terminators by randomly linking terminators with a consensus sequence. These synthetic short terminators avoided repetitive sequences and improved the stability of recombinant synthetic circuits and the assembly of biosynthetic pathways into S. cerevisiae (MacPherson and Saka, 2017). Additionally, refactoring permits the creation of new structures by swapping genetic modules encoding diverse modification enzymes. This strategy is particularly important for natural products with similarly biosynthetic mechanisms. For instance, NRPSs are usually composed of multiple modules that are responsible for integrating diverse monomers into the peptide backbone, which facilitates the production of new chemical structures through the modification of biosynthetic modules (Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2006). The state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art structures are generated through the combination of different biosynthetic modules derived from the BGCs of non\u2010ribosomal peptides (Zobel et\u00a0al., 2016). Furthermore, hybrid enzymes that are capable of synthesizing new compounds have been generated by the fusion of NRPS with other megaenzymes, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020).", "The gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of small peptides are composed of multiple operons.

MacPherson et\u00a0al. constructed a series of short synthetic terminators by randomly linking terminators with a consensus sequence. These synthetic short terminators avoided repetitive sequences and improved the stability of recombinant synthetic circuits and the assembly of biosynthetic pathways into S. cerevisiae (MacPherson and Saka, 2017). Additionally, refactoring permits the creation of new structures by swapping genetic modules encoding diverse modification enzymes. This strategy is particularly important for natural products with similarly biosynthetic mechanisms. For instance, NRPSs are usually composed of multiple modules that are responsible for integrating diverse monomers into the peptide backbone, which facilitates the production of new chemical structures through the modification of biosynthetic modules (Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2006). The state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art structures are generated through the combination of different biosynthetic modules derived from the BGCs of non\u2010ribosomal peptides (Zobel et\u00a0al., 2016). Furthermore, hybrid enzymes that are capable of synthesizing new compounds have been generated by the fusion of NRPS with other megaenzymes, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020).", "The gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of small peptides are composed of multiple operons. The native BGCs may be subjected to endogenous cellular regulation, which will affect the levels of gene expression within the biosynthetic pathway (Shao et\u00a0al., 2013). A controllable biological process that is based on the rewiring of BGCs with well\u2010characterized DNA parts is required to circumvent this limitation (Larroude et\u00a0al., 2018). This process might be facilitated by refactoring, in which native biosynthetic pathways are reassembled using genetic parts (Smanski et\u00a0al., 2016; Fig.\u20092b). During the process of refactoring, non\u2010coding genes and native regulatory elements within the BGC are removed. Furthermore, the uncharacterized regulatory elements within the coding DNA sequences (CDSs) will be identified and deleted by randomly assembling coding genes in silico. The remaining coding genes are obtained using DNA synthesis techniques. By refactoring the BGCs, the expression of genes is controlled using diverse biological parts, such as the promoter, RBS, terminator (Khalil and Collins, 2010). Expanded parts, such as insulators, are used to construct synthetic pathways because of their ability to increase the reliability of the functions of each part and to predict the behaviour of synthetic circuits in different genetic contexts (Lou et\u00a0al., 2012). The BGCs that are equipped with synthetic regulatory elements are theoretically relatively orthogonal, which would allow natural regulatory networks to be bypassed and force the expression of the controlled genes (Myronovskyi and Luzhetskyy, 2016).

The dynamic regulation of the biosynthetic pathway is necessary for the optimal production of secondary metabolites, while avoiding the excess accumulation of intermediates, especially toxic compounds (Dahl et\u00a0al., 2013; Xu et\u00a0al., 2014). The well\u2010characterized dynamic behaviours of synthetic circuits from libraries of synthetic parts will guide the design of synthetic pathways using computational methods (Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2011). As exemplified in the biosynthesis of penicillin in yeast, Awan and coworkers optimized the production of the non\u2010ribosomal peptide penicillin by constructing and testing hundreds of different combinations of penicillin pathway genes with different promoters with varying strengths and expression dynamics (Awan et\u00a0al., 2017). Recently, a random rational strategy was applied to engineer the gene cluster of bottromycin for the construction of overproducing strains. The cluster was refactored with a combination of various promoters with unknown strengths, which allowed researchers to construct a library of bot clusters that would enable the ideal expression levels to be screened in an appropriate host. Furthermore, this strategy allows other genetic regulatory parts (e.g. RBSs) to be used to refactor the BGCs of interest and does not require detailed knowledge of the biosynthesis in the initial stage (Horbal et\u00a0al., 2018).", "Strain improvement", "Strain improvement", "Activation of positive regulators", "Activation of positive regulators", "Activation of positive regulators", "The improvement of strain performance can be achieved within the bio\u2010based peptide\u2010producing system through the use of pathway engineering strategies, such as transcription regulation (Fig.\u20093). The biosynthesis of RiPPs is regulated by complex regulatory mechanisms that are commonly mediated by specific pathway regulators (Bartholomae et\u00a0al., 2017). For example, the biosynthesis of the class I lanthipeptide nisin is regulated by quorum sensing, which is mediated by the two\u2010component system nisRK, the specific regulatory genes within the gene cluster (Lubelski et\u00a0al., 2008). Specific pathway regulators control the transcription of biosynthetic genes within the gene clusters by binding to the promoter regions of operons (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2014). The overexpression of these positive regulators increases the transcription of structural genes within gene clusters and improves productivity (Li et\u00a0al., 2018b). In addition to pathway\u2010specific regulators, global regulators also exert positive effects on the biosynthesis of RiPPs.

The removal of these negative regulators could relieve the transcriptional repression of the BGC and contribute to peptide synthesis (Choi et\u00a0al., 2009). For example, the ArsR family transcriptional regulator DepR2 represses the expression of the daptomycin gene cluster by interacting with the dptEp promoter. The deletion of depR2 caused an approximately 2.5\u2010fold increase in the production of daptomycin (Mao et\u00a0al., 2017). The biosynthesis of peptide antibiotics is related to the endogenous metabolite states of the cell, such as sporulation (Marahier et\u00a0al., 1993). AbrB is a global regulator that controls the expression of genes involved in the transition state between the postexponential phase and stationary phase and sporulation in B. subtilis (Strauch et\u00a0al., 1989).

However, quantitative real\u2010time PCR results indicated that the transcription level of the lipopeptide antibiotic polymyxin biosynthetic gene pmxA was reduced in the presence of AbrB. Transcription was significantly recovered upon the deletion of the abrB gene encoding the AbrB regulator, resulting in the efficient production of polymyxin (Park et\u00a0al., 2012).

Advances in gene editing tools and DNA synthesis enable multiplex genome engineering of industrial chassis organisms for optimize bioproduction (Barbieri et\u00a0al., 2017; Fig.\u20093). Multiplexed automated genome engineering (MAGE) permits access to a library of mutants with diverse genotypes by introducing oligonucleotides, including insertions, deletions and mismatches (Auxillos et\u00a0al., 2019). The combination of this technique with suitable screening approaches could be utilized to investigate target strains that possess optimized in\u00a0vivo metabolic fluxes for target products. Recently, the CRISPRi\u2010based programmable circuit was designed to regulate the metabolic pathway, completing dynamic and self\u2010regulatory dual control of metabolic flux without external inducers (Wu et\u00a0al., 2020).", "Organelle engineering", "Organelle engineering", "Organelle engineering", "Subcellular organelles play vital roles in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites based on the spatial distribution of enzymes in eukaryotes (Keller, 2015; Hammer and Avalos, 2017). As an example, peroxisomes are nearly ubiquitous single\u2010membrane organelles involved in the biosynthesis of fungal metabolites (Stehlik et\u00a0al., 2014). The biosynthesis of penicillin and related cephalosporins requires specific enzymatic reactions within the peroxisomes (Bartoszewska et\u00a0al., 2011). This suggests that subcellular compartmentalization of enzymes involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis may have a promising engineering potential (Fig.\u20093). Herr et\u00a0al. tested the peroxisome targeting strategy for the localization of main enzymes of penicillin biosynthesis in A. nidulans. A peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) tag was incorporated into the non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthase AcvA, which led to a 3.2\u2010fold increase in penicillin production. Moreover, increased peroxisomes through overexpression of pexK also led to improvement in penicillin production (Herr and Fischer, 2014). The biosynthesis of RiPPs is main involved in the ribosome translation with the incorporation of 20 canonical amino acids into the peptide chain. The non\u2010canonical amino acids (ncAAs) as building blocks are available through the interference of translation process via ribosome, which paves the way to expand structural diversity of ribosomal peptides (Budisa, 2013). For example, Tianero et\u00a0al.\u2009(2012) revealed that the specific ncAA can be incorporated into the precursor peptide of cyanobactin using an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl\u2010tRNA synthetase (tRNA/aaRS) pair in response to the nonsense or frameshift mutation. Recently, it was demonstrated that ribosome engineering exerted tremendous effects on the production of secondary metabolites (Lopatniuk et\u00a0al., 2019). Several results showed that ribosomal protein S12 was related to drug resistance of producer and mutations in the ribosomal protein S12 efficiently increased small peptide production (Huo et\u00a0al., 2012; Wang et\u00a0al., 2014).", "Subcellular organelles play vital roles in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites based on the spatial distribution of enzymes in eukaryotes (Keller, 2015; Hammer and Avalos, 2017).
