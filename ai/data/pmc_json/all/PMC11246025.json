["Advances in understanding the pathological mechanisms of breast cancer have resulted in the emergence of novel therapeutic strategies. However, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a molecular subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis, lacks classical and general therapeutic targets, hindering the clinical application of several therapies to breast cancer. As insights into the unique immunity and molecular mechanisms of TNBC have become more extensive, immunotherapy has gradually become a valuable complementary approach to classical radiotherapy and chemotherapy. CD8+ cells are significant actors in the tumor immunity cycle; thus, research on TNBC immunotherapy is increasingly focused in this direction. Recently, CD8+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, a subpopulation of CD8+ cells, have been explored in relation to breast cancer and found to seemingly play an undeniably important role in tumor surveillance and lymphocytic infiltration. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the mechanisms and relative targets of CD8+ T cells, and discuss the features and potential applications of CD8+ TRM cells in non-luminal breast cancer immunotherapy.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Early trends in breast cancer research focused on killing tumor cells directly, bringing radiotherapy and chemotherapy into general use. However, both of them do not localize adequately to the tumor site, and the accidental destruction of normal tissues and systems limits the clinical benefit of these techniques and even hinders a good prognosis. Thus, there is no doubt that the development of immunotherapy provided a tremendous infusion of hope to breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2+ breast cancer. Currently, chemotherapy remains the mainstream treatment method for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for over 15\u201320% of breast cancer cases without the classical hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 (Garrido-Castro, Lin & Polyak, 2019). Whatever the choices of times for TNBC chemotherapy, metastases and relapses and drug resistances are more likely to be caused in these patients without proper maintenance therapy as they are throughout other type breast cancers. Moreover, the molecular heterogeneity within TNBC cells should also take on a fairly negative role which lead to a more aggressive disease course and low immune response underlie the poor prognosis of TNBC compared with other molecular types of breast cancer. Thus, the application value of immunotherapy in TNBC is revealed through the investigation of multiple targets.", "Early trends in breast cancer research focused on killing tumor cells directly, bringing radiotherapy and chemotherapy into general use.

A previous systematic review including 13,914 cases of breast cancer confirmed that a median of about 60% and 61% of TNBC and HER2+ cases, respectively, contain CD8+ T cells, compared with only 43% of HR+ breast cancers (Stanton, Adams & Disis, 2016). TNBC and HER2+ breast cancer are considered to have high immunogenicity, which equates to their being slightly hotter from the viewpoint of immunity, although breast cancer in general tends to be cold (Corti, Nicol\u00f2 & Curigliano, 2021). In addition to the total count of T cell, the density and localization of this kind of immune cell is also crucial to the therapeutic efficacy. Clinical data indicate that a high level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is aligned with favorable outcomes and response rates to chemotherapy in solid tumors, with the density of CTLs in the tumor being particularly important (Koh et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2021; Topalian et al., 2016). These results further indicate that focusing more on CD8+ T cells has extensive prospects for the treatment of HR\u2013 breast cancer, especially for TNBC. Furthermore, we can conclude that the infiltration of CTLs is helpful for subsequent evaluations of breast cancer and even determine whether intensive adjuvant therapy or immunotherapy need to be plugged into clinical strategies.", "Though there are several types of tumor-infiltrating cells, we mainly discuss the high levels of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in breast cancer in this review.

Clinical research on breast cancer showed that the dominant blocking sites consist of CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death receptor 1 and ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1). In contrast to conventional immunotherapy, which also has a killing effect on tumor cells, ICBs play an indirect role in anti-tumor immunity by enhancing the immune response driven by CD8+ T cells and/or alleviating the depletion of CTLs (Farhood, Najafi & Mortezaee, 2019). CTLA-4 blockers, including ipilimumab, can strengthen the activity of CD4+ T cells, which affects CD8+ T cells. PD-1 and its coupled PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells and PD-L2 attached to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages can decrease the production of IFN-\u03b3 via certain interactions and/or individually, and the associated checkpoint inhibitors mainly comprise nivolumab and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) (Kansy et al., 2017; He et al., 2019). Several Phase III clinical trials have already demonstrated significant benefits for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and pathological complete response (PCR) using anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Therefore, regular first-line chemotherapy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with ICBs have been approved as the standard treatment regimens for PD-L1-positive TNBC (Schmid et al., 2020b; Cortes et al., 2020; Schmid et al., 2020a). However, one study showed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 on its own might lead to the upregulation of Tim-3, one of the checkpoints, thereby increasing the expression of PD-1 (Tumeh et al., 2014). Therefore, the blockage of two or even multiple targets is theoretically superior to antagonizing a single target, such as PD-1-Tim-3 blockade plus B and T cell lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) blockade or PD-1 and/or CTLA-4 blockade plus a CD27 agonist (Farhood, Najafi & Mortezaee, 2019; Van De Ven & Borst, 2015).", "The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICBs) as immunotherapy has matured.

The primary components and functional units of engineered T cells that have been constructed in vitro are enriched with extracellular single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) welded to the surface of the cells through the flexure hinge, transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domain, including the CD3 \u03b6-chain intracellular domain and co-stimulating domain. These kinds of constructs can release pro-inflammatory cytokines, promote the expression of the Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L/CD178) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and secrete cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes to induce target cell apoptosis (Xie et al., 2020). Furthermore, genetically engineered T cells with the gene transfer of CAR via a viral vector also have the potential for proliferation, such as the CLASH system with adeno-associated viruses (Corti et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2023). The characteristics of CAR-T confer better stability, higher coverage, and greater specificity in comparison with other treatments (Xie et al., 2020). So far, specific targets reported in breast cancer include AXL, FR\u03b1, TROP2, EGFR (HER1), mesothelin (MSLN), SSEA-4, tumor endothelial marker (TEM8/ANTXR1), CSPG4 (MCSP/HMW-MAA), \u03b1v\u03b23, c-Met (HGFR), NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL), ICAM-1 (CD54), GD2, ROR1, MUC1, CD44v6, EpCAM, EphA10, Notch, CLDN18.2 and endosialin (CD248) (Xie et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Ash et al., 2024). These can be involved in building scFvs, especially for TNBC. The targets mentioned above have been suggested to be correlated with the proliferation, migration, anti-apoptotic characteristics, invasion, and drug resistance of tumor cells, as well as tumor angiogenesis and T cell immunosuppressive effects (Xie et al., 2020; Corti et al., 2022). As to HER2+ breast cancer, CARHer2 T cell is possibly conductive to induce more Th1 cytokines which can kill more tumor cells (Xie et al., 2023). Even though the correlation between different targets and tumor cells and the feasibility of incorporating these targets into the construction of engineered CD8+ T cells have been demonstrated, there are challenges surrounding the application and development of CAR-T, such as the restriction of transportation and homing due to the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the limited motivation of the construction, immune escape caused by tumor heterogeneity, extracellular toxicities including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) (Corti, Nicol\u00f2 & Curigliano, 2021; Ash et al., 2024; Shah et al., 2023). It has been demonstrated that CAR-T cell treatment would have the better anti tumor effect combined with some kind of specific target therapy, such as PD-L1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody (Gao et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023). To boost CD8+ T cells, it is supposed to improve the structure of CAR-T, for example, to activate T cells more accurately and efficiently and modify the immune response via two or even multiple targets comprising different antigens. Currently, FR\u03b1 plus MLSN, HER2 plus MUC1, and PSMA plus PSCA are undergoing preclinical studies (Xie et al., 2020). Moreover, engineered cells can be encoded by introducing suicide genes into T cells that regulate their exhaustion or screening specific targets that overlap minimally with normal tissues and/or maximally with suppressive immune cells (To et al., 2022), apart from addressing adverse effects by monitoring related clinical indicators passively to address extracellular toxicities (Thompson et al., 2019).", "Compared with the ICBs mentioned above, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, which fall into the category of adoptive cell therapy (ACT), have even more direct and immediate cytotoxic activity, especially in TNBC with high immunogenicity.

Based on the first-generation CAR-T modified by the CD3 \u03b6 single chain, an extra co-stimulating domain has been added in second-generation CARs; these mature co-stimulating domains, such as 4-1BB (CD137) or CD28, play a vital role in the construction of various CAR-T. Compared with CD28, 4-1BB might better augment memory cell function as well as prolong the time of survival and activity (Kawalekar et al., 2016). Other co-stimulating domains in third-generation CARs include ICOS (CD278), OX40 (CD34), DAP10, and CD27 (Corti et al., 2022; Honikel & Olejniczak, 2022). The fourth-generation CARs can also activate downstream transcription factors to induce the production of non-specific cytokines and target tumor tissues rather than the regular enhancement of CD8+ T cells (Chmielewski & Abken, 2015), by which remodeling CTLs enhance cytotoxicity against tumor cells, in principle. Currently, CAR-T therapy for solid tumors, such as breast cancer, is still at the preclinical stage.

It is widely known that CTLs expressing the CD8 receptor usually attack tumor cells in the presence of MHC I molecules. In the earliest stage of the immune cycle, DCs capture certain TAAs in their role as potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and produce a specific antigen peptide via degradation by the proteasome, resulting in a conjugate of the peptide and MHC I molecules that is then transferred from the interior of the cell to the surface (Rock, Reits & Neefjes, 2016). The complex can then be recognized by TCRs expressed by CTLs to prime naive CD8+ T cells, which form a wide range of subpopulations including effector T cells (TEFFs) and memory precursor cells. The latter further differentiate into central memory T cells (TCMs), effector memory T cells (TEMs), stem cell memory T cells (TSCMs), and a non-circulating subset of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs). Moreover, TCMs, TSCMs, and TRMs seem to be able to self-renew and interconvert (Zebley, Gottschalk & Youngblood, 2020; Han et al., 2020).", "Much research has demonstrated that a high level of CTLs is closely related with clinical benefits, whether through a direct effect on the tumor or indirect assistance with other treatments, thus that is turn out to be winner of anti-tumor process compared with CD4+ T cells (Melief, 2015; Zou et al., 2020).

Due to the negative influence about high load of tumor antigens and the suppressive TME, intracellular changes involving chromosome aberrations, dysregulated transcription, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic disorders occur, of which the dysfunction of the signaling pathways of diverse cytokines (interleukin (IL)-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1), the overexpression of inhibitory receptors (IRs PD-1, Tim-3, LAG-3), and the reduction of cell lysis, survival, and proliferation are in accordance with the results mentioned above (He et al., 2019). It has been reported that cytokines originating from tumor cells and suppressor cells in the TME lead to T cell depletion in different ways; the former contain adenosine, IDO and VEGF-A, while the latter contain IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-35.

To account for this, the reversal effect of ICBs on TEX has recently gained prominence, having been particularly noted for PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 mentioned previously. There is some evidence that PD-1 inhibits immune cells by dephosphorylating the downstream molecules of CD28 and TCR mediated by SHP2, and CTLA-4 expressed by Tregs competes with CD28 embedded in CD8+ T cells for CD80/CD86 from DCs, which tends to decrease the activation of CTLs by DCs (Farhood, Najafi & Mortezaee, 2019; Hashimoto et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2021).

Interestingly, it has been reported that the evolution of TCRs bound to CTLs occurs during chemotherapy and is associated with clinical efficiency even though this evolution is taking place without orientation and uniformity (Lin et al., 2018). Thus, chemotherapy cannot be characterized simply as an immune suppressor. Interestingly, CXCL13+ CD8+ T cell level in TNBC patients with the combination therapy of paclitaxel and atezolizumab was seemingly higher than those with paclitaxel alone (Zhang et al., 2021).

Compared with radiotherapy, precise ablation, a new treatment for breast cancer, plays a prominent role in potentiating the immune system. More and more evidence shows that microwave ablation (MWA) helps to release high amounts of TAAs and cytokines to reshape the TME apart from precisely attacking the local tumor, which is possibly related to the activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cell (Xiao, Wu & Jiang, 2024). However, some research demonstrates that CD8+ T cells activated by MWA have impaired immune features, such as TEX and emission dysfunction of IFN-\u03b3 (Zhou et al., 2022).

Introduced as a specific cell lineage developing from CD8+ T cells, TRMs play a vital role in the maintenance of the anti-tumor immune response in cancers with higher heterogeneity, especially breast cancer originating from the epithelium. It is also suggested that high infiltration of TRMs indicates a favorable prognosis (Molodtsov & Turk, 2018). So far, biological markers for this specific subpopulation of CD8+ T cells mainly include CD103 (\u03b1E\u03b27), CD69, CD49a (VLA-1), and PD-1 (Mami-Chouaib et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017). A study showed that CD103 and CD49a could enhance the maintenance of TRMs in conjunction with E-cadherin and collagen IV associated with tumor cells where cytotoxicity could be further developed. CD69 acts as a marker for T cell activation, which could interfere with the expression of tumor promoters like S1PR1 and CCR7 (Mackay et al., 2015). Apart from counteracting the egress of TRMs through the upregulation of upstream regions and signaling molecules for maintenance and adhesion, TRMs can also strengthen peripheral tolerance via various pathways, such as HAVCR2, CTLA4, PDCD1, LAG3, and TIGIT (Byrne et al., 2020; Corgnac et al., 2018; Han et al., 2020). Intriguingly, most of these genes are related to immune checkpoint proteins like PD-1, CTLA-4, and Tim-3 (Mami-Chouaib et al., 2018) that mediate TEX as mentioned previously; therefore, further research should be conducted on the partnership between ICBs and the viability of TRMs. Moreover, there are certain special transcription factors in TRMs, including KLF2, Notch-RBPJ, RunX3, Hobit, BATF, Blimp1, Enome and Tbet (Mami-Chouaib et al., 2018; Milner et al., 2017; Mackay et al., 2016).

TRMs can recruit circulating non-specific memory T cells (TMs), and bystander CD8+ T cells have the potential to differentiate into TRMs with or without the stimulation of local antigens, although cellular location and proliferation are restricted by a lack of CD103 (Beura et al., 2018; Behr et al., 2021). Furthermore, local inflammation is involved in the development of TRMs (der Gracht ETI, Behr & Arens, 2021).

Apart from exploring ways to increase the quantity and quality of CD8+ TRMs in breast cancer, approaches to balance the positive and negative effects of T cells in the human body and maximize their clinical benefit warrant exploration in the future.", "The CD8+ T cell subpopulation of TRMs has been confirmed to play a crucial role in immune surveillance and the immune response in breast cancer relative to general CD8+ T cells characterized by short longevity, slow action, and poor targeting and attacking abilities (Savas et al., 2018). Regarding CTL-associated therapy in breast cancer, a few reviews address two aspects of this subject, namely how to improve the quality and the quantity of TRMs. We also summarize and extend the analysis of the developmental properties of CD8+ TRMs combined with their potential targets. Differences in TRM phenotypes and expression features have been found in different types of tumors (Wang et al., 2020), which contribute to the uniform specific treatment related to TRM. Thus far, people have even more constrained knowledge about TRMs, especially in relation to breast cancer.
