["According to WHO report, globally about 10 million active tuberculosis cases, resulting in about 1.6 million deaths, further aggravated by drug-resistant tuberculosis and/or comorbidities with HIV and diabetes are present. Incomplete therapeutic regimen, meager dosing, and the capability of the latent and/or active state tubercular bacilli to abide and do survive against contemporary first-line and second line antitubercular drugs escalate the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. As a better understanding of tuberculosis, microanatomy has discovered an extended range of new promising antitubercular targets and diagnostic biomarkers. However, there are still no new approved antitubercular drugs of routine therapy for several decades, except for bedaquiline, delamanid, and pretomanid approved tentatively. Despite this, innovative methods are also urgently needed to find potential new antitubercular drug candidates, which potentially decimate both latent state and active state mycobacterium tuberculosis. To explore and identify the most potential antitubercular drug candidate among various reported compounds, we focused to highlight the promising lead derivatives of isoniazid, coumarin, griselimycin, and the antimicrobial peptides. The aim of the present review is to fascinate significant lead compounds in the development of potential clinical drug candidates that might be more precise and effective against drug-resistant tuberculosis, the world research looking for a long time.", "1.

Therefore, it is urgent to find a way to strengthen the current antibiotic therapy regimen against drug-resistant tuberculosis [8]. The process of novel drug development to fight out the resistant strains of tubercular infections has been considered for a long time, and some of the significant candidates are in various stages of clinical trials [9]. Unfortunately, the drug development and approval processes are too lengthy, and these agents are often generally not as effective as expected.

Recent advancements in molecular biology and mycobacterial disease immunopathogenesis have contributed to substantial studies in such research areas. Numerous vaccines are manufacturing for prevention or therapeutic purposes [11,12]. We should, however, wait in the coming years for accessible and reliable vaccines.

The activated isoniazid molecule is responsible for suppressing biosynthesis of mycolic acid by enoyl-ACP reductase inhibition, an enzyme elaborated in the biosynthesis of fatty acid in the existence of NAD+ or NADH [35]. So, the enoyl-ACP reductase is considered one of the finest-validated targets in the therapeutics of tuberculosis. Isoniazid resistance is mostly mediated by the mutations of the katG gene, which leads to the drug activation incapability, one of the prominent factors responsible for mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance in the clinical settings [36]. The mutation rate liable for isoniazid resistance is 100 times greater than rifampicin mutation [37].", "Castelo-Branco et al.
