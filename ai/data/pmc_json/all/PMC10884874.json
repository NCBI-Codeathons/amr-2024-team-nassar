["Abstract", "Among the plant\u2010associated microorganisms, the so\u2010called endophytes continue to attract much attention because of their ability not only to protect host plants from biotic and abiotic stress factors, but also the potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. The latter property can elicit growth\u2010promoting effects on plants, as well as boost the production of plant\u2010specific secondary metabolites with valuable pharmacological properties. In addition, endophyte\u2010derived secondary metabolites may be a rich source for the discovery of drugs to treat various diseases, including infections and cancer. However, the full potential of endophytes to produce bioactive secondary metabolites is often not revealed upon conventional cultivation in the laboratory. New advances in genomics and metabolic engineering offer exciting opportunities for the exploration and exploitation of endophytes' biosynthetic potential. This review focuses on bacterial endophytes of medicinal plants, some of their secondary metabolites and recent advances in deciphering their biosynthesis. The latter may assist in genetic engineering efforts aimed at the discovery of novel bioactive compounds with the potential to be developed into drugs.", "Bacteria dwelling within tissues of medicinal plants, the so\u2010called endophytes, represent a unique source of secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities. Modern approaches such as \u201cgenome mining\u201d and metabolic engineering provide new opportunities for revealing the biosynthetic potential of bacterial endophytes and assisting in identification of novel compounds which may fuel drug discovery pipelines.", "Zotchev, S.B.\n (2024) Unlocking the potential of bacterial endophytes from medicinal plants for drug discovery.

Up until the 20th century, most of the healing properties of medicinal plants have been fulfilled via plant extracts, usually prepared as ethanol or water infusions. Although in many cases the medicinal effect of plant extracts was most likely due to a combination of bioactive natural products in these very complex mixtures, the presence of harmful substances could not be ruled out. In addition, variations in growth conditions, such as temperature, soil composition, humidity, UV exposure etc. most likely affect the ratio of bioactive compounds in plant extracts. To circumvent these problems, later efforts have focused on the identification of individual bioactive components in complex plant extracts which could be used as controlled, single\u2010component medicines, such as for example, paclitaxel, an anti\u2010cancer drug from Taxus brevifolia and artemisinin, an anti\u2010malarial drug from Artemisia annua. At the same time, a large number of rigorously controlled and tested plant extracts are continued to be used as medicines, apparently due to the synergistic healing effects of their components (Atanasov et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015).", "Medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine to treat various human diseases, including infections and cancer, as well as for the alleviation of related symptoms (Atanasov et\u00a0al.,\u00a02021).

Several in\u00a0vitro studies have demonstrated that endophytic fungi and bacteria can be used as elicitors of plant\u2010specific secondary metabolite production in plant tissue cultures (Khare et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018; Taghinasab & Jabaji,\u00a02020).

The latter compounds are natural products that are not essential for a basic functioning of bacterial cells in the laboratory, but may give their producers an advantage in the natural environment. For example, secondary metabolites may have a role as chemical weapons to repel predators, suppress competitors for nutritional sources (Spagnolo et\u00a0al.,\u00a02021), or serve as metal chelators or signalling molecules for communication with other members of microbial community living within the plant (Bradley et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020; Scherlach & Hertweck,\u00a02020). Interestingly, the ecological functions of secondary metabolites produced by plants appear to be somewhat different from those produced by endophytic bacteria. Indeed, some plant\u2010specific secondary metabolites are known to function as signal molecules used by the plants to attract pollinating insects or seed\u2010dispersing animals (Wink,\u00a02003). Secondary metabolites are biosynthesized by both plants and microorganisms via sophisticated pathways involving various enzymes and precursors derived from primary metabolism. Several studies have shown that bacterial endophytes can produce bioactive secondary metabolites that are similar or even identical to those isolated from host plants (Ludwig\u2010M\u00fcller,\u00a02015). In addition, a number of unique secondary metabolites never detected in the host plant extracts have been isolated from endophytic bacteria of medicinal plants.

Plant roots extrude into soil substances such as cellulose, organic, amino and fatty acids, phenolics, plant growth hormones, nucleotides, sugars, sterols and vitamins that attract microorganisms and can be used by them as nutritional sources, (Sasse et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018). Bacteria which have the capacity for chemotaxis, the ability to sense specific molecules and move toward or away from their source (Kumar et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020), have an advantage in colonizing the plants by intruding through the root tips or tiny lesions in the roots (Acar et\u00a0al.,\u00a02022). Some bacteria were shown to invade roots using enzymes such as cellulases, xylanases and endoglucanases, which are capable of degrading plant cell wall (Liu et\u00a0al., 2017). Other, non\u2010motile microorganisms such as fungi and filamentous bacteria (e.g. of the genus Streptomyces) that are often reproduced via spores, can colonize the surface of the root first before being able to invade plant tissues.

More importantly, certain endophytic bacteria can stimulate the production of medicinally useful plant products. It has been shown that endophytic Acinetobacter sp. isolated from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum L. stimulates expression of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in this plant (Pandey et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016).

The terpene moiety of the latter is cyclized, leading to the formation of preindosespene, which is subsequently oxidized at C24 to yield indosespene. The formation of xiamycin pentacyclic core is completed by the closure of the central ring. The resulting intermediate, prexiamycin, appears to be spontaneously oxidized to xiamycin A, which can be converted to N\u2010hydroxyxiamycin via N\u2010hydroxylation. The latter modification turned out to be crucial for further structural diversification of xiamycin\u2010like indolosesquiterpenes to yield various xiamycin derivatives such as dixiamycins (xiamycin A, B and C dimers) and chloroxiamycin, by as yet unidentified bacterial enzymes (Zhang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). It seems plausible that XiaK and similar N\u2010hydroxylases can be used for generating chemically diverse libraries of indolosesquiterpenes via biotransformation by bacterial strains expressing various enzymes, for example, halogenases.", "FIGURE 3Biosynthesis of the xiamycins, indolosesquiterpenes isolated from a variety of Streptomyces spp., including endophytes of medicinal plants (compiled from the works of Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al., 2012; Zhang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017).", "FIGURE 3Biosynthesis of the xiamycins, indolosesquiterpenes isolated from a variety of Streptomyces spp., including endophytes of medicinal plants (compiled from the works of Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al., 2012; Zhang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017).", "Biosynthesis of the xiamycins, indolosesquiterpenes isolated from a variety of Streptomyces spp., including endophytes of medicinal plants (compiled from the works of Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al., 2012; Zhang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017).", "Biosynthesis of the xiamycins, indolosesquiterpenes isolated from a variety of Streptomyces spp., including endophytes of medicinal plants (compiled from the works of Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al., 2012; Zhang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017).", "First insights into the biosynthesis of aureothin (Figure\u00a04), the nitrophenyl\u2010substituted polyketide with a range of biological activities, have been gained after identification, cloning and heterologous expression of the aureothin BGC from Streptomyces thioluteus HKI\u2010227 (He & Hertweck,\u00a02003). The aureothin BGC was found to contain nine genes, of which three, aurA, B and C, encode type I polyketide synthases (PKS) apparently responsible for the assembly of the polyketide moiety.

The first PKS type I module is called a loading module, which primes the PKS complex with particular substrates that can range from acyl units to amino acids. The extension of this starting building block is performed by the downstream modules of PKS.
