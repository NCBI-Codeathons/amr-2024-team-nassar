["Bifidobacterium bifidum strains, an important component of probiotic foods, can form biofilms on abiotic surfaces, leading to increased self-resistance. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of B. bifidum biofilm formation. A time series transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis of both B. bifidum biofilm and planktonic cells was performed to identify key genes and metabolites involved in biofilm formation. Two hundred thirty-five nonredundant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (including vanY, pstS, degP, groS, infC, groL, yajC, tadB and sigA) and 219 nonredundant differentially expressed metabolites (including L-threonine, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, ascorbic acid, niacinamide, butyric acid and sphinganine) were identified. Thirteen pathways were identified during the integration of both transcriptomics and metabolomics data, including ABC transporters; quorum sensing; two-component system; oxidative phosphorylation; cysteine and methionine metabolism; glutathione metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis. The DEGs that relate to the integration pathways included asd, atpB, degP, folC, ilvE, metC, pheA, pstS, pyrE, serB, ulaE, yajC and zwf. The differentially accumulated metabolites included L-cystine, L-serine, L-threonine, L-tyrosine, methylmalonate, monodehydroascorbate, nicotinamide, orthophosphate, spermine and tocopherol. These results indicate that quorum sensing, two-component system and amino acid metabolism are essential during B. bifidum biofilm formation.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Biofilm is the aggregation of microorganisms in which cells are frequently embedded in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that are adherent to each other and/or a surface [1]. These EPSs are mainly polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that provide mechanical stability of biofilms and form a three-dimensional polymer network that interconnects and immobilizes biofilm cells [2]. A bacterial biofilm is an emergent form of life based on an EPS matrix representing a protected mode for bacterial cells, which exhibit a set of characteristic features such as desiccation tolerance, resource capture, social cooperation and antimicrobial resistance [3]. Biofilm formation is a complex process involving multiple steps, including initial attachment, accumulation, maturation and dispersion [4].", "Biofilm is the aggregation of microorganisms in which cells are frequently embedded in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that are adherent to each other and/or a surface [1].

The ability of various strains of Bifidobacterium to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces, such as glass, stainless steel, polystyrene and complex food matrices, has been well documented [6,7,8]. Environmental stresses, including oxidative stress, bile, low pH value and nutrient starvation, can induce bacterial biofilm formation [9]. Oxygen exposure causes changes in fatty acids in the bifidobacteria cells and an extension of the lag phase of growth; the cells become elongated and develop a rough surface with many nodes due to abnormal or incomplete cell division, and the oxygen-tolerant bifidobacteria seem to defend against oxygen stress through the increase in the content of short fatty acids and cyclopropane fatty acids and the induction of an oxygen stress protein [10]. Transcriptomic analysis of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum BBMN68 in response to oxidative shock reveals that 3% oxygen treatment can cause oxidative stress, which contributes to biofilm formation [11]. High concentrations of bile (0.5% and above) may lyse bifidobacterial cells, leading to the release of intracellular signals such as oligopeptides or autoinducer-2 (AI-2) to trigger quorum sensing; extracellular DNA released from lysed cells may also coat the surface and result in additional electrostatic interactions, allowing the adherence of bifidobacteria [12].", "Bifidobacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium bifidum, are believed to be the first colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract; they can form biofilms on mucosa and food residues in the gut lumen [5].

The average biofilm particle size was over 150 \u00b5m with the biofilm rate higher than 85% at 22 h (Figure 1).

Tad IV pili are important surface appendages that are central to the surface-sensing mechanism in the early stages of biofilm formation [26].

YidC, which functions as an integral membrane chaperone/insertase associated with the SecYEG translocon, was identified as a target that can inhibit biofilm formation [33]. Elimination of yidC paralogs in Streptococcus disrupts EPS composition and biofilm development [34]. The tad IV pili gene (tadB) and YidC protein gene (yidC) were both upregulated during biofilm formation (Figure 2d).

Amino acids serve as precursors for energy generation with gluconeogenesis, and less abundance of amino acids in the biofilm state of B. bifidum reflects less energy production, which indicates the biofilm had already attained maturity [16]. Biofilm formation requires cell adhesion, surface conditioning and EPS production, which are energetically expensive processes; however, it is evolutionary justified given the great benefits for bacteria to live embedded in the EPS matrix under oligotrophic conditions; therefore, nascent biofilms in eutrophic systems have reduced lag phases and higher growth rates than biofilms from oligotrophic systems [3,38,39]. In bacterial biofilms, organic acids, including short-chain fatty acids, are mainly produced by the fermentation of sugars and can reduce the pH value [40]. The rate of biofilm formation by Actinomyces naeslundii cells was upregulated by 6.25\u2009mM butyric acid compared to the rate in the control (no short-chain fatty acids) in 96-well microtiter plates, and this upregulation was mediated by GroEL (the heat shock protein) [41]. Another report indicated that the number of biofilms consisting of A. naeslundii cells generated from initial attachment cells in a flow cell system was increased by treatment with 60\u2009mM butyric acid [42].
