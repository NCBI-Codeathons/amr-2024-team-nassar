["Communicated by Yusuf Akhter.", "Bacteriocins are highly diverse, abundant, and heterogeneous antimicrobial peptides that are ribosomally synthesized by bacteria and archaea. Since their discovery about a century ago, there has been a growing interest in bacteriocin research and applications. This is mainly due to their high antimicrobial properties, narrow or broad spectrum of activity, specificity, low cytotoxicity, and stability. Though initially used to improve food quality and safety, bacteriocins are now globally exploited for innovative applications in human, animal, and food systems as sustainable alternatives to antibiotics. Bacteriocins have the potential to beneficially modulate microbiota, providing viable microbiome-based solutions for the treatment, management, and non-invasive bio-diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases. The use of bacteriocins holds great promise in the modulation of food microbiomes, antimicrobial food packaging, bio-sanitizers and antibiofilm, pre/post-harvest biocontrol, functional food, growth promotion, and sustainable aquaculture. This can undoubtedly improve food security, safety, and quality globally. This review highlights the current trends in bacteriocin research, especially the increasing research outputs and funding, which we believe may proportionate the soaring global interest in bacteriocins. The use of cutting-edge technologies, such as bioengineering, can further enhance the exploitation of bacteriocins for innovative applications in human, animal, and food systems.", "Supplementary Information", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00203-024-03948-y.", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00203-024-03948-y.", "Keywords", "Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has risen as one of the major public health challenges in recent times.

LAB is a diverse group of bacteria that has garnered significant interest due to their widely recognized safety status, known as \u2018Generally Recognized as Safe\u2019 (GRAS) and \u2018Qualified Presumption of Safety\u2019 (QPS) status (Reuben et al. 2020; Zimina et al. 2020). Some well-known bacteriocinogenic bacteria commonly found in dairy products include Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum (found in camel, cow, and goat milk), Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and L. plantarum (found in cheese and kefir), and Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus (found in other dairy products) (Reuben et al. 2020; Zimina et al. 2020; Benkirane et al. 2022). Lactobacillus acidophilus is commonly isolated from yogurt and fermented soy products as a bacteriocin-producing bacterium, while Bifidobacterium lactis and Brevibacillus brevis are most commonly found in raw milk (Darbandi et al. 2022). In milk products, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus are the predominant bacteriocin-producing bacteria.", "Interestingly, most of the bacteriocins that have been successfully characterized and identified are produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are frequently found in milk and dairy products.

These bacteria exhibit inhibitory activity against major foodborne pathogens including Aeromonas hydrophila, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, thereby preventing their growth in meat products (Winkowski and Montville 1992; Khan et al. 2016). E. faecium HL7, L. plantarum, and L. brevis LAP2 are commonly associated with fish and seafood (Vijayabaskar and Somasundaram 2008; G\u00f3mez-Sala et al. 2015; Ring\u00f8 et al. 2018), while L. brevis, L. paracasei, L. pentosus, L. fermentum, L. plantarum, Weissella, Pediococcus, and Enterococcus durans are known bacteriocin-producing bacteria found in fruits and vegetables (Knorr 1998; Linares-Morales et al. 2020). Soil is another extensively studied unconventional source of bacteriocinogenic bacteria. Many bacteriocins obtained from soilborne bacteria and rhizosphere exhibit inhibitory and biocidal activity against phytopathogens, pests, and insects, making them useful for plant protection as well as biopesticides, bioinsecticides, and growth stimulants (Lv et al. 2017; Zimina et al. 2020). Soil bacteria, including Pseudomonas putida BW11M1, Bacillus subtilis 14B, and Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) produce bacteriocin putidacin, Bac 14B, and michiganin A which have inhibitory activity against P. putida GR12-2R3, Agrobacter tumefaciens, and C. michiganensis subsp. Sepedonicus, the etiological agents of plant diseases. Similarly, Bacillus clausii GM17 produces bacteriocin Bac GM17 which has broad-spectrum antifungal and antibacterial activity against multiple phytopathogens (Zimina et al. 2020).

Bacteriocin production has long been recognized as an important trait in probiotics or protective cultures (Corr et al. 2007; Dobson et al. 2012; Cotter et al. 2013). Although the exact ecological function of bacteriocins is not fully understood, it is believed that they play a significant role in the functionality of probiotics within their host. Functioning as colonizing peptides, bacteriocins facilitate the colonization and dominance of a producing [probiotic] strain into an already established niche (Riley and Wertz 2002; Anjana 2022). These promising advantages exerted by bacteriocins are attributed to their biofunctional properties and structural diversity (Zhu et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023). Current research focuses on exploring the underlying bioactivity of bacteriocins in the development of novel probiotics for broad and newer applications in biomedicine and the agri-food industry. Under different conditions, probiotic-derived bacteriocins are often evaluated and used alone or in combination with the producing strains (Umair et al. 2022; Hussien et al. 2022; Ahn et al. 2023; Mihailovskaya et al. 2023; Yu et al. 2023). Bacteriocins can directly inhibit pathogens and other competing microorganisms (Majeed et al. 2011; Simons et al. 2020) or modulate the composition and diversity of microbial communities and the host immune system through signaling mechanisms (Cz\u00e1r\u00e1n et al. 2002; Di Cagno et al. 2007; Chikindas et al. 2018). For example, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were successfully controlled using pediocin PA-1-producing P. acidilactici MM33. Conversely, no effect was recorded using the non-pediocin PA-1 producing P. acidilactici MM33 strain (Millette et al. 2008). In separate studies, novel bacteriocins such as cerein B4080, cerein 7B, bacteriocin AS-48, garvicin KS, and micrococcin P1 were studied and proposed as promising alternatives for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections caused by multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Ovchinnikov et al. 2020; Vel\u00e1zquez-Su\u00e1rez et al. 2021; Jaumaux et al. 2023). Like probiotics, the antimicrobial properties of bacteriocins are pathogen-specific and activity-dependent (Tran et al. 2023; Zhu et al. 2023). Similarly, oral administration of bacteriocin (ABP118) producing L. salivarius UCC118 reportedly controlled L. monocytogenes infection than the non-ABP118 producing strain of L. salivarius UCC118 (Corr et al. 2007). Therefore, assessing the antimicrobial profiles of bacteriocins against multiple pathogens under different conditions is a prerequisite for their selection in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in clinical settings.", "Most bacteriocin-producing bacteria, especially (foodborne) LAB and gut commensals are widely used as probiotics or protective cultures in food production and as supplements for animals and humans. Bacteriocin production has long been recognized as an important trait in probiotics or protective cultures (Corr et al. 2007; Dobson et al. 2012; Cotter et al. 2013). Although the exact ecological function of bacteriocins is not fully understood, it is believed that they play a significant role in the functionality of probiotics within their host. Functioning as colonizing peptides, bacteriocins facilitate the colonization and dominance of a producing [probiotic] strain into an already established niche (Riley and Wertz 2002; Anjana 2022). These promising advantages exerted by bacteriocins are attributed to their biofunctional properties and structural diversity (Zhu et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023). Current research focuses on exploring the underlying bioactivity of bacteriocins in the development of novel probiotics for broad and newer applications in biomedicine and the agri-food industry. Under different conditions, probiotic-derived bacteriocins are often evaluated and used alone or in combination with the producing strains (Umair et al. 2022; Hussien et al. 2022; Ahn et al. 2023; Mihailovskaya et al. 2023; Yu et al. 2023).

Therefore, assessing the antimicrobial profiles of bacteriocins against multiple pathogens under different conditions is a prerequisite for their selection in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in clinical settings.", "The common and primary denominator in probiotics and protective cultures is the viability of the cells. Both probiotics and protective cultures essentially consist of live or viable cells specifically selected to confer desired benefits when used in adequate amounts (Hill et al. 2014; Hammami et al. 2019; Fischer and Titgemeyer 2023). However, emerging evidence demonstrates their viability as a non-essential precursor for exerting the desired beneficial properties. Some non-viable components from probiotics and protective cultures, such as bacteriocins and postbiotics, can exude comparable beneficial properties (Raman et al. 2016; Hammami et al. 2019; Homayouni Rad et al. 2021; Mack et al. 2022; Liang and Xing 2023; Teng et al. 2023).

In most cases, microbial strains used as probiotics or protective cultures are generally benign and pose no risk. However, untoward conditions, especially horizontal transfer directly or indirectly predispose them to acquire or spread antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among the commensal microbiota (and opportunistic pathogens) inhabiting the same niche (Imperial and Ibana 2016; Costa et al. 2018; Kothari et al. 2019). Human or animal microbiota is believed to be a trove of numerous [functional] genes, including antibiotic resistance genes which can be easily shared or transferred between resident and transient bacteria (e.g., probiotics and pathogens) (Kothari et al. 2019). Several studies have extensively documented the transfer of undesirable genes between the resident microbiota (in the gut or food) and the strains used as probiotics or protective cultures (Hu et al. 2013; Aarts and Margolles 2014; Abriouel et al. 2015; Wolfe 2023; Sada et al. 2024). Other concerns associated with the use of probiotics and protective cultures include deleterious metabolic activities and imbalances, the eruption of excessive immune responses, persistent microbial colonization that disrupts the normal microbiota, septicemia, and localized or systemic infections (Spano et al. 2010; Doron and Snydman 2015; Pararajasingam and Uwagwu 2017; Costa et al. 2018; Kim et al. 2018; Sada et al. 2024).", "In recent decades, there have been overwhelming concerns associated with the use of probiotics and protective cultures, particularly regarding the acquisition and distribution of undesired genes, such as antibiotic resistance and virulence.

Since most microbial strains used as probiotics or protective cultures produce known (or unknown) bacteriocins or bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) that exert similar beneficial effects as the viable strains, it is believed that researchers may sooner than expected preferably explore the use of bacteriocins to mitigate the concerns associated with the use of viable cells. Bacteriocins seem to pose little or no risks for use within animal, human, and food systems while exerting their heterogeneous beneficial effects. Therefore, they may be the most preferred choice for broad applications earlier than anticipated.

Since their discovery, bacteriocins have been used to improve food production, preservation, and safety in the food industry. However, their potential has now extended to various fields, including biotechnology, ecology, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, clinical settings, and veterinary medicine. Bacteriocins offer sustainable solutions to a wide range of scientific problems. Here, we critically evaluated and compiled the significant advances and emerging roles of bacteriocins as well as the latest bacteriocin-related innovations aimed at harnessing their heterogeneous potential and prospects for multisectoral applications in health and agrifood systems.

Numerous studies have highlighted the indiscriminate impact of antibiotics on the microbiota, resulting in dysbiosis and perturbations of microbial composition and diversity that predispose the host to metabolic and immune system disorders (Francino 2015; Sanchez-Rodriguez et al. 2020; Hou et al. 2022). Unlike antibiotics, bacteriocins have a narrow spectrum of activity, are highly specific, and can inhibit pathogens without disrupting host-microbiota homeostasis or causing detrimental effects. Bacteriocins that can promote beneficial shifts in the abundance, composition, and diversity of the microbiota may provide sustainable and valuable microbiome-based solutions for the treatment of infectious and non-infectious microbiome-related diseases resulting from microbiota dysbiosis.", "Furthermore, bacteriocin production by most bacteria can be seen as a strategy to modulate the microbiome (Pu et al. 2022; O\u2019Reilly et al. 2023; R\u00edos Colombo et al. 2023; Rani and Tiwari 2023; Puls et al. 2024). Bacteriocins can either prevent invasion by allochthonous bacteria (competitors or pathogens) or stimulate the immune system to prevent oxidative stress and inflammation (Dahiya et al. 2017; B\u00e4uerl et al. 2017; Heilbronner et al. 2021; Rani and Tiwari 2023; Puls et al. 2024).

Food microbiota are often modulated through the regulation of abiotic factors or by using specific microorganisms and/or their products, such as bacteriocins (And and Hoover 2003; Walsh et al. 2023). The latter involves the use of various forms of bacteriocins, whether purified or semi-purified, and/or bacteriocin-producing strains to modulate food microbiota (O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2003; Ramu et al. 2015; Silva et al. 2018). It has been demonstrated that the microbiota of fermented foods (e.g., cheese and kefir) can be modulated, making them useful models for shaping food microbiota (Wolfe et al. 2014; Bonham et al. 2017; Wolfe 2018; Blasche et al. 2021; Walsh et al. 2023). The application of bacteriocins or bacteriocin-producing strains as starter or protective cultures in dairy products can confer numerous advantages during food processing. They can modulate the food microbiota by accelerating ripening, as is the case with cheese (\u00c1vila et al. 2005; Martinez et al. 2015), or reduce the growth of adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) and other non-starter microbiota in fermented foods (Oumer et al. 2001; O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2003), or inhibit invasion by environmental or spoilage organisms (Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2004, 2007), or significantly reduce the growth of foodborne pathogens (Carnio et al. 2000; Aspri et al. 2017; Kondrotiene et al. 2018), or accelerate enzyme release and activities (O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2003), or enhance fermentation (Oumer et al. 2001).

During vinification, bacteriocin production could be an important characteristic to consider when selecting LAB as starters for malolactic fermentation. Furthermore, bacteriocins produced by LAB have significant potential for use as biocontrol agents against foodborne and spoilage organisms as well as biopreservatives throughout the enological processes (D\u00edez et al. 2012; D\u00fcndar 2016; Fern\u00e1ndez-P\u00e9rez et al. 2018).", "Bacteriocins have also been used to modulate food microbiota to improve organoleptic properties, quality, and microbiological safety.

It has been demonstrated that the microbiota of fermented foods (e.g., cheese and kefir) can be modulated, making them useful models for shaping food microbiota (Wolfe et al. 2014; Bonham et al. 2017; Wolfe 2018; Blasche et al. 2021; Walsh et al. 2023). The application of bacteriocins or bacteriocin-producing strains as starter or protective cultures in dairy products can confer numerous advantages during food processing. They can modulate the food microbiota by accelerating ripening, as is the case with cheese (\u00c1vila et al. 2005; Martinez et al. 2015), or reduce the growth of adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) and other non-starter microbiota in fermented foods (Oumer et al. 2001; O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2003), or inhibit invasion by environmental or spoilage organisms (Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2004, 2007), or significantly reduce the growth of foodborne pathogens (Carnio et al. 2000; Aspri et al. 2017; Kondrotiene et al. 2018), or accelerate enzyme release and activities (O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2003), or enhance fermentation (Oumer et al. 2001). Additionally, bacteriocin production has been detected in LAB bacteria recovered from wine during malolactic fermentation, especially among L. plantarum strains (Navarro et al. 2000; Rojo-Bezares et al. 2008; D\u00edez et al. 2012). During vinification, bacteriocin production could be an important characteristic to consider when selecting LAB as starters for malolactic fermentation. Furthermore, bacteriocins produced by LAB have significant potential for use as biocontrol agents against foodborne and spoilage organisms as well as biopreservatives throughout the enological processes (D\u00edez et al. 2012; D\u00fcndar 2016; Fern\u00e1ndez-P\u00e9rez et al. 2018).", "Bacteriocins have also been used to modulate food microbiota to improve organoleptic properties, quality, and microbiological safety.

This suggests that bacteriocins may have applications in previously unknown fields, and we anticipate further research and applications in these areas in the coming years.", "Harnessing the ubiquitous nature of bacteriocins could help in their exploitation for broad applications in innovative areas of the human, animal, and food systems. The food system is benefiting immensely from commercially available bacteriocins. However, the scope of bacteriocin applications in the food system could be expanded in areas such as [fermented] food microbiota modulation, antimicrobial packaging/coating, biosanitizers, antibiofilm, pre/post-harvest biocontrol, and functional food.", "Harnessing the ubiquitous nature of bacteriocins could help in their exploitation for broad applications in innovative areas of the human, animal, and food systems.

Bacteriocin modulatory activity can provide a viable microbiome-based solution for the treatment and management of microbiome-associated diseases. Bacteriocins also have the potential for non-invasive bio-diagnosis and could be used for diagnosing both infectious and non-infectious diseases, thus complementing conventional diagnostic tools. In terms of agriculture, the growth-promoting effect of bacteriocins in both plants and animals would undoubtedly improve food security, safety, and quality, as well as promote sustainable agriculture and mitigate concerns associated with antibiotic use.", "Furthermore, the use of bacteriocins in the modulation of human and animal microbiota can beneficially improve the composition, diversity, and richness of the microbiota, fostering health and well-being.
