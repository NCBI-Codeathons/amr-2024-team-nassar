["Bacterial polyynes are highly active natural products with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. However, their detailed mechanism of action remains unclear. By integrating comparative genomics, transcriptomics, functional genetics, and metabolomics analysis, we identified a unique polyyne resistance gene, masL (encoding acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), in the biosynthesis gene cluster of antifungal polyynes (massilin A 1, massilin B 2, collimonin C 3, and collimonin D 4) of Massilia sp. YMA4. Crystallographic analysis indicated that bacterial polyynes serve as covalent inhibitors of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. Moreover, we confirmed that the bacterial polyynes disrupted cell membrane integrity and inhibited the cell viability of Candida albicans by targeting ERG10, the homolog of MasL. Thus, this study demonstrated that acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase is a potential target for developing antifungal agents.", "In a multi-omics analysis, bacterial polyynes are found to act as antifungal agents by inhibiting the Candida albicans polyyne resistance gene ERG10, the homolog of MasL encoding acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Polyynes or polyacetylenes contain a conformationally rigid rod-like architecture and an electron-rich consecutive acetylene moiety.

To further verify the function of other core biosynthetic genes, we use plasmid-derived insertion mutagenesis to gain serial mutants of mas BGC from masD (encoded FAAL) to masL (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and 3). YMA4::masD, YMA4::masE, YMA4::masF, YMA4::masH, and YMA4::masI exhibited completely disrupted polyyne biosynthesis. YMA4::masJ exhibited significantly decreased production of polyynes. However, YMA4::masK and YMA4::masL did not affect the biosynthesis process.", "To complement the mutagenesis results, we further established an E. coli heterologous co-expression system of mas genes to determine whether the genes participate in polyyne biosynthesis. The engineered E. coli mas\u2013 (heterologous co-expression with masD to masJ) produced a relatively nonpolar polyyne (Fig.\u00a02a).

The expression of masL rescued fungal cell viability from polyyne inhibition under minimum inhibitory concentration (Fig.\u00a04 and Supplementary Table\u00a07). Furthermore, an in vitro acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (MasL) inhibition assay showed that polyynes (collimonin C/D 1, 2, and massilin A 3) inhibited the MasL enzyme activity (Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a030). Since the drug target identification could be achieved by gene overexpression for gain-of-function of resistance27, we suggest masL serves as a self-resistance gene in the mas BGC, and the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase it encodes is the target of collimonin C/D 1, 2 and massilin A 3. This targeting manner might explain why the growth of mas expressed E. coli is unaffected when producing polyynes without masL because E. coli has an acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-independent route, the methylerythritol phosphate (also called deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate) pathway, to produce isoprenoid28,29.

The monomer of MasL shares the general fold architecture reported in the type II biosynthetic thiolase family31. MasL consists of three domains: an N-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 domain (N-domain, residues 1\u2013121 and 251\u2013271), a loop domain (L-domain, residues 122\u2013250), and a C-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 domain (C-domain, residues 272\u2013394) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a032). The N- and C-domains form a typical five-layered fold (\u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b1) as observed in the structures of the other type II biosynthetic thiolases including Zoogloea ramigera PhaA31, Clostridium acetobutylicum CEA_G288032, and Aspergillus fumigatus ERG10A33. The L-domain displays an \u03b1/\u03b2 fold with a tetramerization loop associated with the C-domain.Table 2X-ray data collection and refinement statistics.MasLMasL-collimonin C complexMasL-collimonin D complexPDB code7EI37EI47FEAData collectionSpace groupP1P21P1Cell dimensions\u00a0a, b, c (\u00c5)71.786, 76.995, 98.08259.139, 115.077, 125.78966.943, 77.741, 98.117\u00a0\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 (\u00b0)79.77, 79.00, 62.9890.00, 91.08, 90.0070.76, 81.78, 64.99Resolution (\u00c5)*30.0\u20131.78 (1.84-1.78)30.0\u20131.66 (1.72-1.66)30.0\u20131.40 (1.45-1.40)Rmerge0.045 (0.233)0.082 (0.560)0.056 (0.553)I / \u03c3I23.8 (5.0)17.7 (2.0)16.3 (2.0)Completeness (%)*92.3 (85.2)99.4 (94.4)94.8 (86.0)Redundancy*3.8 (3.9)5.6 (4.8)2.9 (2.5)RefinementResolution (\u00c5)29.9\u20131.7829.2\u20131.6627.16-1.40No. reflections160,857180,941292,742Rwork/Rfree0.128/0.1800.114/0.1620.146/0.163No. atoms\u00a0Protein11,52211,54411,808\u00a0Ligand/ion\u20138080\u00a0Water1,6631,7201,671B-factors\u00a0Protein22.318.319.8\u00a0Ligand/ion\u201344.053.3\u00a0Water34.934.132.6R.m.s. deviations\u00a0Bond lengths (\u00c5)0.0080.0090.015\u00a0Bond angles (\u00b0)1.4551.4491.530*Highest-resolution shell is shown in parentheses.Fig. 5X-ray structures and polar interaction within the binding site of MasL-collimonin C and MasL-collimonin D complex.Overall views of the crystal structures of MasL-collimonin C complex (a) and MasL-collimonin D (b).

In contrast, the C(6)OH of collimonin D 2 did not form a polar interaction network at the contrasting face and showed fixed spatial direction (dihedral angle to C(7)OH from 32.9\u02da to 42.6\u02da) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a036). The polar interaction network derived from C(6)OH of collimonin C 1 further affected the distal carboxyl group binding model. Furthermore, the reduced binding strength from the salt bridge (in MasL-collimonin D complex) to the hydrogen bond (in MasL-collimonin C complex) corresponded to their inhibition kinetic, that collimonin D 2 has a lower KI (42.84\u2009\u03bcM) than collimonin C 1 (297.10\u2009\u03bcM) (Table\u00a01). The above information suggests that the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group on polyynes is vital for initial non-covalent complex affinity.
