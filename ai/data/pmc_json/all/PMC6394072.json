["Surfactin, one of the most powerful microbial surfactants, is a lipopeptide-type biosurfactant which combines interesting physicochemical properties and biological activities. However, the high cost caused by its low productivity largely limits the commercial application of surfactin. Hence, many engineered bacterium have also been used to enhance surfactin biosynthesis. This review briefly summarizes the mechanism of surfactin biosynthesis, highlighting the synthesis pathway of N-terminally attached fatty acids, and outlines the main genetic engineering strategies for improving the yield and generating novel structures of surfactin, including promoter engineering, enhancing efflux systems, modifying the transcriptional regulatory genes of surfactin synthase (srfA), genomics and transcriptomics analysis, non ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domain and combinatorial biosynthesis. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of the research on surfactin.", "Keywords", "Background", "Background", "Since green chemicals and industrial processes have become a concern for the whole society, environmentally-friendly, biodegradable biosurfactants with low toxicity have aroused great interest [1, 2]. Biosurfactants are classified into glycolipids, phospholipids, fatty acid lipopeptides, lipoproteins, polymeric surfactants and particulate surfactants based on their natural chemical structure and microbial origin [3, 4]. Lipopeptides constitute a class of antimicrobials composed of a hydrophilic peptide ring and hydrophobic fatty acid moieties [5, 6].

Surfactin has a ring-shaped peptide chain containing seven amino acids, and a \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acid chain of 13\u201316 carbon atoms as shown in Fig.\u00a01 [12]. Because of some differences in the length of the fatty acid chain and the types of amino acids, surfactin has many congeners or isoforms [13]. Due to its unique structure, surfactin can not only lower the surface tension of water from 72 to 27 mN/m, but is also highly thermally stable and salt tolerant [14, 15]. Thus, it has great potential in both enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and the microbial enhancement of oil recovery (MEOR) [16, 17].

The biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids l-isoleucine, l-valine and l-leucine shares the same enzyme system encoded by ilvBN, ilvGM, ilvIH, ilvC, ilvD, and ilvE [39, 40]. Especially, the production of l-leucine from the intermediate precursor \u03b1-keto-isovalerate involves an enzyme complex encoded by leuACDB. The resulting intermediates are converted into the corresponding branched-chain acyl-CoA precursors: \u03b1-methylbutyryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, and isovaleryl-CoA through the branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase complex [41].

Furthermore, genes participating in acetyl-CoA generation, which is a precursor of fatty acids, were also particularly upregulated. Likewise, the results of our recent work showed that Bacillus velezensis BS-37 [47], a surfactin high-yield strain, were in agreement with the transcriptome analysis. Moreover, the surfactin production of strain BS-37 doubled to nearly 2\u00a0g/L with the addition of 10\u00a0mM l-Leu, which was consistent with a previous report that surfactin production could be increased 20.9-fold by strengthening the leucine metabolic pathway [35]. In addition to these findings, there were many studies that proved the importance of branched-chain amino acids and branched-chain fatty acids.

The genome and transcriptome analysis of B. amyloliquefaciens MT45, a high-producing strain with a surfactin titer of 2.93\u00a0g/L, showed that most genes in fatty acid synthesis pathway were upregulated compared with B. amyloliquefaciens type strain DSM7T, which produced much less surfactin [46]. Furthermore, genes participating in acetyl-CoA generation, which is a precursor of fatty acids, were also particularly upregulated. Likewise, the results of our recent work showed that Bacillus velezensis BS-37 [47], a surfactin high-yield strain, were in agreement with the transcriptome analysis. Moreover, the surfactin production of strain BS-37 doubled to nearly 2\u00a0g/L with the addition of 10\u00a0mM l-Leu, which was consistent with a previous report that surfactin production could be increased 20.9-fold by strengthening the leucine metabolic pathway [35].

Bacterial quorum sensing (QS) system, a cell-density-dependent regulatory networks, plays a significant role in the regulation of srfA operon. The two canonical peptides, ComX and CSF, mediate the quorum sensing control of competence and sporulation in B. subtilis [60, 61]. In the late-growth phase, a series of gene transcription events downstream of the ComA-ComP two-component are triggered by the accumulation of a high concentration of peptides, among which the srfA operon is stimulated via a complex-regulation phosphorylated cascade [62\u201364]. As shown in Fig.\u00a03, both ComX and CSF activate the transcription of the srfA operon by stimulating the activity of transcription factor ComA through phosphorylation (ComA-P) via two separate pathways. In one pathway, the monitor of cell density, the ComX pheromone, is firstly modified by the ComQ isoprenyl transferase to be processed outside. The signal transduction system composed of the two-component regulatory proteins ComP and ComA is activated when the ComX pheromone reaches the obligatory concentration. Ultimately, phosphorylated ComA binds to the promoter (PsrfA) of the srfA operon in tetramer form, and cooperates with SigA to activate the transcription of corresponding gene expression [65]. Another pathway is mediated by CSF, which is encoded by phrC and is initially imported as inactive-form CSF (inact). CSF is imported into the cell by the oligopeptide permease SpooK [66], and then binds to the Rap protein, which causes the Rap protein losing phosphatase activity. Thereby, the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated ComA can be prevented to facilitate the transcription of srfA gene and synthesis of surfactin [67].Fig.\u00a03The schematic model for the regulation of the transcription of the srfA operon network involved in two extracellular signaling peptide-mediated quorum sensing in B. subtilis.

The two canonical peptides, ComX and CSF, mediate the quorum sensing control of competence and sporulation in B. subtilis [60, 61]. In the late-growth phase, a series of gene transcription events downstream of the ComA-ComP two-component are triggered by the accumulation of a high concentration of peptides, among which the srfA operon is stimulated via a complex-regulation phosphorylated cascade [62\u201364]. As shown in Fig.\u00a03, both ComX and CSF activate the transcription of the srfA operon by stimulating the activity of transcription factor ComA through phosphorylation (ComA-P) via two separate pathways. In one pathway, the monitor of cell density, the ComX pheromone, is firstly modified by the ComQ isoprenyl transferase to be processed outside. The signal transduction system composed of the two-component regulatory proteins ComP and ComA is activated when the ComX pheromone reaches the obligatory concentration. Ultimately, phosphorylated ComA binds to the promoter (PsrfA) of the srfA operon in tetramer form, and cooperates with SigA to activate the transcription of corresponding gene expression [65]. Another pathway is mediated by CSF, which is encoded by phrC and is initially imported as inactive-form CSF (inact). CSF is imported into the cell by the oligopeptide permease SpooK [66], and then binds to the Rap protein, which causes the Rap protein losing phosphatase activity. Thereby, the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated ComA can be prevented to facilitate the transcription of srfA gene and synthesis of surfactin [67].Fig.\u00a03The schematic model for the regulation of the transcription of the srfA operon network involved in two extracellular signaling peptide-mediated quorum sensing in B. subtilis.
