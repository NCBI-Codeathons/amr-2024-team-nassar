The genes involved in SM biosynthesis are usually clustered adjacent to each other into a region known as a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). The recent advent of a diversity of genetic and genomic technologies has facilitated the identification of many cryptic or uncharacterized BGCs and their associated SMs. However, there are still many challenges that hamper the broader exploration of industrially important secondary metabolites. The recent advanced CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized fungal genetic engineering and enabled the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. In this review, we firstly introduce fungal BGCs and their relationships with associated SMs, followed by a brief summary of the conventional strategies for fungal genetic engineering. Next, we introduce a range of state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas-based tools that have been developed and review recent applications of these methods in fungi for research on the biosynthesis of SMs. Finally, the challenges and limitations of these CRISPR/Cas-based systems are discussed and directions for future research are proposed in order to expand their applications and improve efficiency for fungal genetic engineering.", "1.

Although a wide range of fungi-derived SMs have already been identified, many SMs remain unknown. So far, approximately 120,000 fungal species have been identified; nevertheless, this number only accounts for less than 8% of the estimated total number of fungal species existing on earth [2].

In contrast, many valuable SMs have also been produced from fungi and widely applied in various fields, including the manufacturing industry, agriculture, and medicine.

A fungal biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) typically contains genes encoding core synthases/synthatases, biosynthetic tailoring enzymes, regulators, and transporters, as well as enzymes related to self-resistance [7]. The number of publicly available fungal genomes has tremendously increased in recent years due to the rapid development of advanced sequencing technologies and genomic tools. This accumulation of annotated genomic information has accelerated the identification of BGCs with the aid of simultaneously developed automated genome mining tools, such as antiSMASH, MIBiG 2.0, and BiG-SCAPE [8,9,10]. By performing bioinformatic analysis of 1037 fungal genomes, Robey et al. [11] found that the number of BGCs encoded by each fungal genome varied greatly between species. Moreover, BGCs vary greatly in size, spanning from a few kb (harboring two genes) to \u223c100 kb (containing up to 27 genes) [12,13]. Our understanding of the link between fungal BGCs and their associated SMs is very limited, not only because many well-characterized BGCs are transcriptionally silent, but also because a significant number of BGCs have yet to be explored for their biosynthetic potential [14].

Crosstalk and interactions between these factors have been observed during the biosynthesis of fungal secondary metabolites. Among these factors, environmental signals and global regulators normally have a regulatory effect on the transcription of multiple BGCs, while cluster-specific regulators/TFs typically regulate only a specific BGC. A number of global regulators involved in BGC regulation have been described, including the velvet complex [16], BrlA [17], laeA [18], and McrA [19]. The expression of some BGCs is specifically controlled by cluster-specific TFs, and the expression levels of these TFs are closely associated with BGC activation. For TFs possessing weak native promoters, promoter replacement or TF overexpression appear to be effective in activating a previously silent BGC [20]. For example, promoter replacement of the cluster-specific transcriptional factor ATEG_06205 in Aspergillus terreus resulted in the activation of a polyketide biosynthesis gene cluster, as well as the production of highly pigmented naphthoquinones [21]. In A. terreus, overexpressing the pathway-specific transcription factor tazR using the Tet-on system activated the taz pathway and induced the production of novel azaphilones [22]. Epigenetic regulation is also critical to gene activity and occurs through various forms, including DNA methylation rewriting, histone modification, small RNA expression, and the modulation of high-order chromatin structures [15]. The reprogramming of the epigenome in fungi is emerging as a promising strategy for altering BGC activity and promoting SM biosynthesis. However, some BGCs are active under certain conditions. In order to identify SMs that are regulated by these active BGCs, knock-out strains are usually generated through gene deletion or disruption, followed by subsequent metabolite profiling. The exploration of the regulatory mechanisms of BGC expression and their connections to SM biosynthesis provides a theoretical basis for the design and evaluation of practical strategies for SM production from fungi.

Conventional Strategies for Fungal Genetic Engineering", "2. Conventional Strategies for Fungal Genetic Engineering", "Prior to the advent of CRISPR/Cas technology, a diversity of conventional methods have been used to edit fungal genomes and regulate gene expression, including random DNA integration, gene-targeting technology, and RNA technology. Random DNA integration can be created by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI), Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT), and transposon-arrayed gene knockouts (TAGKO) [23]. However, the process of random integration is tedious. Gene-targeting technology is primarily based on homologous recombination (HR), which is widely used for precise gene editing and gene knock-in when a donor DNA template is provided. However, gene-targeted technologies may not be effective in certain fungal species, such as filamentous fungi, due to low rates of HR efficiency [24]. Low HR efficiency in filamentous fungi is due to the requirement for a long, homologous sequence for efficient foreign DNA integration [25,26]. In contrast, HR efficiency is much higher in yeast than in filamentous fungi [24]. On the other hand, many fungal species prefer to use the widely conserved nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) approach for repairing DNA damage, which, in turn, decreases the HR frequency of gene-targeting [24]. It has been reported that disrupting the NHEJ pathway by suppressing key molecules involved in NHEJ, such as KU70, KU80, and DNA ligase IV, could improve the HR efficiency and further enhance the frequency of precise genetic modifications in filamentous fungi [27]. These conventional methods have been widely used for producing a diversity of bioactive SMs via modulating BGCs in fungi, particularly model organisms and industrially important strains.

CRISPR/Cas 9 in type II from the Class 2 CRISPR/Cas system has been extensively explored and exploited for gene editing, which is composed of endonuclease Cas9, CRISPR-derived RNA (crRNA), and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracer RNA) [34]. Cas9 is guided by a hybrid of crRNA-tracer RNA to the target DNA sequence and cuts the double-stranded DNA to form a double-strand break (DSB) [35].

CRISPR/Cas9 knockout technology was also used in Alternaria alternata to unravel the biosynthetic pathway for the biosynthesis of alternariol and its derivatives, which are common SMs that act as pathogenicity factors [50]. Thus, elucidating the biosynthetic and metabolic pathways of fungal SMs with the aid of CRISPR/Cas systems can be effectively used to develop practical strategies to boost the yield of valuable bioactive SMs and reduce the production of toxic SMs.", "In a more recent study carried out on Glarea lozoyensis, replacing a proline hydroxylase gene gloF with another gene ap-htyE via a CRISPR/Cas9-expression plasmid reduced the level of pneumocandin C0 and increased the production of the antifungal drug caspofungin\u2013pneumocandin B0 [51]. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9 is efficient in constructing genetically modified fungal strains that could function as platform strains for novel SM production. For example, a SM-deficient strain of Penicillium rubens, which was created through the consecutive deletion of four BGCs using CRISPR/Cas9, acted as a platform for the integration of the heterologous Calbistrin gene cluster, generating a novel strain that produced a high level of decumbenones, as well as a clean SM profile due to reduced interference from endogenous SMs [52]. Multiple DSBs would limit the survival of fungi, restricting the use of the CRISPR/Cas system for multi-gene editing [53].

More recently, CRISPR/Cas9-meidated deletion of Acaxl2, a key gene regulating arthrospore formation, in industrial A. chrysogenum FC3-5-23 resulted in significantly enhanced cephalosporin C production, revealing a close link between mycelial morphology and cephalosporin C production [55].", "In a more recent study carried out on Glarea lozoyensis, replacing a proline hydroxylase gene gloF with another gene ap-htyE via a CRISPR/Cas9-expression plasmid reduced the level of pneumocandin C0 and increased the production of the antifungal drug caspofungin\u2013pneumocandin B0 [51].

In P. rubens, dCas9-VPR, together with an sgRNA module, were introduced into a non-integrative AMA1 vector to generate a genome-editing-free CRISPRa system, and this system was able to activate the cryptic macrophorin BGC [81]. Interestingly, it has been suggested that transcription activation could be improved by fusing dCas9 to multiple activator domains (Rom\u00e1n et al., 2019). In contrast, transcriptional repression can be achieved via CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), where deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) is fused to repressors [79].

An overview of the application of CRISPR/Cas technology in fungi is illustrated in Figure 2. However, several major challenges and limitations still impede their application. One major issue to be considered is the gene-editing efficiency, which is determined by multiple factors, including the Cas enzyme kinetics, sgRNA design, gene copy number, repair template, editing mechanism, and more.

Thus, more sophisticated computational predictive models that can evaluate sgRNA secondary structures are needed for sgRNA design. The efficiency of CRISPR-based gene modification is affected by the surrounding genetic context, such as the position of the target site, chromatin accessibility, the nucleosome, and transcription factor occupancy of the target site. For example, heterochromatic regions might affect the deployment of a Cas protein or Cas\u2013effector complex to the target site. Therefore, developing new tools to predict the architecture and compactness of the chromatin surrounding the targeted region will help to design optimal sgRNA.

For instance, a series of progressively shorter sgRNAs for targeted gene editing have been tested in human cells, and truncated RNA (tru-RNA) with 17 or 18 nucleotides showed improved specificities without compromising on target activity [110]. This result might be explained as the truncated RNA-guided nuclease complex being more sensitive to mismatches compared with full-length sgRNA with 20 nucleotides. Interestingly, tru-RNAs with even shorter and longer complementarity lengths (other than 17 or 18 nucleotides) either failed to show activities or showed substantially decreased activities, results that need further investigation [110].

Reduced off-target effects observed from the use of Cas nickases are probably due to a lower frequency of indels induced by the Cas nickase compared with those induced by the Cas nuclease at off-target sites, providing a new clue for minimizing off-target effects.

Compared with CRISPR-based DNA-targeting, RNA-targeting systems hold exciting potential to dissect the roles of lethal genes and avoid generating permanent off-target genetic changes. However, the application of CRISPR-based transcriptomic manipulation in fungi is limited to only a few species. Future applications of CRISPR-based RNA-targeting systems along with the already-established CRISPR-based platforms are expected to significantly advance our understanding of fungal secondary metabolism.", "CRISPR/Cas systems can also be used for RNA editing. Recently, a number of CRISPR/Cas systems with RNA-targeting activity have been identified, including type II (Cas9), type III (Cmr/Csm), and type VI (Cas13). Novel CRISPR-based RNA-targeting tools that are developed from Type II, III, and VI systems have already been harnessed for endogenous RNA knockdown, site-specific RNA editing, and RNA tracking in many organisms, including fungi [124,125,126,127,128,129,130].
