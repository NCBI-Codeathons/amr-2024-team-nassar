["Erythromycin and its analogs are used to treat respiratory tract and other infections. The broad use of these antibiotics during the last 5 decades has led to resistance that can range from 20% to over 70% in certain parts of the world. Efforts to find macrolides that were active against macrolide-resistant strains led to the development of erythromycin analogs with alkyl-aryl side chains that mimicked the sugar side chain of 16-membered macrolides, such as tylosin. Further modifications were made to improve the potency of these molecules by removal of the cladinose sugar to obtain a smaller molecule, a modification that was learned from an older macrolide, pikromycin. A keto group was introduced after removal of the cladinose sugar to make the new ketolide subclass. Only one ketolide, telithromycin, received marketing authorization but because of severe adverse events, it is no longer widely used. Failure to identify the structure-relationship responsible for this clinical toxicity led to discontinuation of many ketolides that were in development. One that did complete clinical development, cethromycin, did not meet clinical efficacy criteria and therefore did not receive marketing approval. Work on developing new macrolides was re-initiated after showing that inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by the imidazolyl-pyridine moiety on the side chain of telithromycin was likely responsible for the severe adverse events. Solithromycin is a fourth-generation macrolide that has a fluorine at the 2-position, and an alkyl-aryl side chain that is different from telithromycin. Solithromycin interacts at three sites on the bacterial ribosome, has activity against strains resistant to older macrolides (including telithromycin), and is mostly bactericidal. Pharmaceutical scientists involved in the development of macrolide antibiotics have learned from the teachings of Professor Satoshi Omura and progress in this field was not possible without his endeavors.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The term \u2018macrolide\u2019 antibiotic to physicians and microbiologists means erythromycin and its analogs, such as clarithromycin, azithromycin and roxithromycin.

Macrolide resistance has decreased their utility in the treatment of respiratory tract infections as well as gonorrhea. Solithromycin is poised to become a fourth-generation macrolide for use in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, as it could be available in oral capsule and IV formulations.

Professor Omura is recognized as a global expert in the field of bioorganic chemistry, where his work has focused on the discovery, development and biosynthesis of useful compounds produced by microorganisms, including the macrolide antibiotics. Professor Omura\u2019s work on diverse natural products can be used as a wealth of starting molecules for designing future antibiotics. Professor Omura has received many awards, culminating in the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for his discovery of avermectin in recognition of his tremendous contributions.", "The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "Figure 1Chemical structures of erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and roxithromycin.", "Chemical structures of erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and roxithromycin.", "Figure 2Chemical structure of tylosin, a 16-membered macrolide.", "Chemical structure of tylosin, a 16-membered macrolide.", "Figure 3Chemical structure of pikromycin, a 14-membered macrolide and the first identified.", "Chemical structure of pikromycin, a 14-membered macrolide and the first identified.", "Figure 4Chemical structure of telithromycin (Ketek), the first ketolide.", "Chemical structure of telithromycin (Ketek), the first ketolide.", "Figure 5Chemical structure of solithromycin, a 4th-generation macrolide.", "Chemical structure of solithromycin, a 4th-generation macrolide.", "Figure 6Semi-synthetic route for solithromycin.27, 32", "Semi-synthetic route for solithromycin.27, 32", "Figure 7Chemical structure of WCK 4873 (nafithromycin), a lactone ketolide in clinical development by Wockhardt.", "Chemical structure of WCK 4873 (nafithromycin), a lactone ketolide in clinical development by Wockhardt."]
