["The sessile plant has developed mechanisms to survive the \u201crough and tumble\u201d of its natural surroundings, aided by its evolved innate immune system. Precise perception and rapid response to stress stimuli confer a fitness edge to the plant against its competitors, guaranteeing greater chances of survival and productivity. Plants can \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on volatile chemical cues from their stressed neighbours and have adapted to use these airborne signals to prepare for impending danger without having to experience the actual stress themselves. The role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in plant\u2013plant communication has gained significant attention over the past decade, particularly with regard to the potential of VOCs to prime non-stressed plants for more robust defence responses to future stress challenges. The ecological relevance of such interactions under various environmental stresses has been much debated, and there is a nascent understanding of the mechanisms involved. This review discusses the significance of VOC-mediated inter-plant interactions under both biotic and abiotic stresses and highlights the potential to manipulate outcomes in agricultural systems for sustainable crop protection via enhanced defence. The need to integrate physiological, biochemical, and molecular approaches in understanding the underlying mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in volatile signalling is emphasised.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Climate change has exacerbated the multifarious effects of environmental stresses on crop growth and development, thereby compromising sustainable agricultural productivity worldwide. Biotic stresses in the form of insects, bacteria, viruses, fungi, nematodes, arachnids, and weeds account for over 30% of losses from the annual global food production capacity, or approximately US$500 billion [1]. Abiotic stresses including drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity are major yield-limiting factors of economically important food crops globally [2]. Of these stresses, drought is one of the most significant, given that its frequency and severity has been forecasted to increase due to climate change [3]. Greater effort has therefore been directed towards the implementation of sustainable agricultural management and drought mitigation strategies in major crop-growing regions worldwide.", "Climate change has exacerbated the multifarious effects of environmental stresses on crop growth and development, thereby compromising sustainable agricultural productivity worldwide.

These adaptations may be expressed constitutively, or in many cases, are activated only in the presence of stressors. The evolved innate immunity or basal resistance of a plant is regulated by an intricate network of endogenous signalling molecules, receptor proteins, and transcriptional regulators. In response to environmental stress, plants exhibit an upregulation of the expression of stress-related genes encoding for defence proteins, such as trypsin protease inhibitors (PI) and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which act against herbivory and pathogen attack, respectively. There is also an elevated production of secondary metabolites including osmoprotectants and toxins with deterrent/antifeedant activity [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Timely defence responses to biotic and abiotic stresses offer a fitness benefit to plants that largely depends on the capacity to quickly and accurately recognise external stress stimuli [14,15].

Biochemical and molecular control over VOC synthesis in response to physiological factors such as light [84], temperature, drought [75,83], and high carbon dioxide concentration [83,85] has been shown to relate to the availability of immediate VOC precursors as well as on the activity rate of flux-controlling enzymes.", "The biosynthesis of signalling VOCs depends on the plastidic pool of intermediate products of photosynthesis, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and erythrose 4-phosphate (Ery4P), as well as sufficient supply of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) from glycolysis [74] (Figure 2). During mild stress, the photosynthetic machinery is affected such that the carbon assimilation rate is significantly decreased [86]. Emission rates of most VOCs are expected to be reduced under such conditions [84].

Therefore, ATP and NADPH remain available for the reduction in carbon reserves in the form of starch and sugar for isoprenoid synthesis [21]. Typically, sustained moderate or strong rapid drought stress will eventually lead to a significant reduction in VOC emissions, with augmented emissions after rewatering [76,87].

Electrical signals found in plants include: slow wave potentials (SWPs) propagated in the functional xylem; action potentials (APs) initiated in the phloem; system potentials (SPs) propagated in the apoplast following mechanical perturbations or wounding; and wound potentials (WPs) through changes in cell turgor leading to plasma membrane depolarisation. Hydraulic signals involve changes in turgor pressure, mass flow, and pressure waves. SWPs are closely linked to hydraulic signals as a result of cavitation events or changes in turgor [154,155,156]. Chemical signals can be classified as: (i) secondary messengers including reactive oxygen species (ROS), inositol triphosphate (IP), Ca2+, K+, and anion fluxes; (ii) signalling cascade chemicals including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs); and (iii) chemical response signals including phytohormones and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) have been well-documented involving both above- and below-ground biocontrol of herbivores by insect predators and parasitoids, such as the yellow jacket wasp and the parasitic wasp, respectively [157,158]. Recent advanced analyses have elucidated the role of various mobile molecules including small peptides [155,159,160] and small RNAs (small interfering RNA and micro RNAs) in long-distance systemic signalling [159,161,162,163]. Stomatal closure is one of the initial responses to osmotic stress to prevent hydraulic failure [164] and is regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) [165,166]. During water stress, the root-to-shoot communication is mediated by a small mobile root-derived peptide, CLAVATA3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 25 (CLE25), which then triggers ABA accumulation in the leaves via BARELY ANY MERISTEM1 (BAM1) and BAM2 receptors in the leaf vascular bundles [159]. Sound vibrations (SVs) or acoustic signals produced by both biotic and abiotic stresses act as stimuli capable of priming plants for future stress challenges and as long-range signals that activate plant-signalling pathways [148]. Leaf vibrations caused by herbivore chewing [148,149] and the \u201cclicking\u201d sound produced by the collapsing water column (cavitation) in the xylem [167] have been demonstrated to trigger systemic responses in distal regions of the plant.

Sound vibrations (SVs) or acoustic signals produced by both biotic and abiotic stresses act as stimuli capable of priming plants for future stress challenges and as long-range signals that activate plant-signalling pathways [148]. Leaf vibrations caused by herbivore chewing [148,149] and the \u201cclicking\u201d sound produced by the collapsing water column (cavitation) in the xylem [167] have been demonstrated to trigger systemic responses in distal regions of the plant. The perturbation of the plasma membrane by SVs is characterised by a sequence of molecular episodes including cell wall modification and microfilament rearrangement in plant cells [147,149,168].", "Figure 4Role and mechanism of action of stress-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In response to both biotic and abiotic stresses, VOCs induce various defence-signalling pathways and are involved in intra- and inter-plant priming against future stress challenges. The antixenotic and antibiotic effects of VOCs facilitate direct and indirect defence responses against biotic stressors. Both abiotic and biotic stress induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) whose negative oxidative effects are curbed by VOCs through ROS quenching and cell membrane stabilisation. Thermo-tolerance of photosynthetic tissue is also facilitated by some VOCs under high temperature conditions. (Modified from Vickers et al. [208]).", "Role and mechanism of action of stress-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
