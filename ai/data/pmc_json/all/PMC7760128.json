["Bioactive natural products are typically secreted by the producer strain. Besides that, this allows the targeting of competitors, also filling a protective role, reducing the chance of self-killing. Surprisingly, DNA-degrading and membrane damaging prodiginines (PdGs) are only produced intracellularly, and are required for the onset of the second round of programmed cell death (PCD) in Streptomyces coelicolor. In this work, we investigated the influence of PdGs on the timing of the morphological differentiation of S. coelicolor. The deletion of the transcriptional activator gene redD that activates the red cluster for PdGs or nutrient-mediated reduction of PdG synthesis both resulted in the precocious appearance of mature spore chains. Transcriptional analysis revealed an accelerated expression of key developmental genes in the redD null mutant, including bldN for the developmental \u03c3 factor BldN which is essential for aerial mycelium formation. In contrast, PdG overproduction due to the enhanced copy number of redD resulted in a delay or block in sporulation. In addition, confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that the earliest aerial hyphae do not produce PdGs. This suggests that filaments that eventually differentiate into spore chains and are hence required for survival of the colony, are excluded from the second round of PCD induced by PdGs. We propose that one of the roles of PdGs would be to delay the entrance of S. coelicolor into the dormancy state (sporulation) by inducing the leakage of the intracellular content of dying filaments thereby providing nutrients for the survivors.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Microorganisms are offering us many natural compounds used for their therapeutic properties including antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor agents, amongst many others. The most prolific microbial source of these natural products is the filamentous bacteria that belong to the genus Streptomyces [1,2]. Streptomycetes are Actinobacteria that have a complex multicellular lifestyle [3,4,5,6]. They grow as a branched mycelium consisting of vegetative or substrate hyphae. When nutrients become scarce or upon sensing of physico-chemical stresses, the bacteria enter into a differentiation process. This morphological change starts with the formation of an aerial mycelium emerging from the substrate mycelium and ends with the differentiation of the aerial hyphae into unigenomic spores that have a reproductive and disseminating function. When reproduction is required, an aerial mycelium is formed that feeds on the substrate mycelium, and eventually the aerial hyphae differentiate into long chains of spores. The production of secondary metabolites such as antibiotics is temporally correlated to the onset of morphological differentiation [7,8,9,10]. Why Streptomyces produce so many of these bioactive small molecules, and what the functions of these compounds for their producer, has only recently gained attention [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Two main conflicting viewpoints have stirred debate within this field, with some hypothesizing that \u2018antibiotics\u2019 are only weapons involved in territorial warfare between (micro)organisms, and others suggesting that, at the concentration that they are likely to be found in their natural environments, antibiotics might act as signalling molecules involved in intra- or interspecies communication [11,12,14,15,16,17,18,20,22]. Of course, these possibilities are not mutually exclusive, as one could imagine multiple context-specific functions for a single molecule. In addition, more complex roles are also attributed to antibiotics including to induce membrane damage of the producer to fulfil nutrient and energy needs, especially phosphate sources, for the surviving population [20,23].", "Microorganisms are offering us many natural compounds used for their therapeutic properties including antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor agents, amongst many others.

These molecules are so toxic that several mechanisms of self-resistance are often required for the survival of the producer, including toxin sequestration, efflux, modification, inactivation, self-sacrifice, and target repair [27]. Amongst this type of compounds, tri-pyrrole prodiginines (PdGs) are also able to disrupt the plasma membrane via a chaotropicity-mediated mode-of-action in addition to DNA cleavage [28,29,30]. Streptorubin B and undecylprodigiosin produced by S. coelicolor [31] are particularly interesting because these molecules remain trapped into the cytoplasm and the membranes of the bacterial filaments and are therefore likely to be necessary for the physiology of the producer rather than being involved in warfare with neighboring microorganisms. Moreover, in contrast to other DNA-damaging antitumor antibiotics [27], the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of PdGs does not include genes involved in self-resistance. Why does S. coelicolor internally produce highly toxic compounds without having genes for self-resistance? These two exceptional features, i.e., (i) no secretion and (ii) no resistance genes, prompted us to investigate a possible role in the programmed cell death (PCD) process of the producer. PCD is a hallmark of multicellularity in bacteria, such as in Myxococcus, cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria, as well as in biofilms [6,13,32,33,34,35,36,37]. A study of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa showed that the external addition of prodigiosin induced the formation of reactive oxygen species, which induced PCD [38,39]. Consistent with a role in the onset of PCD, the production of PdGs in S. coelicolor perfectly follows in time and space the zone of the culture where filaments were submitted to a first round of PCD [13]. Once produced, PdGs themselves inflict a massive second round of death resulting in an important destruction of essential macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins) [13].

One possibility is that when S. coelicolor is impaired in producing PdGs, the abundant still-viable biomass rapidly consumes the remaining nutrients and this starvation initiates the developmental program sooner. Indeed, sporulation represents the culmination of the life(cycle) for sporulating microorganisms. As the onset of this state of dormancy is costly and irreversible, microorganisms must consider all alternatives to survive under hostile conditions before triggering sporulation. One of these alternatives would be the killing of the large majority of the vegetative mycelium in order to lower the consumption of the remaining nutrients and provide nutrients from the dying hyphae to feed the survivors. A similar scenario has been previously documented and connected with bacterial developmental processes, such as the cannibalism in Bacillus subtilis, and fratricide in Streptococcus pneumonia [32]. In each case the induced cell death of a portion of the population is considered to provide an advantage to the survivors. Not making PdGs makes S. coelicolor sporulate around 2 days earlier.

For the 3D confocal image stack reconstitution, UCSF Chimera software was used to visualize 84 z-stack images from a 85.2 \u03bcm section (objective HCX PL APO 63 \u00d7 1.20 W CORR UV with a zoom of 2.8 and pixels 512 \u00d7 512) preprocessed by the Fiji software (Gaussian Blur filter for RAF image stack).", "5. Conclusions", "5. Conclusions", "Life for streptomycetes is a cycle that starts with the germination of a spore and ends by the formation of chains of spores. Their development includes a multiphasic growth and complex differentiations where the onset of the sporulation process signifies entering a dormant state until spores encounter more favorable conditions. The red-pigmented tri-pyrroles prodiginines participate to the most important death round of S. coelicolor and we investigated here how the inhibition or instead the overproduction of these cytotoxic molecules influenced the timing of sporulation of the producer. Inhibition of PdG production resulted in accelerated development whereas their overproduction led to a developmental arrest at the vegetative mycelium state. These results confirm that non-secreted anti-proliferative cytotoxic compounds influence importantly the physiology and development of the producing organism. Our work suggest that microorganisms could use compounds with cytotoxic antiproliferative activity as we use them in cancer therapy: to induce cell death in order to prolongate the lifetime, which means to postpone the onset of morphological differentiation for sporulating bacteria.", "Life for streptomycetes is a cycle that starts with the germination of a spore and ends by the formation of chains of spores.
