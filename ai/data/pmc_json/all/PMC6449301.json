["Secondary metabolites (SM) produced by fungi and bacteria have long been of exceptional interest owing to their unique biomedical ramifications. The traditional discovery of new natural products that was mainly driven by bioactivity screening has now experienced a fresh new approach in the form of genome mining. Several bioinformatics tools have been continuously developed to detect potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are responsible for the production of SM. Although the principles underlying the computation of these tools have been discussed, the biological background is left underrated and ambiguous. In this review, we emphasize the biological hypotheses in BGC formation driven from the observations across genomes in bacteria and fungi, and provide a comprehensive list of updated algorithms/tools exclusively for BGC detection. Our review points to a direction that the biological hypotheses should be systematically incorporated into the BGC prediction and assist the prioritization of candidate BGC.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Fungi and bacteria produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs), many of which play vital roles in medicine, such as antibiotics and anticancer reagents. For instance, erythromycin, azithromycin, and penicillin are beneficial antibiotics that treat several bacterial infections in lungs, middle ears, and sexually transmitted diseases (Chen et al. 2014a; Taylor et al. 2015). Vancomycin, isolated from Amycolatopsis orientalis, is considered a last-resort drug for Gram-positive bacterial infections and life-threatening diseases such as severe colitis caused by Clostridium difficile. Salinosporamide A was first isolated and characterized from Salinispora tropica in 2003 and acts as a potent anticancer reagent that has entered several clinical trials for various types of cancers, including melanoma, pancreatic, and lung cancer (Feling et al. 2003; Millward et al. 2012).", "Fungi and bacteria produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs), many of which play vital roles in medicine, such as antibiotics and anticancer reagents.

It was not long until scientists noticed that SMs are usually encoded by genes that cluster together in a genetic package, which was later referred to as a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). A BGC consists of genes required for the synthesis of the bioactive molecule and regulatory elements, such as transcription factors and promoters. Sometimes, it also consists of transportation genes for exportation of the produced SMs and resistance genes that prevent self-destruction in the producers (Ahn and Walton 1998; Brown et al. 1996; Medema and Fischbach 2015).", "Recognizing the potential benefits of SMs, scientists have long sought economical and clinically useful SMs. Traditional approaches for identification of biosynthetic pathway mainly leverage bioactivity screening to first extract the bioactive compounds with desired properties and subsequently locate the responsible genes by biochemical techniques (Luo et al. 2014).

Furthermore, bioactivity screening greatly depends on reference information of the existing pathways, thereby limiting the capacity to unearth novel compounds with new bioactivities. This is evidenced by the fact that during 37\u00a0years between the discovery of chinolone nalidixic acid (1962) and linezolid, the first commercially available oxazolidinone antimicrobial (2000); no new structural classes of antibiotic were introduced to the market (Bax et al. 1998; Moellering 2003; Walsh and Wencewicz 2013; Weber et al. 2003). In contrast, genomic data were able to be used for the prediction of 33,351 putative BGCs (false positive rate of 5%) in 1154 prokaryotic genomes (Cimermancic et al. 2014). The striking disparity between genetic and phenotypic potentials suggests that the limit in discovering natural products lies not in nature\u2019s capacity but in the exploration approach.", "Traditional biochemical characterization approaches have come to a bottleneck in the discovery pipeline, where many of SMs prove impossible to produce or extract under laboratory conditions.

Over the last couple of decades, several tools have been developed for secondary metabolite gene mining (see Table 1 for list of bioinformatics tools). For example, an earlier version of genome mining used the localization of genes on the chromosomes across multiple genomes to predict gene clusters of specific pathways (Hamer et al. 2010). More advanced tools such as BAGEL, ClustScan, NP.searcher, SMURF, antiSMASH, ClusterFinder, PRISM, EvoMining, RODEO, and ARTS were designed to perform genome mining for BGCs (Alanjary et al. 2017; Blin et al. 2013, 2017; Cimermancic et al. 2014; Cruz-Morales et al. 2016; de Jong et al. 2010, 2006; Khaldi et al. 2010; Li et al. 2009; Medema et al. 2011; Skinnider et al. 2015, 2016, 2017; Starcevic et al. 2008; Tietz et al. 2017; van Heel et al. 2013; Weber et al. 2015). These tools implement algorithms to define BGC boundaries and to detect potential BGCs based on multiple indicators such as signature protein domains, distant paralogs of primary metabolic enzymes, and evolutionary hallmarks (Medema and Fischbach 2015). For functional characterization of biosynthetic key genes, two software programs, SBSPKS and NaPDoS, were developed for analyzing the 3D structure and predict their natural products (Anand et al. 2010; Ziemert et al. 2012). Predicted BGCs can then be reconstructed, cloned, and expressed by heterologous hosts using DNA assembly technologies (Chao et al. 2015; Cobb et al. 2013; Harvey et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2015a).

Therefore, it protects the essential protein that the toxic SM targets by providing excess targets or proteins with greater binding affinity. c The horizontal gene transfer hypothesis of core genes is a potential way for microorganism to gain genetic advantage for self-protection. Bioinformatics analysis is applied to scan for BGCs that contain genes matching the three hypotheses. The output BGC candidates will be validated with experiments such as refactoring BGCs, identification of the corresponding SM product, and evaluation of biological activity", "Accumulating evidence suggests that the presence of a resistance gene acts as a self-defense mechanism for the organisms. For instance, the tylosin producer Streptomyces fradiae has three resistant elements, tlrB, tlrC, and tlrD, within the tyl cluster, which encodes tylosin (Cundliffe et al. 2001). The gene tlrC, as an example of efflux-mediated drug resistance, encodes ATP-binding protein for transporting tylosin out of cell. The tlrB and tlrD genes encode methyltransferase, a resistance determinant for methylation of 23S rRNA of the ribosomal tunnel, and thereby sterically blocks the interaction of tylosin with the tunnel wall (Vester and Long 2009), which is an example of target-based strategy. Similarly, self-immunity elements, namely homologs of vanHAX, are close to biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces toyocaensis, an actinomycete that produces the glycopeptide antibiotic A47934; Actinoplanes teichomyceticus producing teicoplanin (Kwun and Hong 2014; Marshall et al. 1998; Sosio et al. 2000); and vancomycin-producing Amycolatopsis orientalis HCCB10007 (Marshall et al. 1998; Xu et al. 2014). The vanHAX operon genes encode a set of enzymes that alter C-terminal D-Ala-D-Ala to D-Ala-D-Lac of peptidoglycan, where vancomycin and other glycopeptides bind, thereby reducing binding affinity. On the other hand, the clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococci encode orthologues of vanHAX and confer resistance (Arthur and Courvalin 1993).

Surprisingly, the A. fumigatus gliotoxin (gli) BGC also harbors the gliT gene, which encodes for gliotoxin oxidoreductase, an enzyme that converts gliotoxin into a less toxic compound (Scharf et al. 2010). gliA was found within the gli BGC to encode an efflux pump that might act in the resistance mechanism against gliotoxin (Dolan et al. 2015). The extent to which gliT and gliA contribute to A. fumigatus self-protection remains difficult to determine. However, there is more evidence of resistance via drug efflux than detoxifying enzyme activity at present (Keller 2015).

On the other hand, HGT events are independent of DNA duplication, making them a safer mode of gene transfer than vertical transmission.

There is accumulating evidence of full pathway transfers between fungi, including the sterigmatocystin gene cluster in Podospora anserina that was laterally acquired intact from Aspergillus nidulans (Slot and Rokas 2011).

It utilizes algorithms that are independent of known biosynthesis pathways to identify core enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of SMs via homology search algorithms such as HMMs. BGCs are then predicted by comparing nearby core genes with a set of manually curated BGC cluster rules. In addition to this model, the search for BGCs also employs the ClusterFinder algorithm, which is based on annotated PFAM domains (Cimermancic et al. 2014).
