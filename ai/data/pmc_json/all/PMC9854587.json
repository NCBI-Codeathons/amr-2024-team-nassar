["Self-resistance determinants are essential for the biosynthesis of bioactive natural products and are closely related to drug resistance in clinical settings. The study of self-resistance mechanisms has long moved forward on the discovery of new resistance genes and the characterization of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by these proteins. However, as more examples of self-resistance have been reported, it has been revealed that the enzymatic reactions contribute to self-protection are not confined to the cellular location where the final toxic compounds are present. In this review, we summarize representative examples of self-resistance mechanisms for bioactive natural products functional at different cell locations to explore the models of resistance strategies involved. Moreover, we also highlight those resistance determinants that are widespread in nature and describe the applications of self-resistance genes in natural product mining to interrogate the landscape of self-resistance genes in drug resistance-related new drug discovery.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Natural products are small chemical compounds derived from secondary metabolites of animals, plants, and microorganisms with an array of biological activities. Since the discovery and clinical use of penicillin and streptomycin [1,2], natural products have been an important source of drugs and play a critical role in modern medicine and agricultural industries [2]. However, widespread use and misuse of these small chemical compounds has led to the rising emergence of antibiotic resistance, resulting in the gradual loss of efficacy of antibiotics in clinic and natural environment. Antibiotic resistance has become one of the greatest public health threats that humans will have to face in the coming decades [3,4]. According to a report from the UK government, the death toll caused by antibiotic resistance is estimated to be up to 10 million per year by 2050, with a cost of drug resistance to $100 trillion [5]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for uncovering the resistance mechanisms in pathogens and developing new compounds with novel modes of action [6,7,8].", "Natural products are small chemical compounds derived from secondary metabolites of animals, plants, and microorganisms with an array of biological activities.

The origins of these acquired resistance genes have been traced to antibiotic-producers in natural environments [9,10]. In antibiotic-producing microbes, self-resistance is a prerequisite for the synthesis of antibiotics [11]. Antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) contain one or more resistance genes to achieve self-protection, and these genes are considered to be the reservoirs of resistance genes, which may transfer to human pathogens by conjugation, transformation or transduction [9,10,12,13]. Consequently, the elucidation of self-resistance mechanisms from antibiotic-producing microbes will not only reveal the action model of antibiotics and guide the discovery of new natural products, but also provide key clues for the studies of clinical antibiotic resistance [8,10,13,14].", "Generally, the clinical antibiotic resistance in human pathogens belongs to acquired resistance, with only a small fraction under the category of innate resistance.

The temporal-spatial shielding is a derivative of a common prodrug strategy, and the most significant difference between them is the presence or absence of secreted protein responsible for inert drug activation. In temporal-spatial shielding mode, antibiotics are synthesized as inert drugs and then transported to the extracellular space, followed by activation with enzymatic reactions catalyzed by secreted proteins, which contributes to the spatial shielding of drug activity.

NDM, a member of tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids with complex hexacyclic structure, exhibits excellent antitumor and antimicrobial activities [22,23]. Its prominent biological activity is derived from the formation of electrophilic iminium species by eliminating C-7 hydroxyl, which covalently alkylates the N2 residue of guanine residing in the minor groove, forming DNA lesions that threaten cellular livelihood (Figure 2A). In the NDM biosynthetic pathway, cytosol-located short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase NapW is responsible for reducing the hemiaminal pharmacophore of intermediate 2 to generate the non-toxic 3 (Figure 2A), which ensures the harmlessness of following products and facilitates the biosynthetic process [18]. The resulting intermediate 3 is treated with a membrane protease NapG to produce the matured prodrug 4, which is then transported out of the cell and activated by the secreted oxidoreductase NapU to generate the final product NDM (Figure 2A). Moreover, NapU catalyzes the overoxidative inactivation of NDM into 5 to control the extracellular concentration of antibiotic and reduce damage to the producer cell [17]. Beyond that, the re-entered final active drug NDM is also inactivated with the reductive reaction of NapW (Figure 2A) [18].

An excellent example is the compartmentalized biosynthesis of fungal mycophenolic acid, which sequesters the inhibition of mycophenolic acid on inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase away from the nucleus of fungi, thereby ensuring the normal synthesis of DNA [24,25]. However, there are few reports on self-resistance mediated by enzyme-catalyzed temporal-spatial shielding in the biosynthesis of eukaryotic natural products. Recent studies of self-protection strategies against fungal macrolides revealed that this self-resistance mode is involved in the biosynthesis of A26771B [19]. A26771B is a 16-membered fungal macrolide antibiotic isolated from Penicillium turbatum, and contains a succinate moiety and an unusual \u03b3-keto-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carboxyl, among which the \u03b3-keto group is the pharmacophore (Figure 2B) [26,27,28]. It exhibits prominent biological activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, although with an unknown mode of action [26]. To biosynthesize A26771B efficiently, its producer utilizes a strategy of intracellular reduction and extracellular oxidation for reversible conversion between ketone and alcohol, thus protecting itself from the cytotoxic effect of A26771B (Figure 2B) [19]. Intracellular acyltransferase BerkF catalyzes monosuccinylation of biosynthetic intermediate Berklactone C to generate the mature non-toxic prodrug Berkeleylactone E, which is then exported out of the cell and oxidized by secreted oxidoreductase BerkD to form the target antibiotic A26771B. Moreover, cytoplasmic short-chain reductase BerkC will reduce the \u03b3-keto group of antibiotic A26771B immediately once it enters into the host cell (Figure 2B).

Among them, alkZ plays a dominant role because it is essential for AZB production [43]. AziR, which is a drug-binding protein switched from aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, is responsible for binding to AZB to shield the drug activity [42]. The transmembrane export protein encoded by aziE couples with the drug-binding protein AziR to form an effective efflux system to transport AZB outside of the cell, thereby maintaining a low concentration of the toxic compound [43,45].

These molecules bind to the bacterial ribosomes and inhibit the biosynthesis of proteins [57]. CMN-producing strain Saccharothrix mutabilis subsp. capreolus possesses several self-resistance mechanisms to overcome the cytotoxicity (Figure 3D). The cac gene, located far away from the CMN BGC, encodes an N-acetyltransferase that inactivates CMN IIA and IIB via acetylation of the \u03b2-lysine moiety [58]. The second resistance gene was proposed to be cmnU within the BGC, deduced to encode a methyltransferase related to the KamB and KamC that confer resistance to kanamycin by methylating 16S rRNA. Consistent with this proposal, the expression of cmnU in Streptomyces lividans and Escherichia coli conferred high-level resistance to CMN and kanamycin [58], although an in vitro assay of CmnU for rRNA methyltransferase activity was not performed. The third is the cph gene that plays a role in the phosphorylation of CMN IA and IIA at the Ser hydroxyl group, but not on CMN IB or IIB. Subsequent biochemical assays and structure analysis determined that the Cph exhibits a high binding affinity to both CMN IIA and IIB, and its expression confers E. coli resistance to CMN IIB, suggesting Cph also serves as an antibiotic sequester beyond phosphotransferase [59].

These cryptic genotoxins have attracted continuous studies due to their close correlation to human health. They cause DNA double-strand breaks through DNA crosslinking or copper-mediated oxidative cleavage, leading to cell-cycle arrest and even cell death [63,64,65]. To counter the cytotoxicity of colibactin, at least four colibactin-resistance determinants (clbN, clbB, clbM and clbS) are present in the pks biosynthetic cluster (Figure 3E). Nonribosomal peptide synthetases ClbN and ClbB install an N-acyl-D-asparagine prodrug motif at the N-terminus of colibactin to prevent the formation of the active imine moiety at the early stage of colibactin biosynthesis, thereby generating the inactive prodrug [66,67]. Subsequently, the resulting precolibactin will be transported into the periplasm by the 12-transmembrane MATE inner-membrane transporter ClbM [68,69,70], where mature colibactin is generated via cleavage of prodrug structure with peptidase ClbP, followed by out membrane translocation [67,71]. Notably, knocking out clbM does not completely abolish the production of colibactin, indicating that precolibactin can also be exported across the cytoplasmic membrane by other means. The intracellular cyclopropane hydrolase encoded by clbS abrogates cytotoxicity of the offloaded intermediates or colibactin by converting the electrophilic cyclopropane into an innocuous hydrolase product [72].

For example, Tang and coworkers successfully discovered a natural herbicide with a new mode of action from Aspergillus terreus by a putative self-resistance gene, astD, encoding a dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) homolog [14]. The DHAD is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the last step of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, and is therefore effectively targeted for herbicide development [14].

Fungal genomes scanning of a DHAD homologue revealed that a BGC encoding a sesquiterpene cyclase homologue and a DHAD homologue was present in the genome of Aspergillus terreus. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the aspterric acid encoded by this BGC is indeed a competitive inhibitor of DHAD and effectively functions as a herbicide, and the DHAD variant AstD functions as a self-resistance enzyme in the BGC for aspterric acid [14].

During comparative genomic analysis of obafluorin BGCs, an open reading frame, obaO, was identified and speculated to be an immunity gene [89].

N-acetyltransferase Cac is responsible for inactivating CMN IIA and IIB via acetylation, methyltransferase CmnU confers resistance to CMN by methylating 16S rRNA, phosphotransferase Cph plays role in the phosphorylation of CMN IA and IIA, and it also serves as an antibiotic sequester to inactivate CMN IIB by physical sequestration. (E) Multi-level resistance mechanism in colibactin-770-producing strain Escherichia coli (pks+). Nonribosomal peptide synthetases ClbN and ClbB prevent the formation of the active imine moiety during early stage of colibactin biosynthesis, inner-membrane transporter ClbM and peptidase ClbP are responsible for prodrug maturation and efflux. Moreover, the intracellular cyclopropane hydrolase ClbS abrogates cytotoxicity of the offloaded intermediates or re-entered colibactin.", "Examples of intracellular multi-level resistance model. (A) Self-resistance strategies employed by yatakemycin (YTM) producing strain Streptomyces sp. TP-3056. The producer is known to be protected by seven resistance genes that function in efflux pumps, chemical modification and damage repair. (B) Self-protection mechanisms of azinomycin B (AZB) producing strain Streptomyces sahachiroi. The drug-bind protein AziR, transmembrane export protein AziE, DNA damage repair enzymes AlkZ and AziN confer resistance to AZB in Streptomyces sahachiroi via drug sequestration, efflux pumps, target protection and damage repair, respectively. (C) Self-resistance strategies employed by trioxacarcin A (TXNA) producer Streptomyces bottropensis.
