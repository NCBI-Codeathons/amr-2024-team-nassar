["Macrolides are broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat a range of infections. Resistance to macrolides is often conferred by mobile resistance genes encoding Erm methyltransferases or Mph phosphotransferases. New erm and mph genes keep being discovered in clinical settings but their origins remain unknown, as is the type of macrolide resistance genes that will appear in the future. In this study, we used optimized hidden Markov models to characterize the macrolide resistome. Over 16 terabases of genomic and metagenomic data, representing a large taxonomic diversity (11 030 species) and diverse environments (1944 metagenomic samples), were searched for the presence of erm and mph genes. From this data, we predicted 28 340 macrolide resistance genes encoding 2892 unique protein sequences, which were clustered into 663 gene families (<70 % amino acid identity), of which 619 (94 %) were previously uncharacterized. This included six new resistance gene families, which were located on mobile genetic elements in pathogens. The function of ten predicted new resistance genes were experimentally validated in \n\nEscherichia coli\n\n using a growth assay. Among the ten tested genes, seven conferred increased resistance to erythromycin, with five genes additionally conferring increased resistance to azithromycin, showing that our models can be used to predict new functional resistance genes. Our analysis also showed that macrolide resistance genes have diverse origins and have transferred horizontally over large phylogenetic distances into human pathogens. This study expands the known macrolide resistome more than ten-fold, provides insights into its evolution, and demonstrates how computational screening can identify new resistance genes before they become a significant clinical problem.", "Data Summary", "Data Summary", "All datasets analysed in this study are publicly available and cited in Table 1 and within the text.

Since their discovery in the early fifties, macrolides have seen extensive clinical use, becoming one of the most frequently prescribed types of antibiotics with applications within both human and animal medicine [3, 4]. Macrolides are primarily effective against Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. \n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\n or \n\nMycoplasma genitalium\n\n [5]) since the molecular structure of the drugs in combination with the decreased permeability of the cell wall makes them less potent against Gram-negative bacteria. However, semi-synthetic macrolides, notably azithromycin, show greater activity towards Gram-negative bacteria, which has led to macrolides also being considered as a first-line treatment for many proteobacterial pathogens (e.g. \n\nSalmonella enterica\n\n or \n\nShigella\n\n sp. [6]) or as an alternative treatment when penicillin and fluoroquinolones are not applicable due to resistance or patient allergy [2, 3].", "Macrolides are broad-spectrum antibiotics that act by inhibiting the protein synthesis through interaction with the large ribosomal subunit [1, 2].

Two of the most common types of macrolide resistance genes are erm genes, encoding 23S rRNA methyltransferases, and mph genes, encoding GTP-dependent macrolide 2\u2032-phosphotransferases [9, 10]. Erm enzymes either mono- or di-methylate position N6 of A2058 in the 23S rRNA (\n\nEscherichia coli\n\n nomenclature), which, through steric hindrance, prevents the macrolide from interacting with its binding site. In addition to both natural and semi-synthetic macrolides, this results in resistance to lincosamide and streptogramin B antibiotics [1]. The exact origins of Erm enzymes have not been determined, though they are hypothesized to have evolved from the KsgA family of highly conserved 16S rRNA methylases through mutations leading to a shift in the ribosomal target [11]. In contrast to Erm, Mph enzymes interact directly with the macrolide molecules by attaching a phosphate group to the 2\u2032-OH group, which changes their biochemical structure such that they become unable to interact with the ribosomal target [12]. This means that, unlike Erm enzymes, Mph enzymes only protect against macrolides. Additionally, Mph enzymes do not have a universal substrate profile, meaning that not all variants protect equally well against all macrolides [13]. The origin of Mph enzymes is less clear, however, they are related to similar enzymes that phosphorylate aminoglycoside antibiotics, which in turn have been suggested to have an evolutionary relationship with eukaryotic protein kinases (e.g. cAMP-dependent protein kinase cAPK) based on structural similarity [14, 15]. While erm genes are the most abundant and diverse type of macrolide resistance genes, with 45 different genes described to date (<80% internal amino acid identity), mph genes are less numerous and with 15 genes described to date [16, 17].", "Resistance to macrolides is typically associated with one of three mechanisms \u2013 modification of the target ribosomal RNA, efflux or enzymatic inactivation of the drug [6] \u2013 and is often caused by mobile resistance genes, which spread to and between pathogens through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [7, 8].

Three gene models were created, representing two of the most common macrolide resistance mechanisms: ribosomal target modification by Erm 23S rRNA methyltransferases and drug inactivation through phosphorylation by Mph macrolide 2\u2032-phosphotransferases. As Erm 23S rRNA methyltransferases showed an inherently high sequence diversity, two separate models were built to ensure high performance (Fig. S1, Table S1). Each model was optimized based on a positive dataset containing experimentally validated protein sequences and a negative dataset containing protein sequences that were evolutionarily close to the ARGs without conferring a resistance phenotype. For the Erm models, the negative sequences consisted of proteins from the AdoMet MTase superfamily, while the negative data for the Mph model consisted of sequences representing homoserine kinase II. The models displayed an overall high sensitivity for full-length genes (0.94, 1.0 and 1.0 for Erm type A, Erm type F and Mph, respectively) while the specificity was 1.0 for all models (Fig. S2, Table S2). The performance for classification of metagenomic fragments varied more, with corresponding sensitivities of 0.7668, 0.8058 and 0.9663, and specificities of 0.90504, 0.9436 and 0.9857 (Fig. S2, Table S2).

Each model was optimized based on a positive dataset containing experimentally validated protein sequences and a negative dataset containing protein sequences that were evolutionarily close to the ARGs without conferring a resistance phenotype. For the Erm models, the negative sequences consisted of proteins from the AdoMet MTase superfamily, while the negative data for the Mph model consisted of sequences representing homoserine kinase II. The models displayed an overall high sensitivity for full-length genes (0.94, 1.0 and 1.0 for Erm type A, Erm type F and Mph, respectively) while the specificity was 1.0 for all models (Fig. S2, Table S2). The performance for classification of metagenomic fragments varied more, with corresponding sensitivities of 0.7668, 0.8058 and 0.9663, and specificities of 0.90504, 0.9436 and 0.9857 (Fig. S2, Table S2).

Considering that only 44 predicted gene families (6.63%) contained previously described erm and mph genes, our findings expand the known macrolide resistome more than tenfold and thus provide a more accurate description of its size and diversity [16]. Particularly, our results show that previously unknown erm and mph ARGs are especially common in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, while their frequency in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes is low in relation to their presence in the sequence repositories. Furthermore, the analysis of metagenomic data indicated that there is a large diversity of erm and mph resistance genes in the microbiome of both humans and domesticated animals.

When expressing these genes in \n\nE. coli\n\n, four of six were shown to induce a resistance phenotype, thus validating that they are functional and can provide increased macrolide resistance in Proteobacteria. It should be emphasized that the two genes that did not result in a resistance phenotype could be functional in other hosts. Indeed, we were unable to validate the resistance phenotype for the new G883 (UGF171), which was related to erm(F), a gene that is functional in, e.g. \n\nBacteroides fragilis\n\n but has previously been reported to not be functional in \n\nE. coli\n\n (though conflicting reports exist) [51, 52]. Furthermore, several of the new pathogen-associated mobile genes were found in Enterobacteriaceae or \n\nPseudomonas\n\n, which are intrinsically resistant to lower concentrations of most macrolides [53]. This suggests that the genes have either been promoted in these pathogens under high macrolide selection pressures or that the genes were co-selected together with other ARGs, possibly through co-localization on MGEs.

This shows that inter-phyla transfer events of macrolide resistance genes do not only include a few widespread macrolide resistance genes, such as erm(A), erm(B) and mph(B), but also several new genes. Interestingly, genes from four of the new pathogen-associated mobile families were found located close to one or more genes encoding components of conjugation systems, including MOB relaxases, mating pair formation (MPF) genes, and type IV coupling proteins. The MOB genes found close to genes from UGF171 and UGF45 were of types that have a documented broad host range (P/Q according to the nomenclature of Smillie et al.) and have been previously reported in multiple phyla, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria [54]. This suggests that conjugation enables the transfer of new macrolide resistance genes over very large evolutionary distances. Furthermore, genes from five of the pathogen-associated mobile gene families were found in the genetic vicinity of insertion sequences (ISs). Notably, ISCR2 \u2013 a member of the ISCR family that uses a rolling circle transposition mechanism to move adjacent genes [55] \u2013 was found close to a total of 11 genes representing two new erm families and one new mph family (Table 3). ISCR2 is one of the most widespread ISCRs and has previously been reported to be involved in the dissemination of multiple types of resistance genes, including macrolide phosphotransferases [56]. Since ISCR2 was associated with genes from three of the six mobile gene families found in pathogens, it suggests that this MGE plays an important role in the dissemination of new macrolide resistance genes. However, ISCR2 has, to our knowledge, not been identified outside of Proteobacteria to date, and indeed all occurrences identified in this study were in Proteobacteria. This would suggest that these new genes became associated with ISCR2 after the initial inter-phyla transfer event and that other HGT mechanisms could have been responsible for their original mobilization. Furthermore, as the sequence identity shared between most of the new pathogen-associated mobile erm genes and their closest chromosomal genes in commensal or environmental bacteria was generally low (as low as 34.5% amino acid identity), this suggests either that the original mobilization of these genes happened in the ancient past or that the mobilization was more recent but the original host(s) are not represented in the databases. However, the mph family UGF5 of mobile genes in Enterobacteriaceae shared as much as 83.7% amino acid identity with chromosomal genes in Sphingobacteriaceae, indicating that this may be the result of a more recent transfer event.", "The phylogenetic analysis revealed that macrolide resistance genes representing five of the six new pathogen-associated mobile gene families were found in species outside their indicated phylum of origin.

The phylogenetic analysis presented in this study provides a more detailed insight into their evolutionary history. For erm genes, we noted that the most widespread variants, including erm(A), erm(B) and erm(C), all clustered together into a single monophyletic clade together with species from the class Bacilli (cluster F.1, Fig. 3). Even though we were unable to identify their exact origin, it is clear that these genes share a close evolutionary relationship with Bacilli. Indeed, erm(A), erm(B) and erm(C) are all ubiquitously present in species from this class, especially in Bacillales, including \n\nStaphylococcus\n\n spp. [erm(A), erm(C)], and in Lactobacillales, including \n\nStreptococcus\n\n spp. [erm(B)]. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that all of these genes have undergone extensive HGT and they could be detected in both evolutionarily close and distant parts of the taxonomic tree (e.g. four, five and seven different phyla, respectively). Several of these transfer events have likely happened in the human or animal microbiome. For example, erm(B) had been transferred into a large number of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species from Clostridia (52), which, together with Bacilli, are ubiquitously present in the human and animal gut [58]. This indicates that the connectivity provided in the human microbiome, in combination with the presence of suitable MGEs and strong selection pressures caused by antibiotic consumption, may have favoured the mobilization and transfer of erm genes from their original hosts in Bacilli. We noted, however, that environmental Bacilli from the genus \n\nOceanobacillus\n\n were also represented within cluster F.1. Though some species from this genus are known to colonize the human microbiome (e.g. \n\nOceanobacillus picturae\n\n, \n\nOceanobacillus massiliensis\n\n) [59, 60], an origin for erm(A), erm(B) and erm(C) outside the human and animal microbiome cannot be excluded.", "Macrolide ARGs are present in bacteria from many phyla, however, their origin and evolutionary history have been largely unknown [57].

The phylogenetic analysis suggested that mph(A) originates from Proteobacteria, specifically Enterobacteriaceae, while mph(B) and mph(C) originate from Firmicutes (Clostridia and Bacilli, respectively). Finally, mph(E) was closely related to genes in Bacteriodetes, especially Sphingobacteriaceae, but was only found in one species from that phylum (\n\nMyroides odoratimimus\n\n), which likely reflects the under-representation of these genomes in the databases. Moreover, all of the most common mph genes, except for mph(C), have spread to several parts of the taxonomic tree, including many pathogens in Enterobacteriaceae. Indeed, mph(A) was, in addition to Proteobacteria, identified in Firmicutes (\n\nStreptococcus suis\n\n), while mph(B) and mph(E) were, in addition to their proposed original phyla, found in several proteobacterial species. We noted that mph(C), despite having a similar origin to mph(B) and being associated with MGEs, was not observed outside of Firmicutes. Our analysis of the genetic context showed that mph(B) genes were located on plasmids known to be associated with ARGs in Enterobacteriaceae (IncF, IncI, IncH) [61], likely explaining how they have been able to successfully spread among Proteobacteria. The association with an MGE with sufficient host range could thus explain why mph(B) has been able to successfully transfer to Proteobacteria when mph(C) has not.

These genes are rarely transferred outside their phylum of origin and we, similarly to previous studies, found no indication that any of the common clinically relevant macrolide ARGs have been mobilized from Actinobacteria. However, contrary to some previous suggestions [64], our results show instances where macrolide resistance genes have successfully spread from antibiotic-producing Actinobacteria into Proteobacteria, proving that, while uncommon, it does occur. As an example, the new erm family UGF311, which was most closely related (41.2\u201344.3 % amino acid identity) to chromosomal genes found in the macrolide-producing Actinobacteria \n\nPseudonocardia\n\n sp. and \n\nStreptomyces venezuelae\n\n [erm(31)] [3, 65], was identified on MGEs in \n\nP. aeruginosa\n\n.

Both \n\nM. xanthus\n\n and \n\nC. necator\n\n are known to prey on Actinobacteria and have recently been shown to be able to efficiently acquire actinobacterial genes (our data, unpublished).

Taken together, our results show that HGT of macrolide resistance genes from Actinobacteria to pathogens from other phyla is possible but limited. This is likely due to a combination of a multitude of barriers, such as the unavailability of MGEs with sufficient host range [54], missing ecological connectivity, and a lack of sufficiently strong selection pressures in some environments [18].
