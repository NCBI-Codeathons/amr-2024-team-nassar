Three dipeptide compounds were purified from its cell-free cultural broth and identified as (\u00b1)-nematophin, cyclo (L-Pro-Gly), and N, N\u2032-dimethyl-cyclo (L-Phe-L-Leu). Nematophin demonstrated a wider antifungal spectrum than the other two compounds. It also exhibited strong inhibitory effects on mycelial growth of Rhizoctonia solani and Phytophthora infestans with EC50 values of 40.00 and 51.25 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Its (S)-configuration structure [(+)-nematophin] was also synthesized and exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the enantiomeric mixture. The detached leaf assay revealed that nematophin possessed significant preventive and curative efficacy against R. solani on broad bean leaves showing corresponding control efficacies of 93.01 and 94.93% at 1,000 \u03bcg/ml, comparable to those of a chemical fungicide (carbendazim) at 500 \u03bcg/ml. Additionally, the pot experiments indicated that nematophin could effectively inhibit the disease extension on rice and broad bean plants caused by R. solani. Nematophin also exerted some adverse influences on the sclerotial development of R. solani by dramatically suppressing their formation and maturation at 40.00 \u03bcg/ml, as well as their germination at 15.00 \u03bcg/ml. Morphological and ultrastructural observations showed that the hyphae of R. solani became twisted, shriveled, and deformed at the growing points after exposure to nematophin at 40.00 \u03bcg/ml, and that the subcellular fractions also became abnormal concurrently, especially the mitochondrial structure. These results indicate that nematophin has great potential to be used as a bio-pesticide in agricultural production.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Xenorhabdus nematophila, a well-studied genus of entomopathogenic bacteria, lives in symbiosis with Steinernema nematodes. Previous research has revealed that X. nematophila is a potent producer of natural compounds with versatile biological activities including antifungal, antibacterial, and antimalarial activities (Crawford et al., 2012; Challinor and Bode, 2015; Engel et al., 2017; Dreyer et al., 2018). Many of these metabolites belong to peptides such as xenocoumacins, nematophin, xenorhabdins, rhabduscins, and xenorxides (Li et al., 1997a,b; Ji et al., 2004; B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9nyi et al., 2009; Helge, 2011; Yang et al., 2011). Such peptides are of diverse structures and resultant multiple bioactivities including antimicrobial activity against plant pathogens (Li et al., 1997a; Yang et al., 2011; Dreyer et al., 2018). Besides, whole genome programs have shown that approximately 7.5% of genomic genes encode proteins involving the secondary metabolism biosynthesis in the strain X. nematophila ATCC19061, most of which encoded molecules are cryptic (Chaston et al., 2011). Given that the culture supernatants of many Xenorhabdus species exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against many plant pathogens (Fang et al., 2014; Hazir et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016), it is feasible to discover novel secondary metabolites of antifungal activity from X. nematophila as bio-pesticides for agricultural production.", "Xenorhabdus nematophila, a well-studied genus of entomopathogenic bacteria, lives in symbiosis with Steinernema nematodes.

Rhizoctonia solani is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that infects more than 200 plant species worldwide, resulting in severe losses in crop yield (Lewis and Lumsden, 2001; Zheng et al., 2013; Mayo et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016). It can also produce sclerotia, a special resting structure surviving in soil for many years, which is the main source of infection in the disease cycle (Townsend and Willetts, 1954; Feng et al., 2016; Moni et al., 2016). Currently, the most common strategy for disease management is the application of chemical fungicides. Their overuse, however, has posed serious threats to human health, environmental safety and ecological balance (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016; Rohr et al., 2017). Bio-pesticides are effective alternatives to the chemical fungicides to overcome their adverse impacts (Kumar, 2018; Lengai and Muthomi, 2018).

Piperazine-2,5-diones including PDKP and MDKP are an important class of cyclodipeptide compounds of versatile bioactivities (Borthwick, 2012). However, scarce work described their antimicrobial activity against plant pathogens.

R. solani was most sensitive to NEP-1. Moreover, the EC50 values of NEP-1 against R. solani and P. infestans were determined to be 40 and 51.25 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Table 2).

MDKP, however, remarkably inhibited the mycelial growth of E. turcicum with an inhibition rate of 67.60% at 100 \u03bcg/ml, higher than that of NEP-1.

Its fermentation broth was indicated to possess strong antimicrobial activity against some plant pathogens in vitro and in vivo, including P. infestans and B. cinerea (Guo et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018).

Xenocoumacins and nematophin were also present in the culture supernatant of X. nematophila YL001, which was confirmed by the HPLC-MS analysis in our previous study (Guo et al., 2017). Based on this, we try to isolate and identify new metabolites from the strain of X. nematophila YL001.

The CD spectra (Supplementary Figure S2) and specific rotation of NEP-1, -2, and -3 reveal that NEP-1 is an enantiomeric mixture of nematophin, denying the previous inference that the natural nematophin is an enantiomer of (S)-configuration (Paik et al., 2003). Based on the biosynthetic process of nematophin, we deduced two possible pathways relevant to the formation of NEP-1. One is that (+)-nematophin (NEP-3) is derived from L-isoleucine (L-Ile) via the aminotransferase to generate 2-keto-3S-methylvaleric acid (S-KMVA) (Mamer, 2001), followed by enolization-induced racemization to form the nematophin stereoisomers in vivo. Previous studies revealed that the racemization of S-KMVA did not occur in vivo, and that L-alloisoleucine (L-allo-Ile) was derived from L-Ile rather than R-KMVA (Mamer and Reimer, 1992; Mamer and L\u00e9pine, 1996). Thus, the other pathway may be that NEP-1 is derived from the authigenic L-Ile and L-allo-Ile, which can be converted to S-KMVA and R-KMVA, respectively. Conversion of L-Ile to L-allo-Ile was verified in bacteria, fungi, plants and mammalian systems and L-allo-Ile is also present in many natural cyclic peptide antibiotics (Mamer, 2001; Li et al., 2016), providing evidence for the second pathway.
