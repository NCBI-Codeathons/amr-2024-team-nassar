Multidrug resistance makes S. epidermidis infections difficult to treat. The study aims to describe the genomic characteristics of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) isolated from clinical sources, to comprehend the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance, virulence, and potential pathogenicity. Sixteen MRSE underwent whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses were carried out to ascertain their resistome, virulome, mobilome, clonality, and phylogenomic relationships. In all, 75% of isolates displayed multidrug resistance and were associated with the carriage of multiple resistance genes including mecA, blaZ, tet(K), erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), dfrG, aac(6\u2032)-aph(2\u2032\u2032), and cat(pC221) conferring resistance to \u03b2-lactams, tetracyclines, macrolide\u2013lincosamide\u2013streptogramin B, aminoglycosides, and phenicols, which were located on both plasmids and chromosomes. Their virulence profiles were evidenced by the presence of genes involved in adherence/biofilm formation (icaA, icaB, icaC, atl, ebh, and ebp), immune evasion (adsA, capC, and manA), and antiphagocytosis (rmlC, cdsA, and A). The community-acquired SCCmec type IV was the most common SCCmec type. The CoNS belonged to seven multilocus sequence types (MLSTs) and carried a diversity of mobile genetic elements such as phages, insertion sequences, and plasmids. The bacterial anti-phage defense systems clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) immunity phage system and restriction-modification system (R-M system) and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) involved in immune evasion and transport of virulence genes were also found. The insertion sequence, IS256, linked with virulence, was found in 56.3% of isolates. Generally, the isolates clustered according to STs, with some similarity but also considerable variability within isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis provide insights into the likely pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. epidermidis, necessitating surveillance of this emerging pathogen.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Staphylococcus epidermidis are coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) that are commensals of the skin microbiome. Among the CoNS, S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, together referred to as the S. epidermidis group, are the most prevalent in clinical settings (Azih and Enabulele, 2013) and can behave as pathogens by colonizing medical devices, infecting surgical wounds, and causing bacteremia (Cabrera-Contreras et al., 2019). CoNS infection is commonly associated with device-associated healthcare infection. S. epidermidis is considered clinically relevant, moderately pathogenic, and known to display multidrug and methicillin resistance that complicates treatment (Becker et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015). mecA gene, which mediates methicillin resistance, is highly conserved in S. epidermidis, easily transferred to other staphylococcal species by horizontal transmission (M\u00e9ric et al., 2015), and borne on the staphylococcal cassette chromosome, SCCmec, which is shared between S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus (M\u00e9ric et al., 2015). It is estimated that globally, S. epidermidis together with other CoNS and S. aureus causes 30% of hospital-associated infections (Xu et al., 2018).", "Staphylococcus epidermidis are coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) that are commensals of the skin microbiome.

The pathogenicity of S. epidermidis is further enhanced by virulence genes associated with adherence/biofilm formation, phenol-soluble modulins, and various mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as plasmids, insertion sequences (ISs), transposons, pathogenicity islands, and phages that are involved in the acquisition and transmission of resistance and virulence characteristics (Bouchami et al., 2016; Rolo et al., 2017). The arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) system, a pathogenicity island thought to facilitate host colonization and immune evasion, has generated interest in recent years (O\u2019Connor et al., 2018). According to recent phylogenetic studies, the ACME most likely originated from S. epidermidis and transmitted to S. aureus through horizontal transfer (Onishi et al., 2013; Planet et al., 2013). Other factors that have been associated with pathogenicity in S. epidermidis include the metabolic state of the bacterial cell, genomic rearrangements in pathogenic isolates facilitated by IS256, and the conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance (Cabrera-Contreras et al., 2019).", "Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important carrier of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which can be transferred between staphylococcal species (Xu et al., 2018).

The sequence type ST2, a single S. epidermidis lineage, is dominant in hospital environments (Lee et al., 2018).

Despite the relatedness of isolates, there is still considerable variation within individual isolates pointing to their mobilization on diverse MGEs.", "Multilocus sequence typing has shown the population structure of S. epidermidis to be clonal (Thomas et al., 2007). The clonal lineages ST2, ST5, and ST23, which are the most commonly reported in hospital environments as well as other sequence types of S. epidermidis are globally distributed (Miragaia, 2018). ST2, in particular, is predominant in the hospital environment. In this study, 2/16 isolates belonged to ST2. Both ST2 isolates in this study possessed icaA gene and IS256, both of which are linked to enhanced pathogenicity (Du et al., 2013). ST35, ST81, and ST89 were not represented in this study, consistent with global data (Cabrera-Contreras et al., 2019). Despite the relatedness of isolates, there is still considerable variation within individual isolates pointing to their mobilization on diverse MGEs.", "Conclusion", "Conclusion", "Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from public hospitals in uMgungundlovu exhibited several permutations and combinations of ARGs, virulence genes, and MGEs pointing to a complex milieu of mobilized antibiotic resistance and pathogenic characteristics in clonal and multiclonal strains. The study thus reiterates the need for the genomic surveillance of CoNS as emerging pathogens to gain insights into their potential pathogenicity.", "Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from public hospitals in uMgungundlovu exhibited several permutations and combinations of ARGs, virulence genes, and MGEs pointing to a complex milieu of mobilized antibiotic resistance and pathogenic characteristics in clonal and multiclonal strains.
