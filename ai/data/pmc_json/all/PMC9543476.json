["ABSTRACT", "Convergence is the phenomenon whereby similar phenotypes evolve independently in different lineages. One example is resistance to toxins in animals. Toxins have evolved many times throughout the tree of life. They disrupt molecular and physiological pathways in target species, thereby incapacitating prey or deterring a predator. In response, molecular resistance has evolved in many species exposed to toxins to counteract their harmful effects. Here, we review current knowledge on the convergence of toxin resistance using examples from a wide range of toxin families. We explore the evolutionary processes and molecular adaptations driving toxin resistance. However, resistance adaptations may carry a fitness cost if they disrupt the normal physiology of the resistant animal. Therefore, there is a trade\u2010off between maintaining a functional molecular target and reducing toxin susceptibility. There are relatively few solutions that satisfy this trade\u2010off. As a result, we see a small set of molecular adaptations appearing repeatedly in diverse animal lineages, a phenomenon that is consistent with models of deterministic evolution. Convergence may also explain what has been called \u2018autoresistance\u2019. This is often thought to have evolved for self\u2010protection, but we argue instead that it may be a consequence of poisonous animals feeding on toxic prey. Toxin resistance provides a unique and compelling model system for studying the interplay between trophic interactions, selection pressures and the molecular mechanisms underlying evolutionary novelties.", "Jory van Thiel and Muzaffar A.

Toxins are key innovations that have evolved throughout the tree of life (Yamaguchi, Park & Inouye, 2011; Casewell et al., 2013). They act on specific molecular targets (e.g. receptors, ion\u2010channels, enzymes, and plasma membranes), causing a range of pathophysiological disruptions throughout the cardiovascular, circulatory and nervous systems (Fry et al., 2009; Casewell et al., 2013). Venom is a mixture of proteinaceous toxins exploited for a variety of functions, including prey capture and defence, ultimately resulting in severe pain, incapacitation or death. By definition, venoms are typically injected into a target system via a mechanical wound caused for example by fangs (e.g. snakes, centipedes and spiders), spines (e.g. fish), nematocysts (e.g. jellyfish and sea anemones) or stingers (bees, wasps and other arthropods). Poisons on the other hand tend to consist of small\u2010molecule toxins (e.g. low\u2010molecular\u2010weight alkaloid or steroidal\u2010based compounds) that are almost exclusively utilised to deter predators \u2013 often by causing rapid pain or paralysis upon contact or ingestion (Duran\u2010Riveroll & Cembella, 2017; Botelho et al., 2019).", "Convergent evolution is the independent emergence of similar traits across different lineages (Storz, 2016).

To counteract the deleterious effects of these toxins, some animals have evolved resistance. Toxin resistance is the increased ability of an animal to survive exposure to one or more toxins without being functionally affected. As a result, toxin resistance has evolved in at least three distinct ecological contexts (Fig.\u00a01): predator resistance, where a predator is resistant to the toxins of its prey (Fig.\u00a01A\u2013C); prey resistance, where the prey is resistant to the toxins of a predator (Fig.\u00a01D); or autoresistance, where an animal is resistant to its own toxins (Fig.\u00a01E).", "Therefore, toxins can be considered ecologically functional traits that mediate antagonistic interactions between predator and prey, driven by natural selection.

There are several molecular mechanisms underlying toxin resistance [reviewed in Holding et al., 2016b and Arbuckle, Rodriguez de la Vega & Casewell, 2017]. First, target modification is a change in the gene sequences that encode receptors or circulating proteins to which specific toxins bind, resulting in a reduction of binding affinity of the toxin towards the target (Barchan et al., 1992; Geffeney et al., 2005; Jansa & Voss, 2011; Tarvin et al., 2017; Karageorgi et al., 2019). Second, off\u2010target repurposing is the molecular modification of a previously non\u2010target site that increases its toxin\u2010binding affinity so that the physiological effect induced by the toxin is altered, and the desired effect has thereby been repurposed (Rowe et al., 2013). Finally, toxin scavenging involves serum\u2010based components that patrol the circulatory system and inhibit the activity of enzymatic toxins (Perez, Pichyangkul & Garcia, 1979; Biardi et al., 2011; Gibbs et al., 2020).", "Resistance particularly evolves in molecular targets involving key regulatory processes that are under strong selection pressures, i.e. that are crucial for the survival of an organism.

These resistance adaptations can be generally categorised as one of four different amino acid substitutions.

Secondly, arginine resistance is characterised by a replacement to arginine (187R). This change sterically hinders the binding of \u03b1\u2010neurotoxins (Rahman et al., 2020). However, since arginine is a positively charged amino acid, it has also been suggested to affect toxin binding by means of electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged \u03b1\u2010neurotoxins (Dellisanti et al., 2007; Drabeck, Dean & Jansa, 2015). Lysine resistance is characterised by a replacement to lysine (191K, 195K and/or 196K). This change to the positively charged amino acid affects the binding by means of electrostatic repulsion of \u03b1\u2010neurotoxins (Harris & Fry, 2021). Finally, proline resistance is characterised by a replacement from proline to either a leucine or histidine (194L, 197L/H).

The pain is caused by the activation of voltage\u2010gated Na+ channels (Nav 1.7), which are responsible for transmitting pain signals (nociceptive action potentials) to the central nervous system (Rowe et al., 2011, 2013). The grasshopper mouse (Onychomys torridus) preys on arthropods including bark scorpions. It shows toxin resistance towards bark scorpion venom characterised by a diminished pain response (Rowe & Rowe, 2008; Rowe et al., 2013). This resistance is underpinned by two substitutions: glutamine (859Q) and glutamic acid (862E) in the Nav 1.8 channel (Fig.\u00a04; Rowe et al., 2013).

Among these colubrid snakes, North American garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) are one of the best\u2010studied examples of TTX resistance (Brodie, 1990; Geffeney, Brodie & Ruben, 2002; Brodie III et al., 2005; Geffeney et al., 2005; Feldman et al., 2009, 2010).

Common garter snakes also evolved TTX resistance in two additional Nav paralogs: Nav 1.6 and Nav 1.7 (McGlothlin et al., 2014).

Interestingly, a recent study revealed that TTX resistance in newts is not exclusively restricted to the Nav 1.4 channel but extends across the entire Nav gene family, which is driven by positive selection, relaxed constraints and gene conversion events (Gendreau et al., 2021).", "The pufferfishes (family Tetraodontidae) are another group of animals that show TTX resistance.

Pufferfish exploit their resistant genotype for different ecological functions, enabling them to prey on TTX\u2010bearing species such as gastropods and echinoderms (Noguchi, Arakawa & Takatani, 2006b). Pufferfish thus accumulate high concentrations of dietary TTX in their organs, including liver, skin and ovaries (Noguchi et al., 2006b).

That principle implies asymmetric selection, such that the prey is under greater selection pressure to escape capture, compared to the selection pressure on the predator to secure a meal.", "By contrast, life\u2010history theory predicts that resistance is unlikely to evolve when selection pressure is low, for example: (i) when predation by a venomous predator is a relatively unimportant selective force for the prey because of the scarcity of encounters; (ii) a short temporal window of exposure exists (Marques et al., 2012); or (iii) when behavioural avoidance of toxic prey is more advantageous than evolving resistance (Smith, 1977; Brodie III, 1993; Portugal et al., 2016); see also Fig.\u00a03).", "By contrast, life\u2010history theory predicts that resistance is unlikely to evolve when selection pressure is low, for example: (i) when predation by a venomous predator is a relatively unimportant selective force for the prey because of the scarcity of encounters; (ii) a short temporal window of exposure exists (Marques et al., 2012); or (iii) when behavioural avoidance of toxic prey is more advantageous than evolving resistance (Smith, 1977; Brodie III, 1993; Portugal et al., 2016); see also Fig.\u00a03).", "By contrast, life\u2010history theory predicts that resistance is unlikely to evolve when selection pressure is low, for example: (i) when predation by a venomous predator is a relatively unimportant selective force for the prey because of the scarcity of encounters; (ii) a short temporal window of exposure exists (Marques et al., 2012); or (iii) when behavioural avoidance of toxic prey is more advantageous than evolving resistance (Smith, 1977; Brodie III, 1993; Portugal et al., 2016); see also Fig.\u00a03).", "Finally, it is also possible that resistance is most likely to evolve in situations where incremental increases in resistance confer an increasing selective advantage.
