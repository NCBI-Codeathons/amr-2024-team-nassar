["These authors contributed equally to this work.", "Agricultural soil harbors a diverse microbiome that can form beneficial relationships with plants, including the inhibition of plant pathogens. Pseudomonas spp. are one of the most abundant bacterial genera in the soil and rhizosphere and play important roles in promoting plant health. However, the genetic determinants of this beneficial activity are only partially understood. Here, we genetically and phenotypically characterize the Pseudomonas fluorescens population in a commercial potato field, where we identify strong correlations between specialized metabolite biosynthesis and antagonism of the potato pathogens Streptomyces scabies and Phytophthora infestans. Genetic and chemical analyses identified hydrogen cyanide and cyclic lipopeptides as key specialized metabolites associated with S. scabies inhibition, which was supported by in planta biocontrol experiments. We show that a single potato field contains a hugely diverse and dynamic population of Pseudomonas bacteria, whose capacity to produce specialized metabolites is shaped both by plant colonization and defined environmental inputs.", "eLife digest", "Potato scab and blight are two major diseases which can cause heavy crop losses. They are caused, respectively, by the bacterium Streptomyces scabies and an oomycete (a fungus-like organism) known as Phytophthora infestans.", "Fighting these disease-causing microorganisms can involve crop management techniques \u2013 for example, ensuring that a field is well irrigated helps to keep S. scabies at bay. Harnessing biological control agents can also offer ways to control disease while respecting the environment. Biocontrol bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, can produce compounds that keep S. scabies and P. infestans in check. However, the identity of these molecules and how irrigation can influence Pseudomonas population remains unknown.", "To examine these questions, Pacheco-Moreno et al. sampled and isolated hundreds of Pseudomonas strains from a commercial potato field, closely examining the genomes of 69 of these. Comparing the genetic information of strains based on whether they could control the growth of S. scabies revealed that compounds known as cyclic lipopeptides are key to controlling the growth of S. scabies and P. infestans. Whether the field was irrigated also had a large impact on the strains forming the Pseudomonas population.", "Working out how Pseudomonas bacteria block disease could speed up the search for biological control agents. The approach developed by Pacheco-Moreno et al. could help to predict which strains might be most effective based on their genetic features.

Properly managed irrigation is a reasonably effective control measure for potato scab. However, scab outbreaks still regularly occur in irrigated soil, and with increasing pressures on water use it is clear that alternative approaches to the control of scab are needed.

We hypothesized that a comparative analysis of a similar number of genomes from suppressive and nonsuppressive strains would identify those BGCs that play important roles in suppressive activity.", "Taxonomic identifications using 16S rRNA amplicon analysis showed order-level changes to the field microbiome between sites (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1) but were unable to accurately capture diversity within genera or species groups. Therefore, biologically relevant variation within the populations of genetically diverse species groups such as P. fluorescens is potentially overlooked. To investigate the diversity of the fluorescent pseudomonad population, we isolated 240 individual Pseudomonas strains from our pre- and post-irrigation field sites (Supplementary file 1). These strains were screened for multiple phenotypes including motility, protease production, fluorescence (siderophore production), and on-plate suppression of S. scabies using a cross-streak assay (Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2). Each phenotype was scored on an ordinal scale between 0 (no phenotype observed) and 3 (strong phenotype). The cross-streak assay provided a rapid read-out of bacterial antagonism for both contact-dependent and diffusible mechanisms of growth inhibition. On-plate suppression of S. scabies was a surprisingly rare trait, with 79% of Pseudomonas isolates outcompeted by S. scabies in this assay.

We hypothesized that a comparative analysis of a similar number of genomes from suppressive and nonsuppressive strains would identify those BGCs that play important roles in suppressive activity.", "The phylogeny of the 69 sequenced strains was analyzed alongside various model pseudomonads, including representatives of the eight phylogenomic P. fluorescens groups defined by Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016. Our sequenced strain collection spans much of this characterized global phylogenetic diversity and contains representatives of at least five of the eight P. fluorescens phylogenomic groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016), as well as strains belonging to the Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas syringae groups (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3). This genetic heterogeneity was also reflected in the diverse specialized metabolome of these strains, as predicted by a detailed analysis of the BGCs encoded in their genomes. Each genome was subjected to antiSMASH 5.0 analysis (Blin et al., 2019), which was further refined by extensive manual annotation to improve the accuracy of predicted pathway products. This second annotation step was particularly important for BGCs that are atypically distributed across two distinct genomic loci (e.g., viscosin and pyoverdine). Our analysis was further expanded to include BGCs not identified by antiSMASH 5.0, including BGCs for hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (Pessi and Haas, 2000), microcin B17-like pathways (Metelev et al., 2013), and the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (McClerklin et al., 2018; Palm et al., 1989). This was achieved by searching the genomes with a curated set of known Pseudomonas BGCs using MultiGeneBlast (Medema et al., 2013) (see Appendix 1 for further details). This manual annotation provided a level of resolution superior to that provided by automated cluster-searching algorithms alone and provided confidence that the majority of natural product biosynthetic potential had been identified. Within a given pathway type (e.g., nonribosomal peptide synthetases [NRPSs]), likely pathway products were assigned where possible (e.g., CLPs) or assigned a code when a conserved uncharacterized BGC was identified (e.g., NRPS 1). All BGCs were mapped to strain phylogeny (Figure 2).", "The phylogeny of the 69 sequenced strains was analyzed alongside various model pseudomonads, including representatives of the eight phylogenomic P. fluorescens groups defined by Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016.

An alternative hypothesis is that changes in the overall relative abundance of soil Pseudomonas over Streptomyces resulting from irrigation may override the observed shift towards less-suppressive Pseudomonas genotypes. In support of this, drought-induced enrichment for commensal Streptomyces and depletion of Proteobacteria in sorghum and rice plants have been shown to be reversed by irrigation (Santos-Medell\u00edn et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2018). In this model, irrigation may reduce the relative fitness of S. scabies versus Pseudomonas spp., while the microbiome of irrigated roots simultaneously becomes less optimal for disease suppression.", "Unexpectedly, irrigation led to a decrease in the proportion of suppressive pseudomonads on potato roots (Figure 8A) even though irrigation is one of the most effective ways to suppress potato scab. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that irrigation enables nonsuppressive Pseudomonas spp. with low motility to be transported to plant roots more effectively.

Therefore, possible future efforts to control potato scab could combine irrigation with pretreatment with effective biocontrol strains, like Ps619, to ensure tubers are colonized by a significant proportion of biocontrol strains. Such a strategy could reduce the quantity of water required for effective scab suppression.

For example, the role of many bacterial specialized metabolites in nature is poorly understood, especially for prolific producers such as the pseudomonads and the streptomycetes (van der Meij et al., 2017). Future studies could examine whether the host selects for bacterial populations enriched in specific BGCs and whether environmental stimuli modulate the abundance of these BGCs.

The authors address the potato scab disease caused by Streptomyces scabie, a disease currently best managed by irrigation. The authors suspect that the protection under irrigation is mediated by the rise of specific pathogen suppressive bacteria in the soil/rhizosphere. The authors chose to focus on Pseudomonads which they cultivate from the field and assay them phenotypically as well as sequence and compare their genomes, identifying differentially distributed BGCs that correlate with pathogen suppression, in vitro. They explore the roles two classes of metabolites (HCN and CLPs) in inhibiting Ss. They ultimately find that Ss suppressive strains (in vitro) are not enriched in the protected irrigated fields.", "Overall, the manuscript is well-written, the figures are clear and beautiful, and the quality of work is noteworthy. However, the story presented is cumbersome, with 8 main figures (and 19S figures!) the paper is not accessible as it should be. More problematic is the lack of in-vivo work (plant or field) and ultimately the discrepancy between the hypothesis and results (suppressive strains are not enriched in irrigated fields).", "Unless I missed the point (and I would gladly read an appeal by the authors or other reviewers if I did), the storyline doesn't lead to a logical conclusion. The authors show multiple experiments of notable quality, but I find it hard to describe exactly what the authors found in relation to their stated problem. Were they able to provide insight into the irrigated vs. unirrigated phenomena? Was the in-vitro phenotyping relevant to the field?", "Unfortunately, while I find the paper interesting, it isn't currently clear to me that the authors made a discovery that would merit publication in eLife. I urge the authors to try and distill the discoveries made in this study into a more concise and logically appealing report.", "1. The authors took a genomic approach alongside an array of classical microbiological techniques to study the potential interactions between Pseudomonads and Streptomyces scabie under defined laboratory conditions. They reached the conclusion that CLPs and HCN can help Pseudomonads to inhibit and outcompete S. scabie. However, while these results provide well-demonstrated phenotypes, considering the large body of work on Pseudomonad-dependent biocontrol it is not surprising that toxic metabolites like HCN can inhibit competitor growth. While CLPs provide a novel result, the authors do not isolate the effect of CLPs as compared with motility effects \u2013 for example, they do not show that the purified CLP can cause these effects.", "2. The authors choose to focus on Pseudomonads, which have been already extensively implicated in biocontrol in the last 3 decades, with many studies linking various secondary metabolites to disease control in various crops, mainly in the context of fungal infections, as well as in the context of aridity and irrigation: the authors are should be aware of the multiple papers from the Thomashow's lab on irrigations and biocontrol by Pseudomonads, which are not citated here\u2026 (Mavrodi 2012 and 2018 for example).", "3. Since all of the phenotypic work in the study is done on agar plates and not on lab grown plants or in the field its completely feasible that the inferred interactions do not take place outside of the lab. This is a major limitation of the current study and a reasonable explanation to their later contradictory findings.", "4. Ultimately, using both metagenomics and culturing the authors find no substantial difference in the microbial communities of irrigated vs. unirrigated fields. Thus, the protective effects of irrigation remain a mystery and Pseudomonads have again been shown to inhibit pathogens in-vitro. There could be many possible reasons for this discrepancy.

The sample sizes of suppressive isolates is quite small, and it is hard to be certain that culturing really represents a random and representative sample of what is in the soil. In retrospect, it seems like it would have been more straightforward to perform qPCR to look at abundance of genes or transcripts related to HCN or CLPs in the two soil types. However, as the authors found an increase in the total abundance of Pseudomonas after irrigation (Figure 1C), I think they could make a stronger case based on my point above and speculate that an increase in total Pseudomonas might contribute to suppression, rather than a change in function of Pseudomonas (which is not really supported by the data).", "3. For Figure 2, it would be helpful if the authors could label each Pseudomonas subgroup as in Garrido-Sanz et al. and/or include some widely studied or type strains to help orient the reader and provide context for the strains and tree.

We are therefore returning this study to you with encouragement to take the time to attempt these type of clarifying in vivo experiments, and to resubmit to eLife once they are complete.

The authors address the potato scab disease caused by Streptomyces scabie, a disease currently best managed by irrigation. The authors suspect that the protection under irrigation is mediated by the rise of specific pathogen suppressive bacteria in the soil/rhizosphere. The authors chose to focus on Pseudomonads which they cultivate from the field and assay them phenotypically as well as sequence and compare their genomes, identifying differentially distributed BGCs that correlate with pathogen suppression, in vitro. They explore the roles two classes of metabolites (HCN and CLPs) in inhibiting Ss. They ultimately find that Ss suppressive strains (in vitro) are not enriched in the protected irrigated fields.", "Overall, the manuscript is well-written, the figures are clear and beautiful, and the quality of work is noteworthy. However, the story presented is cumbersome, with 8 main figures (and 19S figures!) the paper is not accessible as it should be. More problematic is the lack of in-vivo work (plant or field) and ultimately the discrepancy between the hypothesis and results (suppressive strains are not enriched in irrigated fields).", "As described in the response to the editor, we have now obtained significant in planta data that ties together much of the genotypic and phenotypic data reported in the original manuscript. We cannot entirely unite these data with the irrigation data, but we believe that this is a very interesting observation that warrants reporting. For example, what if irrigation is a sub-optimal mode of scab suppression due to a reduction in Pseudomonas biocontrol strains? Our data potentially supports improved suppression strategies where irrigation is combined with the application of biocontrol strains to maximise the effect of a protective microbiome.", "In terms of manuscript length, we agree to an extent with the reviewer\u2019s comments, especially as we have had to lengthen some sections to include new results, methods and citations. We have therefore made edits throughout the manuscript (and figures) to reduce their length, and have removed most of the section that relates to the suppression of other plant pathogens (the old Figure 7 plus associated main text, as recommended by this reviewer). These edits are summarised in a \u201ctrack changes\u201d version of the manuscript.", "We believe that these edits help the manuscript flow more effectively. However, we are keen that the manuscript properly reflects the diverse experimental approaches that were undertaken in this study, which does require the manuscript to be relatively large. We also strongly believe that extensive supplementary information is highly beneficial for other researchers and fits with the ethos of eLife. We want to be as open as possible in presenting associated data, such as the visualisation of gene clusters, carefully annotated mass spectrometry and NMR data, detailed figures showing phenotypic results, and extra data that supports key findings in the main manuscript text.", "Unless I missed the point (and I would gladly read an appeal by the authors or other reviewers if I did), the storyline doesn't lead to a logical conclusion. The authors show multiple experiments of notable quality, but I find it hard to describe exactly what the authors found in relation to their stated problem. Were they able to provide insight into the irrigated vs. unirrigated phenomena? Was the in-vitro phenotyping relevant to the field?", "Our new experiments provide substantial insight to this question. We now have in planta data that relates the in vitro phenotyping to real biocontrol properties. The relevance to the unexpected irrigation data is discussed above.

Our study should prompt some interesting follow-on questions about the role and relative dominance of these non-suppressive strains.", "Unfortunately, while I find the paper interesting, it isn't currently clear to me that the authors made a discovery that would merit publication in eLife. I urge the authors to try and distill the discoveries made in this study into a more concise and logically appealing report.", "1. The authors took a genomic approach alongside an array of classical microbiological techniques to study the potential interactions between Pseudomonads and Streptomyces scabie under defined laboratory conditions. They reached the conclusion that CLPs and HCN can help Pseudomonads to inhibit and outcompete S. scabie. However, while these results provide well-demonstrated phenotypes, considering the large body of work on Pseudomonad-dependent biocontrol it is not surprising that toxic metabolites like HCN can inhibit competitor growth. While CLPs provide a novel result, the authors do not isolate the effect of CLPs as compared with motility effects \u2013 for example, they do not show that the purified CLP can cause these effects.", "We have now purified a CLP from strain Ps682. We had previously shown that production of this viscosin-like CLP was critical for motility and biological activity. This CLP (an isomer of viscosin: \u201cviscosin I\u201d) has been characterised in detail by NMR and further MS/MS experiments. Viscosin I inhibits S. scabies in disk diffusion assays, which has been incorporated into Figure 5.", "2. The authors choose to focus on Pseudomonads, which have been already extensively implicated in biocontrol in the last 3 decades, with many studies linking various secondary metabolites to disease control in various crops, mainly in the context of fungal infections, as well as in the context of aridity and irrigation: the authors are should be aware of the multiple papers from the Thomashow's lab on irrigations and biocontrol by Pseudomonads, which are not citated here\u2026 (Mavrodi 2012 and 2018 for example).", "Apologies \u2013 we were aware of this work and the absence of citations was a mistake. These are now cited along with a sentence of descriptive text (lines 515-517).", "3. Since all of the phenotypic work in the study is done on agar plates and not on lab grown plants or in the field its completely feasible that the inferred interactions do not take place outside of the lab. This is a major limitation of the current study and a reasonable explanation to their later contradictory findings.", "This has been discussed in detail above.", "4. Ultimately, using both metagenomics and culturing the authors find no substantial difference in the microbial communities of irrigated vs. unirrigated fields. Thus, the protective effects of irrigation remain a mystery and Pseudomonads have again been shown to inhibit pathogens in-vitro. There could be many possible reasons for this discrepancy. Possibly another suppressive type of bacteria or fungi or maybe just the abiotic conditions imposed under irrigation (lower oxygen levels for example) shape the behavior of the pathogen itself.", "This has been discussed above. We have also included a statement in the Discussion on the possibility that irrigation reduces the relative fitness of S. scabies versus Pseudomonas spp. yet may not favour an optimal microbiome for disease suppression based on our in planta data. The data we report also provides an ideal foundation for ourselves and others to investigate this observation in more detail (for example, how and why does the environment shape the Pseudomonas population? Is this observed for other diverse genera?). This manuscript represents one of the most extensive attempts to map intra-genus variation in such defined conditions. Comparable studies linking microbial genotype and biological activity either do not contain an explicit link to environmental sampling (e.g. Nature Microbiology, 2019, 4, 996) or focus on a specific environment but do not investigate the link between biological activity and plant health (e.g. Nature Microbiology, 2018, 3, 909).", "Reviewer #2:", "The manuscript by Stefanato et al. constitutes a brilliant multidisciplinary study of the pan-genomic variation in molecular interactions with plant pathogens, which sheds light on their potential plant-protective role within plant microbiomes.

CheckM analysis of duplicated housekeeping genes instead identified assembly errors in two strains, where contigs were duplicated in their sequence files (for example, two different contigs were effectively identical in strain Ps861). This has now been corrected in the online sequences. We should note that we did originally manually review gene cluster data for evidence of BGCs coming from non-Pseudomonas strains by assessing features such as GC content and sequence identity to know BGCs. More generally, there is strong evidence of horizontal transfer of BGCs between diverse bacterial taxa, including pseudomonads (e.g. Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 2018, 84, e02828\u201317; Appl. Environ.

This was one reason why we functionally tested some of the most prominent correlations via gene deletions and tried to highlight this in the text of the manuscript. It may be difficult to separate phylogenetic structure from BGC presence/absence given that the acquisition of a specific BGC may be a critical determinant of lifestyle and thus shape the evolution of specific clades. For example, CLPs aid motility and suppress a variety of organisms. In relation to the Chi-squared tests in Figures 3 and 8, we have since reasoned that a Chi-squared test was not the most suitable statistical test, as it assesses numerical data instead of purely categorical data (i.e., a score of 3 is more similar to 2 than to 0, which is not reflected by a Chi-squared test that assesses for the distribution of categorical variables). We have revised this figure to show statistical significances from a MannWhitney test, which is used to assess for numerical differences between two groups.", "\u2013 For the new viscosin and tensin analogues, it is not clearly indicated in the text/figures how they are related to known viscosins/tensins.

For tensin and other molecules identified by mass spectrometry, the key message was that our MS data and BGC analysis was fully consistent with tensin (and other CLPs in other strains), but without an available authentic standard, we could not explicitly confirm this. For example, simply one stereocentre could be different, such as L-alloisoleucine instead of L-isoleucine, but we believe this is beyond the scope of this paper. For viscosin, the availability of P. fluorescens SBW25 enabled a direct analytical comparison, which indicated that while all BGCs were very similar to each other (>90% identity) and MS data was almost identical, the different LC retention time of some viscosin-like CLPs (e.g. from Ps682) meant that they are isomers of the characterised viscosin. We have now isolated and characterised the viscosinlike CLP from Ps682 using NMR and MS, which highlights possible structural differences but does demonstrate that its chemical connectivity is identical to viscosin and a related molecule called WLIP.", "\u2013 The authors conclude that a subset of the pseudomonads function as generalist pathogen suppressors, based on in vitro experiments, and also imply that pseudomonads use CLPs and HCN to inhibit pathogenic streptomycetes.

In fact, the detection of substantial clonal populations would have told a different story, which would have been interesting in itself (for example, that the same field and/or plants selects for a very narrow population of pseudomonads). However, our initial phenotypic scoring (shown as a sheet in Supporting Dataset 1) provided evidence that the strains were phenotypically diverse, while genome sequencing showed that no two strains are identical, although some are clearly closely related.

The sample sizes of suppressive isolates is quite small, and it is hard to be certain that culturing really represents a random and representative sample of what is in the soil. In retrospect, it seems like it would have been more straightforward to perform qPCR to look at abundance of genes or transcripts related to HCN or CLPs in the two soil types. However, as the authors found an increase in the total abundance of Pseudomonas after irrigation (Figure 1C), I think they could make a stronger case based on my point above and speculate that an increase in total Pseudomonas might contribute to suppression, rather than a change in function of Pseudomonas (which is not really supported by the data).", "We respectfully disagree that our root sampling is not representative of what is going on in the soil. The results of two independent field experiments conducted two years apart both show a decrease in the proportion of suppressive pseudomonads associated with potato roots. The first experiment (Figures 1-2) contained too few sequenced isolates to draw robust conclusions, therefore we designed the second experiment (Figure 8) to investigate this phenomenon further. This experiment showed highly significant differences in the proportion of suppressive isolates on irrigated and non-irrigated roots. While there will inevitably be a degree of sampling bias in any experiment based on culturable isolates, we did our best to ensure that any bias would apply equally to all samples (soil/roots and irrigated/non-irrigated). Our previous expt. showed that a broad distribution of different Pseudomonas genotypes could be cultured from the soil by the methods used here (Figure 2), so we are confident that what we show in Figure 8 is a real phenomenon.", "That said, the hypothesis presented by the reviewers; that relative Pseudomonas and Streptomyces abundance are affected by irrigation and this may be the primary factor in scab suppression, is a valid one. We have amended the discussion to include this as an alternative explanation for our results, and include the suggested references in support of this.", "3. For Figure 2, it would be helpful if the authors could label each Pseudomonas subgroup as in Garrido-Sanz et al. and/or include some widely studied or type strains to help orient the reader and provide context for the strains and tree. This would also help others in the field use this as a resource to identify functional genes that are Pseudomonas-clade specific.", "Thank you for the suggestion. We have taken a slightly different strategy as we were wary of adding too much information to a figure that was already very complex. We agree that the relationship to reference strains is useful information, and we had already presented the Pseudomonas sub-groups and reference strains in Figure 2 \u2014figure supplement 3. This figure is also now referred to in the Figure 2 legend. In addition, a link to an interactive online tree has also been added (via iTOL, https://itol.embl.de/tree/902431818658671633339579), which features reference strains and all phenotypic and genotypic information presented in Figure 2. We hope this online tree serves as a resource for other researchers.", "4. For the paragraphs starting on line 192 (mostly related to Figure 2) please ensure you reference the figure or data in each instance. For instance, \"Multiple BGCs were commonly found across the sequenced strains, including BGCs predicted to make CLPs (42), arylpolyenes (43) and HCN (38).\" This is shown in Figure 2, but it is not referenced in the text so it was hard for me find.", "Figure 2 and Supplementary File 1 are now referenced towards the beginning of this paragraph, which should guide the reader wanting to see the strains that have these BGCs.", "5. There are multiple auxin biosynthesis pathways in Pseudomonas (IoaX/IAN, IAH, etc.; for instance, see https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006811) so it would be helpful to know if the genes identified are all the same pathway. I'm asking in part because it's a bit surprising that IAA biosynthesis is so uncommon in your analysis while other studies have found it to be quite prevalent (for instance, while this study is limited to P. brassicearum, they identified IAA biosynthesis in the whole clade https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001145)", "The methodology we used for identifying all genes and gene clusters is reported in detail in Appendix 1. To identify IAA BGCs, we searched for clustered homologues of IaaM and IaaH from Pseudomonas savastanoi. We therefore appreciate the reference to another well-characterised route to auxin in a Pseudomonas species. Using the information in the PLOS Pathogens paper mentioned above, we assessed our strains for AldA, which was reported to be the critical indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase for IAA biosynthesis in Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. This revealed that homologues of this protein are encoded in all of the strains reported in our study (>88% identity) and are found in exactly the same genetic context as in DC3000. This provides confidence that these homologous proteins represent a genuine route to IAA. We distinguish this route from the other IAA route by naming them IAA 1 and IAA 2 (equivalent to the nomenclature we use for PQQ BGCs). All relevant information has been updated (additional citation, Figure 2 details, Supplementary File 1, Appendix 1 details on AldA), and the manuscript text has been adjusted accordingly."]
