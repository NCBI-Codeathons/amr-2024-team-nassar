The deletion of the pokOIV oxygenase gene led to a non-polyketomycin-producing mutant. Instead, novel compounds were produced by the mutant, which have not been detected before in the wild type strain. Four different compounds were identified and named foxicins A\u2013D. Foxicin A was isolated and its structure was elucidated as an unusual nitrogen-containing quinone derivative using various spectroscopic methods. Through genome mining, the foxicin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the draft genome sequence of S. diastatochromogenes. The cluster spans 57 kb and encodes three PKS type I modules, one NRPS module and 41 additional enzymes. A foxBII gene-inactivated mutant of S. diastatochromogenes T\u00fc6028 \u0394pokOIV is unable to produce foxicins. Homologous fox biosynthetic gene clusters were found in more than 20 additional Streptomyces strains, overall in about 2.6% of all sequenced Streptomyces genomes. However, the production of foxicin-like compounds in these strains has never been described indicating that the clusters are expressed at a very low level or are silent under fermentation conditions. Foxicin A acts as a siderophore through interacting with ferric ions. Furthermore, it is a weak inhibitor of the Escherichia coli aerobic respiratory chain and shows moderate antibiotic activity. The wide distribution of the cluster and the various properties of the compound indicate a major role of foxicins in Streptomyces strains.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Plants, marine organisms, protozoans, fungi, and bacteria produce a wide range of different secondary metabolites. They are not essential for normal growth, development, or reproduction of an organism, but play a secondary role. There have been several discussions about the selective advantage of these natural products for their producers (Firn and Jones, 2000). Secondary metabolites may act as signals for differentiation, as communication molecules, or as weapons to defend against food competitors (Demain and Fang, 2000) and thus they often possess vital functions in their ecological habitat. The genes responsible for the biosynthesis of a compound are often located next to each other in so called biosynthetic gene clusters. The clusters often span more than 100 kb and encode more than 30 genes related to biosynthesis, transport, regulation, self-resistance and modification. Due to their antibiotic, antitumor, cholesterol-lowering, immunosuppressant or antiviral activities, secondary metabolites are invaluable elements of drug discovery research (Vaishnav and Demain, 2011). Approximately 18.000 bioactive secondary metabolites are produced in bacteria, thereof more than 10.000 compounds are synthesized in Streptomyces (B\u00e9rdy, 2012). Representatives of the genus Streptomyces have been studied extensively in the last decades (Weber et al., 2015b). A well-known class of bioactive secondary metabolites are polyketides that are assembled by modular megaenzymes called PKSs. The subsequent steps in the assembly process are highly similar to the biosynthesis of fatty acids. A detailed introduction to PKS can be found in Staunton and Weissman (2001). Non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) belong to another important class of bioactive compounds. They are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) that share certain characteristics with PKS (see Schwarzer et al., 2003 for details).", "Plants, marine organisms, protozoans, fungi, and bacteria produce a wide range of different secondary metabolites.
