["Summary", "For over seven decades, bacteria served as a valuable source of bioactive natural products some of which were eventually developed into drugs to treat infections, cancer and immune system\u2010related diseases. Traditionally, novel compounds produced by bacteria were discovered via conventional bioprospecting based on isolation of potential producers and screening their extracts in a variety of bioassays. Over time, most of the natural products identifiable by this approach were discovered, and the pipeline for new drugs based on bacterially produced metabolites started to run dry. This mini\u2010review highlights recent developments in bacterial bioprospecting for novel compounds that are based on several out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010box approaches, including the following: (i) targeting bacterial species previously unknown to produce any bioactive natural products, (ii) exploring non\u2010traditional environmental niches and methods for isolation of bacteria and (iii) various types of \u2018genome mining\u2019 aimed at unravelling genetic potential of bacteria to produce secondary metabolites. All these approaches have already yielded a number of novel bioactive compounds and, if used wisely, will soon revitalize drug discovery pipeline based on bacterial natural products.", "Microbial Biotechnology (2019) 12(5), 828\u2013844", "Funding information", "This work was supported by the University of Vienna.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Natural products from microorganisms are structurally very diverse and represent a rich source for the discovery of new drugs to treat various human diseases, including infections and cancer. Over 50% of all pharmaceutical drugs currently on the market are directly derived from or inspired by natural products (Newman and Cragg, 2016). Bacteria are perhaps the most prolific microbial producers of bioactive natural products, which are represented by their secondary metabolites. The latter compounds are not required for the normal proliferation of the producing organisms, but appear to give some advantages in environmental adaptation and survival (Jenke\u2010Kodama et\u00a0al., 2008; Strachan and Davies, 2016). Some studies suggest that secondary metabolites with antibiotic activity may be used by bacteria to fight off predators, to compete for nutritional sources (van der Meij et\u00a0al., 2017) or even to defend their hosts (Samuels et\u00a0al., 2013). Whatever the biological role(s) of secondary metabolites is in nature, they are important for the bacteria that synthesize them, since a significant amount of cellular resources, including building blocks from primary metabolism, cofactors and energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, are required for their biosynthesis. Apparently, the biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolites evolved over millions of years to generate chemical structures that interact with particular biological targets, either in the producing organism itself or in those present in the surrounding environment.

Although application of these circuits for controlling secondary metabolism in bacteria is currently still in the early stage, they will certainly become valuable in the future biotech industry, especially for controlled production of valuable drugs.", "Reorganizations of metabolic pathways, also termed \u2018refactoring\u2019, must take into account the levels of gene expression. Ideally, enzymes should be produced only in the amounts sufficient to catalyse specific reactions, and excessive synthesis of enzymes is too energy\u2010demanding or could be even toxic for the cell. Gene expression in bacterial BGCs is usually tightly regulated by a complex system consisting of several layers of regulation (Liu et\u00a0al., 2013).

Biosensors reacting to production of specific secondary metabolites can replace laborious and time\u2010consuming analytical chemistry needed to analyse the results of genome mining. Certain types of biosensors are based on proteins which are able to translate the chemical information (target compound) into fluorescent or colorimetric signal, which makes the screening fast and convenient (DeLoache et\u00a0al., 2015). Recently, several attempts to build biosensors reacting to target compounds and allowing selection of high\u2010producing strains have been reported. Based on the TetR\u2010like repressors, which are very abundant in the BGCs, and bpsA reporter gene encoding indigoidine synthetase, the proof of principle was obtained by detecting production of target antibiotic coelimycin by a biosensor (Sun et\u00a0al., 2017). In another case, the constructed biosensor was used to improve production of antibiotic pamamycin (Reberts et\u00a0al., 2018). In this work, the biosensor built based on the native TetR\u2010like repressor proved to be suboptimal, but was then fine\u2010tuned by altering the promoter and operator regions of the reporter, as well as the ligand affinity of the repressor. Although the attempts were successful, and much useful information has been obtained, these tools still need to be improved to make them robust and applicable to a wide variety of BGCs that are still not characterized with respect to their products.", "Synthetic biology also offers possibilities for construction of in\u00a0vivo biosensors, the synthetic devices for selection of strains producing specific compounds and intermediates as a tool that greatly simplifies genome mining and screening.

A year later, several groups demonstrated the efficacy of the method by performing single and multiple gene deletions and point mutations in the genomes of Streptomyces spp. (Huang et\u00a0al., 2015; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2015). There is also a progress in application of the system for CRISPR/Cas9\u2010mediated activation of cryptic BGCs in Streptomyces (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017), manipulating the BSGs (Liu et\u00a0al., 2015) and cloning and refactoring of BGCs for heterologous expression. Cloning the big BGCs of 100\u00a0kb or larger is still a bottleneck in heterologous expression. In recent studies, CRISPR/Cas9 approach was combined with Gibson assembly and TAR cloning allowing to clone up to 100\u00a0kb of intact DNA, improve the efficiency of TAR and even assemble megabase\u2010sized fragment of DNA by homologous recombination assembly (CasHRA) (Jiang et\u00a0al., 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2015, 2016; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2016).

New ways of how previously uncultivable bacteria can be isolated, exploration of unique environments, and metagenomic\u2010assisted isolation methods will certainly provide bacterial producers of new bioactive compounds. Recent developments in analytic techniques allowing fast de\u2010replication and identification of compounds\u2019 chemical classes and structural features will greatly support the bacterial bioprospecting for new drugs. Development and application of new assays for bioactivities (e.g. for quorum sensing inhibitors, pain suppressors and bioactive compounds against Alzheimer disease) will help to identify compounds that were previously not detected simply because there were no corresponding assays. Genome mining will definitely expand to more bacterial species and BGCs, providing new bioactive compounds via a combination of different methods, including those inspired by synthetic biology. Once discovered, the new compounds will have to be produced at a scale allowing biological testing for pharmacological properties. Therefore, the supply issue will have to be addressed by both refactoring of the BGCs and streamlining metabolism of the host through metabolic engineering, focusing on metabolic flux through target pathway, robustness of the producer and balancing precursor supply. Considering all the advances made in bacterial biology over the last two decades, the future for the discovery of novel drug candidates from bacteria looks bright.", "Despite a clear scepticism from the pharmaceutical companies regarding bacterial natural products, most of which traditionally been antibiotics, a considerable effort is being made by scientific community to prove that many new drugs can still be developed from bacterial secondary metabolites.
