["Sequencing the actinomycin (acm) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces antibioticus IMRU 3720, which produces actinomycin X (Acm X), revealed 20 genes organized into a highly similar framework as in the bi-armed acm C biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chrysomallus but without an attached additional extra arm of orthologues as in the latter. Curiously, the extra arm of the S. chrysomallus gene cluster turned out to perfectly match the single arm of the S. antibioticus gene cluster in the same order of orthologues including the the presence of two pseudogenes, scacmM and scacmN, encoding a cytochrome P450 and its ferredoxin, respectively. Orthologues of the latter genes were both missing in the principal arm of the S. chrysomallus acm C gene cluster. All orthologues of the extra arm showed a G +C-contents different from that of their counterparts in the principal arm. Moreover, the similarities of translation products from the extra arm were all higher to the corresponding translation products of orthologue genes from the S. antibioticus acm X gene cluster than to those encoded by the principal arm of their own gene cluster. This suggests that the duplicated structure of the S. chrysomallus acm C biosynthetic gene cluster evolved from previous fusion between two one-armed acm gene clusters each from a different genetic background. However, while scacmM and scacmN in the extra arm of the S. chrysomallus acm C gene cluster are mutated and therefore are non-functional, their orthologues saacmM and saacmN in the S. antibioticus acm C gene cluster show no defects seemingly encoding active enzymes with functions specific for Acm X biosynthesis. Both acm biosynthetic gene clusters lack a kynurenine-3-monooxygenase gene necessary for biosynthesis of 3-hydroxy-4-methylanthranilic acid, the building block of the Acm chromophore, which suggests participation of a genome-encoded relevant monooxygenase during Acm biosynthesis in both S. chrysomallus and S. antibioticus.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Streptomyces antibioticus IMRU 3720 produces a mixture of actinomycins (Acms), designated as actinomycin X (Acm X).1 Acms are chromopeptides consisting of two pentapeptide lactone rings attached in amide linkage to 2-amino-phenoxazine-3-on-4,6-dimethyl-1,9-dicarboxylic acid (actinocin; Figure 1).

This could have been catalyzed by the same IS elements initially responsible for side by side combination sitting in the flanks and between the two acm gene clusters. In fact, remnants of IS-elements (ISSc1.1 and ISSc1.2) are still visible in the direct neighborhood of the scacmrC- and scacmY-ends of the present S. chrysomallus acm biosynthetic gene cluster (Figures 3 and 6). Imprecise excision may be indicated by the fact that scacmK, the first gene of the left arm has lost the first 107 codons of its original sequence by comparison with the sequence of its orthologue scacmH in the right arm (Figure 5). No coding sequences, promoters or remnants of an IS-element are contained in the 108 nt long stretch between the first detectable codon (108) of scacmK and the stop codon of the preceding scacmT which suggests that the truncated scacmK and its downstream genes including scacmM most probably will not be transcribed. A 22 nt IR downstream of scacmT may mark the previous transcriptional terminator at the end of the right acm gene cluster. In fact, a similar IR is situated at 37 nt after the stop codon of saacmT in the S. antibioticus acm gene cluster (Figure 5). On the other hand, inspection of the promoter regions of the self-resistance genes scacmQrArBrC and of the regulatory genes scacmO and scacmP transcription of these genes cannot be disregarded. Remarkably, the gene scacmY located at the opposite end of the acm C biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a self-resistance gene most probably involved in DNA repair is disrupted by integration of an IS element. Its function could be overtaken by its orthologue scAcmrC as a kind of functional complementation between the two arms in the S. chrysomallus acm C gene cluster, which may select for maintenance of its two-armed structure.", "IS elements and directed repeats (DRs) flank the acm biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chrysomallus", "IS elements and directed repeats (DRs) flank the acm biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chrysomallus", "IS elements and directed repeats (DRs) flank the acm biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chrysomallus", "Sequence analysis of the flanking regions of the acm gene cluster of S. chrysomallus revealed two 165 nt DRs and several IS-elements to both sides (Figure 6).
