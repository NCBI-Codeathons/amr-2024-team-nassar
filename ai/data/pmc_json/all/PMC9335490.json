The increasing number of sequenced fungal genomes revealed a vast and unexplored biosynthetic potential in the form of transcriptionally silent secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Various strategies have been carried out to explore and mine this untapped source of bioactive molecules, and with the advent of synthetic biology, novel applications, and tools have been developed for filamentous fungi. Here we summarize approaches aiming for the expression of endogenous or exogenous natural product BGCs, including synthetic transcription factors, assembly of artificial transcription units, gene cluster refactoring, fungal shuttle vectors, and platform strains.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Secondary metabolites (SM), commonly referred to as natural products, are chemical substances that are produced by living organisms, often bearing distinctive pharmacological effects.

With the introduction of synthetic biology, new tools and alternative methods are provided to further aid the metabolic engineering and exploitation of fungal workhorses. Filamentous fungi (with key players from Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma, Fusarium, and Neurospora species) are highly efficient cell factories, often used industrially for the production of a diverse range of products such as proteins, enzymes, organic acids, and SMs (Meyer et al., 2020). SMs are not essential for the survival of the organism, but the production of these natural products often provides an evolutionary advantage. With the discovery of penicillin in 1928 produced by a mold identified as a Penicillium species, a new era started for industrial antibiotics production and the exploration and characterization of novel fungal SMs. This interest resulted in the discovery of not just antibacterial, but also antifungal (griseofulvin), cholesterol-lowering (lovastatin), immunosuppressant (cyclosporine), anticancer (paclitaxel), and food additive (carmine) compounds (Keller et al., 2005). Alongside the beneficial metabolites, fungi also produce SMs acting as toxins (e.g., aflatoxin, fumonisin, patulin), which negatively affect food, feed, livestock, and human health.", "Secondary metabolites (SM), commonly referred to as natural products, are chemical substances that are produced by living organisms, often bearing distinctive pharmacological effects.

The simultaneous development of automated genome mining tools such as antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2021) and other bioinformatics tools (Kautsar et al., 2019; Navarro-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2020) allowed researchers to identify a vast and unknown biosynthetic potential within the fungal kingdom in the form of SM encoding biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Figure 1A) (Mosunova et al., 2020). Bioinformatic analysis of 1,037 fungal genomes from the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and non-Dikarya revealed that the number of BGCs per genome significantly varies across fungal genomes (Robey et al., 2021). In the Ascomycota phylum Pezizomycotina genomes harbor on average 40 SM BGCs (25% of the genomes within this class possess >60 BGCs), however, this number is significantly lower in non-Dikarya (\u223c15 BGCs), in Basidiomycota (<10 BGCs) or non-Pezizomycotina Ascomycota genomes (\u223c5 BGCs) (Robey et al., 2021). Because of the richness and diversity of SM BGCs contained within their genomes, Pezizomycotina fungi are by far the most studied taxon in the field of SM discovery.

Engineering the DNA binding domain (DBD) of these nucleases allows targeting specific genomic loci. ZFNs are artificial restriction enzymes and are typically generated by fusing DBSs with the FokI nuclease domain. DNA targeting is provided by fusing together three to six DNA-binding zinc-finger proteins, each of which is capable to recognize a specific 3 bp DNA sequence. Although ZFNs are relatively small proteins, which are easy to deliver to the host, their targeting efficiency is rather weak and the relatively high levels of off-target effects may lead to cytotoxicity (Ramalingam et al., 2011). The next generation of targeted DNA editing was the discovery of the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) elements, which are acting as TFs in the species of Xanthomonas.

CRISPRi has been successfully adapted to several bacterial and eukaryotic hosts for targeted gene repression (Farzadfard et al., 2013; Gilbert et al., 2013, 2014; Qi et al., 2013; Rock et al., 2017; Sato\u2019o et al., 2018; Rom\u00e1n et al., 2019; Lauren et al., 2022; Tan et al., 2022). Targeting in close distance to the TSS of the gene of interest with this system leads to successful downregulation, presumably by blocking transcriptional initiation or elongation. In prokaryotic CRISPRi applications, the bare dCas9 without any fused regulator domain is already capable of achieving significant repression. It is believed that the binding of dCas9 can hinder the binding of positive enhancers or the mediator complex for transcriptional elongation. In eukaryotes, the levels of repression achieved by using dCas9 alone are low, but can be enhanced by fusing repressor domains such as KRAB (Kr\u00fcppel associated box) or Mxi1 (a histone deacetylation mediator) (Qi et al., 2013). The efficiency of CRISPRi-based repression differs depending on several factors including the type of fused effector, off- and on-target effects of the CRISPR protein, the distance of the protospacer from the TSS, and the chromatin state of the target genomic region (Smith et al., 2016). Presumably, the native transcription levels of the target genes and the presence of regulatory protein binding sequences in close proximity of the CRISPR complex also affect the degree of repression. In mammalian cell lines, the dCas9-KRAB fusion provides repression when targeted in the range of \u221250 to +300 bp relative to the TSS of a gene, with the highest efficiency of \u223c100-fold repression in the \u221250 to +100 bp region (Gilbert et al., 2014). In S. cerevisiae, the dCas9-Mxi1 fusion resulted in a maximal \u223c10-fold repression when targeted to the \u2212200 to +1 region relative to the TSS, but this reduced efficiency could be explained by the mode of repression employed by Mxi1, which mediates DNA deacetylation (Smith et al., 2016). These experiments also highlight how nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility can affect crRNA efficiency. The level of repression can be further increased by deploying multiple sgRNAs in combination with the Cas9 systems (Farzadfard et al., 2013) which can be achieved by using sgRNA-arrays in combination with self-cleaving sequences (Hammerhead and HDV ribozymes and tRNA) (Gao and Zhao, 2014; Zhang Y. et al., 2019) or exogenous nucleases and their cleavage factor recognition sequences (Csy4 nuclease) (Ferreira et al., 2018).", "The protospacer sequence is crucial in CRISPRi/CRISPRa applications for targeted repression and activation, respectively.

Targeting in close distance to the TSS of the gene of interest with this system leads to successful downregulation, presumably by blocking transcriptional initiation or elongation. In prokaryotic CRISPRi applications, the bare dCas9 without any fused regulator domain is already capable of achieving significant repression. It is believed that the binding of dCas9 can hinder the binding of positive enhancers or the mediator complex for transcriptional elongation.

This species has been used for decades to study important cellular processes such as recombination, DNA repair, and chromatin regulation (Morris, 1976; Chaveroche, 2000; Osmani and Mirabito, 2004), because it can be easily manipulated and cultivated in the lab. This has led to the development of several platform strains that have been engineered to characterize and overexpress heterologous genes and, ultimately, produce natural products. The most interesting platform strains, showcased in Table 1, are derived from a triple auxotrophic strain called A1145 (Nayak et al., 2006). This strain also carries a deletion of the nkuA gene (homolog of human ku70) that renders NHEJ DNA repair less favorable, facilitating precise genomic integration of heterologous genes via HR. A1145 has been successfully used to elucidate a diverse range of biosynthetic pathways belonging to all major classes of SMs (Li et al., 2016; Hai and Tang, 2018; Liu L. et al., 2019; Yee et al., 2020). Despite these attractive features, A. nidulans also has a major downside. It is a prolific producer of SMs (Anyaogu and Mortensen, 2015; Meng et al., 2021) that typically yields a crowded chromatographic background, which can render the identification of new metabolites a cumbersome task. To partially overcome this problem, strains with a cleaner SM background have been developed. In one instance, the BGCs responsible for the biosynthesis of sterigmatocystin and emericellamids, two major classes of compounds produced by A. nidulans, were deleted. This allowed the identification of an important intermediate of the cholesterol-lowering compound zaragozic acid A in an engineered strain, previously overshadowed by the host metabolites (Liu et al., 2017). A similar strain\u2014LO4389\u2014where only the sterigmatocystin pathway was deleted, was used for the identification of 6 polyketides from A. terreus along with the complete reconstitution of the A. terreus asperfuranone pathway (Chiang et al., 2013), underlining once again the potential of such cleaner platform strains. Following the success of such trials, the same authors reported the construction of strain LO8030 where eight of the most highly expressed BGCs were deleted, resulting in a considerable reduction of the genome size (Chiang et al., 2016). Despite that, the strain showed no significant defects in growth. Additionally, not only did the strain offer a minimal background, but it also benefitted from a higher availability of SM precursors, as demonstrated by the synthesis and detection of the previously undiscovered metabolite aspercryptin (Chiang et al., 2016). Recently, LO4389 was used to construct two new strains that possess genetic features that are especially advantageous for the expression of entire biosynthetic pathways. In these strains, up to 6 or 7 genes of interest (GOIs) can be placed under the control of the native regulatory elements of the asperfuranone pathway, whose genes have been removed, while the inducible promoter PalcA controls the major TF regulating the BGC pathway. This elegant approach allows for the induction of entire heterologous BGCs upon the addition of methyl ethyl ketone, and its potential was demonstrated by the successful production of citreoviridin, mutilin, and pleuromutilin (Chiang et al., 2020).", "The filamentous fungus most widely used as heterologous host is by far A. nidulans.

This fungus plays an important role in food manufacturing in Asia, where it is widely used for the production of alcoholic beverages and fermented products such as soy sauce and miso. A. oryzae contains numerous BGCs in its genome, many of which are also found in the toxins-producing species A. flavus, which is a prolific producer of natural products. In fact, the species are so closely related that it is believed that A. oryzae is actually a product of the domestication of A. flavus (Payne et al., 2006). However, A. oryzae produces only a few endogenous SMs, which makes it a perfect host for heterologous production (Anyaogu and Mortensen, 2015). The most common platform strain is the quadruple auxotroph NSAR1 (Jin et al., 2004) which offers great versatility and does not require the need of expensive additives for the selection of the transformants. NSAR1 has been used successfully by many researchers to elucidate diverse biosynthetic pathways (Tagami et al., 2013; Nofiani et al., 2018; Liu C. et al., 2019; Han et al., 2021). Despite the fact that its use is relatively more recent than A. nidulans, an extensive toolkit is now available to transform A. oryzae and express heterologous genes (Pahirulzaman et al., 2012; Lazarus et al., 2014). Of particular interest is a system of vectors\u2014pTYargB/niaD/adeA/sC-eGFPac\u2014that carry an inducible expression cassette (under control of the amyB promoter and terminator) and three constitutive cassettes. There are four versions of these vectors, each carrying a different selection marker, that can be co-transformed to allow the overexpression of up to 16 heterologous genes in the recipient NSAR1 strain (Lazarus et al., 2014). Although A. oryzae already offers a clean SM background, it produces a relatively abundant compound called kojic acid. The presence of kojic acid can complicate the purification of metabolites of interest and interfere with structural characterization. Deletion of the gene kojA, that encodes a crucial oxidoreductase for the synthesis of kojic acid, resulted in an astoundingly clean SM background and easy detection of the metabolite of interest (Dao et al., 2021). Another platform strain that merits attention is the triple auxotroph NSlPD1 (Maruyama and Kitamoto, 2008). The advantage of this particular strain over NSAR1 and its derivative strains is the deletion of the ligD gene, which facilitates HR-mediated genetic engineering (analogously to the deletion of nkuA in A. nidulans). NSlPD1 was successfully engineered to generate a strain that produces higher titers of kojic acid and uses cellulose as starting material (Yamada et al., 2014).", "Another common choice as a cell factory for the identification and production of SMs is A. oryzae.

To increase the titers of penicillin produced, early strains of P. rubens have been subjected to decades of random mutagenesis and selection processes, collectively known as the classical strain improvement program. This has also led to increased capabilities to grow in submerged cultivation conditions and in defined media, features that are very desirable in the industry (Harris et al., 2009; Guzm\u00e1n-Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2018; Iacovelli et al., 2021a). The CSI program also led to a major reduction of the expression and/or mutational inactivation of non-penicillin BGCs. One of the industrial penicillin producer strains was recently engineered to abolish production of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, with the assumption that this strain would retain its metabolic capabilities while offering a cleaner background. Indeed, this particular strain was used to heterologously express the compactin BGC from P. citrinum, together with an engineered cytochrome P450 from Amycolatopsis orientalis. The newly engineered strain was able to catalyze the final hydroxylation step of compactin to the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin, with an impressive yield of more than 6\u00a0g/L in pilot scale fermentations (McLean et al., 2015). This idea was further explored even more recently, when the same \u03b2-lactam-deficient strain was used as a template to generate a quadruple deletion strain in which alongside the penicillin BGC three major BGCs (chrysogine, fungisporin, and roquefortine) were removed, resulting in a considerably clean SM background, ideal for natural product production (Pohl et al., 2020). As proof of concept, the SM-deficient platform strain was used to reintroduce the penicillin BGC, resulting in restored production of the antibiotic, and to overexpress an endogenous PKS (PKS17), leading to the production of YWA1, a common precursor to fungal pigments. Additionally, the strain was used for the successful reconstitution of the calbistrin BGC from Penicillium decumbens, which resulted in the heterologous production of decumbenone A, B, and C (Pohl et al., 2020). This strain is also devoid of the hdfA gene (homolog of human ku70) and is therefore suitable for HR-mediated genetic engineering.

As proof of concept, the SM-deficient platform strain was used to reintroduce the penicillin BGC, resulting in restored production of the antibiotic, and to overexpress an endogenous PKS (PKS17), leading to the production of YWA1, a common precursor to fungal pigments. Additionally, the strain was used for the successful reconstitution of the calbistrin BGC from Penicillium decumbens, which resulted in the heterologous production of decumbenone A, B, and C (Pohl et al., 2020). This strain is also devoid of the hdfA gene (homolog of human ku70) and is therefore suitable for HR-mediated genetic engineering. These results highlight the P. rubens 4xKO strain as a valuable option for SM research.", "Another important fungal workhorse for industrial applications is P. rubens, which is used for the production of penicillin, cephalosporin, and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. To increase the titers of penicillin produced, early strains of P. rubens have been subjected to decades of random mutagenesis and selection processes, collectively known as the classical strain improvement program. This has also led to increased capabilities to grow in submerged cultivation conditions and in defined media, features that are very desirable in the industry (Harris et al., 2009; Guzm\u00e1n-Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2018; Iacovelli et al., 2021a). The CSI program also led to a major reduction of the expression and/or mutational inactivation of non-penicillin BGCs. One of the industrial penicillin producer strains was recently engineered to abolish production of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, with the assumption that this strain would retain its metabolic capabilities while offering a cleaner background. Indeed, this particular strain was used to heterologously express the compactin BGC from P. citrinum, together with an engineered cytochrome P450 from Amycolatopsis orientalis. The newly engineered strain was able to catalyze the final hydroxylation step of compactin to the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin, with an impressive yield of more than 6\u00a0g/L in pilot scale fermentations (McLean et al., 2015).

For decades, this organism has been used in industry for its astonishing ability to produce cellulolytic enzymes such as cellulases and hemicellulases (Bischof et al., 2016), but it never attracted natural product researchers, probably due to the broad availability of other hosts and a lack of well-developed synthetic biology tools. Recently, a strain which carries deletions for the genes tmus53 (ligD homolog) and pyrG was engineered (Steiger et al., 2011). Analogously to other fungal hosts, the \u0394tmus53 deletion facilitates HR-mediated targeted gene integration, while \u0394pyrG allows easy selection through complementation of uracil/uridine auxotrophy. These features raise interest for T. reesei as a potential natural product producing host. In fact, this particular strain has already been utilized to investigate the endogenous biosynthetic pathway of sorbicillinoids (Derntl et al., 2017).

Nevertheless, despite the broad availability of hosts, not all species might be capable to produce the desired natural product, and even when they are, it is very likely that one species performs better than another in terms of yield. This is difficult to predict and engineering more species at once to optimize production can be extremely time-consuming as well as costly. To reduce the workload and facilitate simultaneous cloning and screening of more hosts, a group of researchers recently developed the first multispecies fungal platform for heterologous gene expression (Jarczynska et al., 2020). The first version of this system, called DIVERSIFY, is based upon four Aspergillus species: A. nidulans, A. oryzae, A. niger, and A. aculeatus. Each individual species was first engineered to contain in the genome a \u201ccommon synthetic gene integration site\u201d (COSI), which encodes a reporter gene for white/blue selection placed under the control of a constitutive promoter. Additionally, the COSI contains two 500 bp sequences flanking the reporter cassette that can be used for HR-mediated target gene replacement, whereby GOIs can be easily inserted and overexpressed. Since the COSI is equal in each recipient strain, only one integration cassette has to be designed and built. As a proof of concept, the DIVERSIFY platform has been successfully used to overexpress a fluorescent reporter (mRFP) and cellobiohydrolase, and for the production of 6-MSA, a model polyketide (Jarczynska et al., 2020).

The products of these clusters can be unearthed with the combined efforts of bioinformatics, chemistry, and synthetic biology, to reveal new chemistries and biological activities of interest. A major challenge, however, remains prioritizing these BGCs for their potential value since the bioinformatics tools available at the moment cannot reliably predict the resulting products.
