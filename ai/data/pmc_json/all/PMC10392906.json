In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that over 4.22 billion people around the globe have been affected by diabetes and this number is predicted to be about 6.42 billion, by 2040.3 There are two types of DM; type 1 DM results from damage of \u03b2-cells of the pancreas so that insulin cannot be synthesized adequately, and type 2 DM results from insufficiency of insulin action or resistance. It is interesting to note that people with uncontrolled DM (regardless of type) have changes in healing latency and a higher risk of contracting several newly emerging infectious (mostly bacterial) infections. Due to the immune system\u2019s inability to successfully defend against invasive microorganisms, infections are a major problem in diabetics.4 Bacterial infections and diabetes can have a mutually reinforcing relationship, with some infections, such as periodontitis exacerbating insulin resistance. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant problem in diabetes patients as a result of their susceptibility to infection as well as their frequent use of antibiotics to treat illnesses. Bacteria can develop resistance by changing target sites, making specialized efflux pumps, mutating their DNA to create new metabolic pathways, or creating \u03b2 -lactamases, an enzyme that breaks down \u03b2 -lactams.5 As reported by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2015, T2DM comprises approximately 90\u201395% of all cases of diabetes.6 One solution to mitigate diabetes, especially type 2 DM, is the regulation of postprandial blood glucose by inhibiting the main carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes of \u03b1-glucosidase/amylase in the intestine.7 Currently, prescribed acarbose as both sugar mimics oral \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitors remain in parallel with voglibose, and miglitol the most common drugs of T2DM; however, their application is hindered by the side effects. Moreover, the associated disadvantages required tedious multi-steps for preparation, and low natural abundance prompted the exploration of new molecules as inhibitors for the targeted enzyme.8,9 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) decrease insulin levels in hyperglycemia, which in turn regulates gene transcription and ultimately results in death. ROS is produced under a hyperglycemic condition which further implicates various disorders important to the development of diabetic complications. ROS are thought to damage cells by forming free radicals and lipid peroxides in cell membranes.10,11 Antioxidants that scavenge ROS are of great value in preventing the development and spread of oxidative diseases.12 They play an important role in protecting against deadly diseases by turning free radicals into ineffective states.13 Thus, the use of antioxidants in combination with an anti-diabetic and antibiotic drug will greatly help the immune system to combat insulin and bacterial resistance, respectively.6,14", "Globally, the ever-growing population has put the life of humankind on the edge of being targeted by various diseases, among which, diabetes and antibiotic-resistance infectious diseases are the most common.1 Over the past decades, the global incidence rate of the disease has risen at an alarming rate, hence making it a major health problem of the 21st century.2\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic and epidemic disease characterized by constant hyperglycemia.

Among these, compounds 8, 11, and 16 showed the highest activity against \u03b1-amylase with IC50 = 22.03, 7.59, and 4.08 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, compared to acarbose (IC50 =8.0 \u03bcg/mL).

It was observed that compound 16 was found to be the most active inhibitor with an inhibitory effect up to 2-fold better than acarbose. This enhanced activity of compounds 8 and 16 was found to be most potent which might be due to the presence of electron-donating a group of dimethyl amino (\u2013N(CH3)2) moiety on the para-position of the aryl ring of N-pyrazolines and \u03b2-substituted imidazole analogs, while compound 11 exhibited better potentials with unsubstituted phenyl ring of 4-phenyl-6-styrylpyrimidine-2-ol group that might be attributed to better binding with the active site of the \u03b1-amylase. As the concentration of tested compounds increases, the percentage of inhibition is also increased. The structural activity relationship was established for all compounds which depend upon the different substituents EWG or EDG on the phenyl ring of curcumin and its heterocyclic part. Based on the results, the constituent that is responsible for an \u03b1-amylase inhibitor is possibly the phenols at curcumin since their antioxidant properties can prevent damage from reactive oxygen species and also bind and inhibit an \u03b1-amylase.56 The introduction of strong electron-withdrawing group p-NO2 substitution (12, IC50=102.65\u00b10.23 \u03bcg/mL) into the thiazolo[3,2-\u03b1] pyrimidines moiety can reduce the inhibitory activity.

Based on the obtained results of % inhibition of alpha-amylase enzyme and IC50 values are illustrated in Figure 2, Interestingly, the tested heterocyclic curcuminoid analogs (8\u201316) showed excellent to potent \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity with IC50 ranging from 4.08\u00b10.23 to 102.65\u00b10.23 \u03bcg/mL, in comparison to the standard drug, acarbose (IC50 =8.0 \u03bcg/mL).

It was observed that compound 16 was found to be the most active inhibitor with an inhibitory effect up to 2-fold better than acarbose. This enhanced activity of compounds 8 and 16 was found to be most potent which might be due to the presence of electron-donating a group of dimethyl amino (\u2013N(CH3)2) moiety on the para-position of the aryl ring of N-pyrazolines and \u03b2-substituted imidazole analogs, while compound 11 exhibited better potentials with unsubstituted phenyl ring of 4-phenyl-6-styrylpyrimidine-2-ol group that might be attributed to better binding with the active site of the \u03b1-amylase.

2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method at \u03bb = 517 nm. The purple color of DPPH fades or disappears when it reacts with a hydrogen donor, resulting in its conversion to 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine and a lowering in absorbance.57 In the presence of scavengers in the fractions, the lower the absorption, the more effective the antioxidant activity is. Based on the experimental results, the synthesized compounds (8\u201316) series exhibit good in vitro DPPH radical scavenging abilities, and the results are presented in Table 4 and Supplementary Information in Appendix XVIII. The results of antioxidant by DPPH assay revealed that the percentage of inhibition was increased with the increase in concentration test samples. At a concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL, the majority of the compounds showed greater than 80\u201394% DPPH-free radical scavenging activity. Of the tested compounds, the IC50 of antioxidant activity data of compound 8 showed the highest percent inhibition of the DPPH with an IC50 value of 2.44\u03bcg/mL compared with standard ascorbic acid drug (IC50 = 1.24 \u03bcg/mL), indicating that heterocyclics derived curcumin, 8 exhibited best antioxidant activity compared to ascorbic acid. In other words, these compounds have the ability of electron donors to scavenge free radicals. This could be due to the presence of hydroxyl groups at the para positions (p-OH) of curcumin phenyl rings or pyrazoline moiety itself that stabilize the radicals for their strong electron-donating properties, respectively.

The results revealed that compounds 8 (0.888), 11 (0.946), and 16 (0.757) had high PPB values, indicating longer half-lives than amoxicillin and acarbose.66 Skin permeability (SP, LogKp) was found to be somewhat below the permitted range of \u22125.25 to \u22126.69 cm/sec and a substance with a low negative log Kp value has higher absorption into human skin. Furthermore, glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition measurements are used to predict the excretion characteristics of the tested compounds. P-gp and cytochrome P450 (CYP) are known to help biological membranes, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract or the brain, defend themselves against xenobiotics by biotransforming them.67 The actions of cytochrome P450 and its isoform enzymes were used to predict the metabolic characteristics of the compounds. In this investigation, almost all compounds showed inhibitory activity against CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, but they did not show inhibitory behavior toward CYP2D6. In our study, none of the synthesized compounds inhibited P-gp substrates, except 8, and 9. Computationally toxicity risks such as AMES mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and skin sensitization were investigated. In silico pharmacodynamics studies indicated that compounds 8, 11, and 16 were predicted to be non-mutagenic, non-tumorigenic, non-hepatotoxic, non-irritant, AMES nontoxic and without any skin-sensitive effects, which gives them the property to be acceptable lead-like potential for future development of safe and efficient drugs. For further investigation of the in vivo antibacterial and antidiabetic activity, the computed LD50 in rats from the safer category III acute oral toxicity model seems to be sufficiently safe (2.29\u20132.41\u00a0mol/kg) as shown in Table 7.Table 6Pharmacokinetic (ADME) Properties Prediction of Synthesized Compounds (8\u201316) Using AdmetSAR Online PlatformCompoundIn silico PharmacokineticsHIA (%)aCaco2 (nm/Sec)bSPLogKp (cm/Hour)cPPB %dBBB (c.Brain/c.Blood)eCYP3A4 InhibitionfCYP2C9 InhibitiongCYP2C19 InhibitionhCYP2D6 InhibitioniPgp_Inhibitionj8+ 0.9823\u22120.5430\u22125.720.888+ 0.7500+0.8430+0.5591+ 0.7526\u2212 0.6935\u22120.51569+0.9955\u22120.6153\u22125.550.747+0.7750+0.7003+0.6373+0.7714\u22120.6785\u22120.784610+0.9589\u22120.5810\u22125.751.011+0.7000+0.5879\u22120.6971+0.5235\u22120.8204+0.670911+0.9906\u22120.7344\u22125.580.946+0.6750\u22120.6245\u22120.5691+0.5531\u22120.8888\u22120.638312+0.9032\u22120.7649\u22125.640.994\u22120.5000+0.8888+0.7218+0.7388\u22120.7795+0.695813+0.9628\u22120.7247\u22125.420.992+0.6000+0.7544+0.7852+0.8738\u22120.6652+0.856414+0.9802\u22120.7183\u22125.251.067+0.5750+0.7941+0.8129+0.9119\u22120.5571+0.737415+0.9349\u22120.6547\u22126.690.75+0.7000+0.7868+0.5325\u22120.5487\u22120.8399\u22120.570516+0.9816\u22120.5967\u22126.470.757+0.7000+0.7895\u22120.6185+0.7159\u22120.5568+0.6521Amoxicillin\u22120.8790\u22120.9249\u22120.210.348\u22121.0000\u22120.8309\u22120.9070\u22120.9150\u22120.9231\u22120.9167Acarbose\u22120.9603\u22120.8882\u221215.690.302\u22120.8250\u22120.9864\u22120.8896\u22120.8707\u22120.9030\u22120.5735Abbreviations: aHIA, human intestinal absorption; bCaco2, Caco2 cell permeability; cSPLogKp, skin permeability; d,PBB, plasma protein binding; eBBB level, blood\u2013brain barrier level; f,g,h,iCYP, cytochrome P450 inhibition; jP-gp, glycoprotein inhibition.\nTable 7In silico Toxicity Prediction of Compounds (8\u201316) and Amoxicillin Using AdmetSAR and Pro Tox-II Online ServersCompoundIn Silico Pharmacodynamics (Toxicity)MutagenicTumorigenicIrritantCarcinogenicityAmes ToxicityHepatotoxicitySkin SensitizationRat Acute Toxicity (LD50; mol/kg)a8ActiveActive\u22120.9185\u22120.7628\u22120.6800\u22120.5040\u22120.8228III 0.58849ActiveActive\u22120.8995\u22120.7828\u22120.7700+0.5072\u22120.8100III 0.587110InactiveInactive\u22120.6400\u22120.7928\u22120.5700+0.5264\u22120.8903III 0.684011ActiveInactive+0.6366\u22120.8128\u22120.6000+0.5251\u22120.8883III 0.545712ActiveActive\u22120.8660\u22120.7012+0.7500+0.5625\u22120.8225III 0.580313InactiveInactive\u22120.8495\u22120.9000+0.5100\u22120.6375\u22120.8314III 0.614714InactiveInactive\u22120.7894\u22120.9300\u22120.5500\u22120.5625\u22120.8340III 0.578315InactiveInactive\u22120.9478\u22120.6607+0.5800+0.6625\u22120.8544III 0.676316InactiveInactive\u22120.9497\u22120.7800\u22120.7400\u22120.6125\u22120.8819III 0.7078AmoxicillinActiveInactive\u22120.9872+0.6977\u22120.9600+0.9875\u22120.7693IV 0.5992AcarboseActiveActive\u22120.9391\u22120.9800+0.5800+0.7573\u22120.8755IV0.5397Note: aLD50: lethal dose parameter.", "AdmetSAR online database was utilized to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of the target compounds as illustrated in Table 6.

Furthermore, glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition measurements are used to predict the excretion characteristics of the tested compounds. P-gp and cytochrome P450 (CYP) are known to help biological membranes, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract or the brain, defend themselves against xenobiotics by biotransforming them.67 The actions of cytochrome P450 and its isoform enzymes were used to predict the metabolic characteristics of the compounds. In this investigation, almost all compounds showed inhibitory activity against CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, but they did not show inhibitory behavior toward CYP2D6. In our study, none of the synthesized compounds inhibited P-gp substrates, except 8, and 9. Computationally toxicity risks such as AMES mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and skin sensitization were investigated. In silico pharmacodynamics studies indicated that compounds 8, 11, and 16 were predicted to be non-mutagenic, non-tumorigenic, non-hepatotoxic, non-irritant, AMES nontoxic and without any skin-sensitive effects, which gives them the property to be acceptable lead-like potential for future development of safe and efficient drugs. For further investigation of the in vivo antibacterial and antidiabetic activity, the computed LD50 in rats from the safer category III acute oral toxicity model seems to be sufficiently safe (2.29\u20132.41\u00a0mol/kg) as shown in Table 7.Table 6Pharmacokinetic (ADME) Properties Prediction of Synthesized Compounds (8\u201316) Using AdmetSAR Online PlatformCompoundIn silico
