Here, implementation of a shotgun proteomic strategy led to the identification of non-redundant mycelial proteins (n\u200a=\u200a414) from A. fumigatus including proteins typically under-represented in 2-D proteome maps: proteins with multiple transmembrane regions, hydrophobic proteins and proteins with extremes of molecular mass and pI. Indirect identification of secondary metabolite cluster expression was also achieved, with proteins (n\u200a=\u200a18) from LaeA-regulated clusters detected, including GliT encoded within the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster. Biochemical analysis then revealed that gliotoxin significantly attenuates H2O2-induced oxidative stress in A. fumigatus (p>0.0001), confirming observations from proteomics data. A complementary 2-D/LC-MS/MS approach further elucidated significantly increased abundance (p<0.05) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and the gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT, along with significantly attenuated abundance (p<0.05) of a heat shock protein, an oxidative stress protein and an autolysis-associated chitinase, when gliotoxin and H2O2 were present, compared to H2O2 alone. Moreover, gliotoxin exposure significantly reduced the abundance of selected proteins (p<0.05) involved in de novo purine biosynthesis. Significantly elevated abundance (p<0.05) of a key enzyme, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase Xpt1, utilised in purine salvage, was observed in the presence of H2O2 and gliotoxin. This work provides new insights into the A. fumigatus proteome and experimental strategies, plus mechanistic data pertaining to gliotoxin functionality in the organism.", "Data Availability", "The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

Direct LC-MS/MS involves the on-line separation of complex peptide mixtures using reversed phase nano-LC columns with extended acetonitrile gradients to effect peptide separation [14]. Indirect LC-MS/MS is where complex peptide or protein mixtures are pre-fractionated off-line (e.g. by SDS-PAGE) before LC-MS/MS analysis [15]. Sub-proteome strategies have also been implemented to investigate glutathione binding [4] and mitochondrial proteins [6]. Indeed, the recent emergence of MS-based proteomics studies of A. fumigatus has been undertaken whereby 530 plasma membrane associated proteins were identified by utilising a combination of SDS-PAGE fractionation of total protein followed by peptide separation and identification by 2-D-LC-MS/MS [16]. This study would have been difficult to perform using 2-D due to the incompatibility of hydrophobic proteins, and proteins with transmembrane (TM) regions, with detergents used in isoelectric focusing, the first separation stage of 2-D [17]. Quantitative MS-based proteomics, both label-free and using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), have been used to comparatively profile the stages of A. fumigatus germination [9], [10]. Activity-based MS proteomics has also recently been developed to investigate A. fumigatus following incubation with human sera [18]. The application of MS-based proteomics to dissect the proteome of A. fumigatus has the potential to provide a global overview of the pathways and biological processes active under a set of conditions. In addition, (i) bioinformatic analysis can expand the characterisation of large datasets generated by MS-based proteomics, and (ii) shotgun proteomics offers the possibility of identifying the presence of either hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function, whose existence may either be unclear, or only previously demonstrated at the transcript level.

Proteins exhibiting increased abundance in the co-addition included those with oxidation-reduction activity. GliT, the gliotoxin oxidoreductase [28], [47], was more abundant in the co-addition condition relative to H2O2 alone (3.5 fold) but was unaltered by H2O2 addition alone (Figure 2, Table 2 and Table S4). An increase in abundance of the Ran-specific GTPase and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), involved in cell-cycle regulation and DNA-repair [48], [49], respectively, was also observed in the presence of gliotoxin/H2O2 together. The HAD family hydrolase, also exhibited increased abundance when both gliotoxin and H2O2 were present, relative to any of the control conditions. Proteins involved in amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism [50], [51], glutamine amidotransferase: cyclase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, also showed differential abundance.

Fifteen proteins identified by shotgun mass spectrometry are annotated members of this \u2018supercluster\u2019, with one identified protein involved in the production of fumitremorgins and tryprostatins, four proteins involved in the pseurotin A biosynthetic portion of the cluster and the remaining nine proteins associated with fumagillin biosynthesis. Metabolomic investigation confirmed the presence of fumagillin, tryprostatin B and pseurotin A in culture supernatants, confirming the activity of these clusters, as indicated by shotgun proteomics. Phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase family protein (FtmF) (AFUA_8G00230) was identified by 3 unique peptides and a sequence coverage of 14%. FtmF, a non-heme Fe(II) and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, catalyses the conversion of fumitremorgin B to verruculogen via endoperoxide bond formation [56]. This enzyme is also capable of converting fumitremorgin B to 12\u03b1,13\u03b1-dihydroxyfumitremorgin C and 13-oxo-verruculogen, by deprenylation and oxidation mechanisms respectively [57]. Verruculogen, like fumitremorgin B, is a tremorgenic mycotoxin and has been shown to produce deleterious effects on respiratory epithelial cells [58]. A second protein (AFUA_8G00280) was also identified from the border region of this cluster, with putative oxidoreductase activity, and along with the detection of FtmF, suggests the production of fumitremorgins or tryprostatins by A. fumigatus under the conditions of culture.

A higher abundance of this protein, in the presence of H2O2 alone, may indicate the occurrence of mycelial autolysis, which could have been stimulated by the presence of oxidative stress. This autolysis could also account for the growth-inhibited phenotype observed in the presence of H2O2 alone [30].", "Proteins involved in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism also decreased in abundance in the presence of gliotoxin and H2O2 combined, relative to H2O2 alone. Glutamine amidotransferase: cyclase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase underwent a 1.7 and 1.6 fold decrease in abundance, respectively, relative to H2O2 alone. Additionally, abundance of both of these proteins was decreased 1.9 fold in the co-addition condition, relative to the solvent control. Considering these observations, H2O2 does not appear to be involved in the controlling the levels of these proteins. Instead, gliotoxin, either independently or in combination with H2O2, is responsible for triggering the decrease in abundance of these proteins. Glutamine amidotransferase: cyclase catalyses two steps in the biosynthesis of histidine, producing both a histidine precursor and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an intermediate of the purine biosynthetic process, thus linking these pathways [50]. Interestingly, the bifunctional purine biosynthetic protein, Ade1, was reduced in abundance in the presence of gliotoxin relative to the solvent control (1.8 fold) (Figure 2). Conversely, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase Xpt1, was more abundant in the presence of gliotoxin and H2O2 combined, relative to the solvent control (1.8 fold) and gliotoxin alone (1.6 fold), indicating that levels of this protein are influenced by H2O2. Indeed, Lessing et al.\n[23] observed an increase in abundance of Xpt1 following exposure to H2O2 for 45 min. Xpt1 is involved in the purine nucleotide salvage pathway, whereby XMP and GMP are formed from precursors, xanthine and guanine, respectively [69] (Figure 4; Table 3). Additionally, the increased abundance of another component of the purine salvage pathway, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, has been noted in response to exogenous gliotoxin [20]. These observations reveal a diminution of de novo purine biosynthesis in the presence of gliotoxin and that the alternative salvage pathway is utilised in its place (Figure 4; Table 3). Together, these observations underline the influence of gliotoxin and H2O2, either alone or in combination, on nucleotide biosynthesis in A. fumigatus.", "Proteins involved in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism also decreased in abundance in the presence of gliotoxin and H2O2 combined, relative to H2O2 alone.
