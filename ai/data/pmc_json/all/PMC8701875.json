["In this paper, novel pH-responsive, semi-interpenetrating polymer hydrogels based on tamarind gum-co-poly(acrylamidoglycolic acid) (TMGA) polymers were synthesized using simple free radical polymerization in the presence of bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] phosphate as a crosslinker and potassium persulfate as a initiator. In addition, these hydrogels were used as templates for the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (13.4 \u00b1 3.6 nm in diameter, TMGA-Ag) by using leaf extract of Teminalia bellirica as a reducing agent. Swelling kinetics and the equilibrium swelling behavior of the TMGA hydrogels were investigated in various pH environments, and the maximum % of equilibrium swelling behavior observed was 2882 \u00b1 1.2. The synthesized hydrogels and silver nanocomposites were characterized via UV, FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM. TMGA and TMGA-Ag hydrogels were investigated to study the characteristics of drug delivery and antimicrobial study. Doxorubicin hydrochloride, a chemotherapeutic agent successfully encapsulated with maximum encapsulation efficiency, i.e., 69.20 \u00b1 1.2, was used in in vitro release studies in pH physiological and gastric environments at 37 \u00b0C. The drug release behavior was examined with kinetic models such as zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Hixson Crowell and Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas. These release data were best fitted with the Korsemeyer\u2013Peppas transport mechanism, with n = 0.91. The effects of treatment on HCT116 human colon cancer cells were assessed via cell viability and cell cycle analysis. The antimicrobial activity of TMGA-Ag hydrogels was studied against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia. Finally, the results demonstrate that TMGA and TMGA-Ag are promising candidates for anti-cancer drug delivery and the inactivation of pathogenic bacteria, respectively.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Functionalized interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels have piqued the interest of researchers as potential materials in a wide range of medical and environmental applications, including affinity chromatography, immobilization technologies, drug-delivery systems and organic dyes and heavy metal ion removal applications, such as ion exchangers, adsorbents, and so on [1,2,3,4,5]. The importance of IPNs is growing due to the numerous opportunities to modify their physico-chemical properties [6]. Natural polymers have successfully replaced a number of synthetic materials, either because the latter were high in cost or because the biodegradable and biocompatible properties of natural polymers outperformed those of synthetic materials [7]. The success of natural polymer hydrogels as biomaterials is mostly due to their resemblance to biological tissues and transformation processes, which allow them to be easily manufactured in a variety of forms and sizes at low manufacturing costs [8]. Natural polymers, on the other hand, have high biocompatibility but poor mechanical qualities; the necessity to preserve biological properties hampers their processing. Hence, to improve the physico-mechanical properties of natural polymer-based hydrogels, they are blended, grafted and embedded with compatible additives [8].", "Functionalized interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels have piqued the interest of researchers as potential materials in a wide range of medical and environmental applications, including affinity chromatography, immobilization technologies, drug-delivery systems and organic dyes and heavy metal ion removal applications, such as ion exchangers, adsorbents, and so on [1,2,3,4,5].

The EDX (energy dispersive X-rays) spectrum analysis of the TMGA drug composite and TMGA-Ag nanocomposite hydrogel samples were analyzed by JEOL-IT500A, Tokyo, Japan. Ag-NP-embedded TMGA hydrogels were characterized by field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, Tecnai F20) that operated at 80 kV. The briefly colloidal aqueous TMGA-Ag nanocomposites hydrogel solution was casted on a carbon-coated 300-mesh copper grid and left for 30 min. The image was captured at different ranges of magnification.", "Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "Supplementary Materials", "The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/gels7040237/s1. 1H NMR of TMG polysaccharide (Figure S1), digital photograph of synthesized TMGA hydrogels (Figure S2), in vitro drug release data of TMGA hydrogel (Table S1) and various drug release kinetic parameters (Table S2).", "Click here for additional data file.", "Author Contributions", "Conceptualization, methodology, investigation, data curation, formal analysis, K.N.; conceptualization, investigation, formal analysis, supervision, fund acquisition, writing\u2014review and editing, K.S.V.K.R.; funding acquisition, validation, formal analysis, S.Z.; funding acquisition, validation, formal analysis, S.S.H.; funding acquisition, validation, formal analysis, writing\u2014original draft preparation, K.M.R.
