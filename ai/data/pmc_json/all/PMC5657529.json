["Yatakemycin (YTM) is an extraordinarily toxic DNA alkylating agent with potent antimicrobial and antitumor properties and the most recent addition to the CC-1065 and duocarmycin family of natural products. While bulky DNA lesions the size of those produced by YTM are normally removed from the genome by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, YTM adducts are also a substrate for the bacterial DNA glycosylases AlkD and YtkR2, unexpectedly implicating base excision repair (BER) in their elimination. The reason for the extreme toxicity of these lesions and the molecular basis for how they are eliminated by BER have been unclear. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical properties of YTM adducts responsible for their toxicity, and define the mechanism by which they are excised by AlkD. These findings delineate an alternative strategy for repair of bulky DNA damage and establish the cellular utility of this pathway relative to that of NER.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "A large number of environmental toxins, chemotherapeutic drugs, and cellular metabolites, including those used by microbes as defense mechanisms, are alkylating agents that generate a chemically diverse spectrum of modifications on both the phosphodeoxyribose backbone and the nucleobases of DNA1. These lesions are both mutagenic and cytotoxic as a result of their ability to mistemplate or block nucleotide incorporation during transcription and replication. The majority of alkylation damage is eliminated from the genome by two excision repair pathways. Bulky and/or helix-distorting lesions are removed through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway2,3. In prokaryotes, NER is initiated by the UvrABC incision complex, which isolates the damage within a 12-nucleotide segment that is subsequently replaced with undamaged DNA by helicase, polymerase, and ligase activities. Conversely, small nucleobase modifications are removed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway4,5, which is initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that hydrolyze the N-glycosidic bond linking the damaged nucleobase to the backbone. The resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site is processed by endonuclease, exonuclease, polymerase, and ligase activities. Unlike the UvrABC complex, which acts on a broad spectrum of bulky lesions, DNA glycosylases are each specific for a limited number of small lesions6.", "A large number of environmental toxins, chemotherapeutic drugs, and cellular metabolites, including those used by microbes as defense mechanisms, are alkylating agents that generate a chemically diverse spectrum of modifications on both the phosphodeoxyribose backbone and the nucleobases of DNA1.

These enzymes typically employ a base-flipping mechanism to extrude the modified nucleobase from the DNA duplex in order to capture it inside a nucleobase binding pocket on the surface of the protein6\u20138. This binding pocket allows for damage recognition through shape and charge complementary with the modified nucleobase, while also providing a scaffold for residues that catalyze hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond.

This unique mechanism eliminates the steric constraints of a nucleobase binding pocket and allows AlkD to excise bulky alkylpurine adducts that are refractory to removal by base-flipping DNA glycosylases9,10.

Despite the lesion and the DNA being maintained as rigid bodies, the conformation of the YTM moiety seemed to be well suited to fit into the minor groove, leaving only the hydrophilic edge exposed to solvent. In this predominantly buried arrangement, the \u03c0-faces of all three YTM subunits form an extensive network of CH/\u03c0 interactions with deoxyribose groups in both DNA strands (Fig. 3e). Individually, CH/\u03c0 interactions are often fairly weak (~1 kcal mol\u22121)31. However, the combined strength of the 24 CH/\u03c0 interactions present in our YTMA-DNA model would create a significant energetic barrier to base-pair opening or thermal denaturation. Consistent with this prediction, we found that a single YTMA lesion in a GC-rich dodecamer increased the melting temperature (Tm) of the duplex by 36\u00b0C (Fig. 3g). Our YTMA-DNA model also predicts that without the unlikely dissociation of YTMAde, C1\u2032 will be sterically occluded from nucleophilic attack by a water molecule, rendering YTMA resistant to hydrolysis (Fig. 3f).

Overall, the structure is remarkably similar to those of previously determined product complexes containing much smaller 3-methyladenine (3mAde) and 3-deaza-3-methyladenine (3d3mAde) nucleobases9 (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). In all structures, a common set of DNA binding residues remodels the duplex, bending the helical axis by ~30\u00b0 away from the protein and widening the minor groove by 4\u20135 \u00c5 around the lesion (Fig. 4e\u2013h).

This is consistent with our current and previous crystal structures of AlkD bound to abasic DNA9,10, and with our previous biochemical data showing that AlkD binds THF-DNA with 104-fold higher affinity [Kd = 1.5 nM] than unmodified DNA44. Tight, preferential binding of AP sites by AlkD would inhibit both multiple turnover of YTMA lesions and further repair by the BER pathway, explaining the weak level of protection that AlkD provides against YTM toxicity in vivo.", "DISCUSSION", "DISCUSSION", "This work delineates the molecular basis for an alternative repair pathway for YTMA lesions. The adducts formed by YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins are too large to be excised by traditional DNA glycosylases and too stabilizing to the DNA duplex to be efficiently recognized by the UvrABC complex. Consequently, these compounds have extraordinarily high levels of toxicity, not unlike those of bifunctional alkylating agents that produce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Given the dramatic increase in duplex stability provided by YTMA and related lesions, owing to the extensive network of CH/\u03c0 interactions that they form between opposing DNA strands, these lesions should arguably be regarded as non-covalent ICLs. In prokaryotes, ICLs are repaired through the combined activities of NER and either homologous recombination or translesion synthesis45. Since the adducts generated by YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins neither destabilize nor significantly distort DNA17\u201319,22, reliance on the UvrABC incision complex will likely hinder ICL repair in the same manner that it hinders NER. As such, none of the traditional repair pathways are well suited for these bulky and highly duplex-stabilizing lesions.", "This work delineates the molecular basis for an alternative repair pathway for YTMA lesions.

TP-A0356 by specifically excising YTMA lesions, and thereby providing self-resistance to YTM. While orthologs of YtkR2, including AlkD, are prevalent in non-YTM producing bacteria10,46, they likely have not undergone the same selective pressure. Despite YtkR2 and AlkD sharing thirteen of sixteen DNA binding residues, they share only four of twelve YTMAde binding residues (Supplementary Fig. 8). Notably, these differences seem to create a larger binding cleft in YtkR2, with fewer contacts with YTMAde. While initially surprising, this may serve to destabilize the ternary product complex and promote dissociation of YtkR2, thereby avoiding the inhibition of AP endonuclease activity observed with AlkD. There is also the possibility that YtkR2 functions within a more specialized BER pathway. The gene cluster that encodes YtkR2 and the enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of YTM also encodes proteins with low sequence similarity to Escherichia coli EndoIV and TatD, the latter of which is a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease specific for single-stranded DNA15,47.

Furthermore, since most interactions with the hydrophilic edge of YTMAde are mediated by water (Supplementary Fig. 5), the partially solvent-filled cavity in which the YTM moiety is bound would be able to accommodate a variety of chemically and structurally diverse adducts.
