["Access to whole-genome sequences has exposed the general incidence of the so-called cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), thereby renewing their interest for natural product discovery. As a consequence, genome mining is the often first approach implemented to assess the potential of a microorganism for producing novel bioactive metabolites. By revealing a new level of complexity of natural product biosynthesis, we further illustrate the difficulty of estimation of the panel of molecules associated with a BGC based on genomic information alone. Indeed, we found that the same gene cluster is responsible for the production of compounds which differ in terms of structure and bioactivity. The production of these different compounds responds to different environmental triggers, which suggests that multiplication of culture conditions is essential for revealing the entire panel of molecules made by a single BGC.", "ABSTRACT", "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are organized groups of genes involved in the production of specialized metabolites. Typically, one BGC is responsible for the production of one or several similar compounds with bioactivities that usually only vary in terms of strength and/or specificity. Here we show that the previously described ferroverdins and bagremycins, which are families of metabolites with different bioactivities, are produced from the same BGC, whereby the fate of the biosynthetic pathway depends on iron availability. Under conditions of iron depletion, the monomeric bagremycins are formed, representing amino-aromatic antibiotics resulting from the condensation of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid with p-vinylphenol. Conversely, when iron is abundantly available, the biosynthetic pathway additionally produces a molecule based on p-vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate, which complexes iron to form the trimeric ferroverdins that have anticholesterol activity. Thus, our work shows a unique exception to the concept that BGCs should only produce a single family of molecules with one type of bioactivity and that in fact different bioactive molecules may be produced depending on the environmental conditions.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Specialized metabolites are natural products (NPs) that play essential roles by helping the producing strain to cope with various stresses, are used as weapons to outcompete neighboring commensals, or are required at particular physiological or developmental stages (1, 2).

One of the drivers of the renewed interest in NPs was the discovery of so-called cryptic BGCs that are silent under routine laboratory conditions and may therefore specify molecules that had so far been missed during pharmaceutical screening (7\u20139). An approach that is rapidly gaining momentum is that of expressing cryptic BGCs in a heterologous chassis strain or superhost and exchanging promoter elements within the BGC with those that are expected to result in high levels of expression under laboratory conditions. However, there are several problems associated with this approach. First, it is still difficult to effectively apply it through high-throughput strategies, and it is hard to establish the promise of the activity of a certain BGC on the basis of the DNA sequence alone (10). Second, examples of NPs that are produced from multiple BGCs, or by strains in coculture, are accumulating (11, 12). Alternatively, a single BGC may also be responsible for the production of many (up to over 100) structurally related molecules that differ in terms of their activity (13\u201315), or BGCs can be associated into \u201csuperclusters\u201d that function to produce two or more similar molecules (16, 17).

A total of 37 BGCs were identified, specifically, 36 BGCs on the linear chromosome and 1 additional BGC on linear plasmid pSLUN1 (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). BGC 12 (from S. lunaelactis 21350 [SLUN_21350] to SLUN_21430 [28]) exhibits strong gene synteny with the bagremycin BGC from Streptomyces sp.

The single-crossover event resulted in a duplication of fevR, with the first copy lacking the last 86\u2009nt, resulting in a truncated FevR protein, and the second copy lacking the promoter region and the first 116\u2009nt.

That a single BGC is responsible for the production of several related compounds is not unusual, but several features make the case of the fev/bag BGC unique. For example, the chemical compositions of ferroverdins and bagremycins (nitroso-aromatic versus amino-aromatic compounds) are different, as are their structural organizations (trimers versus monomers), whereas these two characteristics are conserved in other BGCs producing multiple compounds. But what makes this biosynthetic pathway exceptional is that the bagremycins and p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA, the monomer of ferroverdins, are not produced under the same culture conditions. Indeed, excess iron supply is mandatory for p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA production and for its subsequent complexation to a tripartite molecule, while the bagremycins are produced under conditions of low iron levels. Thus, iron is a key molecule that determines the distinct biological activities produced by S. lunaelactis: bagremycins display antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferative activities, presumably in order to inhibit growth of neighboring competing bacteria and fungi and/or to control self-proliferation, while p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA production would be required (to limit iron-mediated oxidative damage) only when iron excess constitutes a main threat. The change of the amino in a nitroso group in bagremycin allows complexation with iron, which strongly suggests an evolutionary driver for this chemical diversification.", "In this work, we provide genomic, genetic, and metabolomic evidence that a single BGC (fev/bag) is responsible for the synthesis of both ferroverdins and bagremycins. That a single BGC is responsible for the production of several related compounds is not unusual, but several features make the case of the fev/bag BGC unique. For example, the chemical compositions of ferroverdins and bagremycins (nitroso-aromatic versus amino-aromatic compounds) are different, as are their structural organizations (trimers versus monomers), whereas these two characteristics are conserved in other BGCs producing multiple compounds. But what makes this biosynthetic pathway exceptional is that the bagremycins and p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA, the monomer of ferroverdins, are not produced under the same culture conditions.

Direct generation of 4.3-HNBA would occur via the nitrosation of 3,4-AHBA and would be mediated by the copper-containing oxidase FevF (with FevE as chaperone). FevF is a copper-containing oxidase which is orthologous to NspF and GriF, while FevE is a copper chaperone orthologous to NspE and GriE (Table\u00a01). NspE bring two coppers to NspF, which converts 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzamide to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzamide in S. murayamaensis (32, 36). Likewise, GriE donates two coppers to GriF, which converts o-aminophenol into o-quinone imine in Streptomyces griseus (37). Since these FevF/FevE orthologous proteins mediate the oxidation of 3.4-AHBA-like substrates to generate quinone imine moieties which would be consecutively nitrosylated, we suggest that both of these enzymes are able to mediate the transformation of 3,4-AHBA to 4,3-HNBA.
