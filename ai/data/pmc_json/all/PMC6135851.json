["Streptomyces coelicolor is a Gram-positive microorganism often used as a model of physiological and morphological differentiation in streptomycetes, prolific producers of secondary metabolites with important biological activities. In the present study, we analysed Streptomyces coelicolor growth and differentiation in the presence of the hypo-methylating agent 5\u2032-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) in order to investigate whether cytosine methylation has a role in differentiation. We found that cytosine demethylation caused a delay in spore germination, aerial mycelium development, sporulation, as well as a massive impairment of actinorhodin production. Thus, we searched for putative DNA methyltransferase genes in the genome and constructed a mutant of the SCO1731 gene. The analysis of the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain demonstrated that inactivation of SCO1731 leads to a strong decrease of cytosine methylation and almost to the same phenotype obtained after 5-aza-dC treatment. Altogether, our data demonstrate that cytosine methylation influences morphological differentiation and actinorhodin production in S. coelicolor and expand our knowledge on this model bacterial system.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Base methylation is a DNA modification present in all kingdoms of life, including bacteria. The methylation of cytosines is an important epigenetic mark, well known in higher eukaryotes to control transcriptional regulation that can cause repression or activation of gene expression.

While adenine methylation has been largely studied in many bacterial systems and it was shown to influence crucial vital processes, such as bacterial cell cycle, only a few studies have so far been published on cytosine methylation in bacteria, mostly in Escherichia coli4,5,16,23. Years ago, some attempts to find a role for DNA methyltransferases in S. antibioticus and S. coelicolor were reported. These studies applied different compounds known to block cytosine methylation (e.g. 5-azacytidine and sinefungin), but no clear role for cytosine methylation was established35\u201337.

In the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain, cytosine methylation was reduced to 22% compared to the parental strain during the MI stage. Our results cannot rule out that other methyltransferases may be responsible for residual methylation nor that other methyltransferases may be expressed following SCO1731 activation in a cascade manner. In fact, 38 genes coding for putative methyltransferases are present in S. coelicolor genome, making this a reasonable hypothesis. Among them, SCO1731 was transcribed in MI at higher levels, when cytosine methylation is higher than in other growth stages both in liquid and solid medium. Moreover, the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant shows the same phenotype observed in the 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine treated cultures regarding the effect on actinorhodin production, aerial mycelium differentiation and sporulation, that resulted impaired in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant and the 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine treated cultures; differently, the delay observed in undecylprodigiosin production, spore germination and growth in the 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine treated cultures was not observed in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant. This further indicates that SCO1731 is not the only methyltransferase participating in the regulation of Streptomyces development. Interestingly, the complemented mutant strain restored partially the methylation levels to 70% and if on the one hand this was sufficient to restore the correct morphological development, on the other one said methylation level was not sufficient to re-establish the onset of the actinorhodin production, further supporting that some other cellular events do occur. This kind of multilevel regulation would be not far from other bacterial systems, better investigated for influence of DNA methylation on gene expression.
