The advancements in science, technology, and economic turnarounds also pass through the realm of natural products chemistry and natural products chemists\u2019 contributions which are acquiring focus and importance on an increasing levels.", "Thus, again, the emerging trends and promise for future from these advancements, and deeper understanding of the natural products chemistry domains with its interrelationship with natural and biological sciences and with the hereto hidden concepts/understandings in biotechnology, drug discovery, pharmaceutical sciences, genetics, and chemical ecology will help to race ahead, and set the agenda for further work with promise of new economic, and technical growth so intricately linked.
