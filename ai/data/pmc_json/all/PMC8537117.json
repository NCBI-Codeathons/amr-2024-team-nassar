["Mycophenolic acid (MPA) targets the inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) of human lymphocytes. It is widely used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients who, incidentally, are at risk for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). We hypothesized that MPA exerts selective pressure on P. jirovecii microorganisms considering its in vitro antifungal activity on other fungi. Thus, we analysed impdh gene in P. jirovecii isolates from SOT recipients. P. jirovecii specimens from 26 patients diagnosed with PCP from 2010 to 2020 were retrospectively examined: 10 SOT recipients treated with MPA and 16 non-SOT patients without prior exposure to MPA. The P. jirovecii impdh gene was amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequences were aligned with the reference sequences retrieved from available P. jirovecii whole genomes. The deduced IMPDH protein sequences were aligned with available IMPDH proteins from Pneumocystis spp. and other fungal species known to be in vitro sensitive or resistant to MPA. A total of nine SNPs was identified. One SNP (G1020A) that results in an Ala261Thr substitution was identified in all SOT recipients and in none of the non-SOT patients. Considering that IMPDHs of other fungi, resistant to MPA, harbour Thr (or Ser) at the analogous position, the Ala261Thr mutation observed in MPA-treated patients was considered to represent the signature of P. jirovecii exposure to MPA. These results suggest that MPA may be involved in the selection of specific P. jirovecii strains that circulate in the SOT recipient population.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) is a transmissible, uncultivable fungus responsible for severe pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) remains the most frequent AIDS defining infection in HIV-infected patients in developed countries. In France, PCP represents 30% of the annually reported 1200 AIDS cases [1]. PCP also affects immunosuppressed patients not infected with HIV [2,3]. PCP occurs in 5\u201315% of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in the absence of prophylaxis, with a mortality rate up to 49% [4,5]. The frequency of PCP seems to increase in SOT recipients, specifically in renal transplant recipients (RTR), particularly when the transplantation is not recent, when the patients are no longer subjected to PCP prophylaxis and when the acquisition of P. jirovecii is nosocomial [6].", "Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) is a transmissible, uncultivable fungus responsible for severe pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients.

It targets the inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme involved in de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. MPA specifically inhibits the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes, since these cells synthesize de novo purines while other human cells can use alternate pathways for this synthesis [7]. Therefore, MPA is a powerful immunosuppressive drug. The resulting immunosuppression leads to opportunistic infection occurrence [8]. Nevertheless, data on the occurrence of PCP in patients treated with MPA are contradictory. MPA may have an antifungal activity on Pneumocystis. Oz and Hughes used a rat model which demonstrated that none of the animals treated with MPA alone or in association with dexamethasone developed PCP whereas 90% of rats treated with dexamethasone or tacrolimus alone developed PCP after 4 weeks of treatment [9]. Husain and Singh showed that PCP frequency in RTR treated with MPA was significantly lower than in RTRs without MPA treatment (0/1068 vs. 10/563, p = 0.00006) [8]. On the other hand, we have published three series of PCP case clusters in RTR and heart transplant recipients (HTR) and noted the occurrence of 38 PCP cases in patients effectively treated with MPA [10,11,12]. Considering these aforementioned observations, the putative antifungal activity of MPA on P. jirovecii remains a subject of debate. Conversely, MPA is known to have an in vitro antifungal activity on other fungal species which is useful in fundamental mycology [13].", "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a widely used anti-rejection treatment included in immunosuppressive regimens for SOT recipients.

The two P. jirovecii impdh gene sequences were identical, except two synonymous SNPs at positions 1850 and 1952 (Figure S2). The P. jirovecii impdh gene is 2070 bp long, encompassing eight introns. The six fragments of the impdh gene were successfully amplified using the six designed primer pairs and afterward sequenced in all 26 patients. Consensus sequences of the P. jirovecii impdh gene were compared to the impdh gene sequence from P. jirovecii genome assembly version Pneu-jiro_RU7_V2 (T551_00631 locus), which was used as a reference sequence to identify SNPs [17]. Nine SNPs were identified at positions 76 (G76T), 914 (G914A), 1020 (G1020A), 1269 (C1269T), 1329 (A1329T), 1737 (G1737A), 1754 (C1754T), 1850 (T1850C) and 1952 (G1952A) (Figure S2; Figure S3; Table 3).

SNP at positions 76 and 914 were found in only one patient each (G76T in C10 and G914A in C13) and were confirmed with a second PCR-sequencing experiment. Eight putative IMPDH alleles were defined based on these polymorphisms (Table 4). The sequence of the impdh gene from Ma and colleagues (T551_00631 locus) [17] corresponds to allele IMPDH-1. This allele was identified in two SOT recipients (T3 and T9) and four control patients (C1, C8, C14 and C15). The sequence of the impdh gene from Ciss\u00e9 and colleagues (PNEJI1_002926 locus) [18] corresponds to allele IMPDH-2. This allele was only identified in six control patients (C3, C4, C7, C9, C12 and C15). Interestingly, allele IMPDH-3 was only identified in the 10 SOT recipients. Allele IMPDH-4 was only identified in three control patients (C6, C14 and C16). Allele IMPDH-5 was only identified in nine control patients (C2, C5, C7, C8, C10, C11, C12, C13, C16).
