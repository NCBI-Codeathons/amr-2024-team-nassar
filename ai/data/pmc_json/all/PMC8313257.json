["Summary", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces phenazine\u20101\u2010carboxylic acid (PCA) and pyocyanin (PYO), which aid its anaerobic survival by mediating electron transfer to distant oxygen. These natural secondary metabolites are being explored in biotechnology to mediate electron transfer to the anode of bioelectrochemical systems. A major challenge is that only a small fraction of electrons from microbial substrate conversion is recovered. It remained unclear whether phenazines can re\u2010enter the cell and thus, if the electrons accessed by the phenazines arise mainly from cytoplasmic or periplasmic pathways. Here, we prove that the periplasmic glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) of P. aeruginosa and P. putida is involved in the reduction of natural phenazines. PYO displayed a 60\u2010fold faster enzymatic reduction than PCA; PCA was, however, more stable for long\u2010term electron shuttling to the anode. Evaluation of a Gcd knockout and overexpression strain showed that up to 9% of the anodic current can be designated to this enzymatic reaction. We further assessed phenazine uptake with the aid of two molecular biosensors, which experimentally confirm the phenazines\u2019 ability to re\u2010enter the cytoplasm. These findings significantly advance the understanding of the (electro) physiology of phenazines for future tailoring of phenazine electron discharge in biotechnological applications.", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa phenazines aid its anaerobic survival by mediating electron transfer to distant oxygen.

Microorganisms produce energy in the form of ATP mainly by the systematic transfer of electrons through their electron transport chains to a terminal electron acceptor such as oxygen, nitrate or sulphate (Kracke et\u00a0al., 2015; Kuypers et\u00a0al., 2018). Electroactive microorganisms are in addition able to transport electrons through their cellular membrane to the extracellular environment to reduce solid\u2010state electron acceptors such as Fe(III) and Mn(IV) (Kato, 2015; Shi et\u00a0al., 2016). This discharge of electrons can be harnessed in a bioelectrochemical system (BES), where electrons are channelled to an electrode (anode) as an alternative electron acceptor (Pant et\u00a0al., 2012; Logan et\u00a0al., 2019). BES technology currently holds potentials in various fields, the most renowned being the microbial fuel cell (MFC) used for wastewater treatment (Pandey et\u00a0al., 2016). Additionally, a fairly new field applies BES in biotechnology for new oxygen\u2010limited bioprocesses, as they can provide an oxygen\u2010independent alternative for discharging excess electrons and thereby maintaining the metabolic flux of the organism (Schmitz et\u00a0al., 2015; Askitosari, 2019).", "Energy is the key factor, which drives metabolism in all organisms (Alexandre et\u00a0al., 2004).

For biotechnological applications, the use of the latter has several advantages. Redox mediators are in principle non\u2010exhaustible (Brutinel and Gralnick, 2012) and based on the three\u2010dimensional culture broth, there is no limit to the extent mediators can travel. This is in contrast to direct electron transfer, which is limited to the 2D surface area of the electrode. The natural mediators produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are termed phenazines, with phenazine\u20101\u2010carboxylic acid (PCA) and pyocyanin (PYO) being the ones dominantly produced (Mavrodi et\u00a0al., 2001). Although these colourful secondary metabolites are mostly known for the different roles they play as a pathogenicity factor in P. aeruginosa infections (Hall et\u00a0al., 2016; Yang et\u00a0al., 2016), they also have been shown to enhance the anaerobic survival of the organism by shuttling electrons to distant oxygen (Wang et\u00a0al., 2010). Phenazines may receive electrons from NAD(P)H, as shown in\u00a0vitro, and from some cytoplasmic enzymatic conversions of central metabolic pathways (Price\u2010Whelan et\u00a0al., 2007; Glasser et\u00a0al., 2017; Jo et\u00a0al., 2020).

PCA with a half\u2010life of more than 10\u00a0days appeared more stable than PYO, which half\u2010life was about one day (Fig.\u00a04).", "Specific glucose consumption and maximum biomass yield of P. putida KT2440 strains in BES using PCA or PYO as electron mediators.", "Specific glucose consumption and maximum biomass yield of P. putida KT2440 strains in BES using PCA or PYO as electron mediators.", "Specific glucose consumption and maximum biomass yield of P. putida KT2440 strains in BES using PCA or PYO as electron mediators.", "Strain PCA\u2010 BES PYO\u2010 BES.", "Strain PCA\u2010 BES PYO\u2010 BES.", "Strain PCA\u2010 BES PYO\u2010 BES.", "Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW gGlc\u20101) Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW\u00a0gGlc\u20101).", "Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW gGlc\u20101) Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW\u00a0gGlc\u20101).", "Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW gGlc\u20101) Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW\u00a0gGlc\u20101).", "KT2440 wt 4.06 0.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.76 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04.", "KT2440 wt 4.06 0.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.76 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04.", "KT2440 wt 4.06 0.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.76 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd 5.02 0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.81 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd 5.02 0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.81 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd 5.02 0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.81 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013\nPA14 gcd 8.84 0.139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 1.27 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013\nPA14 gcd 8.84 0.139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 1.27 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013\nPA14 gcd 8.84 0.139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 1.27 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013", "PA14 gcd", "PA14 gcd", "PA14 gcd", "Specific glucose consumption was calculated for the first 2\u00a0days of the BES experiment.", "Specific glucose consumption was calculated for the first 2\u00a0days of the BES experiment.", "Specific glucose consumption was calculated for the first 2\u00a0days of the BES experiment.", "Fig. 4Metabolic and growth (OD600) profile and the stability of phenazines as electron mediator in the BES over a period of 10\u00a0days using P. putida KT2440.

The specific glucose consumption was highest for the first two days of active aeration, with rates being the lowest for the Gcd mutant and highest for the overexpression strain (Table\u00a01). The initial higher glucose conversion rate especially for the overexpression but also the wild\u2010type strains in both PCA\u2010 and PYO\u2010BES could be linked to the utilization of the periplasmic pathway for glucose oxidation. This was confirmed by the presence of gluconate and 2\u2010ketogluconic acids in the supernatant (Fig\u00a04). The amount of gluconate and 2\u2010ketogluconic acids were expectedly low (about 0.2\u00a0g\u00a0l\u20101) in the wild type (Fig.\u00a04A and B), since the rate of gluconate uptake in P. putida KT2440 is well matched to glucose oxidation with a negligible amount going all the way to 2\u2010ketogluconate (Nikel et\u00a0al., 2015). The initial difference in the current density (after turning down the aeration) for both phenazines between the wild type and the mutant confirmed a contribution of the periplasmic pathway (Fig.\u00a04C and D). It seems like phenazines can only access electrons and enable current production with a delay in the absence of Gcd. Meanwhile, the products of the periplasmic pathway were found accumulated in a high amount in the overexpression strain (Fig.\u00a04E and F). In the PCA\u2010BES, almost 95% of the glucose converted by the overexpression strain was found as gluconate and 2\u2010ketogluconic acid after 2\u00a0days, showing that the sugar oxidation pathway was greatly accelerated by the overexpression; however, sugar acid uptake into the cytosol could not match their production. The effect was similar for this strain in the PYO\u2010BES, although only 42% of the glucose was found as intermediate products of direct glucose oxidation. The correlation between the metabolic flux increase of the overexpression strain in the glucose oxidation pathway and the increased electron discharge with this strain to the BES anode strongly suggests that the direct glucose oxidation pathway indeed is an important interaction point for phenazines to mediate electrons to the anode. However, if electrons are discharged at this point, no energetic gain for the cell is possible, since the electrons will be diverted away from the electron transport chain, which drives ATP\u2010production. To quantitatively compare the efficiency of the electron discharge via phenazines, the coulombic efficiency was calculated for the three strains. It gives the fraction of the electrons from glucose oxidation, which was mediated to the anode for current generation via the phenazines. For the PCA\u2010BES, this value is 4.1%, 5.0% and 8.8% for the wild\u2010type; Gcd mutant, and the overexpression strain, respectively, while it was expectedly lower in PYO\u2010BES with 0.8%, 0.8% and 1.3%, because the current was not sustained due to the instability of PYO. A higher columbic efficiency of the overexpression strain is in agreement to the high current density obtained for this strain in comparison with the other strains and to the less complete oxidation of the glucose with accumulated intermediates (Fig.\u00a04E and F).

The first biosensor was made to track PCA and was based on the two reaction steps that modify PCA to PYO catalysed by the two enzymes PhzM, a methyltransferase, and PhzS, a monoxygenase (Mavrodi et\u00a0al., 2001).

The alcohol substrates 2,3\u2010butanediol and ethanol also show anodic current production (Bosire et\u00a0al., 2016) and can be metabolized by the periplasmic PQQ\u2010dependent ethanol dehydrogenase (Edh). However, the in\u00a0vitro assay of this enzyme showed no reduction of PCA or PYO with either of the alcohols (data not shown). In contrast, the artificial electron acceptor DCPIP was reduced in this assay, showing functionality of the Edh enzyme. The PQQ\u2010dependent enzyme reaction is believed to use the same (hydrid) transfer mechanism for both alcohol (Edh) and aldehyde (Gcd) dehydrogenases (Anthony, 1996; Oubrie et\u00a0al., 1999).
