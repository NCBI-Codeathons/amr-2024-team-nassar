["The disulfide bond is unusual in natural products and critical for thermal stability, cell permeability and bioactivity. DepH from Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968 is an FAD-dependent enzyme responsible for catalyzing the disulfide bond formation of FK228, an anticancer prodrug approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here we report the crystal structures of DepH and DepH complexed with a substrate analogue S,S'-dimethyl FK228 at 1.82\u2005\u00c5 and 2.00\u2005\u00c5, respectively. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that DepH, in contrast to the well characterized low molecular weight thioredoxin reductases (LMW TrxRs), is an NADP+-independent dithiol oxidase. DepH not only lacks a conserved GGGDXAXE motif necessary for NADP+ binding in the canonical LMW TrxRs, but also contains a 11-residue sequence which physically impedes the binding of NADP+. These observations explain the difference between NADP+-independent small molecule dithiol oxidases and NADP+-dependent thioredoxin reductases and provide insights for understanding the catalytic mechanism of dithiol oxidases involved in natural product biosynthesis.", "The presence of a disulfide bond in natural products is rare but usually critical for their bioactivity, thermal stability and cell permeability. One classic example is the antitumorigen FK228 (also known as FR901228 or depsipeptide, registered as NSC 630176, romidepsin or Istodax; Fig. 1), a selective class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in 2009 by the US Food and Drug Administration12. FK228 is produced by the Gram-negative Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968, with a cage-shaped bicyclic depsipeptide structure and a rare disulfide linkage34. The prodrug form of FK228 with a disulfide bond is more stable than its reduced form (red-FK228, Fig. 1) in medium or serum, and this disulfide bond facilitates compound diffusion across the cell membrane more efficiently. Once inside the cells, the prodrug FK228 is activated by glutathione reduction so that one of the free thiol groups of red-FK228 interacts strongly with an active-site zinc and thereby prevents substrate binding1. Similar disulfide linkages are also present in a few other antibiotics or antitumor natural products, including holomycin5, gliotoxin6, triostin A and its derivatives7, FR9013758, spiruchostatins9, and thailandepsins101112.", "The enzyme responsible for catalyzing the disulfide bond formation in FK228 biosynthesis is DepH13. A BLAST search for proteins homologous to DepH revealed several low molecular weight thioredoxin reductases (LMW TrxRs) from bacteria and fungi, and small molecule dithiol oxidoreductases including TdpH from Burkholderia thailandensis E26410 and Ecm17 from Streptomyces lasaliensis7. TrxRs are homodimeric flavoproteins consisting of a cofactor FAD-binding site, an NADP+-binding site and a redox motif CXXC (two cysteine residues separated by two variable amino acids)141516. They catalyze the oxidation or reduction of disulfide bonds through thiol-disulfide exchange between the enzymes and their substrate proteins. Extensive structural studies revealed that the NADP+- and FAD-binding sites of LMW TrxRs are located on opposite faces of the molecules and a conformational change is required for electron transfer from the reduced form of FAD to NADP+17.", "Results", "Results", "Overall structure of DepH", "Overall structure of DepH", "Overall structure of DepH", "The full-length DepH (residues 1\u2013319) from C. violaceum No. 968 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as an N-terminal 6 \u00d7 His-tagged fusion protein and purified to homogeneity13.

Cocrystallization of DepH with FK228 was performed using the same method in the presence of 5\u2005mM DTT but only yielded the apo-DepH crystals. Fortunately, cocrystallization of DepH with dm-FK228 turned out to be successful. The protein drops in which seeds were transferred contained 1.8\u2005\u03bcl of the protein solution and 0.2\u2005\u03bcl of 10\u2005mM dm-FK228 dissolved in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and PEG 200 (1:1 ratio).

We attempted to cocrystallize DepH with NADP+ and to get the tertiary structure of DepH/dm-FK228/NADP+ by controlling the ratio of protein to NADP+ from 1:4 to 1:10, but failed to find any NADP+ densities in the obtained crystal structures.", "Initial crystallization trials were performed using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method at 20\u00b0C with commercially available kits.

We did not try the cocrystallization of DepH with the substrate red-FK228 because red-FK228 is sensitive to oxidation and will be catalyzed to form FK228 by DepH during the cocrystallization process.
