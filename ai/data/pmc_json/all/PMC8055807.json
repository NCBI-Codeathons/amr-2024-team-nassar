["A novel approach targeting self-inducible surfactin synthesis under oxygen-limited conditions is presented. Because both the nitrate (NarGHI) and nitrite (NasDE) reductase are highly expressed during anaerobic growth of B. subtilis, the native promoter PsrfA of the surfactin operon in strain B. subtilis JABs24 was replaced by promoters PnarG and PnasD to induce surfactin synthesis anaerobically. Shake flask cultivations with varying oxygen availabilities indicated no significant differences in native PsrfA expression. As hypothesized, activity of PnarG and PnasD increased with lower oxygen levels and surfactin was not produced by PsrfA::PnarG as well as PsrfA::PnasD mutant strains under conditions with highest oxygen availability. PnarG showed expressions similar to PsrfA at lowest oxygen availability, while maximum value of PnasD was more than 5.5-fold higher. Although the promoter exchange PsrfA::PnarG resulted in a decreased surfactin titer at lowest oxygen availability, the strain carrying PsrfA::PnasD reached a 1.4-fold increased surfactin concentration with 696\u00a0mg/L and revealed an exceptional high overall YP/X of 1.007\u00a0g/g. This value also surpassed the YP/X of the reference strain JABs24 at highest and moderate oxygen availability. Bioreactor cultivations illustrated that significant cell lysis occurred when the process of \u201canaerobization\u201d was performed too fast. However, processes with a constantly low agitation and aeration rate showed promising potential for process improvement, especially by employing the strain carrying PsrfA::PnasD promoter exchange. Additionally, replacement of other native promoters by nitrite reductase promoter PnasD represents a promising tool for anaerobic-inducible bioprocesses in Bacillus.", "Supplementary Information", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13568-021-01218-4.", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13568-021-01218-4.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The cyclic lipopeptide surfactin synthesized by Bacillus subtilis displays promising characteristics in a variety of industrial sectors (Geissler et al. 2019a) due to its excellent surface-active properties and antimicrobial activities (Falardeau et al. 2013; Li et al. 2019).

If product separation by foaming is integrated into the process as a first surfactin enrichment, cells are also lost for further surfactin production (Willenbacher et al. 2014). Issues with blocked exhaust air filters and hence increase in pressure can also occur. However, high agitation and aeration rates are indispensable when defined oxygen levels shall be maintained in commonly employed aerobic cultivations. Indeed, Yeh et al. (2006) reported that up to a certain high level of aeration and stirrer speed surfactin synthesis was improved in carrier-assisted cultivation due to improved oxygen transfer rate and mass transfer efficiency. In contrast to these circumstances, other studies described that an enhanced surfactin production rate was reached in oxygen-limited conditions (Davis et al. 1999; Kim et al. 1997). In this sense, the set-points for both aeration and agitation rate are crucial to have the optimal performance in a bioreactor cultivation with a defined strain. Interestingly, an anaerobic cultivation of B. subtilis as demonstrated by Willenbacher et al. (2015) resulted in a completely foam-free approach for surfactin formation. Nevertheless, anaerobic nitrate respiration reveals some restrictions. Both the overall low growth rates of B. subtilis producer strains and comparatively low surfactin titers make these processes inferior to aerobic counterparts. Still, promising and high values with regard to product per biomass yields were obtained (Geissler et al. 2019b; Willenbacher et al. 2015). Another aspect is the negative impact of nitrite as well as acetate on anaerobic cell growth.

In this field, substitution of the native promoter PsrfA, whose regulation is dependent on a complex quorum-sensing mechanism (Geissler et al. 2019a), constitutes one promising approach. The replacement of PsrfA by constitutively promoters was reported in several studies (Coutte et al. 2010a; Willenbacher et al. 2016). Results demonstrated that both gene expression during the time course of cultivation as well as the ability of the wild-type strain to produce surfactin influence final surfactin concentrations. In contrast to constitutive promoters, several studies reported on improved surfactin titers up to 17-fold employing IPTG-inducible promoters (Jiao et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2018).

Hence, the presented method takes advantage of the ability of B. subtilis to grow anaerobically by nitrate respiration, the most effective life style to generate ATP after aerobic growth with oxygen as electron acceptor (H\u00e4rtig and Jahn 2012). The adaptation of aerobic growing cells to anaerobic conditions is dependent on the interplay of three major regulators, which are ResDE, Fnr and Rex (a detailed overview is given by H\u00e4rtig and Jahn (2012)). In a first step, nitrate is reduced to nitrite by the catabolic nitrate reductase NarGHI (Nakano et al. 1998). In a second step, nitrite is further reduced to ammonium by the nitrite reductase NasDE. Indeed, NasDE is also involved in aerobic assimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite. However, the expression of NasDE was reported to be significantly induced in the absence of oxygen emanating from a promoter located in between nasC and nasD (Nakano et al. 1998). Hence, both PnarG and PnasD are involved in anaerobic nitrate respiration, although also the availability of nitrogen sources plays an important role in this issue. In addition to these anaerobically inducible promoters, B. subtilis exhibits more regulatory networks that allow induction of gene expression under oxygen limitation. An overview of B. subtilis transcriptome under anaerobic growth was provided by Nicolas et al. (2012).

In brief, B. subtilis harbors two nitrate reductases with the genes nasBC and narGHI encoding for the assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reductase, respectively. The transcription of the latter one, narGHI, is thereby repressed in the presence of oxygen (Hoffmann et al. 1995; Nakano et al. 1996). On the contrary, nasDE encodes for both assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrite reductase and transcription is hence also feasible aerobically (Nakano et al. 1998). To demonstrate that the PnasD expression is dependent on the presence of ammonium or nitrate, respectively, B. subtilis MG5 was cultivated in media containing either NH4+ or NO3\u2212 in 10% Rv. As expected, mean MU for PnasD expression was below 10 MU in the medium containing only NH4+, whereas much higher MU values (continuously\u2009~\u2009200 MU) were detected in NO3\u2212 supplemented medium (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In addition, in media supplemented with either 0.005 or 0.01\u00a0mol/L NH4+, a time-delayed expression of PnasD was monitored (Additional file 1: Fig. S1) which was triggered by depletion of NH4+ (data not shown).

Highest expression was detected after 12\u00a0h with 320 MU before expression declined slightly (Fig.\u00a04d).", "The detection of ammonium showed an initial slight decrease before the amount increased steadily for both strains due to nitrate reduction and reached 5.8\u00a0mol and 6.7\u00a0mol for strains KM1016 and MG14, respectively. Nitrite concentrations increased until 22\u00a0h in both cultivations. After a subsequent decrease until ~\u200930\u00a0h, nitrite again increased steadily and reached values of ~\u20090.21\u00a0mol at CDWmax. The pO2 declined faster in the cultivation of strain MG14 which correlated to higher growth rates (Fig.\u00a04d). For strain KM1016, a pO2 of ~\u200914% was reached after ~\u200915\u00a0h, and mean pO2 of ~\u20091.8% was measured after 25\u00a0h of cultivation (Fig.\u00a04c). On the contrary, the pO2 of strain MG14 fell to ~\u20092% after 7\u00a0h of cultivation, and a mean pO2 of ~\u20091.2% was reached after ~\u200915\u00a0h of cultivation. For both strains, the pO2 increased drastically when cell growth was terminated. In terms of foaming, the foam centrifuge was activated right from the beginning for strain KM1016 and after ~\u20096\u00a0h for strain MG14. With respect to the Miller units, PsrfA expression was detectable as soon as cells grew after a short lag-phase. A maximum of 250 MU was determined after 24\u00a0h of cultivation and values slightly decreased afterwards (Fig.\u00a04c). For PnasD, induction levels were below 5 MU until 6\u00a0h of cultivation.

In addition, this self-inducible system is advantageous compared to IPTG-induced promoters due to reduced production costs. Furthermore, foaming was also lowered, and time delayed in both shake flask and bioreactor cultivations. Interestingly, both strains MG12 (PsrfA::PnarG) and MG14 showed improved growth rates when no surfactin was produced in 10% Rv. At both 50% and 100% Rv, increased growth rates were obtained with decreasing surfactin titers. Hence, expression and presence of surfactin seems to result in reduced growth rates, which is in accordance with previous studies (Tsuge et al. 2001; Vahidinasab et al. 2020). Shake flask cultivations employing different Rv have been shown to be a suitable approach to investigate the activation of the promoters PnarG and PnasD. In the presented set-up, the reference strains MG1 and MG5 reached Miller units of up to 2000 for PnasD and 180 for PnarG, respectively. Hence, PnasD expressions were even slightly higher than reported by Hoffmann et al. (2020) when cultivating in anaerobic serum flasks. On the contrary, PnarG expression levels were reported to reach up to 440 MU (Hoffmann et al. 2020). Consequently, as PnarG is an exclusively anaerobically activated promoter, the combination of 100% Rv at 120\u00a0rpm probably did not result in full anaerobic induction. One possibility to further decrease the oxygen input would be to vary the agitation rate as performed by Fahim et al. (2012). However, cell agglutination already occurred at 120\u00a0rpm and is expected to appear even earlier at lower agitation rates. Hence, as nitrate was often observed as growth limiting factor, increasing the nitrate concentration to elongate the cultivation would not be possible under these circumstances. One option would be to perform further strain engineering and delete genes responsible for biofilm formation and thus for cell agglutination (Pedrido et al. 2013). Assuming microaerobic conditions at 100% Rv and 120\u00a0rpm, strain MG14 reached up to ~\u20093-fold higher PnasD expression than PsrfA in the reference strain. On the contrary, the surfactin concentration was only 1.4-fold increased. Feedback mechanisms or nutrient limitations might result in this observed discrepancy, and further studies must investigate which optimizations have to be performed on a molecular level or in operational parameter to reach a 3-fold increase in surfactin titer to exploit the complete potential of PnasD.", "Experiments have demonstrated that B. subtilis MG14 with PsrfA::PnasD poses an interesting candidate for further bioreactor process developments targeting at self-inducible surfactin synthesis uncoupled from the native quorum-sensing system.

(2020), high ammonium and glucose concentrations reduced expression of PnarG, but such a reductive effect was not observed for PnasD. Still, fine-tuning of the medium is important to find a good balance between sufficient ammonium for aerobically growing cells, and cells performing nitrate respiration, hence providing ammonium. Particularly, the effect of different nitrate concentrations on the expression of both PnarG and PnasD has not been examined so far. This is also of utmost importance when employing a self-regulated HNO3-feed as pH regulator. Indeed, the amount of HNO3 added was higher than nitrate consumption due to the production of various metabolites that alkalize the medium on top to the pH shift caused by nitrate respiration, resulting in a continuous increase in nitrate. In addition, the amount of HNO3 needed is three-times higher than for e.g. H3PO4 (monovalent vs. trivalent acid). This results in further limitations as the bioreactor capacity is exhausted earlier. With the current set-up it cannot be examined if both oxygen-depleted and nitrate-depleted conditions reach even higher YP/X values as reported by Davis et al. (1999). For this purpose, mathematical modeling of the bioprocess combining a metabolic model of the nitrogen metabolism, oxygen availability and consumption, along with mechanisms of genetic regulation can be used to provide further insights into this complex interplay. Using this toolset, investigation and evaluation of a dual-limitation fed-batch process becomes feasible, which is a very demanding task for process control, as both limitations need to be tightly regulated (Noll and Henkel 2020).", "As reported by Hoffmann et al.

However, a drastic decrease in biomass was observed when cells entered oxygen-limited or even depleted conditions too fast. It was recently reported that ~\u200990% of cells died upon oxygen depletion, while the remaining cells maintain their viability (Arjes et al. 2020). Similar observations were made in the current employed processes with drop in CDW. Although cells restored their growth, the surfactin productivity of these cells was reduced. Consequently, when targeting at switch processes with different pO2-profiles, it is of utmost importance to relate oxygen availability to adaptation of cells to anaerobic conditions. For example, Hoffmann et al. (1995) reported on a lag-phase of 24 to 36\u00a0h when aerobically growing cells were transferred to anaerobic conditions. This would result in time-consuming processes and the increased growth rates observed in aerobic non-surfactin producing cells would probably not compensate for these adaptation times. In a further approach, a cultivation with a constant agitation rate of 300\u00a0rpm and aeration rate of 1.2\u00a0L/min was tested. This process set-up was identified as easily operable and issues due to foam formation were drastically reduced compared to conventional batch and fed-batch processes with varying agitation and aeration rates due to pO2 regulation. In addition, foaming occurred time-delayed in strain MG14 compared to the reference strain KM1016 which can be attributed in parts to the absence of surfactin during the first hours of cultivation. However, foam formation was yet present prior to the induction of surfactin production. In this sense, identification of other metabolites, such as proteins, in foam and deletion of corresponding genes might be a target in future works to further reduce the foam formation. Results of both surfactin titer and promoter activity of PnasD also clearly indicated that the employed set-up more likely correlated to shake flask cultivations with 50% Rv. Also based on the Miller units obtained, it can be assumed that most cells still grew aerobically. This leads to the open question how many cells have already adapted to anaerobic conditions and it is crucial to further characterize the cell differentiation patterns in aerobically-anaerobically growing cells. Hence, further bioreactor cultivations must be performed with even lower aeration rates, either by applying air with a lower oxygen concentration (currently 16%), pure oxygen or, of course, by adjusting the technical equipment to allow for aeration rates below 1.2\u00a0L/min. Ideally, applying pure oxygen at much lower aeration rates (<\u20090.2\u00a0L/min) would result in two advantages. First, even less foam formation is expected to occur, and second, the autoinduction of surfactin synthesis is expected to be much higher as the available amount of oxygen per cell decreases faster. Another issue faced was the drastic accumulation of nitrite in bioreactor cultivations, which was not observed in shake flasks. At these concentrations, nitrite is reported to reduce and even inhibit cell growth (Hoffmann et al. 2020). Prior to further bioreactor process optimization, studies must address this limitation and investigate the defect of nitrite reduction to ammonium. Nevertheless, even under the current bioreactor process conditions, strain MG14 with a YP/X of 0.211\u00a0g/g and productivity q of 0.004\u00a0g/(g h) was already superior to other non-conventional bioreactor processes reported by Chtioui et al. (2012) (Rotating disc bioreactor, YP/X = 0.068\u00a0g/g, q\u2009=\u20090.001\u00a0g/(g h)) Coutte et al. (2010b) (Membrane bioreactor, YP/X = 0.078\u00a0g/g, q\u2009=\u20090.002\u00a0g/(g h)). A comparative table was prepared previously in Hoffmann et al. (2020). A foam-free anaerobic cultivation was reported to reach a promising YP/X with 0.278\u00a0g/g (Willenbacher et al. 2015), but as summarized by Hoffmann et al. (2020), complete anaerobic processes are time-consuming due to low growth rates and the overall surfactin titers are by far not competitive to conventional aerobic batch processes. With further appropriate regulation of the nitrogen sources and aeration, processes employing strain MG14 are expected to become superior to the reference strain JABs24 as demonstrated in shake flask cultivations with a YP/X of 1.007\u00a0g/g and productivity q of 0.023\u00a0g/(g h). Reaching these yields in bioreactor cultivations, strain MG14 will also surpass reported yields of an IPTG-inducible promoter with YP/X of 0.92 and q of 0.025\u00a0g/(g h) (calculated based on data given in Jiao et al.
