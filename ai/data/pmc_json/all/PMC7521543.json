["Equal contribution", "Jinmaitong (JMT), a compound prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, has long been used as a therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). However, the neuroprotective mechanisms of JMT and its effect on gut microbiota remained unknown. Here, we examined the effects of JMT on behavior, pathomorphology and gut microbiota in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DPN rats. Compared to distilled water administration, JMT reversed decreases in mechanical withdraw threshold and intraepidermal nerve fiber density, improved neurological morphology of sciatic nerves, increased serum neuregulin 1 (NRG1) level and contactin-associated protein (Caspr)-positive paranodes, and decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation in DPN rats. More importantly, JMT enriched nine species of the gut microbiota of DPN rats, helping to prevent dysbiosis. Among these species, p_Actinobacteria, p_Proteobacteria and c_Actinobacteria were negatively correlated with DPN phenotypes and positively correlated with serum NRG1 level. These results indicate that JMT may exert a neuroprotective effect by modulating phenotype-associated gut microbiota and increasing serum NRG1 level in STZ-induced DPN rats. JMT may therefore be an effective complementary and alternative anti-DPN therapy.", "Keywords:", "Abbreviations", "Type 2 diabetes mellitus", "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy", "Neurotropin\u00ae", "Jinmaitong", "Traditional Chinese medicine", "Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry", "Peking union medical college hospital", "Streptozocin", "National institutes of health", "Linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size", "Mechanical withdraw threshold", "Phosphate buffered saline", "Paraformaldehyde", "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay", "Neuregulin 1", "Hematoxylin and eosin", "Transmission electron microscope", "Contactin-associated protein", "Amyloid precursor protein", "Beta Tubulin 3", "Intraepidermal nerve fiber density", "Protein gene product 9.5.", "Myelin basic protein", "Myelin protein zero", "Myelin-associated glycoprotein", "Insulin-like growth factor 1", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic disorder in older adults and poses a severe threat to their health [1].

Several chemical components in JMT have been reported to be able to alleviate DPN both in vivo and in vitro [15\u201318]. Besides, the flavonoids and their glycosides identified in JMT were best known as strong antioxidants and could attenuate different kinds of neuropathic pain in behavioral, physiological, and biochemical tests [19]. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that JMT improves nerve conduction velocity as well as pain and temperature sensation in DPN rats [20\u201322].

Therefore, we speculated that they may help ameliorate DPN phenotypes associated with increased NRG1 levels. Studies show that Actinobacteria also has beneficial effects in T2DM after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [50] and in obesity patients on a high-fermentable fiber diet with inulin [51]. Some reports also suggest that Actinobacteria plays an antidepressant role in inflammatory models [52] and has anti-tumor effects [53]. These researches support the beneficial role of Actinobacteria in human health.", "Based on the studies and results discussed above, we hypothesize that JMT might ameliorate DPN phenotypes by enriching Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Actinobacteria at the class level; these microbiota abundances were positively correlated with body weight, MWT, IENFD, and serum NRG1 level and negatively correlated with non-fasting blood glucose level. By promoting serum NRG1 secretion in DPN rats, these taxa restored Caspr-positive paranodal structures, and decreased amyloid precursor protein accumulation in the sciatic nerves of DPN rats. They also increased the density of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5)-positive intraepidermal nerve fibers in the plantar skin and improved MWT in the sciatic nerves, and finally ameliorated hyperpathia in DPN rats. These changes might explain the JMT-induced reversal of DPN phenotypes and provide innovative insights on the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms of JMT (Figure 9).", "Based on the studies and results discussed above, we hypothesize that JMT might ameliorate DPN phenotypes by enriching Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Actinobacteria at the class level; these microbiota abundances were positively correlated with body weight, MWT, IENFD, and serum NRG1 level and negatively correlated with non-fasting blood glucose level.

Amplicon libraries were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, US) and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, US) with paired-end reads of 250 bp. After discarding singleton reads and removing chimeras, tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units using USEARCH (v7.0.1090) at 97% similarity. A representative sequence of each operational taxonomic unit was then subjected to the taxonomy-based analysis using the RDP database. Heatmap was created using R. Cluster analysis. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were analyzed using QIIME. LEfSe was performed to identify bacterial taxa differentially represented among the groups at different taxonomy levels [58].", "Fecal samples were harvested after an overnight fast at week 12 and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Genomic DNA was extracted from each fecal sample using the E.Z.N.A.\u00ae Stool DNA Kit (OMEGA, Norcross, GA, USA) combined with bead beating according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing procedure was performed by the Realbio Genomics Institute (Shanghai, China). Extracted genomic DNA was used as the template to amplify the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes.
