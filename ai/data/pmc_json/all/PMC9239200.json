Here, we show that aminoglycosides, a well-known class of antibiotics produced by Streptomyces, are potent inhibitors of phage infection in widely divergent bacterial hosts. We demonstrate that aminoglycosides block an early step of the viral life cycle, prior to genome replication. Phage inhibition was also achieved using supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers, indicating a broad physiological significance of the antiviral properties of aminoglycosides. Strikingly, we show that acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic apramycin abolishes its antibacterial effect but retains its antiviral properties. Altogether, our study expands the knowledge of aminoglycoside functions, suggesting that aminoglycosides not only are used by their producers as toxic molecules against their bacterial competitors but also could provide protection against the threat of phage predation at the community level.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Bacteriophages are viruses that prey upon bacteria. Facing the existential threat posed by phage predation, prokaryotes have developed numerous lines of defense, which together form the prokaryotic \u201cimmune system\u201d (1). In response, phages have evolved a multitude of ways to circumvent these barriers, thereby fostering the diversification of bacterial antiviral strategies. Recent bioinformatics-guided screenings revealed a large number of previously unknown antiviral defense systems (2, 3). However, the majority of currently known prokaryotic defense systems rely on a wide range of molecular mechanisms but are mediated mainly by protein or RNA complexes (4).", "Bacteriophages are viruses that prey upon bacteria.

However, the potential antiphage role of this extensive chemical repertoire remains largely unexplored. Recently, new types of defense systems that rely on small molecules rather than on proteins or RNA have been discovered (5, 6). Anthracyclines are secondary metabolites naturally produced by Streptomyces species and were shown to inhibit infection by double-stranded-DNA (dsDNA) phages (5). These molecules act as DNA-intercalating agents and block the replication of phage\u2014but not bacterial\u2014DNA. Since these secondary metabolites are excreted by Streptomyces cells and are diffusible molecules, their production may provide broad protection against dsDNA phages at the community level.", "Environmental bacteria produce a wide range of small molecules, conferring producer cells a specific fitness advantage in competitive or predatory interactions.

The aminoglycoside streptomycin, discovered in 1943, was the first antibiotic active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (9). Strikingly, we observed strong phage inhibition in the presence of aminoglycosides when using strains resistant to the antibiotic. In agreement with this observation, decades-old reports described the inhibition of various phages by streptomycin (10\u201312). However, the biological significance of these observations was not explored, and the underlying mechanism of action remains unclear.

Brock and colleagues proposed a 2-fold inhibition of streptomycin on Enterococcus faecium, where streptomycin would be able to inhibit both genome injection and replication (12). In the same year, it was proposed that streptomycin inhibits the process of injection of these phages by preventing proper unfolding of the phage genome through cross-linking of the phage DNA (23). Recently, Jiang and colleagues reported the inhibition of two M. tuberculosis phages by streptomycin, kanamycin, and hygromycin (19). Following adsorption and quantifying of viral DNA, the authors proposed that the blockage caused by aminoglycosides occurs between genome circularization and replication. Our results put forward different pictures depending on the bacterial host. Infection with \u03bb and Alderaan phages seems to be blocked at the genome replication stage by apramycin in both cases. However, we cannot exclude some additional interference with the injection step of phage Alderaan.
