["These authors contributed equally to this work", "Abstract", "Antibacterial resistance is one of the greatest threats to human health. The development of new therapeutics against bacterial pathogens has slowed drastically since the approvals of the first antibiotics in the early and mid\u201020th century. Most of the currently investigated drug leads are modifications of approved antibacterials, many of which are derived from natural products. In this review, we highlight the challenges, advancements and current standing of the clinical and preclinical antibacterial research pipeline. Additionally, we present novel strategies for rejuvenating the discovery process and advocate for renewed and enthusiastic investment in the antibacterial discovery pipeline.", "Antibacterial resistance is one of the greatest threats to human health.

The main obstacles are as follows:\nNovel antibacterials are technically challenging to discover and optimise for systemic therapy in humans. Most synthetic chemical libraries are designed around concepts of lead\u2010 and drug\u2010likeness (Lipinski et\u00a0al,\u00a02001) with physicochemical properties predicted to afford oral bioavailability and decent hit rates for human targets.

They further improved the permeation of the drug by studying and optimising the porin permeation, while conserving the antibacterial activity (Cully,\u00a02021). This careful design led to the discovery of ETX0462, that showed promising in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo properties, good permeation and no emergence of resistance, and thus the first DBO potentially used in a monotherapy (Cully,\u00a02021; Durand\u2010Reville et\u00a0al,\u00a02021).", "Knowledge of the target\u00a0also allows the use of alternative hit\u2010finding strategies such as target\u2010directed dynamic combinatorial synthesis that led to the identification and optimisation of an MEP pathway enzyme inhibitor in E.\u00a0coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Jumde et\u00a0al,\u00a02021). The use of computational tools, such as molecular\u2010dynamics simulations (Choudhury et\u00a0al,\u00a02015; Pavlova & Gumbart,\u00a02015; Choudhury & Narahari Sastry,\u00a02019) or molecular docking brought precious insights for the rational design of new antibiotic classes. For instance, molecular dynamics can be used to elucidate the reasons for microbial resistance or poor Gram\u2010negative permeation and how to escape them (Isabella et\u00a0al,\u00a02015). Durand\u2010Reville et\u00a0al reported a new, highly potent class of diazabicyclooctane (DBO) that was designed in silico to inhibit multiple penicillin\u2010binding proteins (PBPs) and that represents the first use of structure\u2010porin permeation relationships to improve its permeation (Durand\u2010Reville et\u00a0al,\u00a02021). Chemists at Hoechst Marion Roussel had first designed DBOs as \u03b2\u2010lactam mimics that would not undergo \u03b2\u2010lactamase hydrolysis, thus restoring the antibacterial activity. However, the first compounds of this new class did not display any interesting antibacterial activities, but surprisingly inhibited \u03b2\u2010lactamases (Coleman,\u00a02011). Further development of this BLI class led to the approval of avibactam and relebactam in combination with \u03b2\u2010lactam antibiotics (Ehmann et\u00a0al,\u00a02012; Deja,\u00a02021). However, some DBOs also inhibit PBP2 and display an antibacterial activity in addition to their anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010lactamase activity (Lampilas et\u00a0al,\u00a02008; King et\u00a0al,\u00a02016; Levy et\u00a0al,\u00a02019). Nevertheless, that is not sufficient for a monotherapy due to a lack of in\u00a0vivo efficacy and high frequency of resistance. The strategy of Durand\u2010Reville et\u00a0al was to obtain a more broad\u2010spectrum derivative that would also target PBP1 and PBP3, rationally designed thanks to the use of molecular dynamics simulations (Durand\u2010Reville et\u00a0al,\u00a02021). They further improved the permeation of the drug by studying and optimising the porin permeation, while conserving the antibacterial activity (Cully,\u00a02021).
