["In this study, we isolated an endophytic Burkholderia gladioli strain, named CGB10, from sugarcane leaves. B. gladioli CGB10 displayed strong inhibitory activity against filamentous growth of fungal pathogens, one of which is Sporisorium scitamineum that causes sugarcane smut, a major disease affecting the quality and production of sugarcane in tropical and subtropical regions. CGB10 could effectively suppress sugarcane smut under field conditions, without itself causing any obvious damage or disease, thus underscoring a great potential as a biocontrol agent (BCA) for the management of sugarcane smut. A toxoflavin biosynthesis and transport gene cluster potentially responsible for such antifungal activity was identified in the CGB10 genome. Additionally, a quorum-sensing gene cluster was identified too and compared with two close Burkholderia species, thus supporting an overall connection to the regulation of toxoflavin synthesis therein. Overall, this work describes the in vitro and field Sporisorium scitamineum biocontrol by a new B. gladioli strain, and reports genes and molecular mechanisms potentially involved.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Plant pathogens cause significant economic losses every year, thus driving continuous research and development for novel and effective disease control strategies to ensure grain yield and food security. Sugarcane is an important economic crop in the South China area as well as other tropical or subtropical regions. Sugarcane smut disease caused by S. scitamineum, belonging to smut fungi, the largest group of plant pathogens, is a major constraint in sugarcane production [1]. Traditionally used fungicides face a severe challenge in maintaining the efficiency and environmental impact in controlling the major phytopathogenic fungi. Application of such fungicides has limited effect on sugarcane smut as the chemicals find it difficult to penetrate the waxy coat of the sugarcane stem, within which the dikaryotic hyphae of S. scitamineum thrive systemically prior to the development of visible disease lesions/symptoms [2]. Thus, biocontrol is a relatively safe alternative compared with traditional chemical control. Endophytes and/or phyllosphere-associated microbes are the main source of potential biocontrol agents [3,4]. Such endophytic bacteria generally colonize the intercellular spaces of plant tissues and can be isolated from all compartments of the plant host including the seeds [5]. These are usually symbiotic, parasitic, promotive, or pathogenic within the host plants. Endophytes have been reported as plant probiotics, with functions including nitrogen-fixation, yield increase, phytohormone production, biocontrol of plant diseases [6], and degradation of pollutants [6,7]. Increasing examples have been reported of endophytes functioning as biocontrol agents in disease management programs in crops [8,9,10].", "Plant pathogens cause significant economic losses every year, thus driving continuous research and development for novel and effective disease control strategies to ensure grain yield and food security.
