To protect against pathogenic bacteria, plants produce a large array of secondary metabolites, of which phenolic compounds have been widely reported as antimicrobial agents (Pasqua et\u00a0al., 2019). In response, phytopathogenic bacteria have evolved systems to deal with this rich chemical environment, including plasma membrane efflux pumps (EP) that remove toxic compounds from the cell, minimizing the pressure and facilitating survival and colonization of the host (Du et\u00a0al., 2018; Pasqua et\u00a0al., 2019). Large numbers of diverse and structurally unrelated compounds are excreted by EP, including disinfectants, dyes, organic solvents, detergents, bile acids, hormones, heavy metals, and a variety of defense active phytochemicals (Piddock, 2006; Alibert et\u00a0al., 2017).", "Plants and bacteria have coevolved for over 480 million years producing a plethora of interactions between the kingdoms.

Of these five families, the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily is found only in Gram-negative bacteria. RND transporters are composed of a tripartite complex: an inner membrane protein, periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) and an outer membrane protein (OMF). This arrangement facilitates efflux across both the inner and outer membrane, thereby conferring broad spectrum resistance to the cell (Wiggins, 2004; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2021). These transporters are usually chromosomally encoded and are expressed constitutively in wild-type cells (Lomovskaya and Watkins, 2001; Wiggins, 2004; Elnasser et\u00a0al., 2021).", "EP are commonly classified into five families based on their number of transmembrane spanning regions, energy sources and substrates.

AcrAB-TolC is composed of three essential components: Homotrimeric protein AcrB which is embedded in the inner membrane and pumps out diverse substances using a proton gradient as an energy source, TolC a homotrimeric membrane protein with long cylindrical-like structure that provides conduit across the outer membrane, and AcrA which is a periplasmic adaptor protein that connects AcrB and TolC (Vargiu et\u00a0al., 2014; Kim et\u00a0al., 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017).", "Of the multiple RND transporters, the tripartite drug efflux complexes AcrAB-TolC and MexAB-OprM from Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively, have been extensively studied (Li et\u00a0al., 2015; Venter et\u00a0al., 2015; Blanco et\u00a0al., 2016; Cacciotto et\u00a0al., 2018; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2021).

Such an example is Pectobacterium brasiliense, a Gram-negative plant-pathogen of the Pectobacteriaceae, a family of multiple genera that cause bacterial soft rot and blackleg diseases, leading to plant tissue maceration and finally wilting and collapse of the entire infected plant tissue (Lu et\u00a0al., 2021; Oulghazi et\u00a0al., 2021).

Similarly, AcrAB was shown as an essential component in conferring tolerance to apple phytoalexins in the fire blight pathogen Erwinina amylovora. Indeed, mutation in acrB significantly increased the pathogen\u2019s sensitivity and attenuated its virulence (Burse et\u00a0al., 2004).

The infection procedure was previously described (Luzzatto et\u00a0al., 2007; Yishay et\u00a0al., 2008; Joshi et\u00a0al., 2016). For the assays, fully expanded young leaves of calla lily, or small (25\u221250 g) potato tubers, were surface-sterilized by soaking in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 20 min. Then, the samples were washed twice with sterile, double-distilled H2O and air-dried under a laminar flow hood. Calla lily leaf discs 20 mm in diameter were excised and transferred to a Petri dish containing MS medium. Whole baby potato tubers cultivar \u2018Nicola\u2019 were used for the infection assay. Both the leaf discs and the potato tubers were pierced at the center with a sterile tip. Bacteria grown for 16 h, 28\u00b0C in liquid LB were diluted to 108 CFU/mL in sterile, double-distilled H2O with or without the tested compound and incubated for 2 h at 28\u00b0C on a 150-rpm incubator shaker. After 2 h, leaf discs and potato tubers were inoculated with 10 \u03bcL of bacterial suspension (106 CFU) in the presence or absence of the tested compounds. The inoculated plant material was incubated at 28\u00b0C for 15 h and 48 h for calla lily and potato tubers respectively. Disease severity was expressed as the percentage of decayed tissues relative to the total leaf disc area or for the potato tubers, and quantified as the percentage of rotten tissue based on weight. The experiments were repeated three times with 10 replicates for calla lily and 4 replicates for potato tubers.", "To assess the effects of each compound and EPIs on Pb1692 virulence, and to depict a potential synergistic effect of the different combinations on infection capability of Pb1692, the severity of disease symptoms development was assessed in two host plants, Zantedeschia aethiopica (calla lily) and Solanum tuberosum (potato).
