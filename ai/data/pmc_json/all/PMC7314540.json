In their turn, these antibiotics are regulated by bioscavengers that are selected in the course of evolution. Kinase-mediated phosphorylation represents one of the general strategies for the emergence of antibiotic resistance. A new subfamily of AmiN-like kinases, isolated from the Siberian bear microbiome, inactivates antibiotic amicoumacin by phosphorylation. The nanomolar substrate affinity defines AmiN as a phosphotransferase with a unique catalytic efficiency proximal to the diffusion limit. Crystallographic analysis and multiscale simulations revealed a catalytically perfect mechanism providing phosphorylation exclusively in the case of a closed active site that counteracts substrate promiscuity. AmiN kinase is a member of the previously unknown subfamily representing the first evidence of a specialized phosphotransferase bioscavenger.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Eons of evolution have forced living organisms to create killing agents to sufficiently eliminate the competing species. It required the extremely effective mechanisms of self-resistance to develop simultaneously, as well. These naturally evolved mechanisms are ubiquitous in all kingdoms ranging from microbes to advanced multicellular organisms. Competing with natural processes, researchers have devised artificial catalytic bioscavengers tailored by directed enzyme evolution to protect against the particularly toxic synthetic nerve agents (1\u20133). One of the most important lessons learned from the rational design and combinatorial approaches is the necessity of either of the two factors. It is either an extremely efficient binding to the substrate or a diffusion-limited catalytic efficiency of a bioscavenger to eliminate even the trace concentrations of a free toxin (4). The biodiversity of microbial communities is maintained by an intricate network of interactions between bacterial killers and the counteracting resistant bacteria competing with each other to colonize various ecological niches (5). Bacteria use the evolved antibiotic molecules to kill their competitors (6, 7). In turn, selection pressure drives the evolution of enzymes that inactivate antibiotics; thus, they may be considered as natural catalytic bioscavengers detoxifying the potent killing agents (8). In contrast to the artificially designed bioscavengers, a broader substrate specificity is usually a more beneficial vector of selection in natural microbial communities, which is well documented in aminoglycoside (9) and macrolide (10) antibiotic resistance enzymes.", "Eons of evolution have forced living organisms to create killing agents to sufficiently eliminate the competing species.

S4). Other antibiotic kinases mediating the resistance toward aminoglycosides (PDB ID: 6fuc; identity: 12%; RMSD: 3.1 \u00c5) and macrolides (PDB ID: 5igh; identity: 13%; RMSD: 4.0 \u00c5) represent low sequence identity and structural similarity. AmiN kinase does not provide the resistance to aminoglycoside, macrolide, and tetracycline antibiotics (see table S4). AmiN shares a common protein kinase domain fold (Fig. 3); moreover, structurally similar protein kinase SrkA with an unidentified natural target phosphorylates myelin basic protein (MBP) in vitro (16). Therefore, to further understand the substrate specificity toward polypeptides, we studied phosphorylation of MBP and a combinatorial peptide library using radioactively labeled ATP (17). We identified that MBP and peptides P/I/R-S-W and Y-A-S mimicking an Ami sequence could be phosphorylated with AmiN (figs. S5 and S6). However, the protein kinase activity was more than two orders of magnitude lower in comparison with Ami (fig.

The AmiN closure is induced specifically by Ami rather than ATP (fig. S7) binding. The refined crystal structure of AmiN revealed common features with phosphotransferases\u2014ATP-binding domain, Brenner\u2019s phosphotransferase motif (H200-D202-N207), and metal-binding site (Fig. 3B).

The binding of Ami in the \u03c0-box itself is unable to induce AmiN closure, while it determines its outstanding specificity toward Ami-like molecules. Instead, AmiN closure is predetermined by stabilizing of an intramolecular network of interactions (fig.

The production of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes represents the particularly important molecular fingerprint of resistant strains. Hence, the detailed atomistic description of the molecular mechanisms of the operation of antibiotic kinases is essential for targeting antibiotic resistance by specific inhibitors and antibiotic analogs protected against the respective kinases. Here, we found a unique subfamily of AmiN-like kinases with an exceptional affinity for the substrate and provided its detailed phylogenetic, structural, and functional description. The described mechanism of AmiN operation based on substrate-induced closure of the active site was observed for small-molecule kinases (22, 24\u201327). Moreover, our multiscale QM/MM simulations revealed that the homologous enzymes\u2014N-acetylhexosamine, spectinomycin, and choline kinase\u2014display an enhanced phosphotransfer in a closed conformation as a result of a better gamma phosphate positioning toward a phosphoacceptor (Fig. 6). The kinetic restriction of substrate promiscuity stems from the described substrate-driven closure mechanism in the case of small-molecule kinases, while AmiN kinase represents the prime example. The novel AmiN kinase is a member of a previously unknown subfamily that evolved to phosphorylate a distinct substrate representing the first evidence of a specialized phosphotransferase bioscavenger. AmiN was initially annotated, automatically (28) as a homoserine kinase, and we consider that the number of misclassified antibiotic resistance enzymes with unique specificities and enzymes with unusual mechanisms (29) is very extensive. This substantially challenges the precise prediction of resistomes (30). The comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary landscapes and biodiversity of antibiotic resistance enzymes along with the detailed atomistic descriptions of the resistance mechanisms will improve both the prediction of antibiotic resistance threats and the development of targeted strategies to prevent them (31).", "The global spread of antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent problems of humanity.
