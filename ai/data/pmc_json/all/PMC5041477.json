["Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) is essential for removing the DNA supercoiling generated during replication and transcription. Anticancer drugs like camptothecin (CPT) and its clinical derivatives exert their cytotoxicity by reversibly trapping Top1 in covalent complexes on the DNA (Top1cc). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) catalyses the addition of ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) onto itself and Top1. PARP inhibitors enhance the cytotoxicity of CPT in the clinical trials. However, the molecular mechanism by which PARylation regulates Top1 nuclear dynamics is not fully understood. Using live-cell imaging of enhanced green fluorescence tagged-human Top1, we show that PARP inhibitors (Veliparib, ABT-888) delocalize Top1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, which is independent of Top1\u2013PARP1 interaction. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and subsequent fitting of the data employing kinetic modelling we demonstrate that ABT-888 markedly increase CPT-induced bound/immobile fraction of Top1 (Top1cc) across the nuclear genome, suggesting Top1-PARylation counteracts CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc. We further show Trp205 and Asn722 of Top1 are critical for subnuclear dynamics. Top1 mutant (N722S) was restricted to the nucleolus in the presence of CPT due to its deficiency in the accumulation of CPT-induced Top1-PARylation and Top1cc formation. This work identifies ADP-ribose polymers as key determinant for regulating Top1 subnuclear dynamics.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Topoisomerase I (Top1) is a ubiquitous enzyme essential for the relaxation of DNA supercoiling inside cells during the process of replication, transcription and chromosomal recombination (1,2). The mechanism by which Top1 alters the DNA supercoiling involves three major steps: (i) nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the active site tyrosine (Tyr723 for human Top1) on the scissile phosphate resulting in the covalent attachment of Top1 to the 3\u2032 end of the broken strand (i.e. transient Top1\u2013DNA cleavage complex; Top1cc), (ii) DNA relaxation involving controlled free rotation and (iii) religation of the DNA strand and release of the enzyme (1,2).", "Topoisomerase I (Top1) is a ubiquitous enzyme essential for the relaxation of DNA supercoiling inside cells during the process of replication, transcription and chromosomal recombination (1,2).

In contrast, the array of conditions that significantly enhance the frequency of trapped Top1cc inside the cells are: Top1 poisons, such as camptothecin (CPT) and its clinically used derivatives (irinotecan and topotecan), as well as several non-CPT Top1 inhibitors including the indenoisoquinolines and the indolocarbazoles (3). Endogenous and carcinogenic DNA lesions can also trap Top1cc (3). Top1cc catalytic intermediates can be converted into irreversible Top1\u2013DNA cleavage complexes by colliding replication fork or transcription machinery (3,4), which trigger DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and cell death (3).", "Top1 religation rate is much faster than cleavage rate, thus, the covalent enzyme\u2013DNA complexes (Top1cc) are fleeting catalytic intermediates and normally not detectable.

The Asn722Ser mutation in the C-terminal domain of Top1 is widely available among CPT-resistant cancer cell lines and is also conserved in CPT producing plants (7\u20139). Though Asn722 is next to the catalytic Tyr723 (Figure 1A), still Top1-Asn722Ser mutation was found to be catalytically active in vitro but resistant to CPT (8). Recent studies also highlight the importance of the N-terminal domain (191\u2013206 aa) of Top1 related to in vivo activity, interaction with cofactors and CPT sensitivity (10\u201312). Precisely, Trp205 residue was suggested to control Top1 dynamics through tryptophan anchoring together with Trp203 and Trp206 on the DNA (13,14); (see the domain structure, Figure 1A), and stabilization of CPT-induced Top1cc (6,15).

Several DNA processing enzymes including Top1 are predominantly nucleolar protein and are required to relax DNA supercoils generated during rRNA synthesis (17,18). CPT-induced Top1cc has been shown to activate accumulation of antisense RNA polymerase (RNAP) II transcripts, which causes an interim block of RNAP II at the promoter and a transitory increase of R-loops particularly at the highly transcribed regions (clusters of ribosomal genes in the nucleolus) leading to transcription-dependent DSBs and genome instability (19\u201322). CPT causes delocalization of nucleolar Top1 to the nucleoplasm (23). The complex coordination of Top1 between nucleolus and nucleoplasm was previously attributed to mRNA synthesis (18), while others alternatively proposed that CPT-mediated modification of Top1 with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) may induce translocation of Top1 from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm (24,25).

PARylation is a key PTM orchestrating a variety of cellular processes including DNA repair, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, mitotic segregation, telomere homeostasis and genome maintenance (29,65). Poly(ADP)ribosylation of ribosomal proteins is essential for nucleolar structure, ribosome biogenesis (66,67), rRNA synthesis (65,68) and epigenetic upkeep of the rDNA (63). PARP1 plays a crucial role in DNA damage response by controlling the nuclear localization and biological activities of DNA repair complexes and the conservation and stability of ribosomal genes (29\u201332,65). PARP1 is a key regulator of the single-strand break repair and base excision repair pathway and are backup pathway for the non-homologous end joining double-strand break repair pathway (29,30,32). Like Top1, PARP1 is also dynamic in the nucleus, unmodified PARP1 protein molecules bind to chromatin and accumulate in the nucleoli, upon automodification with poly(ADP-ribose), PARP1 dissociates from the chromatin template and facilitates the recruitment of other chromatin factors (29,30). Consistent with the role of PARP1 activity in rRNA transcription, inhibition of transcription or RNA polymerase I activity delocalize PARP1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (69). Cells exposed to CPT results in delocalization of both Top1 (Figure 1) and PARP1 (26,28) from the nucleolus to nucleoplasm. Because CPT failed to delocalize the Top1-mutants (W205G, N722S and Y723F) from the nucleolus (Figure 1E and\u00a0F) and ABT-888 markedly accumulates Top1 in the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A and\u00a0B), therefore the phenomenon of Top1 nucleolar delocalization is coupled with PARP catalytic activity (Figure 5A). However, our data suggests that PARP1\u2013Top1 interactions (Figure 5C) do not play a role in the delocalization of Top1 from the nucleolus. This is in keeping with the previous report indicating CPT-induced nucleolar delocalization kinetics of Top1 and PARP1 are not concurrent (26,28). Thus it is plausible that activated PARP1 catalyse Top1\u2013PARylation (27,39) (Figures 5C and\u00a07D), which facilitates Top1 catalytic activity (39,40) and turnover of the rDNA synthesis, as PARP1 and Top1 complexes are readily detectable in cells (Figure 5C). Consistent with this conclusion, our FRAP data indicates that both CPT and ABT-888 failed to show accumulation of Top1N722S-bound fractions (see the FRAP quantitation in Figure 6C and Table 1; N722S) as well as redistribution from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A) due to limited CPT-induced Top1\u2013PARylation (Figure 5C). Thus, we conclude that the PARylation of Top1 not only counteracts CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc but also recruits Top1 to the active site of rDNA and rRNA synthesis.", "PARP1 is responsible for the majority of cellular PAR formation (29\u201331). PARylation is a key PTM orchestrating a variety of cellular processes including DNA repair, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, mitotic segregation, telomere homeostasis and genome maintenance (29,65). Poly(ADP)ribosylation of ribosomal proteins is essential for nucleolar structure, ribosome biogenesis (66,67), rRNA synthesis (65,68) and epigenetic upkeep of the rDNA (63). PARP1 plays a crucial role in DNA damage response by controlling the nuclear localization and biological activities of DNA repair complexes and the conservation and stability of ribosomal genes (29\u201332,65). PARP1 is a key regulator of the single-strand break repair and base excision repair pathway and are backup pathway for the non-homologous end joining double-strand break repair pathway (29,30,32). Like Top1, PARP1 is also dynamic in the nucleus, unmodified PARP1 protein molecules bind to chromatin and accumulate in the nucleoli, upon automodification with poly(ADP-ribose), PARP1 dissociates from the chromatin template and facilitates the recruitment of other chromatin factors (29,30). Consistent with the role of PARP1 activity in rRNA transcription, inhibition of transcription or RNA polymerase I activity delocalize PARP1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (69). Cells exposed to CPT results in delocalization of both Top1 (Figure 1) and PARP1 (26,28) from the nucleolus to nucleoplasm. Because CPT failed to delocalize the Top1-mutants (W205G, N722S and Y723F) from the nucleolus (Figure 1E and\u00a0F) and ABT-888 markedly accumulates Top1 in the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A and\u00a0B), therefore the phenomenon of Top1 nucleolar delocalization is coupled with PARP catalytic activity (Figure 5A).

Consistent with this conclusion, our FRAP data indicates that both CPT and ABT-888 failed to show accumulation of Top1N722S-bound fractions (see the FRAP quantitation in Figure 6C and Table 1; N722S) as well as redistribution from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A) due to limited CPT-induced Top1\u2013PARylation (Figure 5C). Thus, we conclude that the PARylation of Top1 not only counteracts CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc but also recruits Top1 to the active site of rDNA and rRNA synthesis.", "Figure 7.Schematic representation of our findings regarding the Top1 dynamics in live cells and response to combination of PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) plus CPT as established by FRAP.

The potential ability of PARP inhibitors for trapping PARP\u2013DNA complexes in addition to their NAD+-competitive catalytic inhibitory mechanism accounts for the cytotoxicity in the proliferative cells (44). PARP trapping is critical when combined with temozolomide (45), while combination with Top1 poisons (CPT) is synergistic in killing cells due to inhibition of PARP catalytic activity (32,41,44,45). The present study provides new mechanistic insights into the action of PARP inhibitors in combination with Top1 inhibitors relevant for cancer chemotherapy. Using live cell microscopy in the presence of ABT-888 [PARP inhibitor with least potential in trapping PARP\u2013DNA complex; (41,44,45)], we show delocalization of Top1 from the nucleolus which results in increased Top1 density in the nucleoplasm. PARylation of Top1 counteracts CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc. Therefore ABT-888 markedly increased CPT-induced trapping of Top1 across the nuclear genome (Figure 7), which is associated with increased cytotoxicity in the proliferating cells exposed to the combination of PARP inhibitor with Top1 inhibitor (31\u201333,41,44\u201346). Indeed, (ADP)ribose polymerase appears to act as a key molecular determinant both for Top1 nuclear dynamics (present study) as well as Top1cc repair by recruitment of PARylated\u2013TDP1\u2013PARP1 complex at Top1cc damage sites (32,35,57\u201359).
