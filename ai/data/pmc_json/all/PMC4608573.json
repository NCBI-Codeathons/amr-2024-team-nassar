Wrote the paper: AB RN MED.", "The photoactivated toxin, cercosporin, produced by Cercospora species, plays an important role in pathogenesis of this fungus to host plants. Cercosporin has almost universal toxicity to cells due to its production of reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen. For that reason, Cercospora species, which are highly resistant to their own toxin, are good candidates to identify genes for resistance to cercosporin and to the reactive oxygen species it produces. In previous research, the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 (cercosporin resistance gene 1) was found to be crucial for Cercospora species\u2019 resistance against cercosporin, and subtractive hybridization analysis identified 185 genes differentially expressed between Cercospora nicotianae wild type (wt) and a crg1 mutant. The focus of this work was to identify and characterize the hypothetical proteins that were identified in the Cercospora nicotianae subtractive library as potential resistance factors. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the 20 genes encoding hypothetical proteins showed that two, 24cF and 71cR, were induced under conditions of cercosporin toxicity, suggesting a role in resistance. Transformation and expression of 24cF and 71cR in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus, Neurospora crassa, showed that 71cR provided increased resistance to cercosporin toxicity, whereas no significant increase was observed in 24cF transformants. Gene disruption was used to generate C. nicotianae 71cR mutants; these mutants did not differ from wt C. nicotianae in cercosporin resistance or production. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed induction of other resistance genes in the 71cR mutant that may compensate for the loss of 71cR. Analysis of 71cR conserved domains and secondary and tertiary structure identify the protein as having an NTF2-like superfamily DUF1348 domain with unknown function, to be intracellular and localized in the cytosol, and to have similarities to proteins in the steroid delta-isomerase family.", "Data Availability", "All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The purpose of this work is to identify genes encoding hypothetical proteins that may play a role in resistance of Cercospora fungi to the photoactivated toxin cercosporin produced by these fungi for infection of host plants. Cercospora species cause leaf spot and blight diseases on many major crops including corn, soybean, sugar beet, and coffee, leading to significant crop losses world-wide. One of the reasons for the success of these pathogens is their production of cercosporin, a photoactivated perylenequinone toxin [1]. Mutants deficient in cercosporin production are significantly less virulent on their host plants, thus engineering cercosporin-resistant crop plants via expression of cercosporin resistance genes may be an ecologically friendly method for controlling these damaging diseases.", "The purpose of this work is to identify genes encoding hypothetical proteins that may play a role in resistance of Cercospora fungi to the photoactivated toxin cercosporin produced by these fungi for infection of host plants.

In the light, cercosporin is converted to an energetically activated triplet state, which reacts with oxygen, generating ROS including singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly toxic species of ROS. Unlike free-radical forms of ROS that are components of cellular metabolism and for which defense mechanisms are understood, cellular resistance to 1O2 is not well characterized [2], and cercosporin is toxic to mice, bacteria, and many fungi in addition to host and non-host plants. During disease development, production of 1O2 and other ROS leads to peroxidation of cell membrane lipids in host plants and can also damage nucleic acids, proteins and lipids in the target cells [1]. Cercospora fungi are immune to cercosporin toxicity, thus they may be a source of genes for engineering crop resistance [3], and also serve as a model for understanding cellular resistance to 1O2.", "Our work has focused on identifying cercosporin-autoresistance genes from Cercospora species, as cercosporin is almost universally toxic to cells due to its production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2].

To identify putative resistance genes, a subtractive cDNA library was generated between the C. nicotianae wild type and a crg1 mutant [7]. From the library, 185 differentially regulated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found that are candidate resistance genes. The ESTs were classified into functional categories based on their homology to known sequences. These functional categories include ones known to be involved in cercosporin resistance including reductases [8], antioxidants and quenchers of ROS [9], and membrane transporters [10\u201313]. Several of the library genes have been characterized for their role in cercosporin resistance. For example, two genes encoding transporters in the library, CnATR1 and CnCFP, were determined to have an important role in resistance [10,12] as disruption of either of these genes in Cercospora species caused the disruptant strains to be sensitive to cercosporin. In addition, tobacco transformed to express CFP showed significantly reduced lesion size after inoculation with C. nicotianae, confirming a role in resistance and suggesting that CFP might be useful for engineering plants for disease resistance [14]. In the case of ROS quenchers, vitamin B6 was shown to quench 1O2 and be involved in defense against cercosporin [9,15]. Studies to engineer tobacco to constitutively express C. nicotianae B6 biosynthetic genes (PDX1 and PDX2), however, resulted in no statistically significant increase in levels of the B6 vitamers, due to heavy regulation of these genes in plants [16]. Although antioxidants have been implicated in cercosporin resistance [2], a recent study of a gene encoding glutathione S-transferase from the library failed to demonstrate a link with cercosporin resistance [17].", "Characterization of C. nicotianae mutants selected for sensitivity to cercosporin [4,5] led to the discovery of the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 (cercosporin resistance gene 1) [6] required for autoresistance to cercosporin.

Under the conditions of our cercosporin-sensitivity assay, growth of wt N. crassa is inhibited by about 70% whereas growth of the resistant C. nicotianae is inhibited by about 40%. No significant increase in resistance was seen in any of the 24cF transformants tested, however significant increases in cercosporin resistance were found in some 71cR transformants, with inhibition as low as 20%. Resistance of the 71cR transformants varied, with some showing no increase. This variation might be explained by the random integration of the insert and different levels of transgene transcripts [43]. To confirm that the resistance seen in 71cR transformants was due to the transgene, expression of the 71cR transgene was tested from randomly picked transformants, two that showed significant resistance and two that did not. The results showed that transformants that showed increased resistance had high expression of the gene compared to the expression of the gene in the transformants that did not have increased resistance. Thus for 71cR transformants, expression of cercosporin resistance correlated with 71cR gene expression. For 24cF, each of the transformants assayed had high levels of expression without imparting increases in resistance.

The protein is predicted to form a dimer. Solvent Accessibility prediction [35] shows several ligand binding regions and predicted localization in the cytosol. With this information, the 71cR protein was predicted to have an enzymatically active group as it is intracellular. Furthermore, the Raptor server predicted that 71cR binds steroids (pocket multiplicity of 74), and predicted amino acid residues that would be important for ligand binding. We confirmed that most of the predicted ligand binding sites are conserved throughout the close orthologs of 71cR.", "Further analysis of tertiary structure was done using the Dali server [36]. Using Dali, the 71cR protein aligned closely with steroid delta-isomerase proteins. Steroid delta-isomerase proteins are common in diverse organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. They catalyze the isomerization of steroids by transferring protons in a two-step reaction [50], and are involved in both steroid biosynthesis [51] and steroid degradation pathways [52]. Although this was the closest association, z values were not high enough to conclude with confidence that 71cR is a steroid delta-isomerase, and it may catalyze a different reaction. We hypothesized that 71cR may impart resistance by degrading or altering the structure of the polyketide cercosporin molecule, but were unable to obtain evidence to support this hypothesis. It is interesting that so many fungi have orthologs to 71cR as most of these are not known to produce photoactivated perylenequinones or to be resistant to such compounds. It is possible that the enzymes, although all having DUF1348 domains, are very different. Alternatively, it is possible that they carry out similar reactions, but that the substrates are different in different species. Further research will be required to characterize the specific function of the 71cR protein as well as orthologs in other fungal species.", "Further analysis of tertiary structure was done using the Dali server [36].

C. nicotianae disruption mutants are not more sensitive to cercosporin than wt, but other genes previously documented to play a role in resistance are up-regulated in these mutants upon exposure to cercosporin toxicity, suggesting that the fungus compensates for loss of resistance genes by up-regulation of other resistance mechanisms. Analysis of 71cR sequence, phylogeny, conserved domains, and secondary and tertiary structure identify the protein as having an NTF2-like superfamily domain with unknown function, to be intracellular, localized in the cytosol, to have enzymatic activity, and to have similarities to steroid delta-isomerase proteins.
