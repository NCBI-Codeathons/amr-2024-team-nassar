["These authors contributed equally to this work.", "Large-scale genome-mining analyses have identified an enormous number of cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) as a great source of novel bioactive natural products. Given the sheer number of natural product (NP) candidates, effective strategies and computational methods are keys to choosing appropriate BGCs for further NP characterization and production. This review discusses genomics-based approaches for prioritizing candidate BGCs extracted from large-scale genomic data, by highlighting studies that have successfully produced compounds with high chemical novelty, novel biosynthesis pathway, and potent bioactivities. We group these studies based on their BGC-prioritization logics: detecting presence of resistance genes, use of phylogenomics analysis as a guide, and targeting for specific chemical structures. We also briefly comment on the different bioinformatics tools used in the field and examine practical considerations when employing a large-scale genome mining study.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Natural products (NPs), which are produced by bacteria, plants, fungi, animals, and other living cells, have been an inspiration for pharmaceutics and other biological agents such as herbicides and insecticides. In theory, NPs are structurally optimized to interact with biological targets after several hundred millennia of evolution [1] and, therefore, have a higher chance of being bioavailable than traditional small molecule drugs [2]. NPs are often categorized into primary and secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites include nutrients and building blocks for cellular maintenance, whereas secondary metabolites endow their producers with selective advantages in ecological niches and help them survive under dynamic environments [3]. For instance, some secondary metabolites function as antibiotics, pigments, and growth hormones [4]. Thus, secondary metabolite NPs have been targeted as novel drug leads with potent bioactivities, with more than 30% of approved small molecule drugs being bacterial secondary metabolites [5].", "Natural products (NPs), which are produced by bacteria, plants, fungi, animals, and other living cells, have been an inspiration for pharmaceutics and other biological agents such as herbicides and insecticides.

For bacterial and fungal secondary metabolites that had their genetic basis elucidated, the genes encoding such enzymes tended to cluster close together in the genome. These clusters are termed biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [6]. Other relevant genes, such as those involved in the regulation, transport, and resistance to the self-produced compounds, can be found in or alongside the BGCs [7]. Biosynthesis enzymes of secondary metabolites have been extensively studied because of the unprecedented chemical transformations they can catalyze in different compound scaffolds [8]. Bacterial secondary metabolites can be classified according to their chemical scaffolds and signature biosynthesis enzymes that synthesize their core structures. Classes of secondary metabolites include polyketides, peptide-derived NPs, isoprenoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, nucleotide-based NPs, phenylpropanoids, and glycosylated NPs [9], which can be further divided into subclasses according to their additional features or chemical modifications.", "The synthesis of these compounds is catalyzed by enzymes.

In this approach, the NP production occurs chronologically as follows: isolation of microorganism(s) of interest, culturing the microbe(s) under different conditions to induce NP production, and purification of desired products through chemical extraction. To test the presence of NPs with desirable bioactivities, bioassays are conducted on bacterial culture, extracted fractions, or purified products to study their effects on various organisms or human disease models, a process known as bioactivity-guided screening [10]. This traditional NP discovery pipeline does not require prior knowledge of a producer\u2019s genome nor its biosynthesis capability, and, thus, it is termed the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach [11]. Although the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach has facilitated the discovery of numerous therapeutic NPs, it suffers from several pitfalls. For instance, it leads to the re-isolation or rediscovery of known compounds produced by different bacterial species, because multiple species can produce the same NP [12,13]. Moreover, some secondary metabolites are difficult to be detected, purified, and examined through bioassays because they are produced at trace concentrations. Cultivation under laboratory conditions may not provide all the environmental stimuli required to produce the desired secondary metabolites.

Genes that have undergone duplication can be identified by constructing a core genome that is conserved throughout a bacterial taxon and searching the individual pangenomes for additional gene copies, suggesting a gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer event. In a study by Tang et al. [44], they probed Salinispora genomes for duplicated housekeeping genes. They did this by identifying all the conserved orthologous groups (OGs) of protein-coding genes in Salinispora, and identified those that were shared among all strains to form the \u2018core genome\u2019. The OGs were grouped into clusters (COGs) to denote their general biological function. With a list of COGs and their hypothetical general functions, they then searched the pangenomes for additional OGs that allegedly had the same function as the OGs in the core genome, which could be duplicated OGs. Their pipeline correctly detected the presence of a duplicated 20S proteasome \u03b2-subunit present in the salinosporamide BGC, showing that their method was viable. Although duplication was detected in multiple COGs in their probing of Salinispora, they focused on a COG assigned to lipid transport and metabolism. The bacterial fatty acid synthase, in particular, was deemed favorable, as it displayed significant structural differences to its equivalent in mammals, implying low cytotoxicity of the produced compound. They discovered thiolactomycins and thiotetroamides by identifying a hybrid PKS-NRPS BGC that contained a duplicated fatty acid synthase gene. Indeed, the observed antibiotic activities of these families of compounds were owed to fatty acid synthase inhibition [44]. Something to be taken into consideration before using gene duplication phenomenon for NP target discovery, however, is that gene duplication events do not guarantee duplicated genes with new functions, because they may only serve metabolic redundancy and are not recruited to secondary metabolism pathways [71].", "A phenomenon that is suggested to confer self-resistance is gene duplication, as it increases the number of the antibiotic target, thereby freeing up evolutionary pressure to allow the target to mutate into a resistant form.

They did this by identifying all the conserved orthologous groups (OGs) of protein-coding genes in Salinispora, and identified those that were shared among all strains to form the \u2018core genome\u2019. The OGs were grouped into clusters (COGs) to denote their general biological function. With a list of COGs and their hypothetical general functions, they then searched the pangenomes for additional OGs that allegedly had the same function as the OGs in the core genome, which could be duplicated OGs. Their pipeline correctly detected the presence of a duplicated 20S proteasome \u03b2-subunit present in the salinosporamide BGC, showing that their method was viable. Although duplication was detected in multiple COGs in their probing of Salinispora, they focused on a COG assigned to lipid transport and metabolism. The bacterial fatty acid synthase, in particular, was deemed favorable, as it displayed significant structural differences to its equivalent in mammals, implying low cytotoxicity of the produced compound. They discovered thiolactomycins and thiotetroamides by identifying a hybrid PKS-NRPS BGC that contained a duplicated fatty acid synthase gene. Indeed, the observed antibiotic activities of these families of compounds were owed to fatty acid synthase inhibition [44]. Something to be taken into consideration before using gene duplication phenomenon for NP target discovery, however, is that gene duplication events do not guarantee duplicated genes with new functions, because they may only serve metabolic redundancy and are not recruited to secondary metabolism pathways [71].", "Although enzymes that were previously confirmed as resistance determinants provide a good starting point for a resistance-gene-guided genome-mining study, our study and that of Tang et al. showed that determining a specific resistant determinant beforehand is not necessary [44,45]. We can exploit the logic behind resistance mechanisms, instead of focusing on a known resistance gene, to discover new compounds and resistance mechanisms. Still, inspiration can be drawn from BGCs confirmed to contain resistance-related genes [7], or from compounds with an unknown biosynthesis pathway but with an established mode of action. Enzymes involved in their mode of action can be targeted and possibly be co-localized with a novel producing BGC. Resistance-gene databases, such as The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database [72] and Resfams [73], can be used to identify targets for genome mining. Prioritizing candidate BGCs associated with resistance determinants is also advantageous, as compounds identified with this pipeline are more likely to display bioactivities because their mode of action is hypothesized through the biological function of the resistance genes.", "Although enzymes that were previously confirmed as resistance determinants provide a good starting point for a resistance-gene-guided genome-mining study, our study and that of Tang et al. showed that determining a specific resistant determinant beforehand is not necessary [44,45].

To date, ARTS-DB contains putative resistance genes identified through ARTS from more than 70,000 genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes [107]. For phylogenomics-guided genome mining, EvoMining is a tool that allows users to visualize expansion and recruitment events in enzyme families through phylogenetic reconstruction. Users can use their own enzyme, genome, and BGC databases. However, pre-computed databases are also available [71]. The accessibility of different NP genome-mining-specific databases and the availability of the different pipelines to study large-scale BGC data contribute greatly to the performance of global-genome-mining studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as deep neural networks, can offer new perspectives in data mining [108,109].", "Databases specific to different modes of genome mining have also become available.

One common hurdle, again due to the size of the data, is difficulties in detecting the novel compound. The automation of RiPP detection by computationally predicting possible NP structures and fragments has been attempted. This is achieved by generating a library of possible MS spectra of the desired RiPP, from which MS peaks of bacterial culture can be matched to. In a prior-mentioned 2016 study by Skinnider et al. [62], the team conducted gene-guided prediction of their candidate compound\u2019s structure, which allowed them to automate the LC\u2013MS/MS peak searching process by using ion mass predictions based on the predicted structure. Other examples of automated RiPP detection efforts are RiPPquest, pep2path, and pepSAVI-MS [110,111,112]. Automated peptide matching is commonly used in proteomics [113], illustrating how existing methods can be applied to the global genome mining of NPs when being optimized for increased speed, reduced computational load, and high effectiveness.", "Besides the genome-mining process, automating other parts of the NP discovery pipeline will make global studies more viable.

One solution is to synthesize the bioinformatically predicted peptide artificially [114,115]. In RiPP discovery, the promiscuity of tailoring enzymes has been exploited to catalyze chemical transformations on novel precursor peptides, pairing well-expressed tailoring enzymes from characterized BGCs with the novel precursor peptides of interest. This hybrid strategy has been successful in both in vivo and in vitro expression: for in vivo expression, hybrid BGCs containing genes from different BGCs are constructed and expressed [66]; and for in vitro production, the final product is synthesized by in vitro reactions, using purified enzymes [116]. The genetic cloning process for BGCs is another part of the pipeline that can be tackled. After selecting specific BGCs and biosynthesis enzyme genes through global genome mining, the gene can be artificially synthesized. This can bypass the efforts in obtaining and isolating the source microbial strain and enable immediate heterologous expression that simplifies the validation of their biochemical functions. This is particularly useful for sequences derived from metagenome assemblies without strain isolation, as well as for sequences of less-studied bacterial taxa where codon optimization for heterologous expression is being considered.", "The age-old bottleneck in the NP discovery pipeline of producing and extracting the NP from bacterial culture has led to the development of various alternative avenues to overcome it.

For example, thermophilic bacteria may produce more thermostable target peptides or proteins, and, thus, multiple laboratories have prioritized candidate BGCs from thermophilic bacteria, which were achieved through a filtering step post-mining [116,117,118] or only mining from thermophilic bacteria [119]. In addition, candidate BGCs are frequently selected from bacterial strains or organisms that are little-known to avoid NP rediscovery. On the other hand, bacteria that are well-known to be rich natural product producers [86], or bacterial families known to produce a particular type of NP [54], are often the targets for more intensive mining. Well-known taxa which enjoy well-established genetic engineering tools are also favorable for downstream work. One can even combine these two principles in selecting rare and conventional bacteria, as illustrated by Chevrette et al.
