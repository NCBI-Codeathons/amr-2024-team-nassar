["", "Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases.\nUnfortunately, the development of antibiotic resistance threatens\nour current therapeutic arsenal, which has necessitated the discovery\nand development of novel antibiotics against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Cyclomarin\nA and rufomycin I are structurally related cyclic heptapeptides assembled\nby nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which show potent anti-Mtb activity with a new cellular target, the caseinolytic\nprotein ClpC1. An NRPS adenylation domain survey using DNA extracted\nfrom \u223c2000 ecologically diverse soils found low cyclomarin/rufomycin\nbiosynthetic diversity. In this survey, a family of cyclomarin/rufomycin-like\nbiosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) that encode metamarin, an uncommon\ncyclomarin congener with potent activity against both Mtb H37Rv and multidrug-resistant Mtb clinical isolates\nwas identified. Metamarin effectively inhibits Mtb growth in murine macrophages and increases the activities of ClpC1\nATPase and the associated ClpC1/P1/P2 protease complex, thus causing\ncell death by uncontrolled protein degradation.", "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a\nmajor public health threat and is recognized by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) as the leading infectious disease killer worldwide.1 The continued emergence of multidrug-resistant\nand extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has made the prevention and treatment of\nTB very challenging.2 The discovery and\ndevelopment of anti-Mtb drugs with new cellular targets\nis therefore a high priority. Cyclomarin A and rufomycin I (ilamycin\nC1) are chemically similar cyclic heptapeptide antibiotics3\u22126 (Figure 1a) that\nare highly potent (nanomolar MIC) against multidrug-resistant Mtb as well as other pathogenic nontuberculosis mycobacteria.7,8 They have been of particular interest for the development of TB\ntherapeutics as they have a novel mode of action by targeting cellular\nproteostasis via the protease regulatory chaperone ATPase (ClpC1).7\u221210 The biosynthesis of the cyclic peptide scaffolds for cyclomarin\nA and rufomycin I follow the colinear extension model of modular NRPS\nsystems.11\u221213 The biosynthesis of cyclomarin A involves a heptamodular\nNRPS that directly incorporates the nonproteinogenic amino acids N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)-Trp (prenylated-Trp, p-Trp) and\n3-amino-3,5-dimethyl-4-hexenoic acid (ADH) into the growing peptide.\nIn contrast the \u03b2-hydroxy, \u03b4-hydroxy and \u03b2-methoxy\nsubstituents seen on p-Trp1, Leu2 and Phe4 (respectively) are thought to be installed while the proteinogenic\nsubstrates are tethered to their PCPs.11 In rufomycin, the heptamodular NRPS uses three nonproteinogenic\namino acids p-Trp, 3-nitro-l-Tyr and L-2-amino-4-hexenoic\nacid (AHA). The l-Leu residue incorporated at the seventh\nposition of the peptide undergoes post-NRPS cyclization with the amide\nof neighboring l-Leu to generate the 6-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-amino-2-piperidinone\nmoiety.12,13 It should be noted that while ADH of cyclomarin\nA and AHA of rufomycin I bear a structural resemblance to one another\nand occur at analogous positions in the two peptides, they represent\nconvergent biosyntheses involving homologation of a valine-derived\nisobutyraldehyde with pyruvate (cyclomarin A) and a trimodular polyketide\nsynthase assembly line (rufomycin I).11\u221213", "Figure 1Sequence tag-based screen of cyclomarin/rufomycin-like BGCs. a)\nThe structures and BGCs of cyclomarin A and rufomycin I. b) Phylogenetic\ntree of all A-domains from cyclomarin A and rufomycin I BGCs. p-Trp,\nADH and AHA represent N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)Trp,\n3-amino-3,5-dimethyl-4-hexenoic acid and 2-amino-4-hexenoic acid,\nrespectively. c) Pipeline for the discovery of cyclomarin/rufomycin\ncongeners from the soil metagenome. eDNA isolated from \u223c2000\nunique soils was screened by PCR using universal A-domain degenerate\nprimers.
