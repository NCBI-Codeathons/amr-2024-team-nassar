Here we describe work that enhances the utility of UniProtKB as a support for both the study of natural products and for their discovery. The foundation of this work is an improved representation of natural product metabolism in UniProtKB using Rhea, an expert-curated knowledgebase of biochemical reactions, that is built on the ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology of small molecules. Knowledge of natural products and precursors is captured in ChEBI, enzyme-catalyzed reactions in Rhea, and enzymes in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, thereby linking chemical structure data directly to protein knowledge. We provide a practical demonstration of how users can search UniProtKB for protein knowledge relevant to natural products through interactive or programmatic queries using metabolite names and synonyms, chemical identifiers, chemical classes, and chemical structures and show how to federate UniProtKB with other data and knowledge resources and tools using semantic web technologies such as RDF and SPARQL. All UniProtKB data are freely available for download in a broad range of formats for users to further mine or exploit as an annotation source, to enrich other natural product datasets and databases.", "1.

The actual compound similarity search (sachem:similaritySearch) is performed by the IDSM endpoint, which returns ChEBI compounds identical or similar to patulin to the Rhea endpoint. The Rhea endpoint then assembles a list of matching reactions and passes this list back to the UniProt endpoint, which finally maps the reactions to all possible enzymes and creates the desired result set of cognate chemicals, reactions, and enzymes. The results are available at tinyurl.com/sparql-uniprot.", "Examples of queries on www.uniprot.org and the corresponding URLs (that can be bookmarked for future reference).", "Query on UniProtKB URL.", "patulin, by name uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=patulin.", "patulin, by structure (using the first two blocks of the InChIKey) uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=inchikey:ZRWPUFFVAOMMNM-UHFFFAOYSA.", "patulin, by chemical identifier (CHEBI:74926) uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=%09CHEBI%3A74926.", "all members of the class gamma lactone, by chemical identifier (CHEBI:37581) uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=CHEBI%3A37581.", "fungal oxidoreductases proven to metabolize malonyl-CoA and linked to protein structure data of any type in the Protein Data Bank www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=annotation%3A%28type%3A%22catalytic+activity%22+inchikey%3ALTYOQGRJFJAKNA-DVVLENMVSA%29+taxonomy%3A%22Fungi+%289FUNG%29+%5B4751%5D%22+goa%3A%28%22oxidoreductase+activity+%5B16491%5D%22%29+reviewed%3Ayes+database%3A%28type%3Apdb%29."]
