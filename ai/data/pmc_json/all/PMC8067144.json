Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria.

Bacteriocin Overview", "2. Bacteriocin Overview", "Bacteriocins are a diverse group of antimicrobial cationic and hydrophobic peptides composed of 20\u201360 amino acids. The ribosomal machinery is responsible for the synthesis of bacteriocins. Several genes are implicated in modifying amino acids, the export and regulation of the bacteriocin, and self-immunity proteins [16,17,18]. Bacteriocin encoding genes are organized into operons located in the chromosome, plasmids, or other mobile genetic elements. In general, these operons are inducible and require secretion and extracellular accumulation of bacterial peptides for induction [19,20]. Bacteriocins are extracellularly released and can have bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects on species closely related to the producing strain or affect other genera, phylum, or even domain [21,22].", "Bacteriocins are a diverse group of antimicrobial cationic and hydrophobic peptides composed of 20\u201360 amino acids.

An important advantage of bacteriocins is that they can have activity against pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria, including multidrug-resistant species, without discriminating between antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains [26].

Nisin was the first antimicrobial agent in reaching the category of food-safe additive in 1969. The use of nisin is, at present, licensed in more than 50 countries [61]. The United States granted the Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) designation by the FDA [50]. Researchers have shown that the antimicrobial action of nisin can extend to non-food-related bacteria. Thus, nisin has been included in clinical studies to prevent the formation of dentobacterial plaque and gingivitis in dogs, with an effect comparable to chlorhexidine [62,63]. An advantage of its use is the stability to remain active and express a synergistic action among a series of topical delivery systems: mouthwash, toothpaste, and guar-gum biogel [62,63]. In dogs, diverse oral bacteria species form a polymicrobial biofilm in the tooth surface, developing periodontal disease (PD) [64]. Enterococcus faecalis is the main bacteria in the oral cavity of dogs involved in PD, and it shows resistance to different antibiotics [65]. Further, E. faecalis leads to adherence and aggregation of other pathogen bacteria, all of them forming the biofilm of PD [66]. Pet animals have been considered reservoirs of this species of potentially pathogenic bacteria that is potentially harmful to high-risk individuals [67,68,69]. Nisin shows broad bactericidal action in vitro against reference strains of E. faecalis and other bacteria involved in canine PD. The combination of nisin\u2013biogel inhibits and eradicates canine PD multispecies biofilms tested in a model of co-aggregate bacteria in vitro with E. faecalis, Neisseria\nzoodegmatis, Corynebacterium canis, Porphyromonas cangingivalis, and Peptostreptococcus canis [66]. Prolonged nisin use in oral canine cleaning does not have the negative effects that chlorhexidine exhibits, such as taste loss or pigmentation of the enamel [70,71,72]. Enterococcus faecium is another bacterium implicated in PD disease; it is considered a zoonotic opportunist, and it is also the most abundantly isolated from the feces of healthy dogs [73].

Nisin has been used as a treatment in bovine mastitis caused by complex bacterial: Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. [76,77]. The main advantage is that nisin only remained in the milk for 12 h after its application in concentrations that did not generate any risk in consuming the product, aside from avoiding bacterial resistance [78,79]. Due to this, the FDA approved a nisin-based udder disinfectant [33]. In addition, nanoparticles to which nisin was included have shown a bactericidal effect against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus spp. isolated from bovine mastitis and methicillin-resistant S. aureus [80,81]. Some species of S. aureus produce biofilm, a virulence factor that favors the establishment of infection in the udder and interferes with antibiotics [82]. A study demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of nisin on biofilm-producing S. aureus cultures. Furthermore, it penetrates the biofilm matrix, which leads to the detachment of the biofilm. Likewise, the combination of nisin and lysostaphin resulted in synergy against Staphylococcus spp. biofilm [83]. Nisin alters the biofilm\u2019s architecture and composition, reducing the polysaccharides that constitute the biofilm of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis without affecting the integrity of the proteins. In addition, nisin reduced the extracellular DNA in S. aureus biofilm, but this effect was not observed in the S. epidermidis biofilm [84]. In pig production, there are opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus and Escherichia coli species. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a zoonotic pathogenic that causes great economic losses in the pig industry. The co-administration of nisin with conventional antibiotics for treating swine Streptococcus infection can decrease antibiotic resistance. This bacteriocin elicits the bacterial membrane permeability to facilitate the antibiotic to reach the target [85]. In addition, nisin can cross the capsule of S. suis, degrade biofilm, and kill the bacteria. In mice infected by S. suis, nisin reduced bacterial load and avoided bacterial systemic dissemination [86]. Nisin V, a variant of nisin (bioengineering synthesized), showed enhanced potency against L. monocytogenes in vivo. Nisin V decreased the load of Listeria monocytogenes in the liver and spleen of mice experimentally infected [87]. Avirulent strains of S. suis serotype 2 (isolated from the tonsils of healthy pigs) produce bacteriocins suicin 90\u20131330, suicin 65, and suicin 3908. These antimicrobial peptides have an antibacterial effect on virulent S. suis, including bacteria resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline. Interestingly, structure amino acid sequences within these suicins have little similarity to each other (<25%) [88,89,90]. A recombinant suicin has shown inhibitory activity against Gram-positive strains [91]. Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes diarrhea in piglets. The use of colistin (polymyxin E) has led to the development of a resistant strain [92,93,94]. The combination of nisin or enterocin DD14 with colistin showed a synergistic effect against colistin-resistant E. coli strains isolated from pigs. This effect is because the loss of membrane stability induced by interacting colistin with LPS allows the entry of bacteriocins to damage the cell wall [95]. In horses, enterocin M in the diet reduced undesirable Gram-negative bacteria: coliforms, Campylobacter, and Clostridium spp. No physiological parameter was altered by the administration of enterocin M in horses [96]. Nisin added to water in weaned rabbits decreases harmful intestinal microbiota: Staphylococcus coagulase-positive, coliforms, Pseudomonas, and Clostridiae. Rabbits with nisin treatment increased their body weight average, and meat quality was not affected [97,98]. A partially purified bacteriocin PPB CCM7420, isolated from E. faecium, showed a significant reduction of parasite Eimeria spp. oocysts in rabbits [98].", "New alternatives in livestock are being sought to replace antibiotics and diminish bacteria resistant to them.

The use of colistin (polymyxin E) has led to the development of a resistant strain [92,93,94]. The combination of nisin or enterocin DD14 with colistin showed a synergistic effect against colistin-resistant E. coli strains isolated from pigs. This effect is because the loss of membrane stability induced by interacting colistin with LPS allows the entry of bacteriocins to damage the cell wall [95]. In horses, enterocin M in the diet reduced undesirable Gram-negative bacteria: coliforms, Campylobacter, and Clostridium spp. No physiological parameter was altered by the administration of enterocin M in horses [96]. Nisin added to water in weaned rabbits decreases harmful intestinal microbiota: Staphylococcus coagulase-positive, coliforms, Pseudomonas, and Clostridiae. Rabbits with nisin treatment increased their body weight average, and meat quality was not affected [97,98]. A partially purified bacteriocin PPB CCM7420, isolated from E. faecium, showed a significant reduction of parasite Eimeria spp. oocysts in rabbits [98].", "Some types of nisin are effective against aquaculture pathogens.

Plantaricin (isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum F1) was proposed as a viable alternative to replacing the use of antibiotics against colibacillosis in broiler chickens [113]. Plantaricin CLP29 and enterocin CLE34, partially purified, have wide antibacterial activity against Salmonella pullorum and E. coli [114]. The discovery of new bacteriocins for application in poultry has been made in the microbiota of the domestic broiler chicken\u2019s gastrointestinal tract. The bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa NRRL B-30509 was isolated from domestic Russian broiler chickens, producing the bacteriocin paenicidin A, which has activity against Campylobacter jejuni [115]. Another bacteriocin with potential use in poultry is pediocin A (isolated from Pediococcus pentaceus FBB61) [116]. The antimicrobial activity has been reported against Gram-positive bacteria, such as L. monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens type A [117]. In broilers infected by C. perfringens type A (producer of NetB toxin) involved in necrotic enteritis, Pediocin A was administered in food. The treatment improved the growth performance of the chickens. However, it did not decrease the bacterial load [118]. Microencapsulation of bacteriocin could prevent the inactivation of bacteriocin, due to digestive processes in broilers [119]. The combination of bacteriocins divercin AS7 and nisin as an additive in the diet of broilers has been shown to improve body weight gain [120,121]. Divercin AS7 and nisin showed bactericidal activity similar to salinomycin (ionophore coccidiostat) [121]. Nisin has antimicrobial action on microbiota related to the detriment of productivity in broiler chickens, similar to monensin ionophore.

The Probiotic Activity of LAB Bacteriocins", "6. The Probiotic Activity of LAB Bacteriocins", "Oral administration of purified or semipurified bacteriocins has been shown to have limitations. Digestive enzymes can degrade bacteriocins, and bacteriocins can adhere to food particles or diffuse through digestion, among others [126]. The protection of bacteriocins in capsules or nanocapsules can be an alternative to prevent enzymatic degradation and avoid various doses and high concentrations of bacteriocins [127]. Thus, the most efficient method for taking advantage of bacteriocins in the digestive tract includes bacteriocin-producing LAB as probiotics. This strategy favors the colonization of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, and bacteriocins can be produced in situ [128]. There are multiple benefits of using LAB in place of antibiotics or growth promoters. These include modulation of microbiota, improving the intestinal barrier function and digestion, preventing the colonization of enteric pathogens, and stimulating the immune system [15,129,130,131]. However, studies showed that E. faecium LMG 30881, a producer of enterocin B in the canine diet, caused unfavorable effects, such as runny stools, higher Gram-negative bacterial counts, and lower hemoglobin concentrations [132,133]. The use of bacteriocin-producing LAB probiotic in dogs requires more research, since no further work has been generated in this regard to date. In healthy pigs, it has been shown that some LAB of the gastrointestinal tract prevents villous atrophy of the post-weaning stage, promotes the maturation of gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue, and has immunomodulatory activity. Oral administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius B1 (isolated from healthy piglets) in newborn piglets showed that the probiotic bacteria colonized the duodenal mucosa and increased the height of the villi, which improved absorption and promoted the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Interestingly, L. salivarius increased the expression of porcine beta-defensin 2 (pBD-2), an antimicrobial peptide produced by host cells. Continuous probiotic administration caused a considerable increase in the production of pBD-2, which could even be detected in the saliva of piglets [134]. In the duodenum and ileum, the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, plasma cells that produce IgA, and the synthesis of Toll-Like Receptor-2 (TLR-2) increased. In the ileum, interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that promotes the differentiation and proliferation of B lymphocytes, was increased [130]. These studies suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of L. salivarius B1 are due to bacteriocins [135]. L. salivarius UCC118 (isolated from the human intestinal microbiota) produces the bacteriocin Abp118. This antimicrobial peptide has been shown to have activity against L. monocytogenes [136,137]. L. salivarius UCC 118, as a probiotic added to the diet of pigs after weaning, showed that LAB colonized the ileum and caused a significant decrease in spirochetes (Treponema), considered to be opportunistic pathogens of pigs [138]. Rustic or native animals on farms can be a natural source of bacteriocins-producing probiotics. A study has shown that miniature piglets from Congjiang (a breed of pig native to China) had higher resistance to stress-induced diarrhea during early weaning due to gut microbiota. In the feces of miniature piglets, a higher population of Lactobacillus gasseri LA39 and Lactobacillus frumenti, producers of the bacteriocin gassericin, was found. This study also demonstrated an increase in the signaling pathway involved in protein expression (NHE3, SLC5A1, DRA, and PAT1) associated with intestinal absorption. Gassericin decreased the expression of proteins related to intestinal secretion (NKCC1, CFTR, CaCC1). These bacteria could be transplanted into commercial crossbred piglets before weaning and prevent diarrhea after weaning. This study provides a strategy for the possible prevention of diarrhea in pigs and even other mammals [139]. There are reports of more than 30 LAB as probiotics that inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms in birds; however, their mode of action remain poorly understood [140,141,142]. LAB as probiotics in poultry has been used to control experimental coccidial infection, endemic in the commercial broiler industry. Studies on the inclusion of multispecies probiotics (E. faecium, Bifidobacterium animalis, and L. salivarius) in food or water have shown that the colonization of LAB in the intestine causes a coccidiostatic effect on Eimeria spp. In addition, the probiotic prevented intestinal damage without affecting body weight gain values. On the other hand, there were high probiotic LAB amounts in intestinal microbiota, while coliform and C. perfringens were lower than the control group [143]. The multispecies probiotic for commercial use can be integrated into chicken microbiota early in ovo and for one day of hatching. These bacteria increased protection against Eimeria spp. and commercial vaccine-administered response, at the same time [144,145].

The lantibiotic nisin is the oldest and most widely used bacteriocin in the food industry [148]. Nisin has shown that its administration in the diet for short periods increases CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (LT) and reduces the lymphocytes B (LB) levels in the blood. Its consumption in prolonged period results in return to normal LT levels, the maintained decrease in LB, and the count increase of macrophages/monocytes [149].

In LPS-stimulated PBMC, nisin inhibits the synthesis of TNF-\u03b1, thereby decreasing the inflammatory response [154]. In porcine PBMC infected by E. coli, nisin decreased the inflammatory response, mainly the production of IL-6 [150]. This anti-inflammatory effect is reproduced in bovine mammary gland epithelial cells by promoting a negative regulation in the production of TNF-\u03b1, which benefits the recovery of intramammary tissue. Endometritis represents a frequent health problem in the first three weeks postpartum. In bovines, nisin prevents endometritis induced by experimental infection with S. aureus. Bacteriocins in this infection promote a decrease in the proinflammatory cytokines and increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines [157]. In tissue injuries, such as fractures, the bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103) were shown to reduce postoperative effects, such as inflammation.

The administration of these antimicrobial peptides in domestic animals eliminates potentially pathogenic undesirable microorganisms without causing cytotoxicity on cells or tissues. Interestingly, it does not generate resistance to antibiotics, and resistance to bacteriocins is minimal. Bacteriocins are analogous and synergistic when combined with antiseptics, antibiotics, and ionophores, showing greater potency than antimicrobial peptides from eukaryotic cells. In addition, these combinations can reduce resistance to bacteriocins. The potential use of bacteriocins alone or along with microbicidal agents has potential therapeutic actions in periodontal disease and mastitis in dairy cows, prevents postoperative infections in fractures, and coccidiostats and improves productive parameters in substitution of antibiotics as growth promoters. In animal nutrition, bacteriocins reduce cholesterol and triglycerides, thus improving the quality of the meat as a final product. LAB colonize the intestinal mucosa and produce bacteriocins in situ. LAB and their bacteriocins promote the integrity of the intestinal barrier, eliminate bacteria that interfere with the use of nutrients, and stimulate the expression of proteins associated with the absorption of intestinal fluid. This finding suggests that they can be used as probiotics in poultry and monogastric animals. Furthermore, these bioactive peptides have a role in the immune response as immunomodulators. Bacteriocins modulate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines to promote the repair of cell damage. Some of them are potent inducers of antimicrobial peptides in eukaryotic cells, which improve the innate immune response against pathogens. However, the bacteriocins produced by virulent bacteria can be a virulence factor, promoting a proinflammatory cytokine profile, which favors infection in lymphoid cells and organs. Little is known about the immunomodulatory effects of bacteriocins in animals. More studies are required to fully understand the role of bacteriocins on the innate and adaptive response that could contribute to the control or resolution of infections or diseases. LAB bacteriocins are projected as new antimicrobials that could be targeted or stabilized by nanotechnology and prevent enzymatic digestion. In addition, more research is required on modifications that could increase the potency of bacteriocins. The benefits of bacteriocins shown in vitro and in vivo assays provide support for developing and researching clinical trials in the different areas of veterinary medical therapeutics.", "Bacteriocins are a powerful weapon that can be exploited in veterinary medicine. The administration of these antimicrobial peptides in domestic animals eliminates potentially pathogenic undesirable microorganisms without causing cytotoxicity on cells or tissues. Interestingly, it does not generate resistance to antibiotics, and resistance to bacteriocins is minimal. Bacteriocins are analogous and synergistic when combined with antiseptics, antibiotics, and ionophores, showing greater potency than antimicrobial peptides from eukaryotic cells. In addition, these combinations can reduce resistance to bacteriocins. The potential use of bacteriocins alone or along with microbicidal agents has potential therapeutic actions in periodontal disease and mastitis in dairy cows, prevents postoperative infections in fractures, and coccidiostats and improves productive parameters in substitution of antibiotics as growth promoters. In animal nutrition, bacteriocins reduce cholesterol and triglycerides, thus improving the quality of the meat as a final product. LAB colonize the intestinal mucosa and produce bacteriocins in situ. LAB and their bacteriocins promote the integrity of the intestinal barrier, eliminate bacteria that interfere with the use of nutrients, and stimulate the expression of proteins associated with the absorption of intestinal fluid.
