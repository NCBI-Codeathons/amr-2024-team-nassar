["", "Fungi have historically been the source of numerous important\nmedicinal\ncompounds, but full exploitation of their genetic potential for drug\ndevelopment has been hampered in traditional discovery paradigms.\nHere we describe a radically different approach, top-down drug discovery\n(TD3), starting with a massive digital search through a\ndatabase of over 100,000 fully genomicized fungi to identify loci\nencoding molecules with a predetermined human target. We exemplify\nTD3 by the selection of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)\nas targets and the discovery of two molecules, 1 and 2, which inhibit therapeutically important human CDKs. 1 and 2 exhibit a remarkable mechanism, forming\na site-selective covalent bond to the CDK active site Lys. We explored\nthe structure\u2013activity relationship via semi- and total synthesis,\ngenerating an analog, 43, with improved kinase selectivity,\nbioavailability, and efficacy.

Consistent\nwith this role, disruption of rosD resulted in accumulation\nof 1, without production of 2. The purified\nRosD protein, generated by heterologous expression in E. coli, enabled reconstitution of the epimerization\nreaction in vitro, affording rapid conversion of 1 to\nthe equilibrium 1/2 mixture (Supporting Figure 5). In these reconstitution\nreactions, we also observed two new products by LC-MS/MS, these being\nconsistent with hydrolytic ring-opening of the vinylogous anhydride\nin 2 to form the known compound roseopurpurin A 9, which undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to form aculeatusquinone\nC 10 (Scheme 1). Interestingly, the corresponding products of hydrolytic\nring-opening and decarboxylation from 1 were not observed\nin significant quantities under reaction conditions, consistent with\nour general observation that the vinylogous anhydride in 2 is more reactive than that in 1. Degradants 9 and 10 were formed at the same rate under conditions\nin which the RosD enzyme was omitted, with all other conditions being\nheld constant. To further establish the nonenzymatic nature of this\npathway, 2 was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile\nand water with a mild base (NaHCO3), resulting in formation\nof 9 and 10. Because intermediates such\nas 6 in the biosynthetic pathway can also undergo nonenzymatic\nhydrolysis and decarboxylation, or methanolysis to produce methyl\nesters, we propose that a number of the aculeatusquinones and roseopurpurins\nderived from intermediates in the ros biosynthetic\npathway similarly result from shunt pathways and are not evolved products\nof the ros BGC (Supporting Figure 6).", "Characterization of Mechanism of Action of 1 and 2 on Human CDK2", "Characterization of Mechanism of Action of 1 and 2 on Human CDK2", "Characterization of Mechanism of Action of 1 and 2 on Human CDK2", "Our initial characterization of the\ninteraction of 1 with the Aspergillus\nnidulans CDK Pho85 (PhoA) revealed the site-selective\nformation of a covalent 1:1 adduct, with the inhibitor being linked\nto the active site Lys residue that engages the \u03b1- and \u03b2-phosphate\nmoieties of ATP.

The structure of CDK2/cyclin E bound to 51 (Figure 6C) shows\nthe molecule optimally positioned in the active site for nucleophilic\nattack by Lys33. GEMs 1 and 2 are selective\nby many orders of magnitude for Lys33 over other lysines in CDK2 as\nwell as lysines in other proteins, which in combination with the optimal\nbinding pose demonstrates that covalent bond formation with Lys33\nis enzyme-activated, most likely by a combination of orbital steering\nand enzyme-assisted lysine desolvation. Nearly all protein kinases\npossess a lysine residue in the same position as Lys33 in CDK2, and\nyet 1 and 2 are far from promiscuous kinase\ninhibitors.", "The origins of kinase selectivity in 1 and 2 are likely to derive from the substituents and\nstereochemistry of\nthe GEMs, especially at the junction with the 7-membered ring (C5a)\nand the adjacent C6. Both of these critical positions are, interestingly,\nremote from the hinge-interacting region. The stereocenter at C7 may\nbe less important for selectivity, as 1 and 2 are stereoisomeric at this position, yet exhibit nearly identical\nkinase selectivity. Our SAR studies provided further insights into\nthe role of these positions in determining selectivity. For example,\nat equal concentrations the enantiomer of 1 is devoid\nof kinase inhibitory activity when 1 and 2 show nearly complete inhibition. Analog 38, stripped\nof stereochemistry and substituents at C6 and C7, was drastically\nreduced in CDK-inhibitory activity but had undergone reprogramming\nto target a completely different kinase, CSNK1A1 (Figure 9D). This observation suggests\nthat a systematic SAR exploration of the tricyclic scaffold in 1 and 2 is warranted, as it is likely to yield\na family of novel Lys-targeting covalent kinase inhibitors, possibly\nwith high brain penetration. Finally, semisynthetic chloro-substitution\nat C2 provided an analog with improved selectivity for CDK2 compared\nto 1 and 2, retaining good CDK2 activity\nbut reducing activity against several other CDKs (e.g., CDK7) and\nagainst other protein kinases (e.g., MAP3K11) (compare Figure 9A,B).", "The origins of kinase selectivity in 1 and 2 are likely to derive from the substituents and\nstereochemistry of\nthe GEMs, especially at the junction with the 7-membered ring (C5a)\nand the adjacent C6.
