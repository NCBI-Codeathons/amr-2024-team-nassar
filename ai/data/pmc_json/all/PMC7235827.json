["The global spread of antibiotic resistance is forcing the scientific community to find new molecular strategies to counteract it. Deep functional profiling of microbiomes provides an alternative source for the discovery of novel antibiotic producers and probiotics. Recently, we implemented this ultrahigh-throughput screening approach for the isolation of Bacillus pumilus strains efficiently producing the ribosome-targeting antibiotic amicoumacin A (Ami). Proteomics and metabolomics revealed essential insight into the activation of Ami biosynthesis. Here, we applied omics to boost Ami biosynthesis, providing the optimized cultivation conditions for high-scale production of Ami. Ami displayed a pronounced activity against Lactobacillales and Staphylococcaceae, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, which was determined using both classical and massive single-cell microfluidic assays. However, the practical application of Ami is limited by its high cytotoxicity and particularly low stability. The former is associated with its self-lactonization, serving as an improvised intermediate state of Ami hydrolysis. This intramolecular reaction decreases Ami half-life at physiological conditions to less than 2 h, which is unprecedented for a terminal amide. While we speculate that the instability of Ami is essential for Bacillus ecology, we believe that its stable analogs represent attractive lead compounds both for antibiotic discovery and for anticancer drug development.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The global spread of antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the most urgent problems faced by humanity, particularly relevant to the so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). Globally, antibiotic-resistant infections cause 31.5 million sepsis cases resulting in 5.3 million deaths annually [1]. Hence, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global action plan to tackle AR [2]. The efficient counteraction of the AR problem demands the creation of new molecular tools with antibacterial activity. While classical platforms for antibiotic discovery have been successfully applied, providing the majority of antibiotics on the market [3], a new paradigm of studying microbiome function at the single-cell level is required [4]. Recently, we proposed a concept of deep functional microbiome profiling based on single-cell cultivation of microorganisms encapsulated in isolated compartments of a double water-in-oil-in-water emulsion, combined with subsequent probing of their functionality [5]. Previously, ultrahigh-throughput profiling of bacterial communities for anti-Staphylococcus activity enabled isolating particular clones with the highest level of antibiotic production [6]. The application of this technology to the screening of the exotic microbiome of the East Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos collaris) resulted in the isolation of Bacillus pumilus strains efficiently producing the antibiotic amicoumacin A (Ami) [5]. While Ami was discovered in the 1980s [7,8,9], its mechanism of action and molecular target remained ambiguous for a long time [10] and were precisely determined just recently [11]. Ami efficiently targets both pro- and eukaryotic ribosomes [11,12], resulting in similar minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and IC50 values for Ami-sensitive bacterial strains and human cell lines, respectively [12]. This cytotoxicity restricts its application as an antibiotic on the one hand and provides a perspective agent targeting mammalian translation on the other. However, Ami was reported as an effective anti-inflammatory and antiulcer agent [7], which was subsequently associated with its anti-Helicobacter pylori activity [13]. Numerous Bacillus strains produce Ami [14] and are applied as probiotics to enhance gastrointestinal health [13] or to prevent Vibrio infections in aquaculture [15,16]. Whereas the immunostimulatory effects of Bacillus resulting in an increase in IgA level were reported [17], the antibiotic activity of Ami is a more straightforward and documented reason for the efficacy of Ami-producing Bacillus probiotics [15,16].", "The global spread of antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the most urgent problems faced by humanity, particularly relevant to the so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species).

We expand this data illustrating that Ami is active against numerous Gram-positive bacteria, including the overwhelming majority of pathogenic Enterococcus and Staphylococcus strains. However, we suggest that the application of Ami as an antibiotic or anticancer agent is problematic, since it has low stability in aqueous solutions at physiological pH. We observed the sequential transformation of Ami into AmiC and AmiB, which are inactive metabolites of Ami (lactone and carboxylic acid, respectively). The outstanding instability of the terminal amide of Ami originates from its intramolecular self-lactonization. This process is exceptionally efficient in the case of Ami, decreasing its half-life to less than 2 h at physiological conditions. We speculate that this self-lactonization is so productive because of the formation of the energetically favorable five-membered transition state. Moreover, the proximate protonated amine group enhances this effect. Hence, we consider that self-lactonization serves as an improvised intermediate state, substantially decreasing the energetic barrier of amide hydrolysis.

Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of Ami activation/attenuation [20] and self-resistance [5] were identified. Hence, we suggest that these recent advances provide new applications of Ami in the fields of synthetic biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine. The high-level production of Ami is of interest in these cases, and our results indicate how it could be achieved by the application of state-of-the-art microbiological technologies. Deep functional profiling facilitates the isolation of potent Ami producers, while proteomics and metabolomics provide an essential basis for boosting Ami production.", "Ami is active against both bacteria and mammalian cells, and this is the fundamental problem limiting its broad application. Taking into account the antibiotic potential of Ami, we classify it as a potent agent against Gram-positive pathogenic strains of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus, including MRSA. Ami was also reported as an efficient anti-H. pylori antibiotic, providing attractive gastroprotective action [13]. However, the major obstacle to the practical application of Ami is its low stability at physiological conditions. This is also relevant to H. pylori, which neutralizes the acidic conditions of the stomach via urease activity. Ami has a half-life of ~2 h in neutral and slightly alkaline conditions. That is more than 104 times lower than the respective values obtained for terminally amidated peptides [23]. Hence, the rate of Ami hydrolysis at physiological conditions is similar to that of spontaneous amide hydrolysis at 170 \u00b0\u0421 [24] and close to the hydrolysis rate achieved by artificial enzymes, i.e., proteolytic antibodies [23,25].", "Ami is active against both bacteria and mammalian cells, and this is the fundamental problem limiting its broad application.

The decomposition of Ami is a two-step process, including its self-lactonization, followed by lactone hydrolysis. The self-lactonization of Ami is the rate-limiting step that makes the main contribution to the acceleration of Ami hydrolysis. This is achieved by the formation of the lactone AmiC, simulating the transition state and reducing the energetic barrier of amide hydrolysis. We consider that the potential of Ami has been underestimated for a long time because of the decreased stability of Ami in biological fluids. While the instability of Ami is a stumbling block for its clinical application, we suggest this feature is not accidental. We speculate that Ami serves as an efficient biocontrol agent providing the benefit for Bacillus over its competitors in the wild. The instability of Ami is advantageous in this case, as it enables a precisely time-resolved control over its inhibitory activity. The total synthesis of natural products of the amicoumacin family was reported recently [26,27].
