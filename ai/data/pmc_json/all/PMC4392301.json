A subset of these microbes produces a diversity of anti-microbial natural products including polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, terpenoids, heterocylic nitrogenous compounds, volatile compounds, bacteriocins, and lytic enzymes. In recent years, detailed molecular analysis has led to a better understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms. New genomic and bioinformatic tools have permitted comparisons of orthologous genes between species, leading to predictions of the associated evolutionary mechanisms responsible for diversification at the genetic and corresponding biochemical levels. The purpose of this review is to describe the biodiversity of biosynthetic genes of plant-associated bacteria and fungi that encode selected examples of antimicrobial natural products. For each compound, the target pathogen and biochemical mode of action are described, in order to draw attention to the complexity of these phenomena. We review recent information of the underlying molecular diversity and draw lessons through comparative genomic analysis of the orthologous coding sequences (CDS). We conclude by discussing emerging themes and gaps, discuss the metabolic pathways in the context of the phylogeny and ecology of their microbial hosts, and discuss potential evolutionary mechanisms that led to the diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The plant is an attractive versatile home for diverse microbes that can colonize internal plant tissues (endophytes), live on the surface (epiphytes) or in the soil surrounding the root system (rhizosphere microbiota) (Barea et al., 2005; Johnston-Monje and Raizada, 2011). Plant associated microbes have the potential to be used as biocontrol, the use of living organisms to suppress crop disease (Eilenberg, 2006) through various mechanisms including the production of antibiotics (Compant et al., 2005). Diverse classes of antimicrobial secondary metabolites of microbial origin have been reported (Mousa and Raizada, 2013), including polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, terpenoids, heterocylic nitrogenous compounds, volatile compounds, bacteriocins as well as lytic enzymes. Polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides constitute the majority of microbial derived natural products (Cane, 1997). Interestingly, the tremendous structural diversity of antimicrobial secondary metabolites originated via limited metabolic pathways utilizing few primary metabolites as precursors (Keller et al., 2005). Underlying the diversification of antimicrobial metabolites must have been a corresponding genetic diversification of ancestral genes driven by co-evolutionary pressures (Vining, 1992).", "The plant is an attractive versatile home for diverse microbes that can colonize internal plant tissues (endophytes), live on the surface (epiphytes) or in the soil surrounding the root system (rhizosphere microbiota) (Barea et al., 2005; Johnston-Monje and Raizada, 2011).

It was suggested that the peptides encoded by phlACB may exist as a multi-enzyme complex (Bangera and Thomashow, 1999). phlD has been the subject of interest, because it has homology to chalcone and stilbene synthases from plants, which suggests horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between plants and their rhizosphere microbial populations (Bangera and Thomashow, 1999). Whereas, phlACB coding sequences are highly conserved between eubacteria and archaebacteria (Picard et al., 2000), a considerable degree of polymorphism was reported for phlD (Mavrodi et al., 2001). phlA transcription is negatively regulated by the product of phlF (Delany et al., 2000) which also appears to mediate repression by fusaric acid (Delany et al., 2000), a metabolite of pathogenic fungi of plants, that has previously been implicated in repression of biosynthesis of the anti-fungal compound, phenazine (see above) (van Rij et al., 2005).

Mupirocin can inhibit the growth of methicillin resistant Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus influenza, and Neisseria gonorrheae (Sutherland et al., 1985).

Jadomycin (jad) production is induced under stress conditions such as phage infection or heat shock (Doull et al., 1994; Jakeman et al., 2009). The jad biosynthetic gene cluster in S. venezuelae is closely related to type II polyketide synthase genes (Han et al., 1994) with a complex biosynthetic gene cluster (Zou et al., 2014). Jadomycin is of interest here because upstream of the jad operon are sets of negative regulatory genes including jadR1R2R3 and jadW123 (Yang et al., 1995; Zou et al., 2014). jadW123 encodes enzymes for the biosynthesis of gamma-butyrolactones (GBL), whereas JadR2 is a pseudoreceptor for GBL which upon its binding activates JadR1 and JadR3 that subsequently act as positive and negative transcriptional regulators of the jad biosynthetic operon, respectively (Zou et al., 2014). GBLs are becoming well known as regulators of secondary metabolism in gram positive bacteria, analogous to the related acyl homoserine lactone compounds which mediate QS in gram negative bacteria (Nodwell, 2014). QS is a method of communication between bacterial populations that activates genes based on high cell density through the signal molecule N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) (Whitehead et al., 2001).

In Europe in the Middle Ages, consumption of ergot-infected grain or grasses caused convulsions, paranoia and hallucinations in livestock and humans, known as St. Anthony's Fire (Dotz, 1980). The diverse ergot alkaloids share a tetracyclic ergoline backbone derived from tryptophan and dimethylallyl diphosphate (Flieger et al., 1997). Gene clusters for ergot alkaloid biosynthesis have been identified in various Ascomycete species belonging to Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Claviceps. Seven genes encode the ergoline scaffold including dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS) which catalyzes the first committed step. DMATS is responsible for the prenylation of L-tryptophan with dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP) to produce 4-dimethylallyltryptophan (4-DMAT) (Heinstein et al., 1971). Ergots have diversified into three classes, caused by diverse substituents attached to the carboxyl group of the tetracyclic ergoline backbone, in particular the presence of an amide group (creating ergoamides), a peptide-like amide moiety (creating ergopeptines) or the absence of these moieties (creating clavine alkaloids) (Wallwey and Li, 2011). These structural modifications are responsible for the differential physiological and pharmacological effects of the ergot family, that include treatment of postpartem hemorrhage, leukemia, and Parkinson's disease. The genetic basis for ergot diversification into these 3 major classes is associated with the presence or absence of nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS) which catalyze the biosynthesis of the peptide moieties on the ergoline backbone (Wallwey and Li, 2011). For example, four NRPS genes are present in Claviceps purpurea (which encodes ergopeptines) but absent in Aspergillus fumigatus (which produces clavine alkaloids). Inactivation of these genes suggests that two of the NRPS genes (lpsA and lpsB) are also responsible for synthesis of the ergoamides (Haarmann et al., 2008). Interestingly, further diversification of the peptide moiety within C. purpurea has been reported to be caused by fine-scale allelic diversification of the NRPS genes (Haarmann et al., 2005).

The agrocin 84 antibiotic is essentially a nucleotide attached to an amino acid-like moiety (methyl pentanamide), and its mode of action was proposed to involve competitive binding to the active site of leucyl-tRNA synthetases (Reader et al., 2005). agnB2 encodes a leucyl-tRNA synthetase homolog that confers self-immunity to agrocin 84 since it does not bind the antibiotic (Kim et al., 2006). Normally, a tRNA synthetase acts as a ligase that catalyzes the attachment of an amino acid to a tRNA which includes an anticodon; the catalysis results in a phosphoanhydride bond between the amino acid and ATP as the initial step in the aminoacylation of tRNA (Ibba and S\u00f6ll, 2000). Surprisingly, agnA encodes a truncated homolog of an asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase which lacks the anticodon-binding domain, but maintains the catalytic domain.

Diversity within each cluster can include varying combinations of biosynthetic coding sequences (CDS), transporters for the respective compound, regulatory genes and CDS that confer self-immunity (e.g., mupirocin, agrocin 84). The biosynthetic operons vary in how many CDS synthesize the core skeleton (e.g., synthetases) as well as in how many encode decoration enzymes (e.g., hydroxylases, acyltransferases). However, the decoration enzymes may be encoded outside the gene cluster (e.g., phenazine operon). Furthermore, the biosynthetic CDS may be organized into genetic modules (e.g., NRPS) that vary in number. Each gene cluster is also associated with distinct DNA regulatory elements, for example to receive signals such as from quorum sensing. For example, comparative analysis of the trichothecene biosynthetic gene clusters (TRI) in Fusarium and Trichoderma showed multiple evolutionary diversification events within a single biosynthetic gene cluster family (e.g., head-to-tail vs. head-to-head rearrangements) (Figure 5). In another example, comparative analyses of the polymyxin operon showed mixing and matching of CDS, resulting in diversification of the compounds. Similarly, diversification of the phenazines likely arose through a diversity of biosynthetic decoration enzymes (e.g., hydroxylases). Another intriguing observation is from the helvolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster, in which transferase CDS were shown to have duplicated and diversified into paralogous gene families.

As another example, whereas most chitinase genes possess a single catalytic domain, examples were noted where a single CDS encodes two catalytic domains (Figure 7). In general, the literature notes that domains within the same CDS can evolve independently (e.g., catalytic vs. substrate binding domains of chitinase); combined with the existence of linker peptides between domains as sites of homologous recombination, these features can result in novel alleles following domain swapping (e.g., family18 chitinases). Whereas, such allelic diversification plays a major role in the diversification of compound structures, caused for example by DNA mutations within the substrate binding domain, the literature demonstrates examples where biochemical diversity has arisen from relaxed substrate specificity of the biosynthetic enzymes (Figure 3).

(2011) to hypothesize the possibility of special and temporal gene expression of the associated biosynthetic pathway, at different developmental resolutions ranging from a single cell to fungal colony.", "A related major challenge is that there are many natural products that exist in the literature that were initially isolated as part of screens for new compounds from total extracts, and hence the ecological functions of these compounds, as well as their underlying genes, remain unknown.", "A related major challenge is that there are many natural products that exist in the literature that were initially isolated as part of screens for new compounds from total extracts, and hence the ecological functions of these compounds, as well as their underlying genes, remain unknown.", "As anti-pathogenic metabolites may be self-toxic, the evolution of self-resistance is a particularly fascinating avenue of study, which this review demonstrates has been investigated for a limited number of pathways (e.g., mupirocin). Diverse self-resistance mechanisms have been reported in the microbial literature (Sch\u00e4berle et al., 2011; Westman et al., 2013; Stegmann et al., 2015), suggesting that each plant-asssociated microbe with anti-microbial activity may employ unique self-protection strategies.", "As anti-pathogenic metabolites may be self-toxic, the evolution of self-resistance is a particularly fascinating avenue of study, which this review demonstrates has been investigated for a limited number of pathways (e.g., mupirocin).

Bioinformatic genome mining of biosynthetic gene clusters, combined with new advances in metabolomics, may also lead to the discovery of a diverse array of novel bio-active natural products. Moreover, merging these techniques with knowledge of microbial co-evolution and ecology (Vizcaino et al., 2014) along with advanced microscopy and imaging techniques will open a new era of discovery to harvest the diversity of natural products to combat evolving pathogens.", "The recent advances in genome sequencing combined with gene editing tools will facilitate more in-depth analysis of orthologous biosynthetic genes in diverse species.
