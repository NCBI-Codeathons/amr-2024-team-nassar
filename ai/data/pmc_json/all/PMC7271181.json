Cf.\nsatellite DNA.satellite DNADNA containing highly repetitive sequences, that has a base composition (and thus density in ultracentrifugation) significantly different from normal DNA. Typically 10% of mammalian, and 50% of insect genomes are composed of satellites. As satellites are dispersed widely in the genome, are easily detectable (with a highly repetitive probe) and are frequently polymorphic in length, they are ideal markers for linkage studies of disease or inheritance, and for genomics. Minisatellites (variable number of tandem repeats, VNTRs) have core repeats of 9\u221280\u00a0bp, microsatellites (short tandem repeats, STRs, simple sequence repeats, SSRs) have repeats of only 2\u22126\u00a0bp.

Mutations in SCARF2 are associated with Van Den Ende-Gupta syndrome.Scatchard plotA method for analysing data for freely reversible ligand/receptor binding interactions. The graphical plot is: (Bound ligand/Free ligand) against (Bound ligand); the slope gives the negative reciprocal of the binding affinity, the intercept on the x-axis the number of receptors (Bound/Free becomes zero at infinite ligand concentration). The Scatchard plot is preferable to the Eadie-Hoffstee plot for binding data because it is more dependent upon the values at high ligand concentration, the most reliable values. A non-linear Scatchard plot is often taken to indicate heterogeneity of receptors, although this is not the only explanation possible.scatter factorA motility factor (motogen) isolated from conditioned medium in which human fibroblasts have been grown. It causes colonies of epithelial and endothelial cells, in culture, to separate into single cells that move apart i.e. they scatter. It has been shown to be identical to human hepatocyte growth factor (728aa), but it is not mitogenic for all cell types. Defects are responsible for a form of autosomal recessive deafness.scavenger receptorsStructurally diverse family of receptors on macrophages that are involved in the uptake of modified LDL and have been implicated in development of atherosclerotic lesions. Six classes are recognized with different binding preferences.

Three main species, Schistosoma haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni, cause disease in man. Larval forms of the parasite live in freshwater snails; cercariae liberated from the snail burrow into skin, transform to the schistosomulum stage, and migrate to the urinary tract (S. haematobium), liver or intestine (S. japonicum, S.mansoni) where the adult worms develop. Eggs are shed into the urinary tract or the intestine and hatch to form miracidia which then infect snails, completing the life cycle. Adult worms cause substantial damage to tissue and seem to resist immune damage by mechanisms that are not fully understood.schistosomulum\nPl. schistosomula.

In biology, liquid scintillation counting is mainly used for \u03b2 emitters such as 14C, 35S and 32P and particularly for the low energy \u03b2 emission of 3H. Gamma emissions are often measured by counting the scintillations that they cause in a crystal. Autoradiographic images can be enhanced by using a screen of scintillant behind the film.scintillation proximity assayAssay system in which antibody or receptor molecule is bound to a bead that will emit light when \u03b2 emission from an isotope occurs in close proximity, i.e. from a radioactively-labelled ligand.

They contain luciferase and luciferin and are responsible for the production of luminescence, a brief (0.1\u00a0sec) blue flash (max 476\u00a0nm) when stimulated, usually by mechanical disturbance. Dinoflagellates produce most of the bioluminescence in the oceans.SCIPPOU-domain transcription factor (Oct-6, Tst-1, 451aa) expressed by promyelinating Schwann cells (where it represses expression of the myelin structural genes) and, in tissue culture, by oligodendrocyte progenitors.scirrhous carcinomaCarcinoma having a hard structure because of excessive production of dense connective tissue.sclereidType of sclerenchyma cell that differs from the fibre cell by not being greatly elongated.

Scruin holds the microfilaments of the core process in a strained configuration so that the process is coiled. The myosin binding sites on the microfilaments are blocked so HMM decoration is impossible, indicating that there is an unusual packing conformation; when the scruin-actin binding is released the process straightens, the conformation of the actin changes and myosin binding is possible.scurfyA murine X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, similar to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in humans, caused by mutation of the foxp3 gene which affects the development and maintenance of CD4+\nregulatory T-cells.scurvyDisease caused by vitamin C deficiency.

Anionic detergent that at millimolar concentrations will bind to and denature proteins, forming an SDS-protein complex. The amount of SDS bound is proportional to the molecular weight of the protein, and each SDS molecule, bound by its hydrophobic domain, contributes one negative charge to the protein thus swamping its intrinsic charge. This property is exploited in the separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE.SDS-PAGE\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in which the charge on the proteins results from their binding of SDS. Since the charge is proportional to the surface area of the protein, and the resistance to movement proportional to diameter, small proteins migrate further.sdtIn Drosophila a protein (stardust, EC 2.7.4.8) with guanylate kinase activity that is a component of the SAC complex that determines epithelial polarity.

Acts as a receptor for the preprotein-secB complex and as an ATP-driven molecular motor. Interacts with the secYEG preprotein conducting channel. See sec-dependent transport.sec-dependent transportPathway for the secretion of proteins across the inner membrane into the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria using the general translocase SecYEG. The SecA protein recognises the signal sequence of proteins destined for export. Also used for the insertion of inner membrane proteins, in some cases in association with YidC. Other translocation mechanisms involve the Tat system and YidC. SecYEG is a trimeric complex where Y and E are related to sec61\u03b1 and \u03b3 subunits (see secA).sec proteinsProteins involved in sec-dependent transport. In S. cerevisiae Sec 1 (724aa) is involved in the final stage of protein secretion. Sec7 has a domain of around 200aa that is found in several GEFs for ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs); mutations lead to accumulation of Golgi cisternae and loss of secretory granules. Various other Sec proteins (Sec13, Sec16, Sec23, Sec24, Sec31) are components of the COPII coat protein complex. Sec61 is a conserved heterotrimeric protein-conducting channel (translocon) in eukaryotes (homologous to the SecY channel in eubacteria and archaea) that associates with the sub-complex Sec62/Sec63 and translocates proteins across cellular membranes and integrates proteins containing hydrophobic transmembrane segments into lipid bilayers. Sec61a (Ssh1, 476aa) is a multispanning membrane protein, Sec61b (SEB2, 88aa) kinetically facilitates cotranslational translocation and interacts with the 25-kD subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC25), Sec61\u03b3 (SSS1, 80aa) is the third component. Sec65 in S. cerevisiae is a subunit of the signal recognition particle similar to mammalian SRP19. See also exocyst complex.secerninsA subfamily of the peptidase C69 family.

Wood is composed largely of secondary xylem.secretagogueSubstance that induces secretion from cells; originally applied to peptides inducing gastric and pancreatic secretion.secretasesA family of peptidases involved in processing of membrane-bound precursor molecules. Alpha-secretase (ADAM10, EC 3.4.24.81, CD156c, 748aa) has broad proteolytic activity and cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the soluble non-amyloidogenic product sAPP alpha. It also processes heparin-binding epidermal growth-like factor, ephrin-A2 and TNF. Beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1, Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, EC 3.4.23.46, 501aa) is the major beta-secretase in vivo, an aspartic peptidase that generates the N-terminus of the beta-amyloid protein from APP; further cleavage is then carried out by gamma-secretase. It is an integral membrane protein. Beta-secretase-2 (EC 3.4.23.45, theta-secretase, memapsin-1, 518aa) has similar activity. Gamma-secretase is a multi-protein complex that will cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and other type I transmembrane proteins such as notch and E-cadherin. There are four components, presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, all required for proteolytic activity, and a fifth component, CD147, with a regulatory role.secretinPeptide hormone (27aa derived from a 121aa precursor peptide) secreted by S cells in the duodenal mucosa. Stimulates secretion of pepsin by the pancreas and bile, but inhibits secretion of gastric acid. One of the secretin family of hormones that also includes gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon, glucagon like peptide-1, growth hormone releasing hormone, helodermin, peptide histidine methionine, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide. The receptor (440aa) is G-protein coupled.secretionRelease of synthesized product from cells. Release may be of membrane-bounded vesicles (merocrine secretion) or of vesicle content following fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane (apocrine secretion). In holocrine secretion whole cells are released.secretion systemsThere are various different bacterial secretory systems. In the Type I secretion system (T1SS, TOSS) there is a contiguous channel that traverses the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. There are only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP). The Type I secretion system transports various molecules including ions, drugs and proteins of various sizes (20\u2212900\u00a0kDa). The Type II system (T2SS) in Gram-negative bacteria depends upon the Sec or Tat system for initial transport of proteins into the periplasm from where they pass through the outer membrane via a multimeric (12\u221214 subunits) complex of pore forming secretin proteins. In addition to the secretin proteins, 10\u221215 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. In some bacteria, certain proteins are shared between the pilus complex and the type II system. The Type III system (TTSS, T3SS) is essential for pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria, and allows them to translocate proteins into eukaryotic host cells. The type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) is a multisubunit membrane-spanning macromolecular assembly comprising more than 20 different protein, some of which have sequence homology with flagellar proteins. The TTSS encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) is critical for adaptation to the intracellular environment within both phagocytic and epithelial cell types. The Type IV secretion system (T4SS, TFSS) is homologous to the conjugation machinery of bacteria and to archaeal flagella. It is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. Discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens which uses this system to introduce the T-DNA portion of the Ti plasmid into the plant host, which in turn causes the development of a crown gall.secretograninsSee granins.secretoneurinA polypeptide (33aa) derived by proteolytic cleavage from secretogranin II (617aa; see granins) that stimulates dopamine release from striatal neurons, and gonadotropin II secretion from the pituitary; inhibits serotonin and melatonin release from pinealocytes.

The receptor is G-protein coupled.secretorA person who secretes ABO blood group substances into mucous secretions, e.g. saliva; at least 80% of humans are secretors.secretory carrier-associated membrane proteinsA family of integral membrane proteins (SCAMPs, tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins) of post-Golgi membranes that function as recycling carriers to the cell surface. At least five members of the family have been identified ( SCAMP1, 338aa; SCAMP2, 329aa; SCAMP3, 347aa, SCAMP4, 229aa; SCAMP5, 235aa) with different tissue distributions and transport activities. In Arabidopsis similar proteins (e.g. SCAMP1, 282aa) are probably involved in membrane trafficking.secretory cellsCells specialized for secretion, usually epithelial. Those that secrete proteins characteristically have well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, whereas conspicuous smooth endoplasmic reticulum is typical of cells that secrete lipid or lipid-derived products (e.g. steroids). In plants secretory cells release substances such as mucins and latex.secretory component\nsecretory piece A secreted polypeptide chain (585aa) cleaved from the poly-immunoglobulin receptor (764aa). This receptor binds polymeric IgA and IgM at the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, the complex is then transported across the cell and is secreted at the apical surface. During the secretory process the secretory component is cleaved from the transmembrane segment of the receptor.secretory proteinsIn eukaryotes, proteins synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum and destined for export. Nearly all proteins secreted from cells are glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus, although there are exceptions (e.g. albumin). In prokaryotes, secreted proteins may be synthesized on ribosomes associated with the plasma membrane or exported post-translation.secretory vesicleMembrane-bounded vesicle derived from the Golgi apparatus and containing material that is to be released from the cell. The contents may be densely packed, often in an inactive precursor form (zymogen).securinAn inhibitor (pituitary tumour-transforming gene 1 protein, 202aa) of the anaphase activator separin (separase/Esp1p).

Seipin mutations are involved in various disorders including congenital lipodystrophy type 2, Silver syndrome and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V.seismonastyThe movement of a plant part in response to vibration (a special case of the response to touch, the thigmonastic response). The folding of the leaflets of Mimosa is the classic example. Informative webpages: http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e32/32d.htm\nselectins\naddressins A family of cell adhesion molecules that have selective carbohydrate-binding capacity (selective lectins, hence the name). They are integral membrane glycoproteins with an N-terminal, C-type lectin domain, followed by an EGF-like domain, a variable number of repeats of the short consensus sequence of complement regulatory proteins and a single transmembrane domain. The prefix letter is based on the site of their original identification, although they are not restricted to these locations. E-selectin (endothelial selectin, CD62E, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, ELAM-1, 610aa) is upregulated on endothelial cells of post-capillary venules where it is important for neutrophil margination during acute inflammation; it binds sialylated Lewis X and a particular glycoform of ESL-1 that is present on myeloid cells. L-selectin (leucocyte-endothelial cell adhesion molecule, LECAM, CD62L, LAM-1, MEL-14 antigen, leu-8, 372aa) is also involved in leucocyte-endothelial adhesion, for lymphocyte homing to high endothelial venules and for implantation of the embryo to the uterine wall. It binds to carbohydrates on CD34, CD162, GlyCam and MAdCAM. Once the leucocytes have migrated into tissue (diapedesis) the L-selectin is enzymatically removed by a membrane-associated metallopeptidase, a sheddase. P-selectin (platelet selectin CD62P, PADGEM, GMP-140, LECAM-3, 830aa) is rapidly upregulated in platelets and endothelial cells when activated, but only transiently expressed. It mediates rolling of neutrophils, platelets and some T-cell subsets to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Although knock-out animals show defective cellular infiltration into inflammatory sites it is necessary to inhibit both P-selectin and E-selectin to see total blockade.selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors\nSSRIs A class of drugs that inhibit the uptake of serotonin into presynaptic cells. This increases the duration of the signal and also reduces serotonin production through a feedback mechanism. They are extensively prescribed for depression, anxiety disorders, and some personality disorders. An example is Prozac.selector genesA group of genes that determines which part of a developmental pattern cells will be allocated within a developmental segment. Antennapedia is an example and the neural selector gene cut, that encodes a homeobox transcription factor, is required for the specification of the correct identity of external (bristle-type) sensory organs in Drosophila.selenium\nSe An essential trace element that must be added as a supplement in serum-free culture media for most animal cells. Some plant species are Se tolerant and will accumulate very high concentrations of Se (accumulators), but most plants are Se non-accumulators and are Se-sensitive. See selenocysteine and selenoprotein. Review: http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.arplant.51.1.401\nselenocysteine\nSec An unusual amino acid of proteins, the selenium analogue of cysteine, the selenium atom replacing sulphur. Involved in the catalytic mechanism of seleno-enzymes such as formate dehydrogenase of E. coli, and mammalian glutathione peroxidase. A special opal suppressor tRNA that recognizes certain UGA nonsense codons allow it to be genomically encoded.selenoproteinA protein that contains selenocysteine. Selenoprotein N (590aa) contains a single selenocysteine residue and is a glycoprotein localized within the endoplasmic reticulum and found in brain, muscle, lung and placenta. Mutations in the gene lead to rigid-spine muscular dystrophy. Selenoprotein P (381aa) has multiple selenocysteine residues and may be involved in antioxidant activity and possibly in selenium transport. Mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein (116aa) is important for the maintenance and stabilization of the crescent structure of the sperm mitochondria. Selenoprotein W (87aa) may be involved in redox-related processes and may have a role in the myopathies of selenium deficiency. Selenoprotein Z (524aa) is thioredoxin reductase 2 (EC 1.6.4.5). Various other selenoproteins are known and many are involved in redox reactions.self-antigens\nautoantigens Normal components of the body that can be antigens in an autoimmune response.self-assemblyThe formation of higher-order structures from subunits (protomers) without any external source of information (priming structures or templates).self-cloningAny system in which inappropriate cell types or organisms are eliminated because they possess some character that allows them to die or to remove themselves from the system. Thus a transfected cell with genetic material including a drug resistance marker will be self-cloning in the presence of the drug and non-transfected cells will die.self-incompatibilityThe inability of pollen grains to fertilize flowers of the same plant or its close relatives. It is a mechanism to ensure out-breeding within some plant species, e.g. in the case of the S gene complex in Brassicas where the genes encoding for SI specificity in pistil (SRK) and pollen (SCR) are thought to be preserved because there is rarely or never any recombination.self-replicatingLiterally, replication of a system by itself without outside intervention. In practice often taken to refer to systems that replicate without the contribution of any information from outside the system.self-splicingSelf-catalysed removal of group 5 introns from mRNA, mediated by six paired conserved regions.sem-5A cell-signalling gene of C. elegans that encodes a protein (228aa) with SH2 and SH3 domains; acts in vulval development and sex myoblast migration.semaphorinsFamily of proteins that mediate neuronal guidance by inhibiting nerve growth cone movement. Both transmembrane and secreted proteins are included and many domains of the proteins are highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. Most are around 750aa with a conserved \u2018sema\u2019 domain of up to 500aa extracellularly with a single immunoglobulin C2-type domain C-terminally to this. Collapsin, responsible for the collapse of nerve growth cones of chick sensory neurites in culture following contact with retinal axons was one of the first semaphorins described. Receptors are plexins; see also collapsin response-mediator proteins.

Adj. semelparous.semiautonomousDescribing systems or processes that are not wholly independent of other systems or processes.semiconservative replicationThe system of replication of DNA found in all cells in which each daughter cell receives one old strand of DNA and one strand newly synthesized at the preceding S phase. The existence of semiconservative replication was demonstrated by the Meselson-Stahl experiment and implied the two- or multi-strandedness of DNA.semigamyA rare type of facultative apomixis in plants controlled by an incompletely dominant autosomal gene. During semigamy, the sperm and egg cells undergo cellular fusion, but the sperm and egg nucleus fail to fuse in the embryo sac, giving rise to diploid, haploid, or chimeric embryos composed of sectors of paternal and maternal origin. Early report: http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/2/117.extract\nsemipermeable membraneA membrane that is selectively permeable to only one (or a few) solutes. The potential developed across a membrane permeable to only one ionic species is given by the Nernst equation for the species: this is the basis for the operation of ion-selective electrodes.Semliki forest virusEnveloped virus of the alphavirus group of Togaviridae. First isolated from mosquitoes in the Semliki Forest in Uganda; not known to cause any human illness although it causes a lethal encephalitis in rodents. The synthesis and export of its three spike glycoproteins, via the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, have been used as a model for the synthesis and export of plasma membrane proteins.SEN1See senataxin.Senarmont compensationIn interference microscopy, compensation for the phase difference introduced by the object, measured by introducing a quarter-wavelength plate and rotating the analyser: the angle of rotation is proportional to the optical path difference.senataxinA protein (2,677aa), probably a helicase (EC 3.6.1.-), which may be involved in RNA maturation. Involved in DNA double-strand break response generated by oxidative stress. The gene is mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive Type 1 and in a rare autosomal dominant form of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Has homology to SEN1 of S. cerevisiae, a helicase required for endonucleolytic cleavage of introns from all families of precursor tRNAs. It is essential for vegetative growth of the yeast.\nSendai virus\nHaemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) Parainfluenza virus type 1 (Paramyxoviridae). Can cause fatal pneumonia in mice, and may cause respiratory disease in humans. The ability of ultraviolet-inactivated virus to fuse mammalian cells has been extensively used in the study of heterokaryons and hybrid cell lines.senescent cell antigenAn antigen (62\u00a0kDa) that appears on the surface of senescent erythrocytes and is immunologically cross-reactive with isolated band III. Seems to be recognized by an autoantibody, and the immunoglobulin-coated erythrocyte is then removed from circulation by cells such as Kuppfer cells of the liver that have Fc receptors. Intracellular cleavage of intact band III by a calcium-activated peptidase, calpain, may reveal the antigen in situ. See LIM kinases.senile plaqueCharacteristic feature of the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients and aged monkeys, consisting of a core of amyloid fibrils surrounded by dystrophic neurites. The principal component of amyloid fibrils in senile plaques is B/A4, a peptide of about 4\u00a0kDa that is derived from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). The B/A4 sequence is located near the C-terminus of APP.Senior-Loken syndromeAn autosomal recessive disease characterised by nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. Various forms of the disorder are caused by mutations in genes encoding nephrocystins.sensitizationA state of increased responsiveness, usually referring to the state of an animal after primary challenge with an antigen. The term is frequently used in the context of hypersensitivity.sensory ataxic neuropathyA clinically heterogeneous systemic disorder with variable features resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction. Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) is caused by mutation in the nuclear gene that encodes DNA polymerase-gamma or by mutation in the gene for twinkle. Spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy (SCAE) is similar.sensory neuron\n(1) A neuron that receives input from sensory cells. (2) Sensory cells such as cutaneous mechanoreceptors and muscle receptors.SEPALLATAA MADS-box subfamily of transcription factors that interact with ABCD floral homeotic genes in specifying different floral whorls. SEPALLATA1 (SEP1, agamous-like MADS-box protein AGL2, 215aa) forms a heterodimer with AGAMOUS and interacts with other members of the family.separinA caspase-like cysteine endopeptidase (separase, EC 3.4.22.49, 2120aa), involved in cleaving the cohesin complex that links sister chromatids until the metaphase to anaphase transition. Separin activity is inhibited until securin is ubiquitinated by the anaphase-promoting complex and proteolytically degraded. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) phosphorylates securin and blocks ubiquitination by the APC. In S. cerevisiae separin is Esp1.SephacrylTrade-name for a covalently cross-linked allyl dextrose gel formed into beads. Used in gel filtration columns for separating molecules in the size range 5\u00a0kDa to 1.5 million Da.SephadexTrade-name for a cross-linked dextran gel in bead form used for gel filtration columns: by varying the degree of cross-linking the effective fractionation range of the gel can be altered.SepharoseTrade-name for a gel of agarose in bead form from which charged polysaccharides have been removed. Used in gel filtration columns.septate junctionAn intercellular junction found in invertebrate epithelia that is characterized by a ladder-like appearance in electron micrographs. Thought to provide structural strength and to provide a barrier to diffusion of solutes through the intercellular space. Occurs widely in transporting epithelia, and is (perhaps controversially) considered analogous to tight junctions (zonula occludens).septic shockCondition of clinical shock caused by endotoxin in the blood. A serious complication of severe burns and abdominal wounds, frequently fatal. Part of the problem seems to be due to increased leucocyte adhesiveness, which leads to massive sequestration of neutrophils in the lung, increased vascular permeability, and acute (adult) respiratory distress syndrome.septicaemiaA potentially life-threatening infection in which many bacteria are present in the blood. Commonly referred to as blood poisoning. See bacteraemia.septinsFamily of evolutionary conserved proteins (cytoskeletal GTPases, peanut-like proteins, cell division control-related proteins, ~350aa) that polymerize into hetero-oligomeric complexes that form filaments, and associate with cellular membranes, actin filaments and microtubules. GTPase activity is required for filament formation. They were first identified in S. cerevisiae where they are associated with cytokinesis and septum formation and form a ring of 10\u00a0nm filaments underlying the plasma membrane in the mother-bud neck. Homologous proteins, associated with cleavage furrows, are reported from Drosophila, amphibians and mammals but not from protozoa or plants, and they are also involved in membrane dynamics, vesicle trafficking, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal remodelling. There are at least 14 human septins with tissue-specific isoforms in many cases. A deficiency in septin-5 degradation may contribute to the development of early onset Parkinson\u2019s disease 2, septin-7 interacts with CENP-E at the kinetochore. Mutations in septin-9 are associated with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy. Review: http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/11/236\nseptumLiterally a separating wall. Mainly applied to the structure composed of plasmalemmae and cell wall material formed in cell division in prokaryotes and fungi. Also applied to the sealing layers in various packages of sterile fluids, or barriers through which injections, needles etc., may be passed.SeqbootA data-analysis package that allows bootstrap, jackknife, or permutation resampling of molecular sequence, restriction site, gene frequency or character data. It can be used to generate multiple data sets that are resampled versions of the input data set. Link to webpage: http://cmgm.stanford.edu/phylip/seqboot.html\nSequenase\u2122Proprietary name for a genetically engineered form of T7 DNA polymerase (EC. 2.7.7.7) used in DNA sequencing. Affymetrix homepage: http://www.affymetrix.com/estore/index.jsp\nsequence homologyStrictly, refers to the situation where nucleic acid or protein sequences are similar because they have a common evolutionary origin. Often used loosely to indicate that sequences are very similar. Sequence similarity is observable; homology is an hypothesis based on observation.sequestosome\naggresome Protein aggregates (perinuclear inclusion bodies) composed of ubiquitin-linked proteins destined for degradation. Sequestosome-1 (ubiquitin-binding protein p62, 440aa) is an adapter protein which binds ubiquitin and may regulate the activation of NF\u03baB1 by TNF\u03b1, nerve growth factor (NGF) and interleukin-1 and may regulate various signalling cascades. One form of Paget\u2019s disease of bone is caused by mutation in the gene. Overexpression of parkin or disruption of microtubules apparently blocks the formation of aggresomes.sequonA consensus sequence of amino acids, as for example the tripeptide motif Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr that is the site for N-linked glycosylation.SERSee smooth endoplasmic reticulum.SERCASee sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca\n2+\n-ATPase.serglycin\nproteoglycan 1 An intracellular proteoglycan, found particularly in the storage granules of connective tissue mast cells. The core protein consists of 153aa with 24 serine-glycine repeats between amino acids 89 and 137, hence the name. The serine-glycine repeats are the linkage sites for around 15 glycosaminoglycan chains that are either heparin or highly sulphated chondroitin sulphate. These negatively charged chains are thought to concentrate positively charged proteases, histamine and other molecules within the storage granules.sericinA serine-rich protein (1186aa in Bombyx mori) found in silk. It forms a sticky coat on the fibroin threads and cements them together. It is finding a range of uses in biotechnological applications.serincClass of carrier proteins (serine incorporators, e.g,, serinc-1, 453aa; serinc-2, 456aa) that facilitate the synthesis of serine-derived lipids, phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. Serinc is a unique protein family that shows no amino acid homology to other proteins but is highly conserved among eukaryotes. The members contain 11 transmembrane domains. Research article: http://www.jbc.org/content/280/42/35776.long\nserineOne of the amino acids (Ser, S, 105\u00a0Da) found in proteins and that can be phosphorylated. See Table A1.serine dehydrataseA gluconeogenic enzyme (EC 4.2.1.13, SDH, 328aa), one of the beta-family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzymes, catalyzes the deamination of L-serine and L-threonine to yield pyruvate or 2-oxobutyrate.serine hydroxymethyltransferaseOne of the alpha- class of pyridoxal phosphate enzymes (EC 2.1.2.1, SHMT1, 444 and 483aa isoforms; SHMT2, 494aa is mitochondrial), a catabolic enzyme involved in converting serine to glycine and a key enzyme in the formation and regulation of the folate one-carbon pool. E. coli SHMT (417aa) has little sequence similarity to the enzyme family. See mimosine.serine peptidasesPeptidases (serine proteases) that share a common reaction mechanism based on formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate on a specific active serine residue. Most are inhibited by generic serine peptidase inhibitors (serpins) and irreversibly inactivated by a series of organophosphorus esters, such as di-isopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). They are, however, diverse in molecular structure and catalytic mechanisms and are not homologues of each other. Examples are trypsin, chymotrypsin and the bacterial enzyme subtilisin.SERK genesPlant genes that encode somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases. SERK1 (EC 2.7.10.1, 625aa) is a dual specificity kinase that will phosphorylate serine/threonine- and tyrosine-containing substrates. It is involved in the brassinolide signalling pathway. SERK1 and SERK2 act redundantly and double mutants of SERK1 and SERK2 are completely male sterile. SERK3 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-associated receptor kinase 1, 615aa) forms a heterodimer with BRI1 which it can phosphorylate; this may changie the equilibrium between plasma membrane-located BRI1 homodimers and endocytosed BRI1-BAK1 heterodimers. SERK4 and SERK5 are also known but their function is unclear.serogroupA group of bacteria or other microorganisms that have a certain antigen in common.serosa\n(1) A serous epithelium, having serous glands or cells, as opposed to a mucous membrane. (2) Thin infolding of the lining of the peritoneal cavity that forms the omentum.serotoninA neurotransmitter and hormone (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT, 176\u00a0Da), found in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. It is important in the mammalian CNS and various psychoactive drugs (such as selective serotinin-reuptake inhibitors) are extensively used to treat depression. Serotonin is produced by enterochromaffin cells in the gut and is stored in platelets. Most receptors are G-protein coupled except for the 5-HT3 receptor which is a ligand gated ion channel permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. In plants serotonin may be present at high levels in fruits.serotypeThe genotype of a unicellular organism as defined by antisera directed against antigenic determinants expressed on the surface.serous glandAn exocrine gland that produces a watery, protein-rich secretion, as opposed to a carbohydrate-rich mucous secretion.serpentine receptorsSee G-protein-coupled receptors.serpinsSuperfamily of proteins, mostly serine peptidase inhibitors, that includes alpha 1-antitrypsin, complement C1 inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, maspin, PEDF, protease nexin-1 and vaspin. The serpin-enzyme complex (SEC) formed from a serpin and a serine peptidase binds to a hepatocyte receptor (SEC receptor) that mediates catabolism of \u03b1-1-antitrypsin/elastase complexes and elevates \u03b1-1-antitrypsin synthesis.serrate\n(1) The transmembrane ligand (1404aa) for Notch, contains 14 repeats of the EGF-like domain, expressed on dorsal cells of Drosophila wing, activates Notch on ventral cells and induces the expression of delta protein. Serrate protein expression is reciprocally induced by delta and modulated by fringe. (2) In plants, a zinc finger protein, (SERRATE, 720aa) that is required for proper processing of primary miRNAs to miRNAs, for pre-mRNA splicing and for the accumulation of the trans-acting small interfering RNA (ta-siRNA).Serratia marcescensA Gram-negative bacterium that is very common in soil and water; most strains produce a characteristic pigment, prodigiosin. Opportunistic human pathogen, infecting mainly hospital patients. Serratia marcescens haemolysin (ShlA, 1608aa) is an unusual pore-forming toxin, that requires ShlB (557aa) for its secretion and activation. ShlA not only forms pores in erythrocytes but also in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Haemolysin: http://iai.asm.org/cgi/reprint/72/1/611.pdf\nSertoli cellTall columnar cells found in the mammalian testis closely associated with developing spermatocytes and spermatids. Probably provide appropriate microenvironment for sperm differentiation and phagocytose degenerate sperm.serumFluid that is left when blood clots; the cells are enmeshed in fibrin and the clot retracts because of the contraction of platelets. It differs from plasma in having lost various proteins involved in clot formation (fibrinogen, prothrombin, various blood-clotting factors such as Hagemann factor, Factor VIII etc.) and in containing various platelet-released factors, notably platelet-derived growth factor. For this reason serum is a better supplement for cell culture medium than defibrinated plasma (plasma-derived serum).serum amyloidThe fibrils deposited in tissues in secondary amyloidosis which are unrelated to immunoglobulin light chains (in contrast to the situation in primary amyloidosis) and are made of amyloid A protein (AA protein). This is derived from serum amyloid A (SAA) that is the apolipoprotein of a high-density lipoprotein and an acute phase protein. Partial proteolysis converts SAA into the beta pleated sheet configuration of the amyloid fibrils. Amyloid P protein is also found as a minor component of the fibrils (in both primary and secondary amyloidosis) and is derived from serum amyloid P a pentraxin with similarity to C-reactive protein. The physiological role remains obscure.serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinasesSerine/threonine protein kinases (SGKs, of which several isoforms have been identified) that are transcriptionally regulated by corticoids, serum, and cell volume. SGK1 (EC 2.7.11.1, 431aa) activates certain potassium, sodium, and chloride channels and plays an important role in the regulation of epithelial ion transport by inactivating (by phosphorylation) Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT-2) for degradation. SGK2 (427aa) is involved in the activation of potassium channels. SGK3 (496aa) also activates potassium channels and mediates IL-3-dependent survival signals. SGKs belong to the AGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family that includes Akt.serum hepatitisSee hepatitis B.serum requirementThe amount of serum that must be added to culture medium to permit growth of an animal cell in culture. Transformed cells frequently have less stringent serum requirements than their normal counterparts.\nserum response element\nSRE DNA motif (20\u00a0bp) found (for example) in the c-fos promoter, which is bound by the serum response factor.serum response factor\nTranscription factor (SRF, p67SRF) which interacts with Elk-1 (p62TCF) to bind the serum response element promoter motif found in many growth-related genes.serum sicknessA hypersensitivity response (Type III) to the injection of large amounts of antigen, as might happen when large amounts of antiserum are given in a passive immunization. The effects are caused by the presence of soluble immune complexes in the tissues.sestrinsA family of conserved proteins that accumulate in cells exposed to stress and whose expression is modulated by p53. They are involved in reducing peroxiredoxins which have been over-oxidised by hydrogen peroxide, thereby regenerating their protective anti-oxidant function. Sestrins contain a predicted redox-active domain homologous to bacterial AhpD. May also be regulators of cellular growth. In humans sestrin-2 (480aa) and sestrin-3 (492aa) are also known. Defects in sestrin-1 (SESN1, p53-regulated protein PA26, 492aa) may be involved in heterotaxia. In Drosophila, dSesn (sestrin homologue, 497aa) appears to be a negative feedback regulator of TOR. Weblog: http://anti-agingfirewalls.com/2010/03/07/sestrins-longevity-and-cancers/\nSET complexAn endoplasmic reticulum-associated complex, originally discovered as a granzyme A (GzmA) target in cells undergoing caspase-independent T cell-mediated death, that contains 3 DNases (the base excision repair endonuclease APE1, 5\u2032\u22123\u2032 exonuclease TREX1, and endonuclease NM23-H1). NM23-H1 and TREX1 are activated by GzmA cleavage of the inhibitor SET protein to cause single-stranded DNA damage Other components include a DNA binding protein (HMGB2) that preferentially binds to distorted or damaged DNA, and the PP2A inhibitor pp32/PHAP-I. The SET complex plays an important role in the early phase of the HIV-1 lifecycle by inhibiting autointegration.SET proteinA protein (suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax, 290aa) involved in apoptosis, transcription, nucleosome assembly and histone binding. It is a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A and modifies phosphorylation of histone H4 with effects on nucleosome structure. The SET domain is found in a number of proteins involved in embryonic development in plants and animals. For example, SETD8 (SET domain-containing protein 8, histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD8, EC 2.1.1.43, 393aa) specifically monomethylates Lys20 of histone H4, probably contributing to the maintenance of proper higher order structure of DNA during mitosis. See SET complex.seven-membrane spanning receptorsSee G-protein-coupled receptors.sevenlessA Drosophila gene (sev) that is required for development of the R7 cell in each ommatidium in the eye. Gene product is a receptor tyrosine kinase (EC 2.7.10.1, 2554aa), related to the insulin receptor, for which the ligand is the product of the bride of sevenless gene. In the downstream signalling cascade son-of-sevenless plays an important part.severe combined immunodeficiency diseaseA range of serious disorders of the immune system (severe congenital immunodeficiency disease, SCID). In all forms there is deficiency in T cell-mediated immune responses (T\u2212) but B-cells and NK cells may or may not be affected. The commonest form is caused by mutation in the interleukin 2-receptor (IL2RG) gene (X-linked SCID; T\u2212, B+, NK\u2212). Autosomal recessive SCID (T\u2212, B+, NK\u2212 SCID) is caused by mutation in the JAK3 gene; T\u2212, B+, NK+ SCID is caused by mutation in the IL7R gene, the CD45 gene, or the CD3D gene; T\u2212, B\u2212, NK\u2212 SCID is caused by mutation in the ADA (adenosine deaminase ) gene; T\u2212, B\u2212, NK+ SCID is caused by mutation in the RAG1 and 2 genes; T\u2212, B\u2212, NK+ SCID combined with sensitivity to ionizing radiation is caused by mutation in the artemis gene. Gene therapy has been used to treat some patients with ADA deficiency.severinA protein (362aa) of the villin/gelsolin family from Dictyostelium that binds to the barbed ends of F-actin microfilaments in a Ca2+-dependent manner, blocking further assembly. Not, apparently, essential for movement.sex chromatinCondensed chromatin of the inactivated X chromosome in female mammals (Barr body).sex chromosomeThe chromosome that determines the sex of an animal. In humans the two sex chromosomes (X and Y) are dissimilar, the female has two X chromosomes (XX), and the male is heterogametic (XY); sperm are either X or Y. A portion of the X and Y chromosomes is similar and is known as the pseudoautosomal region. In many organisms, there is only one sex chromosome, and one sex is XX, the other X0. A different system operates in birds, some fish and crustaceans, and some insects; the the ovum determines the sex, the male being homogametic (ZZ) and the female ZW. There is apparently no homology between the XY and ZW systems.sex-ductionThe transfer of genes from one bacterium to another by the process of conjugation. May involve one bacterium with an F\u2032-plasmid, in which case the process is called F-duction.\nsex hormoneHormone that is secreted by gonads, or that influences gonadal development. Examples are estrogen, testosterone, gonadotrophins.sex-linked disorderA genetic defect most commonly seen in heterogametic individuals (males in mammals), the consequence of a mutation in a gene on the unpaired portion of the X chromosome so that there is only one copy of the allele. Only homozygous females will show the defect.sex piliFine filamentous projections (pili) on the surface of a bacterium that are important in conjugation. Often seem to be coded for by plasmids that confer conjugative potential on the host; in the case of the F-plasmid, the F-pili are 8\u22129\u00a0nm diameter and several microns long, composed of pilin. Whether the pili merely serve to establish and maintain adhesive contact between the partners in conjugation, or whether DNA is actually transferred through the central core of the pilus is still unresolved, although a simple adhesion role is more generally accepted.Sezary cellsSee Sezary syndrome.Sezary syndromeA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, affecting CD4+ cells, an advanced form of mycosis fungoides, in which skin all over the body is reddened, itchy, peeling, and painful.

Generally used in the context of sequence analysis (shotgun sequencing) carried out by chopping DNA (or even the whole genome) into many small sections of random length, sequencing them all, some many times, and pasting them together using computer methods that recognise overlap, as opposed to working systematically from one end.Shp\n(1) Protein tyrosine phosphatases with SH2 domains that are recruited to the ITIM motif of receptor tyrosine kinases and play an important role in the control of cytokine signalling. Shp-1 (haematopoietic cell phosphatase, PTP1C, PTPN6, 595aa) is important in regulating antigen responses in T-cells. See motheaten. Shp-2 (Syp, PTP2C, PTPN11, 593aa) functions downstream of several growth factor receptors and has a role in cell spreading and migration; the homozygous mutation in mice is lethal.

Interacts with the MAP kinase HOG1. See Skp.\nsickle cell anaemiaDisease common in ethnic groups originally from areas in which malaria is endemic. The cause is a point mutation in haemoglobin (valine instead of glutamic acid at position 6), and the altered haemoglobin (HbS) crystallizes readily at low oxygen tension. In consequence, erythrocytes from homozygotes change from the normal discoid shape to a sickled shape when the oxygen tension is low, and these sickled cells become trapped in capillaries or damaged in transit, leading to severe anaemia. In heterozygotes, the disadvantages of the abnormal haemoglobin are apparently outweighed by increased resistance to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, probably because parasitized cells tend to sickle and are then removed from circulation.sideraminesSee sideromycins.sideroblastic anaemiaX-linked sideroblastic anaemia (XLSA) is caused by mutation in the gene encoding delta-aminolevulinate synthase-2 (ALA synthase), the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of haem biosynthesis.

In gymnosperms the sieve cells retain their nuclei and the conducting connections have less obvious pores than sieve plates.sigma factorsProkaryotic initiation factors (\u03c3 factors) that promote attachment of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites. Every molecule of RNA polymerase has one sigma factor subunit which is released following attachment and different sigma factors are involved under different environmental conditions. For example, in E. coli, \u03c370 (RpoD, 613aa) is the primary sigma factor for housekeeping proteins, \u03c354 (RpoN, 477aa) is involved under conditions of nitrogen limitation, \u03c338 (RpoS, 111aa) under starvation conditions, amongst others.sigma receptorsReceptors originally identified by their ability to bind various psychoactive drugs but then shown to be non-opioid receptors. Sigma receptor 1 (sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1, 223aa) is widely expressed and involved in lipid transport from the ER, regulates various other receptors and potassium channels and has a role in calcium signalling. Considered to be involved in learning, memory and mood alteration. Sigma 2 receptors, unlike sigma-1 are not coupled to Gi/o proteins and sigma-2 receptor specific ligands induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion.signal peptidase complex\nSPC A multi subunit serine peptidase (protease) complex located in the ER membrane that cleaves the signal sequence from proteins that are destined for export. Cleavage occurs as soon as the cleavage site of the translocating polypeptide is exposed in the lumen of the ER. Mammalian signal peptidase is a complex of five different polypeptide chains; SPC12 and SPC25 have substantial cytoplasmic domains and span the membrane twice, SPC18, SPC21, SPC22/23 are single-spanning membrane proteins mostly exposed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Also known as docking protein. Heterodimeric, both protomers (\u03b1, 638aa; \u03b2, 271aa) having GTP-binding capacity, though dissimilar binding sites. Not until the complex of SRP, ribosome, message, and nascent polypeptide chain binds to the SRP-receptor is the block to further chain elongation released \u2013 and concurrently the SRP is released, leaving the ribosome attached to the ER membrane. Co-translational transport of the polypeptide delivers it into the lumen of the ER.signal sequence\n(1) An N-terminal sequence (~20aa, usually hydrophobic but with some positive residues) that interacts with signal recognition particle and is present on proteins that are destined either to be secreted or to be membrane components. It is normally absent from the mature protein, having been removed from the growing peptide chain by the signal peptidase complex located on the cisternal face of the endoplasmic reticulum. (2) Any sequence that determines the organelle for which the protein is destined.signal transduction\nSignal-response coupling The cascade of processes by which an extracellular signal (typically a hormone or neurotransmitter) interacts with a receptor at the cell surface, causing a change in the level of a second messenger (for example calcium or cyclic AMP) and ultimately effects a change in the cell\u2019s functioning (for example, triggering glucose uptake, or initiating cell division).

Silanization can neutralize surface charges, thus eliminating non-specific binding. Often used to prepare surfaces for the binding of DNA fragments in microarrays.silent geneA gene that is not phenotypically expressed. This can arise because of mutation of the gene itself (e.g. a nonsense codon causing premature termination of translation), a defect in some upstream control, or a mutation that renders the product inactive in some way.silent mutationMutations that have no effect on phenotype because they do not affect the activity of the product of the gene, usually because of codon ambiguity.siliconizationNon-covalent coating of surface with a layer of silicone oil making it less adhesive or reactive.

Details: http://openwetware.org/wiki/SOB\nSOCSFamily of proteins suppressor of cytokine signalling, SOCS 1-7 and CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein, 258aa) with SH2 domains that are induced in response to cytokines and act as negative feedback regulator of JAKs in the intracellular signalling pathway. SOCS1 (JAK-binding protein, JAB, STAT-induced STAT inhibitor-1, SSI-1, 211aa) is induced by IL6 and is probably the substrate recognition component of an ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins and seems to recognize JAK2. Other SOCs family members are induced by different cytokines and have slightly different targets (e.g. SOCS2, 198aa, is a negative regulator in the growth hormone/IGF1 signalling pathway).sodium channel\n(1) Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV1.1, etc.) are responsible for electrical excitability of neurons. They are multi-subunit transmembrane channels with an aqueous pore around 0.4\u00a0nm diameter, with a negatively charged region internally (the \u2018selectivity filter\u2019) that blocks the passage of anions. The alpha subunits form the pore itself, the beta subunits vary between tissues and regulate the sensitivity. The channel opens in response to a small depolarization of the cell (usually caused by an approaching action potential), by a multistep process. Around 1000 sodium ions pass in the next millisecond, before the channel spontaneously closes (an event with single-step kinetics). The channel is then refractory to further depolarizations until returned to near the resting potential. There are around 100 channels per mm2 in unmyelinated axons; in myelinated axons, they are concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier. Mutations are associated with various forms of epilepsy, muscular disorders (periodic paralysis, myotonia), long QT syndrome, Brugada\u2019s syndrome-1, erythromelalgia, congenital insensitivity to pain and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. Many toxins (e.g. tetrodotoxin) affect the channel. (2) Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels are a family of nonvoltage-gated sodium-permeable ion channels inhibited by the diuretic drug, amiloride. They are well characterized in epithelia where they constitute the rate-limiting step for sodium ion reabsorption. They are heterotrimers of highly homologous alpha, beta and gamma subunits which also have homology with degenerins from C. elegans. Gain of function mutations in the beta or gamma subunits is the cause of Liddle\u2019s disease. A delta subunit that will assemble with the beta and gamma subunits to form a functional channel is also known.

A multi-subunit enzyme (EC 3.6.1.3), having a catalytic alpha subunit with multiple isoforms and a smaller beta subunit. The pump moves 3 sodium ions out of the cell, and 2 potassium ions in, for each ATP hydrolyzed. The sodium gradient established is used for several purposes (see facilitated diffusion, action potential), while the potassium gradient is dissipated through the potassium leak channel.sodokuRat-bite fever, an infection by Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minus, following the bite of a rat or contact with rat saliva.soft agarSemi-solid agar used to gelate medium for culture of animal cells.

It localizes to Golgi apparatus where it appears to regulate protein transport events, cell adhesion, and cell polarization for locomotion. (2) In S. cerevisiae a suppressor (901aa) of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase mutant.sol-gel transformationTransition between more fluid cytoplasm (endoplasm) and stiffer gel-like ectoplasm proposed as a mechanism for amoeboid locomotion: since the endoplasm cannot really be considered a simple fluid and has viscoelastic properties like a gel, the term is misleading and the mechanism is not generally accepted.solanidineThe aglycone of solanine and chaconine that is produced by the action of solanidine UDP-glycosyltransferases. Solanine has a branched trisaccharide galactose-(glucose)- rhamnose moiety, chaconine a glucose-(rhamnose)-rhamnose moiety.solanineA glycoalkaloid toxin found in species of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) that includes potatoes. It can occur naturally in the any part of the plant, including the leaves, fruit, and tubers. It is very toxic even in small quantities.

For example, solute carrier family 1 (SLC1) comprises neuronal/epithelial high affinity glutamate/ neutral amino acid transporters, SLC2 family is of facilitated glucose transporters (GLUT proteins) and has 14 members. The superfamily does not include ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters, ion channels or aquaporins.somaclonePlants derived from somatic cells that have been grown in culture. Somaclonal variation is variation seen after repeated subculture.somatic cellUsually any cell of a multicellular organism that will not contribute to the production of gametes, i.e. most cells of which an organism is made: not a germ cell. Notice, however, the alternative use in somatic mesoderm.somatic cell geneticsMethod for identifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene without sexual crossing. Unstable heterokaryons are made between the cell of interest and another cell with identifiably different characteristics (or without the gene in question), and a series of clones isolated. By correlating retention of gene expression with the remaining chromosomes, it is possible to deduce which chromosome must carry the gene. Human-mouse heterokaryons have been extensively used in this sort of work.somatic cell nuclear transferTransfer of the nucleus of a somatic cell into an enucleated egg as a means of cloning.somatic embryogenesisThe process in plants (asexual embryogenesis) in which somatic cells differentiate into embryos and ultimately into plants via a series of characteristic morphological stages. Somatic cells in plants retain totipotency.somatic hybrid\nHeterokaryon formed between two somatic cells, usually from different species. See somatic cell genetics.somatic mesodermThat portion of the embryonic mesoderm that is associated with the body wall, and is divided from the splanchnic (visceral) mesoderm by the coelomic cavity.\nsomatic mutation\nMutation that occurs in the somatic tissues of an organism, and that will not, therefore, be heritable, since it is not present in the germ cells. Some neoplasia is due to somatic mutation; a more conspicuous example is the reversion of some branches of variegated shrubs to the wild-type (completely green) phenotype. Somatic mutation is probably also important in generating diversity in V-gene regions of immunoglobulins.somatic recombinationOne of the mechanisms used to generate diversity in antibody production is to rearrange the DNA in B-cells during their differentiation, a process that involves cutting and splicing the immunoglobulin genes. Somatic recombination via homologous crossing-over occurs at a low frequency in Aspergillus, Drosophila and Saccharomyces and in mammalian cells in culture. It may be detected through the production of homozygous patches or sectors after mitosis of cells heterozygous for suitable marker genes.somatocrininGrowth hormone-releasing factor. See growth hormone-releasing hormone.somatoliberinGrowth hormone-releasing factor, somatotropin-releasing factor. See growth-hormone releasing hormone.somatomedinGeneric term for insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) produced in the liver and released in response to somatotropin. Somatomedins stimulate the growth of bone and muscle, and also influence calcium, phosphate, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Somatomedin A (180aa) is IGF-II, somatomedin C (153aa) is IGF-I. Somatomedin B is a serum factor of uncertain function derived by proteolytic cleavage from vitronectin. See somatostatin.somatostatinGastrointestinal and hypothalamic peptide hormone (two forms: 14 and 28aa); found in gastric mucosa, pancreatic islets, nerves of the gastrointestinal tract, in posterior pituitary and in the central nervous system. Inhibits gastric secretion and motility: in hypothalamus/pituitary inhibits somatotropin release. Somatostatin acts through five G protein-coupled receptor subtypes (SSTR1-5), displaying a tissue specific distribution with multiple subtypes present on many cells. A neuropeptide, cortistatin, strongly resembles somatostatin. See also Table H2.somatotropeCell in the anterior pituitary which secretes growth hormone.somatotrophin\nUS. somatropin. Hormone (human growth hormone, hGH, 191aa) released by anterior pituitary that stimulates release of somatomedin, thereby causing growth. See also Table H2.somitesSegmentally arranged blocks of mesoderm lying on either side of the notochord and neural tube during development of the vertebrate embryo.

Unlike rice it is a C4 plant.sorocarpFruiting body formed by some cellular slime moulds; has both stalk and spore-mass.\nsortilinA sorting receptor (neurotensin receptor 3, 831aa) in the Golgi compartment and a clearance receptor on the cell surface. Required for protein transport from the Golgi to lysosomes and important for the sorting and trafficking of sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins).sorting nexinsA large family of proteins that characteristically have a phox-homology (PX) domain and are required for the endocytosis and sorting of transmembrane proteins. Sorting nexin-1 (SNX1, 522aa) is a component of the mammalian retromer complex. Human SNX1, -2, and -4 have been proposed to play a role in receptor trafficking and have been shown to bind to several receptor tyrosine kinases. SNX-6 (406aa) interacts with members of the TGF\u03b2 family of receptor serine-threonine kinases. Yeast Vps5p is the orthologue of mammalian sorting nexin-1.sorting outPhenomenon observed to occur when mixed aggregates of dissimilar embryonic cell types are formed in vitro. The original aggregate sorts out so that similar cells come together into homotypic domains, usually with one cell type sorting out to form a central mass that is surrounded by the other cell type. Much controversy has arisen over the years as to the underlying mechanism, whether there is specificity in the adhesive interactions (which would imply tissue-specific receptor-ligand interactions), or whether it is sufficient to suppose that there are quantitative differences in homo- and hetero-typic adhesion (the differential adhesion hypothesis). With the exception perhaps of the main protagonists, most cell biologists consider that there are probably elements both of tissue specificity (CAMs) and of quantitative adhesive differences involved.sorusA group of sporangia or spore cases, e.g. on the underside of fern leaves.sos\n(1) Guanine-nucleotide releasing factors (sos1, 1333aa; sos2, 1332aa), the mammalian homologues of son-of-sevenless.

A frameshift mutation in the spartin gene is the cause of Troyer syndrome (a form of spastic paraplegia).spasminProtein (180aa in Vorticella) that forms the spasmoneme. Thought to change its shape when the calcium ion concentration rises, and to revert when the calcium concentration falls: the reversible shape change is used as a motor mechanism.

Capable of shortening faster than any actin-myosin system, and of expanding actively. See spasmin.spastic paraplegiasA set of neurodegenerative disorders in which there is lower-limb spasticity (increased muscle tone with involuntary spasms or sustained contractions) and muscle weakness with a variety of different causes.

It is thought that the domain may be a member of the Ig superfamily and as such may function as a protein-binding interface.speciationFormation of new biological species. Usually considered to require isolation of a sub-population of the ancestral species either geographically (classically seen with remote islands), by occupying a different niche (adaptive radiation), through acquisition of behavioural changes that restrict mating, so that distinct genetic variations accumulate and prevent further interbreeding, or by polyploidy that makes interbreeding with the original species impossible. See sympatric speciation.speciesA group of individuals that are capable of interbreeding with each other but not with members of other groups. Usually a result of some form of isolation; in the early stages speciation can be reversed if reproductive isolation is lost or the niches change and overlap. Species are grouped into genera and divided into subspecies and varieties or cultivars. The name of the genus should be capitalised and the species name should not \u2013 thus Homo sapiens, genus Homo, species sapiens and both should be italicised.

Spondin 1 (F-spondin, vascular smooth muscle cell growth-promoting factor (VSGP), 624aa) is a secreted extracellular matrix protein that interacts with a central sequence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and prevents proteolytic processing by beta-secretase. Spondin 2 (M-spondin, mindin, 331aa) is a ligand for neutrophil and macrophage integrins and binding via mindin regulates the expression of Rho GTPases in dendritic cells. Mindin-deficient mice exhibit defective inflammatory and immune responses. The R-spondins regulate beta-catenin signalling. R-spondin 1 (RSPO1, 263aa) is expressed in enteroendocrine cells as well as in epithelial cells from various tissues. Mutations are associated with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis with squamous cell carcinoma of skin and sex reversal.

In S. cerevisiae Ste20p (sterile 20 protein, 939aa) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K) involved in the mating pathway. Human homologues (at least 28) have the kinase domain but linked to other domains that confer specificity.stealth proteinsA protein family that is conserved from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. In bacteria they help pathogens to avoid the host innate immune system and are involved in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides such as capsular polysaccharides of pathogenic streptocoocci. Stealth protein GNPTAB is involved in adding mannose residues to enzymes destined for lysosomes and is defective in human I-cell disease.STEAPOne of a small family of cell-surface antigens that are expressed in prostate cancer and are potential targets for antibody-mediated therapy and diagnosis. STEAP1 (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate, EC 1.16.1.-, 339aa) is expressed at the cell-cell junctions of the secretory epithelium of prostate and strongly expressed in prostate cancer cells. It is a metalloreductase that can reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and Cu2+ to Cu+ using NAD+ as an acceptor. STEAP2 (490aa), STEAP3 (488aa) and STEAP4 (459aa) have similar properties but some are more ubiquitously expressed. See papin, PSM, PTCA-1, PSCA.stearic acidN-octadecanoic acid. See fatty acids.steatoblastsCells that give rise to fat cells (adipocytes).steel factorMurine equivalent of stem cell factor, the ligand (273aa) for kit.Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndromeA neurological disorder (progressive supranuclear palsy) that can be caused by defects in tau protein although the more typical forms are linked to other loci. There are some features resembling Parkinson\u2019s disease.stefinsFamily of cysteine peptidase inhibitors. Stefin A (cystatin A, keratolinin, 98aa) inhibits cathepsins D, B, H and L. Stefin B (cystatin B, 98aa) has anti-peptidase activity against cathepsins L, H and B. Mutations in stefin B are associated with myoclonic epilepsy of Unverricht and Lundborg.stele\nvascular cylinder The vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) inside the cortex of roots and stems of vascular plants.stem cell\n(1) Cell that gives rise to a lineage of cells (progenitor cell). (2) More commonly used of a cell that, upon division, produces dissimilar daughters, one replacing the original stem cell, the other differentiating further (e.g. stem cells in basal layers of skin, in haematopoietic tissue, and in meristems). Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are totipotent, able to produce any cell type; following modification in vitro they can be used to produce chimeric embryos and thus transgenic animals. Pluripotent stem cells are more limited and can produce only some differentiated cells. Quiescent stem cells may have a repair function and for example, the satellite cells in the skeletal muscles of mammals are quiescent myoblasts that will proliferate after wounding and give rise to more muscle cells by fusion. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated cells that have been experimentally induced to revert to a pluripotent state. Originally this required transfection of genes with the risk that the iPSCs were potentially neoplastic; the hope is that eventually it will be possible to take cells from a patient, revert them to pluripotency and use them therapeutically.stem cell factorA growth factor (mast cell growth factor, 273aa, 245aa when processed), the ligand for kit. Stimulates proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid series. See steel factor.stem cell-derived tyrosine kinaseThe murine homologue of the human ron receptor tyrosine kinase (STK, macrophage-stimulating protein receptor, EC 2.7.10.1, CD136, 1378aa). The precursor is cleaved into alpha (281aa) and beta (1068aa) chains which form a disulphide-linked heterodimer. Expressed on macrophages. Ligand is macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), a serum protein activated by the coagulation cascade.stem-and-loop structureTerm for the structure of tRNAs which has four base-paired \u2018stems\u2019 and three \u2018loops\u2019 (not base-paired), one of which contains the anticodon.stenohalineDescriptive of an organism that is unable to tolerate a range of salinities Cf euryhaline.\nstenospermocarpyOne cause of seedlessness in, for example, grapes. Pollination and fertilization occur as normal, but the embryo and/or endosperm abort two to four weeks after fertilization; seed development ceases but the ovary wall pericarp continues to grow and forms berries. See parthenocarpy.stentA device inserted into a blood vessel to keep it open, usually a small metal coil or mesh tube. Similar devices are used in the GI tract and ureter.StentorGenus of large multinucleate protozoa (up to 2\u00a0mm long) with a ring of apical cilia used in feeding on bacteria. Spirotrich ciliates. Usually attached to a surface in freshwater ponds etc. but can relocate. Sometimes called the \u2018trumpet animalcule\u2019 because of its shape.stereociliumSee stereovillus.stereotaxisA system by which the precise 3-D co-ordinates of a target site are identified, allowing focussed delivery of radiation or precise insertion of a microelectrode.stereovillusMicrofilament bundle-supported projection, several microns long, from the apical surface of sensory epithelial cells (hair cells) in inner ear: like a microvillus, but larger. It is stiff and may act as a transducer directly, or merely restrict the movement of the single sensory cilium (which does have an axoneme). Also described on cells of pseudo-stratified epithelium of the epididymal duct. Sometimes called stereocilia but they do not have axonemes so this is potentially confusing.sterigmatocystinAn intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway that generates aflatoxins.Sternberg-Reed cellsSee Hodgkin\u2019s disease.steroid finger motifSee steroid receptor.steroid hormonesA group of structurally related hormones, based on cholesterol from which they are synthesized. They control sex and growth characteristics, are highly lipophilic, so can readily cross the plasma membrane, and are unique in that their receptors are in the nucleus, rather than on the plasma membrane. The five major subgroups are glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestagens.steroid receptorsReceptors for steroid hormones that have a conserved domain (the \u2018steroid finger\u2019 motif) containing two C4-type zinc fingers. Type I are cytoplasmic until they bind a hormone and release a chaperone, then they move to the nucleus and act as transcription factors. Type II are nuclear transcription factors and other members of this type bind non-steroid ligands (thyroid hormone, vitamin A).steroid response elementDNA sequence in the promoter region of a gene that is recognized and bound by a steroid receptor. Informative web-pages: http://www.ultranet.com/~jkimball/BiologyPages/S/SteroidREs.html\nsteroidogenic acute regulatory proteinA mitochondrial protein (START domain-containing protein 1, StAR1, 285aa) that mediates cholesterol transfer and promotes steroid hormone production in the ovary, testis and adrenal gland. Defective in congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (lipoid CAH).sterol regulatory element\nSRE See sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, steroid response element.sterol regulatory element binding proteins\nSREBPs A family of membrane-bound transcription factors important in both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. SREBPs (SREBP1, 1147aa; SREBP2, 1142aa) regulate the expression of over 30 genes. SREBPs are regulated by proteolytic cleavage (see insig-1, SCAP), rapid degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and sumoylation.sterolsMolecules that have a 17-carbon steroid structure, but with additional alcohol groups and side chains. Commonest example is cholesterol.Stickler\u2019s syndromeAn autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder in which there are ocular, orofacial, auditory, and skeletal anomalies. Type 1 is caused by mutation in the collagen 2A1 gene and is morphologically similar to Wagner\u2019s syndrome, Type 2 is a result of mutation in collagen 11A1 and Type 3 by mutation in collagen 11A2. An autosomal recessive form can be caused by mutation in the COL9A1 gene.sticky endsThe short stretches of single-stranded DNA produced by cutting DNA with restriction endonucleases whose site of cleavage is not at the axis of symmetry. The cut generates two complementary sequences that will hybridize (stick) to one another or to the sequences on other DNA fragments produced by the same restriction endonuclease.stilbene synthaseImportant enzymes (stilbene synthase 1, EC 2.3.1.95, 392aa in grape, Vitis vinifera; many others are known) in the stilbene pathway. The levels of stilbenes increases in grapevine in response to biotic and abiotic stress, but also during berry ripening. Resveratrol is a stilbene.Still\u2019s diseaseA systemic inflammatory disorder (systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis). Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease is probably just the adult version of the same disorder.STIM proteinsSingle-pass transmembrane proteins localized predominantly in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum that appear to function as sensors of ER Ca2+ levels and redistribute into a punctate pattern when calcium levels are low. STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1, 685aa) communicates with and opens CRAC channels located in the plasma membrane by interacting with Orai1. STIM2 (746aa) can form heterodimers with STIM1 and may inhibit STIM1-mediated Ca2+ influx.stimulated emission depletion microscopyA method of obtaining greater resolution in optical microscopy than is possible with standard confocal techniques. A small region of the specimen is illuminated with a very brief flash of light that stimulates fluorescence but is followed by illumination with a \u2018ring\u2019 of light at a wavelenth that depletes the capacity to fluoresce. The net effect is to restict the stimulation of fluorescence to an extremely small spot, smaller than that set by the point source of a confocal microscope and improving the resolution by an order of magnitude.stimulus-secretion couplingA term used to describe the events that link receipt of a stimulus with the release of materials from membrane-bounded vesicles (the analogy is with excitation-contraction coupling in the control of muscle contraction). A classical example is the link between membrane depolarization at the presynaptic terminal and the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.sting cells\nNematocysts of coelenterates.stipeA stalk, especially of fungal fruiting bodies or of large brown algae.stipuleA small appendages at the base of a leafstalk in certain plants; usually paired.STK\n(1) Stem cell-derived tyrosine kinase.

(4) Streptokinase.stochasticRandom or probabilistic.stoichiometryRatio of the participating molecules in a reaction \u2013 in the case of an enzyme-substrate or receptor-ligand interaction should be a small integer.Stoke\u2019s radiusStoke\u2019s law of viscosity defines the frictional coefficient for a particle moving through a fluid, a coefficient that depends upon the viscosity of the fluid and the radius of the particle. The apparent radius of a molecule sedimenting under centrifugal force calculated from this law (the Stoke\u2019s radius) is a feature of the tertiary structure and thus informative about the molecule in question.stolonA creeping horizontal stem that forms roots. A characteristic method of spreading in plants such as the strawberry.stoma\nPl. stomata. Pore in the epidermis of leaves and some stems, which permits gas exchange through the epidermis. Can be open or closed, depending upon the physiological state of the plant. Flanked by stomatal guard cells.STOMAGENA mesophyll-derived factor (45aa) that promotes epidermal stomatal development in Arabidopsis, generated from a 102aa precursor. If overexpressed or externally applied it increases stomatal density. It may compete with EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTORs for binding to the receptor TOO MANY MOUTHS.stomatinAn erythrocyte integral membrane protein (Band 7.2b, 288aa), defective in overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis. Stomatin is found in most tissues and extensively throughout the animal kingdom, although its function is unclear. Stomatin-like 1 (STOML1, SLP1, 394aa), STOML2 (356aa) and STOML3 (287aa) are known in humans; STOML2 is overexpressed in a range of epithelial tumours. Similar genes (mec-2, unc-24, unc-1) are found in C. elegans and mutations in all of these affect the nervous system.stomatocytosisA condition in which erythrocytes adopt an abnormal shape because of ion leakage across the plasma membrane. In one form (hereditary stomatocytosis-I, overhydrated stomatocytosis) there appears to be a defect in stomatin. A second form, stomatocytosis-II, in which there is no increase in fragility, has been reported. A different disorder, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (xerocytosis; desiccytosis), is caused by excessive leakage of potassium from the erythrocytes which lose water and become more fragile.stone cellSee sclereid.stoninA family of adapter proteins (stonin-1, stoned B-like factor, 735aa; stonin-2, stoned B, 905aa) that are involved in the endocytic machinery and may facilitate clathrin-coated vesicle uncoating. In Drosophila stoned B (1262aa) may mediate the retrieval of synaptotagmin from the plasma membrane.STOP\n(1) A calmodulin-binding microtubule-stabilizing protein (stable tubulin-only protein, microtubule-associated protein 6, 813aa) that inhibits cold temperature-induced disassembly, particularly in neurites. A similar protein, MAP6 domain-containing protein 1 (199aa) probably has similar properties. (2) In Arabidopsis a protein, SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY 1 (STOP1, 499aa) a zinc-finger transcription factor that is important in responding to major stress factors in acid soils such aluminum (Al3+). (3) See short stop (shot).\nstop codonSee termination codons.stop transfer sequenceAmino acid sequence (membrane anchor sequence) that causes cessation of the co-translational transfer of a protein across a membrane and leaves the protein embedded in the membrane. Generally consists of long sequences of hydrophobic residues.storage diseasesSee lysosomal diseases.storage granules\n(1) Membrane-bounded vesicles containing condensed secretory materials (often in an inactive, zymogen, form). Otherwise known as zymogen granules or condensing vacuoles. (2) Granules found in plastids, or in cytoplasm; assumed to be \u2018food reserves\u2019, often of glycogen or other carbohydrate polymer.storage pool disease\nSPD Platelet defects in which the numbers and contents of granules are affected. In alpha-SPD (gray platelet syndrome) there are severe reductions in the alpha-granules and their contents, in delta-SPD the defect is only in the dense granules (delta-granules) and in a third form (alpha/delta-SPD) both types of granule are affected.storage vacuoleIn plants, vacuoles used to sequester products used for defence, or toxins that would harm the plant, or materials for later use. Contrast with lytic vacuoles.STRSee satellite DNA\nstrain birefringenceSee birefringence.Strasburger cellA nucleated cell in phloem tissue of gymnosperms, closely associated with a sieve cell.stratified epitheliumAn epithelium composed of multiple layers of cells, only the basal layer being in contact with the basal lamina (see basement membrane). The basal layer is of stem cells that divide to produce the cells of the upper layers; in skin, these become heavily keratinised before dying and being shed as squames. Stratified epithelia usually have a mechanical/protective role.stratifinAn adapter molecule (14-3-3-sigma, epithelial cell marker protein 1, 248aa) found mainly in tissues enriched in stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium. Has a modulatory role in a range of signalling pathways.stratum corneumOutermost layer of skin, composed of clear, dead, scale-like cells with little remaining except keratin.stratum granulosumLayer of granular cells underlying the stratum corneum in the skin of vertebrates. The cells accumulate keratin and gradually become compressed to form the cornified cells of the outermost layer.stratum lucidumA thin, clear layer of dead cells in vertebrate skin, lying between the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum of thick skin, as on palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.stratum MalpighiiOne of the layers of the skin in vertebrates, lying between the proliferating cells of the basal layer (stratum germinatum) and the stratum granulosum where keratin deposition occurs. Also known as the prickle cell layer. Location of many of the disorders of the skin.streptavidinA protein (183aa) from Streptomycetes avidinii that has an avidin domain and binds biotin with high affinity. Forms a homotetramer that binds four biotin molecules. A useful experimental tool although its biological function is unclear.StreptobacillusA Gram-negative bacterium (Streptobacillus moniliformis) infective agent of rat-bite fever (sodoku).streptococcal M-proteinCell wall protein of streptococci used as a taxonomic marker for different strains of Group A streptococci (more than 100 serotypes are known). The M-protein confers anti-phagocytic properties on the cell and is present as hair-like fimbriae on the surface. M-protein is an important virulence factor, and antibodies directed against M-protein are essential for phagocytic killing of the bacteria.streptococcal toxinsGroup of haemolytic exotoxins released by Streptococcus spp. \u03b1-haemolysin: 26\u221239\u00a0kDa (four types), forms ring-like structures in membranes (see streptolysin O). Lipid target unclear; \u03b2-haemolysin: a hot-cold haemolysin with sphingomyelinase C activity; \u03b3-haemolysin: complex of two proteins (29 and 26\u00a0kDa) that act synergistically, rabbit erythrocytes particularly sensitive; \u03b4-toxin: heat-stable peptide (5\u00a0kDa) with high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids. Seems to act in a detergent-like manner (cf.\nsubtilysin), but may form hydrophilic transmembrane pores by cooperative interaction with other \u03b4-toxin molecules; leucocidin (Panton-Valentine leucocidin): two components F (fast migration on CM-cellulose column: 32\u00a0kDa), and S (slow: 38\u00a0kDa). Mode of action contentious. See also Streptococcus, streptolysins O and S, erythrogenic toxin. Streptococcus pyogenes releases a range of pyogenic (fever-inducing) exotoxins, several of which are superantigens with sequence homology to staphylococcal toxins (SPEA, erythrogenic toxin, 251aa; SPEC, 235aa). SPEB is a cysteine peptidase (streptopain, EC 3.4.22.10, 398aa).streptococcins\nBacteriocins released by streptococci.StreptococcusGenus of Gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. Some species (Strep. pyogenes in particular) are responsible for important diseases in humans (pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever): Strep. pneumoniae (Pneumococcus pneumoniae; Diplococcus pneumoniae; Fraenkel\u2019s bacillus) is the main culprit in lobar- and broncho-pneumonia. Streptococci have anti-phagocytic components (hyaluronic acid-rich capsule and M-protein), and release various toxins (streptolysins O and S, erythrogenic toxin) and enzymes (streptokinase, streptodornase, hyaluronidase, and proteinase). The \u03b1-haemolytic streptococci (viridans streptococci) produce limited haemolysis on blood agar; include S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. pneumoniae. The \u03b2-haemolytic streptococci, of which S. pyogenes is the only species, though there are many serotypes, produce a broad zone of almost complete haemolysis on blood agar as a result of streptolysin O and S release. The \u03b3-streptococci are non-haemolytic (e.g. S. faecalis).streptodornaseMixture of four DNAases (EC 3.1.21.1) released by streptococci. By digesting DNA released from dead cells the enzyme reduces the viscosity of pus and allows the organism greater motility.streptograminsGroup of antibiotics that consist of mixtures of two structurally distinct compounds, type A and type B, which are separately bacteriostatic, but bactericidal in appropriate ratios. They act at the level of inhibition of translation through binding to the bacterial ribosome. An example is quinupristin.streptokinaseA non-enzymic plasminogen activator (440aa) released by Streptococcus pyogenes. Activates plasminogen by forming a complex. There are various forms (streptokinases A, C, G).streptolydiginAntibiotic produced by Streptomyces lydicus that blocks peptide chain elongation by binding to bacterial RNA polymerase. Research paper: http://www.jbc.org/content/270/41/23930.long\nstreptolysin OOxygen-labile thiol-activated haemolysin (571aa). Haemolysis is inhibited by cholesterol, and only cells with cholesterol in their membranes are susceptible. Toxin aggregates are linked to cholesterol to form a channel 30\u00a0nm diameter in the membrane, and non-osmotic lysis follows. Markedly inhibits neutrophil movement and stimulates secretion, but has little effect on monocytes. Cf.\nstreptolysin S.streptolysin SOxygen-stable haemolysin of Streptococcus pyogenes. Thought to be a peptide of ca 28aa: causes zone of \u03b2-haemolysis around streptococcal colonies on blood agar. Like complement-mediated haemolysis it appears to act in a one-hit mechanism. Toxic to leucocytes, platelets, and several cell lines. Has sequence homologies to the bacteriocin class of antimicrobial peptides. A nine-gene operon is required for SLS production: this includes a candidate gene for a bacteriocin prepropeptide, SagA, the likely SLS precursor and candidate genes for chemical modification of the bacteriocin propeptide and self protection, an ABC transporter for export and maturation proteolysis of the leader peptide, and an internal terminator motif for differential transcription of structural gene and accessory gene mRNAs. Cf.\nstreptolysin O. Article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC143243/?tool=pmcentrez\nStreptomycesGenus of Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria that grow slowly in soil or water as a branching filamentous mycelium similar to that of fungi. Important as the source of many antibiotics, e.g. streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, macrolides.streptomycinA water-soluble aminoglycoside antibiotic from the bacterium Streptomyces griseus. Commonly used antibiotic in cell culture media: acts only on prokaryotes, and blocks transition from initiation complex to chain-elongating ribosome.streptopainSee streptococcal exotoxins.streptovaricinsAntibiotics of the ansamycin class, produced by various Actinomycetes, that block initiation of transcription in prokaryotes. (Cf.\nrifamycins and rifampicin).streptozotocinMethyl nitroso-urea with a 2-substituted glucose, used as an antibiotic (effective against growing Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms), and also to induce a form of diabetes in experimental animals (rapidly induces pancreatic B cell necrosis if given in high dose). By using multiple low doses in a particular strain of mice, it is possible to produce insulitis followed later by diabetes, a model for Type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes in humans.stress related genesThe strongly regulated biotic stress related genes in plants include several PR-proteins (endochitinase (TC60929), chitinase (Q7XB39), osmotin-like proteins (P93621), thaumatin (Q7XAU7), disease response protein (Q45W75), tumour related proteins (P93378)), three 1,3-\u03b2-glucanases and several proteinase inhibitors. Early induction of genes encoding chitinases and 1,3-\u03b2-glucanases is a typical response of plants towards fungal pathogens.stress-fibresBundle of microfilaments and other proteins found in fibroblasts, particularly slow-moving fibroblasts cultured on rigid substrata. Shown to be contractile; have a periodicity reminiscent of the sarcomere. Anchored at one end to a focal adhesion, although sometimes seem to stretch between two focal adhesions.stress-induced proteinsAlternative and preferable name for heat-shock proteins of eukaryotic cells, which emphasises that the same small group of proteins is stimulated both by heat and various other stresses.stresscopinSee urocortin III.striated muscleMuscle in which the repeating units (sarcomeres) of the contractile myofibrils are arranged in register throughout the cell, resulting in transverse or oblique striations observable at the level of the light microscope, e.g. the voluntary (skeletal) and cardiac muscle of vertebrates.strigolactonesCarotenoid-derived plant hormones (sesquiterpenes) implicated in inhibition of shoot branching. Strigolactones act as a host-recognition signal for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, are released by the host plant and stimulate hyphal branching \u2018branching factors\u2019. They are also seed germination stimulants for the parasitic weeds Striga and Orobanche.stringA Drosophila protein of the Cdc25 family (M-phase inducer phosphatase, EC 3.1.3.48, 479aa) that activates mitosis by hydrolyzing phosphotyrosine 15 of the cyclin dependent kinase Cdc2. String is activated by tribbles and is transcribed in a spatial pattern controlled by the anterior-posterior and dorsoventral patterning systems. Cf.\ncysteine string protein.stringencyIn nucleic acid hybridization, the labelled probe is used to label matching sequences by base-pairing. Unbound probe is removed though a series of stringency washes. Low stringency washing (low temperature, high ionic strength), allows some mismatching of probe and target, and thus allows the detection of similar sequences at some cost in specificity. By contrast, high stringency conditions allow only closely matching sequence to remain base-paired.stringent controlOne of the two regulatory mechanisms used by E. coli to adjust rRNA output to amino acid availability (cf.\ngrowth-rate dependent control). Stringent control is mediated by alarmone ppGpp.striosomeOne of the components of the striatum region of the basal ganglia in the brain. The striatum is made of two parts, the matriosome and the striosome. Both receive input from the cortex (mostly frontal) and from dopaminergic (DA) neurons, but the striosome projects principally to DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN), the matriosome projects back to the frontal lobe.strobila\nPl. strobilae. A part or structure that buds to form a series of segments. In Scyphozoa, the sessile larval stage that produces medusoids by transverse fission. In Cestoda, the segmented body consisting of proglottides. Cf. strobilus.strobilus\nPl. strobili. (1) The cone-like reproductive structures of most gymnosperms and some pteridophytes.

The site of the dark reaction of photosynthesis. (2) Loose connective tissue with few cells.stromal cellA non-committal name for a resident cell of loose fibrous connective tissue.stromatolitesLarge rounded, multilayered fossils found in rocks dating from the Early Archaean (3.5mya), possibly before \u2018modern\u2019 cyanobacteria evolved. The layers are produced as a result of photosynthetic activity of bacterial colonies causing the precipitation of calcium carbonate that is combined with other sedimentary material trapped within the mucilage surrounding the colony. New layers of bacteria then develop on the outer surface. Modern equivalents are produced by cyanobacteria under certain circumstances e.g. on the beaches at Shark Bay in W. Australia.stromelysinsMatrix metallopeptidases (stromelysin-1, EC 3.4.24.17, MMP-3, 477aa; stromelysin-2, EC 3.4.24.22, MMP-10, 476aa; stromelysin-3, EC 3.4.24.-, MMP-11, 488aa) involved in breaking down the extracellular matrix.stromovascular cellsThe non-adipocyte cells of adipose tissue, presumed to be mostly pre-adipocytes. Research article: http://jas.fass.org/content/82/2/429.full.pdf+html\nstromuleDynamic tubular structures emerging from the surface of plastids.

Recent paper: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/115/abstract\nstrong promoterPromoter that, when bound by a transcription factor, strongly activates expression of the associated gene. The term is widely used, but lacks precision.Strongylocentrotus purpuratusCommon sea urchin. Echinoderms are popular tools for developmental biology because the early embryo is transparent and cell movements can easily be observed. Sea urchin eggs are available in large numbers and were a convenient material for early biochemical studies on histones and mRNA. Because they are relatively large they have also been convenient for various electrophysiological studies.strongyloidiasisIntestinal infestation (strongyloidosis) of man with the nematode worm, Strongyloides stercoralis.\nstrophanthinMixture of glycosides from Strophanthus kombe (a tropical liana) with properties similar to those of digoxin and ouabain (strophanthin G). See digitalis.STRP\nShort tandem repeat polymorphism. See satellite DNA.structural bioinformaticsThe branch of bioinformatics associated with prediction of the secondary structure of proteins and nucleic acids. Much software has been developed to do this and there are a number of free packages available. The capabilities of such programs and the availability of software changes rapidly. See PyMol. RNA secondary structure: http://openwetware.org/wiki/Wikiomics:RNA_secondary_structure_prediction\nstructural geneA gene that codes for a product (e.g. an enzyme, structural protein, tRNA), as opposed to a gene that serves a regulatory role.structure-activity relationship\nSAR The relationship between the strucure of a compound and its activity, usually done by systematically varying the structure and analysing binding or inhibitory activity. A more sophisticated analysis using complex computational methods to derive appropriate parameters of shape and electronic distribution produces a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). The hope is that eventually it will be possible to design better inhibitors (drugs) by this means, but rational design is not yet straightforward.Strumpell\u2019s diseaseA spastic paraplegia caused by a defect in strumpellin.strumpellinA component (1159aa) of the WASH complex, ubiquitously expressed and defective in some forms of spastic paraplegia (Strumpell\u2019s disease).struviteA mineral composed of orthorhombic crystals of magnesium ammonium phosphate. Struvite stones in the kidney are composed of a struvite-carbonate-apatite matrix and are associated with urinary infections, particularly with urease-producing bacteria, including Ureaplasma urealyticum and Proteus.strychnine\nAlkaloid obtained from the Indian tree Strychnos nux-vomica; specific blocking agent for the action of the amino acid transmitter glycine. Convulsive effects of strychnine are probably due to its blockage of inhibitory synapses onto spinal cord motoneurons.Stuve-Wiedemann syndromeSee Schwartz-Jampel syndrome.STX\n(1) See saxitoxin. (2) Shiga toxin. See shiga-like toxin. (3) See sialyltransferase.Stylonychia mytilusLarge ciliate protozoan of the Order Hypotrichida, that has compound cilia (cirri) that can be used for walking or swimming.S-type lectins\ngalectins One of two classes of lectin produced by animal cells, the other being the C-type lectins. The carbohydrate binding activity of the S-type lectins requires their cysteines to have free thiols and, unlike the C-type lectins, does not need divalent cations. They mostly have molecular masses in the range 14\u221216\u00a0kDa and often form dimers and higher oligomers. The carbohydrate recognition domain contains a number of critically conserved amino acids and largely binds to \u03b2-galactosides. S-type lectins occur as cytoplasmic proteins and lack a signal sequence for secretion, yet do exist extracellularly.subacuteDescription of a disease that progresses more rapidly than a chronic disease and more slowly than an acute one.subacute sclerosing panencephalitis\nSSPE Chronic progressive illness seen in children a few years after measles infection, and involving demyelination of the cerebral cortex. Virus apparently persists in brain cells: usually considered a slow virus disease.subcommissural organA brain gland (SCO) present in all vertebrate phyla. It secretes glycoproteins into the cerebrospinal fluid, where some aggregate to form Reissner\u2019s fibres and others remain soluble. Among the secreted proteins is SCO-spondin which is probably involved in axonal growth and/or guidance. Research article: http://www.cerebrospinalfluidresearch.com/content/5/1/3\nsuberinFatty substance, containing long-chain fatty acids and fatty esters, found in the cell walls of cork cells (phellem) in higher plants. Also found in the Casparian band. Renders the cell wall impervious to water.subgenomic RNA\nsgRNA Copies of viral RNA from positive-strand RNA viruses that are truncated at the 5\u2032 ends, but have the same 3\u2032 ends. The viral genome has multiple open reading frames with only a single 3\u2032 end: the subgenomic RNA is a transcript of a downstream ORF which would not normally be expressed because the stop-site at the end of the upstream ORF terminates transcription. A special subgenomic promoter (RNA-promoter) between the ORFs permits this to happen.

A large excess of mRNA from one sample is hybridized to cDNA from the other, and the double stranded hybrids removed by physical means. Remaining cDNAs are those not represented as RNA in the first sample, and thus presumably expressed uniquely in the second. To improve specificity, the process is often repeated several times. See also differential screening.subunitsComponents from which a structure is built; thus myosin has six subunits, microtubules are built of tubulin subunits. In some cases it may be more informative to speak of protomers.succinateIntermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate cycle.succinate dehydrogenase\n(1) SDH (EC 1.3.5.1, succinate-coenzyme Q reductase, complex II in electron transport, succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase). An enzyme complex of 4 subunits located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has two main activities, as part of the citric acid cycle, oxidizing succinate into fumarate while passing electrons on to FAD and as complex II of the electron transport chain, which uses electrons freed from succinate, to reduce ubiquinone to ubiquinol. (2) An enzyme (EC 1.3.99.1, fumarate reductase, fumarate dehydrogenase) that oxidises succinate to fumarate with the involvement of an acceptor.

The structures are presented as Haworth models and it should be noted the configuration at the carbon which carries the carbonyl oxygen is not determined unless the hydroxyl-group takes part in a glycosidic linkage, which it always does in higher oligomers. The convention for depicting glycosidic linkages is:glycosyl carbon \u2192 acceptor hydroxyl. Configuration not defined in free molecule.Shaded regions have configurations that are not defined in free molecules.Sulphated derivatives of N-acetyl aminohexoses are also widespread and include the 4- and 6- sulphate esters of N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl galactosamine.Disaccharides and PolysaccharidesThese are fully specified by the residue names, sequence, bond-direction, and the position numbers of the carbon atoms giving rise to the linkage.

A groove or furrow e.g. on the surface of the cerebrum in mammals.sulfonamidesSynthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics derived from sulphanilamide (a red dye) with a wide spectrum of activity against most Gram-positive and many Gram-negative organisms. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. In UK formerly sulphonamides but sulfonamide is the BAN.sulfur, sulfo-The British spelling, sulphur, sulpho- is used throughout except where the British Approved Name (BAN) for drugs is the \u2018sulf-\u2019 spelling.sulphatase-modifying factor 1The enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (SUMF1, EC 1.8.99.-, 374aa) that catalyses the post-translational formation of C-alpha-formylglycine (FGly) from cysteine at the active site of sulphatases. Mutations lead to multiple sulphatase deficiency.\nsulphatases\nEsterases (EC 3.1.6.-) that degrade sulphate esters such as heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate. See, for example, aryl sulphatase also multiple sulphatase deficiency.sulpholipidsAny lipid containing sulphur although usually restricted to mean those in which the polar head group contains sulphate species. Sulpholipid-1 (SL-1) is an abundant sulphated glycolipid and potential virulence factor found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In plants they are important intermediates in the sulphur cycle.sulphonylurea receptorThe sulphonylurea receptor-1 (ABCC8, SUR-1, 1581aa) is an ABC transporter that regulates glucose-induced insulin secretion by controlling K+-ATP channel activity of the pancreatic beta-cell membrane. They form a stoichiometric complex with 4 pore-forming inwardly-rectifying Kir6.2 molecules to produce the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. SURs have two nucleotide-binding folds that sense changes in the metabolic status (ATP/ADP ratio) of the cell. Glibenclamide, a sulphonyl urea drug, binds to SUR and labelled forms of the drug can be used to show the distribution of the receptors.sulphonylureasGroup of drugs which act by augmenting insulin secretion. Used in the treatment of Type II diabetes. Examples include glibenclamide which is the sulphonylurea most commonly used in experimental studies.

Very important in studies of protein structure because they affect disuphide bonding.SUMOSmall ubiquitin-related modifier proteins See sumoylation.sumoylationPost-transcriptional modification of a protein by the conjugation of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) proteins: stabilizes some proteins and may alter subcellular localization. Three different SUMO proteins are conjugated to proteins, SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. The SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 genes are closely related, with 86% sequence identity while SUMO-1 is less closely related with about 50% sequence identity with SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. SUMO-1 (101aa) conjugates as a monomer, while SUMO-2 (95aa) and SUMO-3 (103aa) are conjugated to proteins as higher molecular weight polymers. Targets include p53, ran-Gap and various transcription factors, including C/EBP proteins and c-Myb.Sun proteinsA conserved family of proteins that have a Sun domain (Sad1/UNC-84 homology domain). They are important components of various complexes involved in chromosomal movement, positioning of nuclear pore complexes and linkage of the nucleoskeleton with the cytoskeleton (the LINC complex). Interact with lamins and with nesprins. They were originally cloned by homology with C. elegans protein UNC-84 that is involved in nuclear migration/positioning. In S. cerevisiae Sun 4 (septation protein SUN4, 420aa) is involved in the process of septum formation. The NSUN family (NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family) are S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases, for example, Nsun2 (tRNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase NSUN2, EC 2.1.1.29, 767aa).superantigenAntigens, mostly of microbial origin, that activate all those T-lymphocytes that have a T-cell receptor with a particular V\u03b2 sequence; as a consequence superantigens activate large numbers of T-cells and elicit an inappropriately strong immune response. Superantigens are presented on MHC Class II, but are not processed, and bind with high affinity but not in the normal peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule. Presentation is not MHC-restricted. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are the best known superantigens and are pyrogenic, increase host susceptibility to endotoxic shock, suppress immunoglobulin production and stimulate CD4+ T-cells. Superantigen diseases include Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever (produced by erythrogenic toxin of Streptococcus pyogenes). The Mls gene product in mice can act as a self-superantigen.supercoilingIn circular DNA or closed loops of DNA, twisting of the DNA about its own axis changes the number of turns of the double helix. If twisting is in the opposite direction to the turns of the double helix, i.e. anticlockwise, the DNA strands will either have to unwind or the whole structure will twist or supercoil - termed negative supercoiling. If twisting is in the same direction as the helix, clockwise, which winds the DNA up more tightly, positive supercoiling is generated. DNA that shows no supercoiling is said to be relaxed. Supercoiling in circular DNA can be detected by electrophoresis because supercoiled DNA migrates faster than relaxed DNA. Circular DNA is commonly negatively supercoiled and the DNA of eukaryotes largely exists as supercoils associated with protein in the nucleosome. The degree of supercoiling can be altered by topoisomerases.superhelixA supercoil of a molecule, like DNA, that is already coiled.SUPERMANA transcriptional regulator (204aa) in Arabidopsis that acts indirectly to prevent the B class homeotic proteins APETALA3 and PISTILLATA from acting during flower development.superoxideTerm used interchangeably for the superoxide anion (.)O2\n\u2212, or the weak acid HO2\n(.). Superoxide is generated both by prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and is an important product of the metabolic burst of neutrophil leucocytes. A very active oxygen species, it can cause substantial damage, and may be responsible for the inactivation of plasma antiproteases that contributes to the pathogenesis of emphysema.superoxide dismutaseAny of a range of metalloenzymes (EC 1.15.1.1) that catalyse the breakdown of superoxide to produce hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. The eukaryotic form (SOD1) is a copper-zinc enzyme (154aa) and the prokaryotic (SodA, 206aa in E. coli) and mitochondrial (SOD2, 222aa in humans) form has manganese as a cation. Other metal ions (iron, nickel) are found in some prokaryotes. They play an important role in protecting tissues from superoxide-induced damage. Superoxide dismutase copper chaperone (274aa) delivers copper and zinc to SOD1. See amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1.supershiftPhenomenon in band-shift assays where the reduction in mobility on a gel induced by a binding interaction with a protein is enhanced by the addition of an antibody to the protein (or another interacting protein). Net result is that the mobility of the band of interest is further decreased (shifted).supervillinAn actin binding protein (2214aa) of the gelsolin/villin family, that forms a high-affinity link between the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane. Isoform 1 (archvillin) is muscle-specific and is important in myogenesis and the assembly of myosin II. Isoform 2 (supervillin) is more ubiquitously expressed, somewhat smaller (1788aa), and may down-regulate focal adhesions by binding to thyroid receptor-interacting protein 6 (TRIP6).suppression PCRA modification of PCR, competition (or suppression) hybridization in which there is selective suppression of the amplification of one or more closely related sequences, useful when the target is present as a rare sequence in a large excess of a closely related sequence. A 5\u2032 extension is included in one (or both) primer(s) that will form a hairpin loop with internal sequence of the amplicon and is then refractory to further amplification. Sequences containing a perfect match to the 5\u2032extension are not amplified (are suppressed) and only sequences containing mismatches or lacking the sequence is unaffected. Descriptive article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1184225/\nsuppression subtractive hybridization\nSSH A method developed for cDNA comparisons, based on PCR suppression by inverted terminal repeats (PS-effect). In complex mixtures, the PS-effect allows precise amplification only of molecules that are flanked by different adapters at opposing termini (asymmetrically flanked molecules). This principle is used in Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH), where the molecules of interest, those unique to the test sample, are driven to the asymmetrically flanked state and selectively amplified.suppressor factor\n(1) Factors released by T-suppressor cells (T-regulatory cells). (2) See suppressor mutation and termination codons.suppressor mutationMutation that alleviates the effect of a primary mutation at a different locus. May be through almost any mechanism that can give a primary mutation, but perhaps the most interesting class are the opal, amber and ochre suppressors, where the anticodon of the tRNA is altered so that it misreads the termination codon and inserts an amino acid, preventing premature termination of the peptide chain.suppressor T-cellsSee T-regulatory cells.suprachiasmatic nucleus\nSCN A region in the hypothalamus, immediately above the optic chiasm.

It is usually measured as the zeta potential at the Helmholtz slipping plane outside the surface.surface-active compoundUsually, in biological systems, a detergent-like molecule that is amphipathic and that will bind to the plasma membrane, or to a surface with which cells come in contact, altering its properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, or vice versa.surfactantA surface-active compound; the best known example of which is the lung surfactant (see surfactant proteins).surfactant proteinsPulmonary surfactant is mainly (90%) lipid associated with four surfactant-associated proteins: 2 collagenous, carbohydrate-binding glycoproteins (SP-A and SP-D of the collectin family) and 2 small hydrophobic proteins (SP-B and SP-C). Production of surfactants at parturition allows the lungs to fill with air because the alveolar surface becomes hydrophobic. SP-A is oligomeric, consisting of 18 protomers (248aa) with lectin-like domains that recognize glycoconjugates, lipids and protein determinants on both host cells and invading microorganisms. SP-B (381aa) is a disulphide-linked homodimer. SP-C (197aa) is defective in a form of pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction and variations are associated with respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. SP-D (375aa), an oligomeric complex of 4 homotrimers, contributes to the lung\u2019s defense against inhaled microorganisms. Binds maltose residues and other alpha-glucosyl moieties. It also occurs at the luminal surface of the gastric mucosa.surfactinA lipopeptide biosurfactant (a cyclic heptapeptide coupled to an C13\u2212C15 acyl residue) produced by surfactin synthase (a heterotrimeric enzyme, 3587aa, 3583aa and 1275aa) in Bacillus subtilis.

Found to induce tumours in new-born hamsters. In culture, transforms the cells of many non- and semi-permissive species, including mouse and human. See also T-antigen.S valueSee Svedberg unit and sedimentation coefficient.Svedberg unitThe unit named after a pioneer of the ultracentrifuge that is applied to the sedimentation coefficient of a particle in a high-speed or ultracentrifuge. The unit S is calculated as follows, S=rate of sedimentation\u00d71/\u03c12r, where \u03c1 is the speed of rotation in radians per second and r is the radius to a chosen point in the centrifuge tube. 1 Svedberg unit is defined as the time taken to travel unit distance for a particle under the influence of unit centrifugal acceleration, 10\u221213 seconds. The units are non-additive: a particle formed from two 5S particles will not have a sedimentation coefficient of 10S.swainsonineFungal indolizidine alkaloid that is a reversible inhibitor of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase and of the Golgi complex alpha-mannosidase II that is involved in processing the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins.SWAMIn mouse an antibacterial protein (SWAM1, single WAP motif protein 1, elafin-like protein 1, 80aa; SWAM2, 85aa).swatA program for searching one or more DNA or protein query sequences, or a query profile, against a sequence database, using an efficient implementation of the Smith-Waterman or Needleman-Wunsch algorithms. Link to website: http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html\nSWI/SNF complexThe SWI/SNF (Switch/Sucrose non-fermentable) complex remodels nucleosome structure in an ATP-dependent manner. In yeast the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex has 11 tightly associated polypeptides (SWI1, SWI2, SWI3, SNF5, SNF6, SNF11, SWP82, SWP73, SWP59, SWP61, and SWP29). SWP59 and SWP61, encoded by the ARP9 and ARP7 genes respectively, are members of the actin-related protein (ARP) family. The similarity of ARP7 and ARP9 proteins to the heat-shock protein and HSC family of ATPases suggests that chromatin remodelling may involve chaperone-like activities.

Contains two tandem SH2 domains through which it interacts with the ITAM motif. More widely distributed than zap70 and important in signalling in both myeloid and lymphoid cells.symbiontOne of the partners in a symbiotic relationship.symbiosisLiving together for mutual benefit. See symbiont, symbiotic algae.\nsymbiotic algaeAlgae (often Chlorella spp.) that live intracellularly in animal cells (e.g. endoderm ofHydra viridis). The relationship is complex, because lysosomes do not fuse with the vacuoles containing the algae, and the growth rates of both cells are regulated to maintain the symbiosis. There is considerable strain-specificity. The term is imprecise, since there are many other symbiotic algae (as in lichens) where the relationship is different.sympathetic nervous systemOne of the two divisions of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system (the other being the parasympathetic nervous system). The sympathetic preganglionic neurons have their cell bodies in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, and connect to the paravertebral chain of sympathetic ganglia. Innervate heart and blood vessels, sweat glands, viscera, and the adrenal medulla. Most sympathetic neurons, but not all, use noradrenaline as a post-ganglionic neurotransmitter.sympathetic ophthalmiaAn autoimmune response in which there is inflammatory disease in the undamaged eye following perforating injury to the other eye.sympathomimeticMimicking the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathomimetic drugs mimic the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system to produce, for example, tachycardia and increased output from the heart or bronchodilatation and vasodilatation.sympatric speciationDevelopment of a new species without (geographical) isolation.

See apoplast.symplectic metachronismSee metachronism.symplesiomorphicSee apomorphic.symportA mechanism of transport across a membrane in which two different molecules move in the same direction. Often, one molecule can move up an electrochemical gradient because the movement of the other molecule is more favourable (see facilitated diffusion). Example: the sodium/glucose co-transport. See antiport, uniport.synaphinSee complexin.synapomorph\nApomorphic features possessed by two or more taxa in common. Phylogenic trees are based upon identifying groups united by synapomorphies.synapseA connection between excitable cells, by which an excitation is conveyed from one to the other. (1) Chemical synapse: one in which an action potential causes the exocytosis of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic cell, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-gated ion channels on the postsynaptic cell. These ion channels then affect the resting potential of the postsynaptic cell. (2) Electrical synapse: one in which electrical connection is made directly through the cytoplasm, via gap junctions. (3) Rectifying synapse: one in which action potentials can only pass across the synapse in one direction (all chemical and some electrical synapses). (4) Excitatory synapse: one in which the firing of the presynaptic cell increases the probability of firing of the postsynaptic cell. (5) Inhibitory synapse: one in which the firing of the presynaptic cell reduces the probability of firing of the postsynaptic cell. (6) See immunological synapse.synapsinsFamily of phosphoproteins that coat synaptic vesicles and bind to the cytoskeleton. Synapsin Ia and Ib (Brain protein 4.1, 705aa) are alternatively spliced variants as are synapsins IIa and IIb (582aa). Synapsin III (580aa) has a more restricted distribution. The synapsins are implicated in neurotransmitter release, axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. Can be phosphorylated by several protein kinases and interact with small G proteins such as rab. Synapsin 1 forms a ternary complex with nitric oxide synthase and CAPON. Mutations in synapsin 1 are associated with a form of X-linked epilepsy.synapsis\n(1) The specific pairing of the chromatids of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis. It allows crossing-over to take place. (2) Process that brings the ends of double-strand breaks in DNA together, prior to end joining in NHEJ. Synapsis results in the autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, which is required to make the DNA ends available for ligation.synaptic cleftThe narrow space between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell in a chemical synapse, across which the neurotransmitter diffuses.synaptic facilitationSee facilitation.synaptic plasticityChange in the properties of a synapse, usually in the context of learning and memory. Very few synapses provide simple 1:1 transfer of action potentials, and very small changes in the efficiency of a synapse (usually mediated by changes in either the pre- or postsynaptic membrane) can have profound influences on the electrical properties of a neuronal circuit. See also neuronal plasticity.synaptic transmissionThe process of propagating a signal from one cell to another via a synapse.\nsynaptic vesicleIntracellular vesicles containing neurotransmitter found in the presynaptic terminals of chemical synapses.synaptobrevinsSmall integral membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles that have v-SNARE coiled-coil homology domains and interact with target-SNARES. Two neuronal isoforms, VAMP1 (118aa) and VAMP2 (116aa) are known that bind SNAPs and syntaxin. Clostridial toxins encoding zinc endopeptidases, such as tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin, block synaptic release by degrading synaptobrevins. Other related proteins occur in other tissues serving a similar role in vesicle targeting through interactions with SNAREs. VAMP3 (100aa) is cellubrevin and involved in protein recycling. VAMP4 (141) is involved in removing an inhibitor (probably synaptotagmin-4) of calcium-triggered exocytosis during the maturation of secretory granules. VAMP5 (myobrevin, 102aa) is found in muscle. VAMP7 (synaptobrevin-like protein 1, 220aa) is ubiquitous and involved in endosome-lysosome transport. VAMP8 (endobrevin, 100aa) is associated with dense-granule secretion in platelets. VAMP-like proteins are found in a wide range of organisms, including protozoa, yeasts and Arabidopsis.synaptogenesisFormation of a synapse.synaptogyrinA family of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity (synaptogyrin 1, SYNGR1, 233aa; SYNGR2, (cellugyrin), 224aa, SYNGR3, 229aa; SYNGR4 234aa). Synaptogyrin-3 is involved in the positive regulation of dopamine transporter activity.synaptojaninsInositol 5-phosphatases involved in vesicle recycling; the amino-terminal region has homology with yeast Sac1 (involved in phospholipid metabolism) and the C-terminal region has proline-rich sequences that probably interact with SH3 domains of amphiphysin and grb-2. Synaptojanin-1 (EC 3.1.3.36, 1573aa) is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in presynaptic terminals through an interaction with dynamin, Eps15 and amphiphysin. Synaptojanin-2 (1496) has a much wider tissue distribution but a similar role in vesicle recycling. Synaptojanin-2-binding protein (145aa) is a mitochondrial outer-membrane protein.synaptomorphicSee apomorphic.synaptonemal complexStructure, identified by electron microscopy, lying between chromosomes during synapsis; consists of two lateral plates closely apposed to the chromosomes and connected to a central plate by filaments. It appears to act as a scaffold, but is not apparently essential for crossing-over. In S. cerevisiae, a mutation eliminating the synaptonemal complex protein, Zip1 (875aa), increases the meiosis I nondisjunction rate of nonexchange chromosomes, suggesting it is a backup system for those chromosome where recombination has not occurred. Various synaptonemal proteins have been identified (SYCP1, 976aa; SYCP2, 1,530aa; SYCP3, 236aa and synaptosomal central element proteins, Syce 1, 329aa and Syce2, 171aa). Research article: http://www.pnas.org/content/107/2/781.full.pdf+html\nsynaptophysinAbundant glycoprotein component (major synaptic vesicle protein p38, 313aa) of small synaptic vesicle with four transmembrane domains; both N- and C-termini are located cytoplasmically. The transmembrane organization and putative quaternary structure resemble that of connexins. Synaptophysin-like protein 2 (mitsugumin-29, 264aa) is involved in communication between the T-tubular and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes. See synaptoporin.synaptopodinAn actin-associated proline-rich protein (929aa) found in kidney podocytes and a subset of mature telencephalic dendritic spines of neurons; a regulator of rhoA signalling and cell migration. Blocks Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination of rhoA, thereby preventing the targeting of rhoA for proteasomal degradation. May be involved in synaptic plasticity in telencephalic neurons. Synaptopodin-2 (myopodin, 1093aa) is skeletal muscle-specific and localized to the Z-disc in mature muscle. Shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a differentiation-dependent and stress-induced fashion.synaptoporin\nSPO Putative channel protein (265aa) of synaptic vesicles, and a member of the synaptophysin/connexin superfamily. It has 58% amino acid identity to synaptophysin, with highly conserved transmembrane segments but a divergent cytoplasmic tail.synaptosomeA subcellular fraction prepared from tissues rich in chemical synapses, used in biochemical studies. Consists mainly of vesicles from presynaptic terminals.synaptotagminsCalcium-binding synaptic vesicle proteins that bind acidic phospholipids and recognize the cytoplasmic domain of the neurexins. Function as Ca2+ sensors that facilitate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1, p65, 422aa) is only one of a large family (at least 15 members) that probably differ subtly in their binding partners. SYT1 forms a complex with SV2B (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B), syntaxin 1 and SNAP25; SYT2 (419aa) interacts with stonin-2 and SCAMP5 (secretory carrier-associated membrane protein-5). Similar proteins are found in many metazoa.SynCAMsSynaptic cell adhesion molecules. Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules of the nectin subfamily (for example, syncam-1, cell adhesion molecule 1, nectin-like protein 2, 442aa) involved in calcium-independent homo- and heterotypic cell adhesion, not restricted to neuronal cells. Syncam 1 is implicated in presynaptic differentiation along with \u03b2-neurexin/neuroligin. It also interacts with poliovirus receptor-related protein 3 (nectin-3) and is involved in a wide range of other activities, acting as a tumour suppressor, promoting natural killer cell cytotoxicity amongst other things.synchronous cell populationA culture of cells that all divide in synchrony. Particularly useful for certain studies of the cell cycle, cells can be made synchronous by depriving them of essential molecules, which are then restored. Synchronization breaks down after a few cycles, however, as individual cells have unique division rates.syncoilinAn intermediate filament-type III protein (482aa) found in striated and cardiac muscle where it binds to desmin and to \u03b1-dystrobrevin and thereby to the dystrophin-associated protein complex.syncollinProtein (134aa) found within zymogen granules that is required for efficient regulated exocytosis. Normally exists as a doughnut-shaped homo-oligomer (possibly a hexamer) in close association with the luminal surface of the zymogen granule membrane.syncytinMembrane proteins encoded by human endogenous retroviruses genes that have retained their original fusogenic properties and participate in trophoblast fusion (formation of the syncytiotrophoblast) during placental morphogenesis. Syncytin 1 (538aa), the product of a HERV-W gene, is cleaved into a surface protein (SU, gp50, 297aa) that mediates recognition of the type D mammalian retrovirus receptors SLC1A4 and SLC1A5, and a transmembrane protein (TM, gp24, 221aa) that acts a class I viral fusion protein. SU and TM form a heterodimer. Syncytin 2 (product of a HERV-FRD gene, 538aa) is similar.syncytiotrophoblastSyncytial layer that forms the outermost fetal layer in the placenta and is thus the interface with maternal tissue. Has invasive capacity \u2013 though in a regulated manner. See syncytin.syncytiumAn epithelium or tissue in which there is cytoplasmic continuity between the constituent cells. Striated muscle is the classic example.syndactylyA relatively common congenital abnormality in which the webbing between finger or toes persists because of a failure in the normal developmental programmed death of inter-digital tissue. Can be caused by mutation variously in genes encoding connexin-43, homeobox HOXD13, fibulin-1, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 or regulatory elements of the sonic hedgehog system. Syndactyly is associated with several other disorders although the mutations responsible are unclear.syndecansIntegral membrane proteoglycans associated largely with epithelial cells. The core protein has an extracellular domain that is modified by addition of multiple heparan sulphate, chondroitin or dermatan sulphate chains and N-linked oligosaccharide. The heparan sulphate chains bind to proteins of the extracellular matrix, including collagens, fibronectin and tenascin. The cytoplasmic domain is thought to interact with actin filaments thus linking the cytoskeleton with fibrous elements of the extracellular matrix. Members of the family include syndecan-1 (CD138, 310aa), syndecan-2 (fibroglycan, heparan sulphate proteoglycan core protein, 201aa). Syndecan-3 (442aa) may have a role in signalling and binding of heparin-binding growth-associated molecule increases phosphorylation of c-src and cortactin. Syndecan-4 (amphiglycan, ryudocan core protein, 198aa) interacts with CUB domain-containing protein 1, the adaptor proteins syntenin-1 and -2 (syndecan binding protein, SDBP1, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 9, scaffold protein Pbp1, 298aa; SDBP2, 292aa) and various other proteins. Syndecans bind gp120 of HIV and mediate viral entry to the host cell. The Drosophila protein (399aa) is required for axonal and myotube guidance and is a necessary component in slit/robo signalling.syne proteinsSee nesprins.SynechocystisA freshwater cyanobacterium capable of both phototrophic growth in sunlight and heterotrophic growth in darkness. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is well studied and exhibits circadian rhythms.SynedraA genus of freshwater diatoms.

Forms heteropolymeric IFs with desmin and/or vimentin that link to adherens-type junctions. Three synemin isoforms, (339aa, 1251aa and 1563aa) are produced by alternative splicing and have different tissue distributions.synergidsCells of the egg apparatus in plants; two cells at the apex of the embryo sac closely associated with the egg cell and directly involved with the process of fertilisation.SynergistetesA phylum of bacteria; Gram-negative, rod-shaped obligate anaerobes. Some species have been implicated in periodontal disease, gastrointestinal infections and soft tissue infections.synergyAn interaction that produces a more-than-additive effect. Demonstrating a synergistic effect requires that the second compound produces an additional effect in the presence of a maximally-effective level of the other. This criterion is not always met.\nsynexinAnnexin 8. See Table A2.syngamyFusion of two haploid gametic nuclei to form the diploid nucleus of the zygote.syngeneicOrganisms that are antigenically identical \u2013 monozygotic twins or highly inbred strains of animals.

Isoforms 1 and 2 form a heterodimer: isoform 2 inhibits E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (SIAH1) and inhibits proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Can be ubiquitinylated by parkin to produce cytoplasmic inclusions resembling Lewy bodies. Defects may cause Parkinson\u2019s disease. See synuclein.synpolydactylySee syndactyly.syntaxinsA large family of receptors (t-SNAREs) for intracellular transport vesicles that bind synaptotagmin and taxilins in a calcium-dependent fashion and interact with voltage dependent calcium and potassium channels. Syntaxins have a hydrophobic C-terminal region that anchors the protein on the cytoplasmic surface of cellular membranes, a central conserved region and a variable N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syntaxin 1 (288aa) is mainly expressed in brain tissue and is thought to function specifically in neurotransmitter release, whereas syntaxin 2, 3, and 4 are involved in more general vesicle trafficking. In Arabidopsis, syntaxin 121 (syntaxin-related protein At-Syr1, 346aa) functions in the secretory pathway and binds to SNAP33.syntenicDescribing genes that lie on the same chromosome. Some loci are syntenic in both human and mouse, others are not.synteninSee syndecans.synthetaseEnzymes of Class 6 in the E classification; catalyse synthesis of molecules, their activity being coupled to the breakdown of a nucleotide triphosphate.syntrophinsA family of adapter proteins that interact with dystrophin, dystrobrevin and diacylglycerol kinase (DGK)-zeta at the plasma membrane of muscle and nerve and may link receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. Alpha-1-syntrophin-alpha (syntrophin-1, Pro-TGF\u03b1 cytoplasmic domain-interacting protein 1, TACIP1, 505aa) is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, and is important in synapse formation. Beta-1-syntrophin (syntrophin-2, 538aa) and beta-2-syntrophin (syntrophin-3, 540aa) are ubiquitous and interact with the other members of the syntrophin family. Gamma-1-syntrophin (syntrophin-4, 517aa) is brain-specific but gamma-2-syntrophin (syntrophin-5, 539aa) is widely expressed. See dystrophin-associated protein complex.synucleinFamily of proteins (\u03b1-synuclein, 140aa; \u03b2-, 134aa; \u03b3-, 127aa) with structural resemblance to apolipoproteins, abundant in neuronal cytosol and particularly in presynaptic terminals where they may be involved in the regulation of dopamine release. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u03b1-synuclein is a component of plaque amyloid; mutations in the \u03b1-synuclein gene are the cause of various forms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (types 1 and 4) and the protein accumulates in Lewy bodies. Interacts with synphilin.syphilisA contagious sexually-transmitted disease caused by infection with the spirochaete Treponema pallidum. Can also be vertically transmitted from mother to fetus.syringomycinA phytotoxic lipopeptide produced by Pseudomonas syringae that form pores in plasma membranes and is also a powerful surfactant. Syringopeptin has similar effects.syringopeptinA phytotoxic cyclic lipodepsipeptide produced by Pseudomonas syringae that oligomerizes to form pores in cell membranes.syringyl alcoholA phenylpropanoid alcohol (sinapyl alcohol), one of the three precursors of lignin.systematic sclerosisSee scleroderma, fibrillarin.systemicDescribing something with global rather than local effects: systemic insecticides, for example, become distributed throughout a plant, systemic diseases affect the whole body.systemic acquired resistance\nSAR In plants, long-term resistance to pathogen attack, triggered by elicitors released by the pathogen (e.g. bacteria). In contrast to the hypersensitive response, which is a localized response involving cell death at the site of infection, SAR is displayed by the whole plant. SAR is associated with the expression and activity of a set of SAR genes which include the pathogenesis-related (PR) genes.systemic carnitine deficiencyA condition in which carnitine levels are low in non-muscle tissue. Mutations in the SLC22A5 gene, which encodes the sodium ion-dependent carnitine transporter (OctN2), cause a failure of reabsorption of carnitine in the kidney. Myopathic carnitine deficiency is caused by a different mutation and is restricted to skeletal muscle.systemic lupus erythematosus\nSLE An autoimmune disease with antinuclear and other antibodies (often anti-RNA) in plasma. Immune complex deposition in the glomerular capillaries is a particular problem. Multiple genes affect susceptibility, mostly genes that regulate the immune suystem although resistance is associated with a polymorphism in the Toll-like receptor-5 gene. See lupus erythematosus.systeminAn 18aa wound hormone released from sites on tomato leaves damaged mechanically or by insects. Through the systemin receptor regulates more than 20 defensive genes. Produced, by proteolytic cleavage, from prosystemin (200aa).systemin receptorA leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor with serine/threonine-protein kinase activity in Solanum peruvianum (Peruvian tomato) (EC 2.7.11.1, brassinosteroid LRR receptor kinase, 1207aa). Almost identical to the brassinosteroid receptor in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) although brassinosteroid and systemin bind to different sites. The receptor regulates an intracellular cascade including, depolarization of the plasma membrane, the opening of ion channels, an increase in intracellular Ca2+, activation of a MAP kinase activity and a phospholipase A2 activity. As a consequence linolenic acid, is released from plant membranes and converted to jasmonic acid.systems biologyFashionable term for an integrated approach to biology in which effects on the whole organism are studied as opposed to the reductionist approaches of modern molecular bioscience. This Dictionary deliberately contains definitions that span a wide range of biological sub-specialities since molecular cell biologists are generally well aware of the importance of putting their work into context, but may need a glossary for some of the more arcane terminologies.syzygy\n(1) In some parasitic protozoa the pairing of gamonts prior to sexual fusion.

The Type I secretion system transports various molecules including ions, drugs and proteins of various sizes (20\u2212900\u00a0kDa). The Type II system (T2SS) in Gram-negative bacteria depends upon the Sec or Tat system for initial transport of proteins into the periplasm from where they pass through the outer membrane via a multimeric (12\u221214 subunits) complex of pore forming secretin proteins. In addition to the secretin proteins, 10\u221215 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. In some bacteria, certain proteins are shared between the pilus complex and the type II system. The Type III system (TTSS, T3SS) is essential for pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria, and allows them to translocate proteins into eukaryotic host cells.

They are multi-subunit transmembrane channels with an aqueous pore around 0.4\u00a0nm diameter, with a negatively charged region internally (the \u2018selectivity filter\u2019) that blocks the passage of anions. The alpha subunits form the pore itself, the beta subunits vary between tissues and regulate the sensitivity. The channel opens in response to a small depolarization of the cell (usually caused by an approaching action potential), by a multistep process. Around 1000 sodium ions pass in the next millisecond, before the channel spontaneously closes (an event with single-step kinetics). The channel is then refractory to further depolarizations until returned to near the resting potential. There are around 100 channels per mm2 in unmyelinated axons; in myelinated axons, they are concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier. Mutations are associated with various forms of epilepsy, muscular disorders (periodic paralysis, myotonia), long QT syndrome, Brugada\u2019s syndrome-1, erythromelalgia, congenital insensitivity to pain and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder.
