["The human society faces a serious problem due to the widespread resistance to antibiotics in clinical practice. Most antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters in actinobacteria contain genes for intrinsic self-resistance to the produced antibiotics, and it has been proposed that the antibiotic resistance genes in pathogenic bacteria originated in antibiotic-producing microorganisms. The model actinobacteria Streptomyces clavuligerus produces the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic cephamycin C, a class A \u03b2-lactamase, and the \u03b2 lactamases inhibitor clavulanic acid, all of which are encoded in a gene supercluster; in addition, it synthesizes the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP. The secreted clavulanic acid has a synergistic effect with the cephamycin produced by the same strain in the fight against competing microorganisms in its natural habitat. High levels of resistance to cephamycin/cephalosporin in actinobacteria are due to the presence (in their \u03b2-lactam clusters) of genes encoding PBPs which bind penicillins but not cephalosporins. We have revised the previously reported cephamycin C and clavulanic acid gene clusters and, in addition, we have searched for novel \u03b2-lactam gene clusters in protein databases. Notably, in S. clavuligerus and Nocardia lactamdurans, the \u03b2-lactamases are retained in the cell wall and do not affect the intracellular formation of isopenicillin N/penicillin N. The activity of the \u03b2-lactamase in S. clavuligerus may be modulated by the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP at the cell-wall level. Analysis of the \u03b2-lactam cluster in actinobacteria suggests that these clusters have been moved by horizontal gene transfer between different actinobacteria and have culminated in S. clavuligerus with the organization of an elaborated set of genes designed for fine tuning of antibiotic resistance and cell wall remodeling for the survival of this Streptomyces species. This article is focused specifically on the enigmatic connection between \u03b2-lactam biosynthesis and \u03b2-lactam resistance mechanisms in the producer actinobacteria.", "1. Introduction", "1.

An important mechanism of antibiotic resistance is the modification of the antibiotic target in the antibiotic-producing bacteria [17,18].
