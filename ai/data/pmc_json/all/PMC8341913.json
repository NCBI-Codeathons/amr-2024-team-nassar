See DOI: 10.1039/d0cb00228c", "Bacterial natural products have been a rich source of bioactive compounds for drug development, and advances in DNA sequencing, informatics and molecular biology have opened new avenues for their discovery. Here, we describe the isolation of an aureolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster from a metagenome library derived from a New Zealand soil sample. Heterologous expression of this pathway in Streptomyces albus resulted in the production and isolation of two new aureolic acid compounds, one of which (metathramycin, 6) possesses potent bioactivity against a human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116, IC50 = 14.6 nM). As metathramycin was a minor constituent of the fermentation extract, its discovery relied on a combination of approaches including bioactivity guided fractionation, MS/MS characterisation and pathway engineering. This study not only demonstrates the presence of previously uncharacterised aureolic acids in the environment, but also the value of an integrated natural product discovery approach which may be generally applicable to low abundance bioactive metabolites.", "Heterologous expression of an aromatic polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster recovered from a New Zealand soil metagenome library resulted in the discovery of new bioactive aureolic acids.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Aureolic acids are a family of glycosylated aromatic polyketides that have potent bioactivities against human cancer cells and Gram-positive bacteria.1,2 All naturally occurring aureolic acids have been discovered from soil or marine actinomycete bacteria, and the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for two of these have been described: mithramycin (Fig. 1, 1) from Streptomyces argillaceus,1,3 and chromomycin A3 (Fig. 1, 2) produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus.4 Although aureolic acids have been approved for clinical use (e.g. mithramycin for testicular carcinoma and myeloid leukemia), their clinical applications remain limited due to significant off target toxicity.5,6", "Aureolic acids are a family of glycosylated aromatic polyketides that have potent bioactivities against human cancer cells and Gram-positive bacteria.1,2 All naturally occurring aureolic acids have been discovered from soil or marine actinomycete bacteria, and the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for two of these have been described: mithramycin (Fig. 1, 1) from Streptomyces argillaceus,1,3 and chromomycin A3 (Fig. 1, 2) produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus.4 Although aureolic acids have been approved for clinical use (e.g. mithramycin for testicular carcinoma and myeloid leukemia), their clinical applications remain limited due to significant off target toxicity.5,6", "Fig. 1Biosynthesis of aureolic acids mithramycin and chromomycin A3, and the structure of chromocyclomycin.", "Fig. 1Biosynthesis of aureolic acids mithramycin and chromomycin A3, and the structure of chromocyclomycin.", "Biosynthesis of aureolic acids mithramycin and chromomycin A3, and the structure of chromocyclomycin.", "Biosynthesis of aureolic acids mithramycin and chromomycin A3, and the structure of chromocyclomycin.", "The potent anticancer bioactivity of mithramycin and chromomycin A3 has fuelled a search for new congeners.
