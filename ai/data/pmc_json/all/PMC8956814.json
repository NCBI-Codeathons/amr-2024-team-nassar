["Lead contact", "Summary", "Bergamotenes are bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane sesquiterpenes found abundantly in plants and fungi. Known bergamotene derivatives all possess (2S,6S)-bergamotene backbone. In this study, two (+)-\u03b1-trans-bergamotene derivatives (1 and 2) with unusual (2R,6R) configuration were isolated and elucidated from marine fungus Nectria sp. HLS206. The first (+)-\u03b1-trans-bergamotene synthase NsBERS was characterized using genome mining and heterologous expression-based strategies. Based on homology search, we characterized another (+)-\u03b1-trans-bergamotene synthase LsBERS from Lachnellula suecica and an (+)-\u03b1-bisabolol synthase BcBOS from Botrytis cinerea. We proposed that the cyclization mechanism of (+)-\u03b1-trans-bergamotene involved endo-anti cyclization of left-handed helix farnesyl pyrophosphate by (6R)-bisabolyl cation, which was supported by molecular docking. The biosynthesis-based volatiles (3\u20136) produced by heterologous fungal expression systems elicited significant electroantennographic responses of Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera frugiperda, respectively, suggesting their potential in biocontrol of these pests.

The double bond between C-10 and C-11 was assigned as E geometry based on the strong rotating frame overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) correlation between H-9 and 13-CH3 (Figure\u00a0S15). The homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY) spectrum (Figures 1B and S14) revealed two spin systems (-4CH5CH26CH1CH22CH- and -8CH29CH210CH-), which further elucidated the planar structure of 1 as shown in Figure\u00a01A. The single crystals of 1 were generated, and X-ray crystallography was performed subsequently using Gu K\u03b1 radiation, which confirmed the structure and determined the absolute configuration of 1 (2R,6R,7R) (Figure\u00a01C, Table S1). To our knowledge, this is the first time that a natural bergamotene derivative in this configuration has been identified.Table 1The 1H NMR (500 MHz) and13C NMR (125 MHz) data of necbergamotenoic acid A (1), necbergamotenoic acid B (2) and its ionized form (2\u2032)No1a2b2\u2032b\u03b4H mult.

The gene annotation of upstream and downstream of necD revealed three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (NecB, NecC and NecE), which could be responsible for the oxidation from (+)-\u03b1-trans-bergamotene to 1 and 2 (Figure\u00a02A, Table S4). Furthermore, necA encodes a p53 inducible quinone oxidoreductase PIG3 involving cellular responses to oxidative stress (Porte et\u00a0al., 2009) which seemed to be a self-resistance enzyme (SRE). As a result, we hypothesized that NecD may be responsible for the biosynthesis of (+)-\u03b1-trans-bergamotene skeleton.Figure\u00a02The sesquiterpenome of Nectria sp.

The antennae of 3-day-old virgin male and female moths were cut at the base of the flagellum. About 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL stock solutions of individual compound was prepared with n-hexane. In each test, 10\u00a0\u03bcg of each compound was used for stimulation. Odor stimulation was controlled by a puff of purified air (0.2 s at 10\u00a0mL/s airflow) from a stimulus controller (CS-55, Syntech, Kirchzarten, Germany). EAG signals were recorded and monitored with an Intelligent Data Acquisition Controller (IDAC-4-USB, Syntech), then analyzed using Syntech EAG-software. For each compound, 4 or 5 antennae from different individual moths were tested. The EAG response values of each compound were calculated by subtracting that of the same antennae corresponding to a solvent blank of n-hexane.", "The EAG assays were performed on both sexes of Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera frugiperda respectively according to previous reports (Guo et\u00a0al., 2021).
