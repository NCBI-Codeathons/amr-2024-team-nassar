["Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are operonic sets of microbial genes that synthesize specialized metabolites with diverse functions, including siderophores and antibiotics, which often require export to the extracellular environment. For this reason, genes for transport across cellular membranes are essential for the production of specialized metabolites and are often genomically colocalized with BGCs. Here, we conducted a comprehensive computational analysis of transporters associated with characterized BGCs. In addition to known exporters, in BGCs we found many importer-specific transmembrane domains that co-occur with substrate binding proteins possibly for uptake of siderophores or metabolic precursors. Machine learning models using transporter gene frequencies were predictive of known siderophore activity, molecular weights, and a measure of lipophilicity (log P) for corresponding BGC-synthesized metabolites. Transporter genes associated with BGCs were often equally or more predictive of metabolite features than biosynthetic genes. Given the importance of siderophores as pathogenicity factors, we used transporters specific for siderophore BGCs to identify both known and uncharacterized siderophore-like BGCs in genomes from metagenomes from the infant and adult gut microbiome. We find that 23% of microbial genomes from premature infant guts have siderophore-like BGCs, but only 3% of those assembled from adult gut microbiomes do. Although siderophore-like BGCs from the infant gut are predominantly associated with Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus, siderophore-like BGCs can be identified from taxa in the adult gut microbiome that have rarely been recognized for siderophore production. Taken together, these results show that consideration of BGC-associated transporter genes can inform predictions of specialized metabolite structure and function.", "Microbes produce specialized metabolites with diverse functions, including siderophores, ionophores, antibiotics, antifungals, and signaling molecules (Osbourn 2010). Specialized metabolites therefore often underlie both cooperative and competitive interactions between microbes and microbial interactions with the physiochemical environment (Davies 2013; Sharon et al. 2014; Tyc et al. 2017). The vast majority of specialized metabolites in bacteria are produced by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are sets of genomically colocalized genes. Colocalization of genes into BGCs is thought to occur because of selection for coinheritance and coregulation (Fischbach et al. 2008). Although thousands of microbial natural products have been characterized, genomic BGC predictions made using programs such as antiSMASH (Blin et al. 2019b) and ClusterFinder (Cimermancic et al. 2014) suggest that characterized molecules represent just a small fraction of all existing microbial natural products (Medema and Fischbach 2015; Kim et al. 2017). Many of these unknown metabolites may be highly novel owing to enzymatic and combinatorial diversity of genes in BGCs (Jenke-Kodama et al. 2006; Chevrette et al. 2020).", "Because of the sheer number of sequenced but otherwise uncharacterized BGCs and the time and costs required for chemical characterization, there is a pressing need for predictions of BGC metabolite structures or functions to enable prioritization of targets for laboratory study (Tran et al. 2019). Prediction of metabolite structure or function for a novel BGC from gene content alone is challenging. For many biosynthetic nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), there is a \u201ccolinear\u201d assembly-line regulation in which the order of genes relates to the order of enzymatic modifications on the metabolite during synthesis (Fischbach and Walsh 2006). Using this colinearity rule can help predict some degree of structural detail in NRPSs and PKSs, as is done by antiSMASH and PRISM (Skinnider et al. 2017), but there are many known exceptions to this rule (Wenzel and M\u00fcller 2005), and the accuracies of these software predictions have not been formally assessed using a large training data set.", "Prediction of BGC metabolite function generally relies on contextual genes associated with BGCs. The observation that genes conferring resistance to the produced metabolite are also colocalized with the BGC motivates investigation of putative resistance genes (self-resistance gene mining) (Mungan et al. 2020; Yan et al. 2020) for functional prediction. For siderophore activity prediction, antiSMASH assigns a functional \u201csiderophore\u201d label for BGCs that contain the IucA/IucC gene family, but this gene is only specific for siderophores with biosynthetic pathways similar to aerobactin (Hider and Kong 2010). More recently, Hannigan et al. (2019) trained neural networks to both identify BGCs in genomes and classify BGCs by known metabolite functions. These networks used protein families from the Pfam database (Pfams) (El-Gebali et al. 2019) found in each BGC as features. They predicted activity labels of antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, and inhibitor, with precisions of 36%, 47%, 61%, and 69% on each class, respectively.", "Many specialized metabolites perform their ecological roles extracellularly and thus require transport across cellular membranes. Transporter genes often colocalize in BGCs and have been shown to be compound specific and necessary for export of the product in many cases (M\u00e9ndez and Salas 2001; Mart\u00edn et al. 2005; Severi and Thomas 2019). Therefore, transporters may also inform predictions of BGC metabolite structure and function. The distribution of transporters associated with biosynthetic gene clusters has so far been assessed only in characterized BGCs with experimental validation, a small fraction of the total number of BGCs sequenced. At least 40 BGC-associated exporters have been characterized, mostly in the Actinomycetes, with varying degrees of experimental validation (Severi and Thomas 2019).", "Transporters associated with BGCs are commonly either ATP-dependent active transporters or ion-gradient-dependent transporters (Mart\u00edn et al. 2005). ATP-dependent transporters include the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of both importers and exporters (Rees et al. 2009) and the MacB tripartite efflux pump (Greene et al. 2018b). Examples of characterized structures of each transporter class and their substrates are shown in Figure 1A. In brief, Type I ABC importers are characterized by the BPD_transp_1 transmembrane (TM) protein family and include MalFGK and MetNI for malate and methionine import in E. coli (ter Beek et al. 2014). Type II ABC importers are characterized by the FecCD TM protein family, and examples include BtuCD and HmuUV (ter Beek et al. 2014) and the FecBCDE system for Iron(III) dicitrate import in Escherichia coli (Staudenmaier et al. 1989). Both types of ABC importers often associate with substrate binding proteins (SBPs), small membrane or periplasmic proteins for substrate uptake (Berntsson et al. 2010; ter Beek et al. 2014). Periplasmic binding proteins, Type II ABC importers, and TonB-dependent receptors are also known to play key roles in siderophore uptake in multiple bacterial species (Ellermann and Arthur 2017).", "Figure 1.Distributions of transporter classes in biosynthetic gene clusters.

Export of Nystatin, Doxorubicin, and Mccj25 was found to be dependent on ATP-dependent transporters (Severi and Thomas 2019). The vast majority of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and a number of antibiotics from Actinomycetes also rely on characterized ATP-dependent ABC transporters (M\u00e9ndez and Salas 2001; Gebhard 2012).", "Ion-gradient-dependent transporters (also known as secondary active transport systems) do not require ATP and facilitate transport of small molecules in response to chemiosmotic gradients (Quistgaard et al. 2016). Those found in BGCs are often examples of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and occasionally, the resistance nodulation division (RND) family or the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. Examples of characterized secondary active transporters for antibiotics include an RND transporter for pyoluteorin, and MFS transporters specific for mitomycin C, virginiamycin S, and landomycin (Severi and Thomas 2019).", "Thousands of BGCs with chemically characterized metabolites open up the possibility for a broad genomic and computational analysis of phylogenetically and functionally diverse BGCs.

The 95th percentile of metabolite molecular weights for clusters with MFS_1 and without ABC_tran was 1082 Da, which may be approaching a biological limit for the molecular weights of substrates for these transporters.

Molecular activity of specialized metabolites based on functions proven in the laboratory may be very different from the ecological roles that metabolites play in natural settings (Behnsen and Raffatellu 2016; van der Meij et al. 2017; Kramer et al. 2020). Further, many BGCs may produce multiple variants of a metabolite (Fischbach and Clardy 2007), only some of which may be reported. There may also be reference-database biases in our gene searches\u2014although they are sensitive, it is possible that phylogenetically divergent microbes use transporter genes that are not hit by our sequence models. Finally, as reported, a significant proportion of BGCs contain no transporter at all or a transporter gene genomically adjacent to a BGC may not be functionally linked. There are both technical and biological reasons why a BGC might not contain a transporter gene. First, the transporter(s) for the metabolite produced may be encoded elsewhere in the genome. Second, the BGC's genomic boundaries may be misannotated, and the transporter may be downstream from annotated genes. Third, it is possible that the metabolite being produced performs its primary function intracellularly and does not require a transporter for export. It is also possible that there are unannotated transport systems in BGCs: To further investigate this, we identified unannotated proteins with transmembrane domains in BGCs and found that 18% of BGCs in MIBiG without a transporter contained one unknown membrane protein. Despite these caveats, it appears as though transporter genes provide simple and strong signals for inferring both activity and chemical properties of metabolites produced by BGCs.", "There are multiple caveats to our work. Molecular activity of specialized metabolites based on functions proven in the laboratory may be very different from the ecological roles that metabolites play in natural settings (Behnsen and Raffatellu 2016; van der Meij et al. 2017; Kramer et al. 2020). Further, many BGCs may produce multiple variants of a metabolite (Fischbach and Clardy 2007), only some of which may be reported. There may also be reference-database biases in our gene searches\u2014although they are sensitive, it is possible that phylogenetically divergent microbes use transporter genes that are not hit by our sequence models. Finally, as reported, a significant proportion of BGCs contain no transporter at all or a transporter gene genomically adjacent to a BGC may not be functionally linked. There are both technical and biological reasons why a BGC might not contain a transporter gene. First, the transporter(s) for the metabolite produced may be encoded elsewhere in the genome. Second, the BGC's genomic boundaries may be misannotated, and the transporter may be downstream from annotated genes.
