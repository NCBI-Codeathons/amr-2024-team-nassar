They comprise a group of over 100 compounds isolated from natural sources and several thousand derivatives that have been synthesized by chemical methods [4,5]. In addition to being able to intercalate DNA and inhibit topoisomerases, phenazines act through their redox activity, which enables them to exchange electrons with e.g. NADH, Fe2+/Fe3+ or molecular oxygen. Whereas the reoxidation of NADH may play an important role in the survival of phenazine producers in anoxic environments, like those found in the deeper layers of biofilms, the reduction of ferric iron or O2 directly or indirectly leads to the generation of toxic ROS.

A different mechanism of phenazine self-resistance has recently been discovered in the plant-colonizing bacterium Enterobacter agglomerans (previously termed Pantoea agglomerans and Erwinia herbicola) strain Eh1087. This strain is capable of controlling fireblight, a plant disease caused by the phytopathogen Erwinia amylovora [10], by producing the phenazine derivative D-alanylgriseoluteic acid (AGA) from genes carried on a 200 kB plasmid. AGA is also active against a number of other bacteria, including clinically relevant species such as Staphylococcus aureus [11]. It has also been isolated from a marine Vibrio species (SANK 73794) [12] and most likely is produced from griseoluteic acid (GA; 6-(hydroxymethyl)-9-methoxyphenazine-1-carboxylic acid), a compound that has also been found in Pelagiobacter variabilis [13] and more recently in an Indonesian Streptomyces sp.

The genetic material required for AGA biosynthesis is assembled in an operon that contains the 15 open reading frames ehpA-O and is in part highly similar to the conserved phz-operon found in Pseudomonas and other phenazine producing species. Of the encoded enzymes, EhpA-E utilize chorismic acid to produce phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) [4], which is then converted to AGA by the remaining enzymes EhpF-O [10,15] with the exception of EhpJ, which encodes a membrane transporter of the major facilitator superfamily presumably involved in exporting AGA from the cell. In addition to the genes involved in AGA biosynthesis, the promoter of the ehp-operon also triggers the transcription of an additional gene ehpR from the second DNA strand (Figure 1). This gene encodes a protein of 129 amino acids and has been shown to give rise to resistance against AGA but not some other common phenazines like phenazine-1-carboxylic acid. When first reported in 2002, no sequence homology to other proteins could be detected [10]. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind EhpR-mediated phenazine resistance, we have therefore characterized the protein and its interaction with the E. agglomerans-produced phenazine derivative griseoluteic acid.

Even though it possesses only low sequence homology to the better studied members of this family, the atomic resolution crystal structure of EhpR in complex with griseoluteic acid shows that the protein shares common principles with mitomycin C and bleomycin resistance protein in binding the antibiotic, namely a \u03c0-stacking sandwich interaction to hold the flat aromatic molecule (Figure 4A/B). Because the binding site does not contain residues that catalyze chemical conversion in other related proteins like glyoxalase I or fosfomycin resistance protein FosA/X, EhpR most likely acts as a chaperone involved in the secretion of phenazine antibiotics produced by P. agglomerans.

While we presently cannot exclude that AGA binds more tightly, a model of this complex based on the structure with GA argues against this because the D-alanyl group projects to the surface of EhpR with no strong interactions discernable (Figure 2D). In addition, the finding that the binding site is blocked by F109 in the apo structure indicates that the ligand needs to induce structural rearrangements. This will also make binding more difficult than in the related mitomycin C and bleomycin resistance proteins, whose binding sites are not blocked in the unliganded form (compare e.g. PDB entries 1KLL and 1KMZ, [21]). In accordance with this, the reported dissociation constants for mitomycin C resistance protein and its ligands are between 6.3 and 31 \u03bcM [21], approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the KD between EhpR and GA measured here. Weak binding may be a desired property of EhpR, since the protein also needs to be able to release its ligands once it reaches the membrane exporter and the affinity needs to be tuned to the intracellular AGA concentration in E. agglomerans to ensure efficient shuttling of the antibiotic. While the intracellular concentration of AGA is not known, other phenazine producers generate high amounts of phenazines and can be optimized to produce several grams of phenazines per liter of culture (corresponding to > 10 mM concentration) [22], indicating that the low affinity for GA observed here may just be optimal for the hypothesized chaperone function of EhpR.", "It is interesting that the binding of GA is relatively weak.

Because of this anticipated non-specificity, it is also possible that related proteins in other microorganisms can render these strains resistant to phenazines.
