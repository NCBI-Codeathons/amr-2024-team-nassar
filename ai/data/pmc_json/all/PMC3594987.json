However, benefits offered by these magic bullets have been substantially lost in subsequent days following the widespread emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant strains. While it is obvious that excessive and imprudent use of antibiotics significantly contributes to the emergence of resistant strains, antibiotic resistance is also observed in natural bacteria of remote places unlikely to be impacted by human intervention. Both antibiotic biosynthetic genes and resistance-conferring genes have been known to evolve billions of years ago, long before clinical use of antibiotics. Hence it appears that antibiotics and antibiotics resistance determinants have some other roles in nature, which often elude our attention because of overemphasis on the therapeutic importance of antibiotics and the crisis imposed by the antibiotic resistance in pathogens. In the natural milieu, antibiotics are often found to be present in sub-inhibitory concentrations acting as signaling molecules supporting the process of quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They also play an important role in the production of virulence factors and influence host\u2013parasite interactions (e.g., phagocytosis, adherence to the target cell, and so on). The evolutionary and ecological aspects of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in the naturally occurring microbial community are little understood. Therefore, the actual role of antibiotics in nature warrants in-depth investigations. Studies on such an intriguing behavior of the microorganisms promise insight into the intricacies of the microbial physiology and are likely to provide some lead in controlling the emergence and subsequent dissemination of antibiotic resistance. This article highlights some of the recent findings on the role of antibiotics and the genes that confer resistance to antibiotics in nature.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "The term \u201cantibiotics\u201d was first coined by the American microbiologist Selman Waksman and his colleagues to describe chemical substances produced by microorganisms and having antagonistic effects on the growth of other microorganisms.

Though antibiotics were introduced into the clinical practice only in the middle of the last century, the use of microorganisms for the management of microbial infections in ancient Egypt, Greece, China, and some other places of the world is well-documented.

However, emergence and propagation of bacterial strains, resistant to almost all the therapeutically useful antibiotics during the past few decades revealed the limitation of the wonder drugs. Though imprudent and excessive use of antibiotics is highlighted as a major causative factor behind the setback, it is evident by this time that antibiotic resistance does not call for exposure of the organisms to antibiotics. It is also found that genes involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance evolved thousands of years before antibiotics were introduced into the clinical practice.

Antibiotics are produced in the late stages of microbial stationary growth phase, decoupled from the doubling time, implying that they are not indispensable for sustenance of life of the producer organism.

This dual role of antibiotics remains a riddle. In the natural habitat, the diverse microbial communities exist as a multi-cellular network.

Instead, many antibiotics are known to possess biological activities other than the inhibitory role at such a low concentration and have major effects on global transcription pattern. Antibiotics such as erythromycin (an inhibitor of translation) and rifampicin (an inhibitor of transcription), at low concentrations, could modulate global bacterial transcription pattern in a random promoter library construct of Salmonella typhimurium having lux as the reporter gene. In response to the low concentration of different antibiotics, a variety of promoters were activated, including those involved in virulence, metabolic, and adaptive functions.

Comparative genomics, molecular genetics, combinatorial chemistry, and structural biology are being applied to explore new antibiotics but still the struggle is on. Several secondary approaches like reduction of antibiotic consumption, preservation of existing therapeutics, development of new antibiotics, and development of new strategies like sensitization of antibiotic-resistant organisms using QS inhibitors have been adopted but without much success.", "Relatively rare genes that happened to confer antibiotic resistance were once involved in other cellular functions, but were selected for the resistance phenotype and mobilized from the environmental genomic reservoirs, with the rapid dissemination into taxonomically divergent commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This process was very rapid on an evolutionary scale and HGT, mediated by mobile genetic elements, played a prominent role in it. So it would be wise to plan a strategy to control the process of HGT to control subsequent transfer of resistance genes to pathogens.", "Relatively rare genes that happened to confer antibiotic resistance were once involved in other cellular functions, but were selected for the resistance phenotype and mobilized from the environmental genomic reservoirs, with the rapid dissemination into taxonomically divergent commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
