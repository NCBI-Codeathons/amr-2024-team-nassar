["Ophiobolins are a group of sesterterpenoids with a 5-8-5 tricyclic skeleton. They exhibit a significant cytotoxicity and present potential medicinal prospects. However, the biosynthesis and transport mechanisms of these valuable compounds have not been fully resolved. Herein, based on a transcriptome analysis, gene inactivation, heterologous expression and feeding experiments, we fully explain the biosynthesis pathway of ophiobolin K in Aspergillus ustus 094102, especially proved to be an unclustered oxidase OblCAu that catalyzes dehydrogenation at the site of C16 and C17 of both ophiobolin F and ophiobolin C. We also find that the intermediate ophiobolin C and final product ophiobolin K could be transported into a space between the cell wall and membrane by OblDAu to avoid the inhibiting of cell growth, which is proved by a fluorescence observation of the subcellular localization and cytotoxicity tests. This study completely resolves the biosynthesis mechanism of ophiobolins in strain A. ustus 094102. At the same time, it is revealed that the burden of strain growth caused by the excessive accumulation and toxicity of secondary metabolites is closely related to compartmentalized biosynthesis.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Terpenoids, with complicated and diverse structures, are the largest category of natural products.

Sesterterpenoids are a class of rare terpenoids containing five isoprenyl units and are mainly isolated from metazoan, plants and fungi [1]. Although the amount of sesterterpenoids only accounts for less than 1.5% of the total terpenoids, many of these compounds show broad-spectrum biological activities and promising application prospects [1]. The 14/18-membered sesterterpenoids synthesized by terpene synthase LcTPS2 from Leucosceptrum canum exhibit significant immunosuppressive activity [2]. Asperterpenols A and B isolated from Aspergillus sp. 085242 strongly inhibit acetylcholinesterase [3,4]. Nine new sesterterpenoids synthesized by a silent gene cluster in Aspergillus ustus 094102 were identified by gene mining, among which aspergilol A and B showed cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 [5].", "Terpenoids, with complicated and diverse structures, are the largest category of natural products.

In A. ustus 094102, OblCAu could dehydrogenate intermediates generated in the multi-step oxidation process (Scheme 1), as we discovered 21,21-O-dihydro-6-epi-ophiobolin G (8) and 21-deoxyophiobolin K (9) from its products [7]. Additionally, the docking results of OblC with 1 and 3 further proved this point. In the catalytic pockets of both models, most residues, especially those near the side chains, were the same (Figure S8), which indicated that the side chain was the core site where OblC recognized substrates, and changes of groups at the rings away from the side chain had little effect on the catalytic activity of OblC. Owing to the substrate promiscuity of OblCAu and the non-enzymatic transformation of natural ophiobolins, nearly 20 ophiobolins were found in the metabolites of A. ustus 094102 [7]. FAD-dependent oxidoreductases play an important role in the modification of the terpene skeleton.
