Several groups, including ours, described MonAzPs biosynthesis as a highly complex pathway with many branch points, affording more than 110 MonAzP congeners in a small group of fungi in the Eurotiales order. MonAzPs biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are also very complex and mosaic-like, with some genes involved in more than one pathway, while other genes playing no apparent role in MonAzPs production. Due to this complexity, MonAzPs BGCs have been delimited differently in various fungi. Since most of these predictions rely primarily on bioinformatic analyses, it is possible that genes immediately outside the currently predicted BGC borders are also involved, especially those whose function cannot be predicted from sequence similarities alone. Conversely, some peripheral genes presumed to be part of the BGC may in fact lay outside the boundaries. This study uses a combination of computational and transcriptional analyses to predict the extent of the MonAzPs BGC in Monascus ruber M7. Gene knockouts and analysis of MonAzPs production of the mutants are then used to validate the prediction, revealing that the BGC consists of 16 genes, extending from mrpigA to mrpigP. We further predict that two strains of Talaromyces marneffei, ATCC 18224 and PM1, encode an orthologous but non-syntenic MonAzPs BGC with 14 genes. This work highlights the need to use comprehensive, integrated approaches for the more precise determination of secondary metabolite BGC boundaries.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Monascus-type azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs) are a complex mixture of secondary metabolites (SMs) with a tricyclic azaphilone scaffold, produced by a few fungal genera in the Eurotiales order such as Monascus and Talaromyces spp. MonAzPs are traditionally classified as red, orange, and yellow pigments based on their absorbance maxima (Feng et al., 2012). To the best of our knowledge, more than 110 MonAzPs components have been identified from various fungi (Chen et al., 2019). As colorants, MonAzPs have been widely used in various food products for centuries, especially in Southeast Asian countries (Chen et al., 2015). Moreover, MonAzPs also possess wide-ranging biological activities such as preventing hypertension (Lee and Pan, 2012a), lowering cholesterol levels (Lee et al., 2010), causing hypolipidemic effects (Lee and Pan, 2012b), and displaying anti-obesity (Choe et al., 2012) and anti-tumor activities (Akihisa et al., 2005).", "Monascus-type azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs) are a complex mixture of secondary metabolites (SMs) with a tricyclic azaphilone scaffold, produced by a few fungal genera in the Eurotiales order such as Monascus and Talaromyces spp. MonAzPs are traditionally classified as red, orange, and yellow pigments based on their absorbance maxima (Feng et al., 2012).

With the advent of fungal genome sequencing, several groups, including ours, proposed a unified MonAzPs biosynthetic process active in various Monascus species and strains that differ in their azaphilone pigment and citrinin productivities (He and Cox, 2016; Chen et al., 2019). This pathway was found to consist of a trunk pathway with many biosynthetic branches that use enzymes with substrate- and product flexibility. It was also seen to utilize adventitious biochemical or chemical transformations, and to incorporate some still not well characterized biosynthetic steps (Chen et al., 2019). Functional studies on the biosynthesis of MonAzPs utilized a combination of targeted gene knockouts, heterologous gene expression, and in vitro chemical and enzymatic reactions (Balakrishnan et al., 2013, 2014a,b,c, 2015, 2017a,b,c; Xie et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Liu J. et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020). These studies also revealed that the MonAzPs biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in Monascus ruber M7 also encodes the biosynthesis of monasones, anthraquinone-type SMs with antibacterial activities (Li et al., 2020).", "Investigations of the MonAzPs biosynthetic pathway started in the 1960s (Birch et al., 1962; Kurono et al., 1963; Hadfield et al., 1967).

It remains possible that genes outside the currently predicted boundaries of the BGC are also involved in MonAzPs production, especially when their functions cannot be easily predicted from the similarities of their encoded proteins alone. Conversely, it is also possible that bioinformatic methods over-estimate the extent of MonAzPs BGCs, and include genes in the predicted clusters that have in fact no role in pigment biosynthesis. Such prediction mistakes may undermine biosynthetic proposals by omitting important genes or including spurious ones, thus highlighting the need for more comprehensive prediction workflows to delimit BGC boundaries.", "The functional and structural complexities of MonAzPs BGCs and biosynthetic processes, and their variability among different fungi make it difficult to predict the extent of these BGCs, especially when relying only on routine sequence similarity searches to draw cluster boundaries.

Several widely used software tools that predict fungal SM BGCs, including SMURF1 and antiSMASH2 detect the genes encoding such core enzymes, and anchor the predicted BGCs around these genes (Khaldi et al., 2010; Blin et al., 2019). However, these very useful software tools are not particularly well suited to define BGC boundaries. To address this need, Takeda et al. (2014) devised a novel comparative genomics method to predict the extent of SM BGCs by searching for gene similarities in genome sequence assemblies, and by evaluating the presence of similar genes even in non-syntenic blocks.

Some pathway-specific regulators control the transcription of all the genes involved in the production of a given SM, while others regulate only a key subset of the structural genes. For example, the transcription factor Sol4 governs all six biosynthetic genes in the BGC of solanapyrone, a polyketide-derived phytotoxic SM from the fungus Ascochyta rabiei (Kim et al., 2015). Such pathway-specific regulators may also be exploited for cluster boundary predictions. Thus, the boundaries of the BGC for azanigerone A, an azaphilone pigment from Aspergillus niger, were predicted using RT-PCR analysis in a strain with an activated pathway-specific positive regulator (Zabala et al., 2012). In contrast, the expression of only some key structural genes is modulated by the pathway-specific regulators for apicidin, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, fusaric acid, a mycotoxin produced by fusaria, and sterigmatocystin, a carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by aspergilli (Jeon et al., 2011; Studt et al., 2016; Wiemann et al., 2018). Finally, pathway-specific regulators may also modulate the expression of genes with no obvious function in SM biosynthesis, resistance or export, as is the case with the fusarin C BGC in Fusarium fujikuroi (Niehaus et al., 2013). Therefore, transcription analysis that relies solely on the differential expression of genes governed by a pathway-specific regulator to predict SM BGC boundaries may also omit important genes, or overestimate BGC size due to pleiotropic effects, or the extent of euchromatic regions.", "The biosynthesis of fungal SMs is governed by a hierarchical regulatory network that often involves pathway-specific regulators (Lyu et al., 2020).

Functional studies with a near-identical genomic locus in T. marneffei strain PM1 have been reported by Woo et al. (2014). Surprisingly, the knockdown of only five genes of this locus was shown to lead to the loss of Monascus-type azaphilone pigment production. Correspondingly, only pks3 (66% identity to mrpigA), rp1 (46% identity to mrpigB), rp2 (58% identity to mrpigK), rp3 (58% identity to mrpigJ), and rp4 (65% identity to mrpigH) were annotated as constituents of the Monascus-type azaphilone BGC in T. marneffei PM1. Further research is necessary to reveal why the knockdown of genes orf3 (65% identity to mrpigN), orf4 (63% identity to mrpigD), orf5 (70% identity to mrpigC), orf7 (71% identity to mrpigG), orf8 (70% identity to mrpigE), or orf9 (57% identity to mrpigP) were seen to be neutral for pigment biosynthesis in T. marneffei PM1 when the knockout of the orthologous genes in M. ruber M7 eliminates or at least severely reduces the production of the classical MonAzPs 1\u20134 (Liu et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017).

Importantly, citrinin biosynthesis is governed in Monascus spp. by a BGC different from the one for MonAzPs (He and Cox, 2016), necessitating the further evaluation of the proposed connection of the T. marneffei PM1 BGC (and its equivalent in strain ATCC 18224) to citrinin biosynthesis.

T. marneffei was reported to produce MonAzPs-type soluble red pigments (Ogihara et al., 2000, 2001; Frisvad et al., 2013; Arai et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2018; Morales-Oyervides et al., 2020; Tolborg et al., 2020), and accordingly, orthologs of most of the M. ruber M7 MonAzPs biosynthetic genes were found to be encoded in the T. marneffei ATCC 18224 BGC, albeit in a non-syntenic arrangement (Chen et al., 2017, 2019; Pavesi et al., 2021). While the genes corresponding to mrpigF, mrpigO, and mrpigL were absent from the T. marneffei BGC, similar genes to mrpigF and mrpigO are encoded elsewhere in the genome of this fungus (Supplementary Table 4), and a mrpigL equivalent is not necessary for azaphilone pigment biosynthesis. Functional studies with a near-identical genomic locus in T. marneffei strain PM1 have been reported by Woo et al. (2014). Surprisingly, the knockdown of only five genes of this locus was shown to lead to the loss of Monascus-type azaphilone pigment production. Correspondingly, only pks3 (66% identity to mrpigA), rp1 (46% identity to mrpigB), rp2 (58% identity to mrpigK), rp3 (58% identity to mrpigJ), and rp4 (65% identity to mrpigH) were annotated as constituents of the Monascus-type azaphilone BGC in T. marneffei PM1. Further research is necessary to reveal why the knockdown of genes orf3 (65% identity to mrpigN), orf4 (63% identity to mrpigD), orf5 (70% identity to mrpigC), orf7 (71% identity to mrpigG), orf8 (70% identity to mrpigE), or orf9 (57% identity to mrpigP) were seen to be neutral for pigment biosynthesis in T. marneffei PM1 when the knockout of the orthologous genes in M. ruber M7 eliminates or at least severely reduces the production of the classical MonAzPs 1\u20134 (Liu et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017). In addition, gene knockdown experiments in T. marneffei PM1, targeting pks3 (XP_002149769 in strain ATCC 18224, the ortholog of the mrpigA PKS), and rp1 (XP_002149768 in strain ATCC 18224, the ortholog of mrpigB, encoding a transcriptional regulator) seem to also connect the BGC in strain PM1 to the production of citrinin, a mycotoxin with a similar but not identical chromophore to that of MonAzPs (Woo et al., 2014). Importantly, citrinin biosynthesis is governed in Monascus spp. by a BGC different from the one for MonAzPs (He and Cox, 2016), necessitating the further evaluation of the proposed connection of the T. marneffei PM1 BGC (and its equivalent in strain ATCC 18224) to citrinin biosynthesis. Integration of further bioinformatic, transcriptomic, gene knockdown/gene knockout, gene overexpression, and metabolite analyses, as described here for the MonAzPs BGC of M. ruber M7, is expected to answer such outstanding questions.", "The MonAzPs BGC represents an especially tough challenge for cluster boundary prediction. This is because of the composite, mosaic-like nature of this BGC. First, it is a supercluster with genes necessary to produce two structurally different SM groups: MonAzPs-type azaphilones and monasone-type naphthoquinones (Li et al., 2020). Some genes are involved solely in the biosynthesis of one or the other SM group, while others are necessary for both. Next, MonAzPs production itself is highly complex, with many metabolic branch points opening up shunt pathways, and integrating fortuitous enzymatic and chemical reactions that afford a huge variety of pigment products (Chen et al., 2019). Last, this BGC also straddles genes or even sub-clusters (such as the six-gene sub-cluster in M. pilosus and M. ruber NRRL 1597) with no relationship to the production of MonAzPs or monasones (Balakrishnan et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017). Any and all of these characteristics could easily confuse BGC border prediction methods that rely on one type of dataset. Thus, during the trimming step of the comparative genomics-based prediction (Takeda et al., 2014), the calculated scores at mrpigG, mrpigK, and mrpigN all showed inflection points (Figure 1D), potentially misleading a user to call the end of the MonAzPs BGC at any of these genes. When analyzing differential trascriptomic data by comparing the wild-type and the \u0394mrpigB strains, the expression levels of the mrpigC, mrpigJ, mrpigK, or mrpigL genes were not significantly downregulated in the strain that is deficient in the cluster-specific regulator (Figure 2B). This could have been taken as a sure sign that the end of the BGC was already reached. Conversely, although both the mrpigAup1 (at the left border) and the mrpigPdown1 gene (at the right border) were found to be downregulated in \u0394mrpigB strains (Figure 2B), neither comparative genomics nor gene knockouts support the inclusion of these genes in the MonAzPs BGC (Figures 1, 4). Finally, gene disruption of mrpigL, a gene well within the BGC boundaries, does not affect the production of MonAzPs (Chen et al., 2017), again giving a false signal for reaching the end of the BGC. Based on these and similar examples, we believe that only the integration of all three methods used in this study (comparative genomics, differential transcriptomics, and gene deletion with subsequent metabolite analysis) could adequately identify BGC borders in fungi, at least in the case of highly complex clusters such as the one for MonAzPs production.", "The MonAzPs BGC represents an especially tough challenge for cluster boundary prediction.
