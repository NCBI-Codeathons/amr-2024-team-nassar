For instance, morning exercise groups, as opposed to evening exercise groups, may be waking up earlier and being exposed to light earlier in the day. Over several weeks, they will entrain to this earlier light exposure, and their performance rhythm will also be expected to advance, which could explain the observations. On the other hand, some studies noted no differences in morning or evening BT between morning-trained and evening-trained groups which suggests either light exposures are not different between groups or are not sufficiently different to differentially affect the BT rhythm.34 36 A case study of exercise earlier in the day, measuring BT at several time points, identified changes in BT amplitude post-intervention but not in the observed phase timing of peaks or troughs.38 Another study demonstrates changes in diurnal variation of performance but not in the diurnal rhythm of testosterone or cortisol.39 This leads to the question: \u201cwhy might the performance rhythm phase-shift separately from other well-described circadian rhythms such as BT, cortisol or testosterone?\u201d A \u2018masking effect\u2019 of exercise on exercise performance could offer an explanation. However, this non-circadian effect needs to have lasted from 48 hours up to 2 weeks after the last exercise session as per the timing of the post-intervention testing session in these studies.34 36 37 What \u2018washout\u2019 period would be required to observe circadian effects from masking effects remains open. One study indicated no effect of habitual time of exercise on diurnal variation in performance.40 Different to the other studies reported here,34\u201339 the authors did not observe a diurnal variation in performance to begin with.40 They suggest that the tropical environmental conditions in Guadeloupe may have played a role.40 Remarkably, even an acute bout of submaximal cycling performed the day before a time-trial improved performance when it occurred at the same time-of-day as the time-trial.41 The authors suggest chronotype preference, fatigue (glycogen and lactate levels), circadian phase-shift and time familiarisation as the potential explanations, but that the latter is the most likely.41 However, other studies have observed phase-shifting of performance independent of BT34 36; thus, a circadian phase-shift of performance rhythm independent of BT may be possible.", "Habitual time of exercise and diurnal variation in performance", "Habitual time of exercise and diurnal variation in performance", "Author, year Finding.", "Author, year Finding.", "Souissi et al 200237 The time-of-day of exercise (6 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength and anaerobic performance, measured 2 weeks postintervention..", "Souissi et al 200237 The time-of-day of exercise (6 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength and anaerobic performance, measured 2 weeks postintervention..", "Edwards et al 200541 Cycling the day before improved next day time-trial performance when performed at the same time-of-day..", "Edwards et al 200541 Cycling the day before improved next day time-trial performance when performed at the same time-of-day..", "Blonc et al 201040 The time-of-day of exercise (5 weeks) did not affect diurnal variation in muscular strength..", "Blonc et al 201040 The time-of-day of exercise (5 weeks) did not affect diurnal variation in muscular strength..", "Chtourou et al 201235 The time-of-day of exercise (12 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength..", "Chtourou et al 201235 The time-of-day of exercise (12 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength..", "Chtourou et al 201236 The time-of-day of exercise (8 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength and anaerobic performance but not body temperature (BT), measured 2 weeks post-intervention..", "Chtourou et al 201236 The time-of-day of exercise (8 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength and anaerobic performance but not body temperature (BT), measured 2 weeks post-intervention..", "Imafuku 201638 Exercise affected BT amplitude but not phase..", "Imafuku 201638 Exercise affected BT amplitude but not phase..", "Kuusmaa et al 201639 Exercise-type sequence and time-of-day (12\u201324 weeks) affects diurnal variations in performance after 12 weeks but not cortisol or testosterone..", "Kuusmaa et al 201639 Exercise-type sequence and time-of-day (12\u201324 weeks) affects diurnal variations in performance after 12 weeks but not cortisol or testosterone..", "Zbidi et al 201634 The time-of-day of exercise (6 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength but not BT, measured from 48 hours postintervention..", "Zbidi et al 201634 The time-of-day of exercise (6 weeks) affects diurnal variation in muscular strength but not BT, measured from 48 hours postintervention..", "The following studies demonstrate the potential for exercise to interact with the human circadian system to improve health (table 4).
