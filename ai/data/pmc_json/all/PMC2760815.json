["The 16S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase enzymes that modify nucleosides in the drug binding site to provide self-resistance in aminoglycoside-producing micro-organisms have been proposed to comprise two distinct groups of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent RNA enzymes, namely the Kgm and Kam families. Here, the nucleoside methylation sites for three Kgm family methyltransferases, Sgm from Micromonospora zionensis, GrmA from Micromonospora echinospora and Krm from Frankia sp. Ccl3, were experimentally determined as G1405 by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. These results significantly extend the list of securely characterized G1405 modifying enzymes and experimentally validate their grouping into a single enzyme family. Heterologous expression of the KamB methyltransferase from Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius experimentally confirmed the requirement for an additional 60 amino acids on the deduced KamB N-terminus to produce an active methyltransferase acting at A1408, as previously suggested by an in silico analysis. Finally, the modifications at G1405 and A1408, were shown to confer partially overlapping but distinct resistance profiles in Escherichia coli. Collectively, these data provide a more secure and systematic basis for classification of new aminoglycoside resistance methyltransferases from producers and pathogenic bacteria on the basis of their sequences and resistance profiles.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "The aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin was the first drug discovered through systematic screening of natural products active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1944 (1). In the following decades, many aminoglycosides were isolated from soil bacteria, primarily the Gram-positive actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora (2,3). These antibiotics comprise a structurally varied family of poly-cationic compounds with a central aminocyclitol ring, most frequently 2-deoxystreptamine or streptamine, connected via glycosidic bonds to amino sugars. The numerous hydroxyl and primary amine groups of these substituents give aminoglycosides their overall positive charge and, based on their position, define three distinct structural classes of drug. The 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamines (4,6-DOS) include kanamycin and most clinically useful aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin. The same core may alternatively be 4,5-disubstituted (4,5-DOS) as in the aminoglycosides neomycin and paromomycin, while the final group of compounds consists of those that do not fit into either of these groups, such as apramycin, streptomycin, hygromycin B and spectinomycin.", "The aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin was the first drug discovered through systematic screening of natural products active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1944 (1).

Resistance by 16S rRNA methylation, accomplished by S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent rRNA resistance methyltransferases (MTs), is a frequently occurring mechanism alongside drug modification in the aminoglycoside-producing actinomycetes (5,6). Modifications at two sites, G1405 and A1408, are thought to be incorporated by two different methyltransferase protein families (6\u20139). However, these sites of modification have only been experimentally determined as G1405 for KgmB from Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius (10), formerly classified as Streptomyces tenebrarius (11), and A1408 for KamA (also known as IrmA) and KamC from Streptomyces tenjimariensis and Saccharopolyspora hirsuta respectively (5,9). Methylation sites have also been identified for functionally equivalent methyltransferases from isolates of bacterial pathogens, as G1405 for ArmA and RmtB, and A1408 for NpmA (12\u201314). Typically, activity for other MTs has been inferred indirectly by their inability to further methylate ribosome subunits already protected by one of these enzymes (15). Furthermore, although it is clear that these base methylations can confer high-level resistance to specific combinations of aminoglycoside antibiotics (5), despite their close proximity the action spectra of each does not entirely overlap and few systematic studies have been performed to date.

To examine whether the triply and doubly methylated RNAs might be formed during the measurement from a 4-fold methylated precursor, we examined the loss of methyl groups from the fully methylated composite 1402-1415 RNA fragment (m/z 4501.73) in a post-source decay (PSD) experiment (Figure 4). The ion gate was set to allow only ions from m/z 4500\u20134560 (shaded region in the spectra of Figure 4) into the field-free drift region of the ToF tube with the laser intensity increased to cause a higher degree of laser-induced dissociation (LID). As expected, the parent ion was measured at m/z 4501.46 and, in this mode of operation, all smaller ions must be fragments derived from this ion. A strong fragment measured at m/z 4445.55, resulting from the loss of all four methyl groups from the composite 1402\u20131415 RNA fragment was observed (Figure 4B). This supports our hypothesis that the heterogeneity in the data for the composite RNA fragment results from the loss of methyl group(s) during the measurement and that the fragment with the largest mass is methylated at four different sites, including by Sgm at G1405 (Figures 2B and 3C). We do not observe any signals for the RNA fragments resulting from RNase T1 cleavage at nt 1405 in E. coli expressing Sgm and no signal for the composite 1402\u20131415 RNase T1 fragment in untransformed E. coli (Figure 3). Taken together with the PSD data, we conclude therefore that the methylation of G1405 in E. coli expressing Sgm is stoichiometric.\nFigure 4.Post-source decay (PSD) analysis of composite RNA fragment 1402\u20131415 after Sgm in vivo methylation.

Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of all kam genes revealed a conserved region upstream of the start codon originally suggested by Holmes et al. (9).

Our results systematically establish the link between the 16S rRNA modification type and aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance pattern conferred by these modifications. Both groups of 2-DOS antibiotics bind to 16S rRNA so that their Ring I substituents (see chemical structures associated with Table 1) are placed in close proximity to A1408.

This modification confers resistance to apramycin and the kanamycin group of 4,6-DOS aminoglycosides other than gentamicin. The modification does not, however, confer significant resistance to paromomycin (5) despite the observation of two direct hydrogen bonds to A1408 in the crystal structure of the antibiotic-30S complex (40). It is possible that additional contacts made by other parts of these drugs sufficiently compensate for those lost near A1408. Alternatively, secondary binding sites on the 70S ribosome might account for the unaltered antibiotic susceptibility as shown recently for paromomycin and gentamicin which also bind to 23S rRNA helix 69 in the vicinity of the P-site tRNA to inhibit ribosome recycling (41).
