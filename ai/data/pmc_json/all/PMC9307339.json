["Academic Editor: Zhaoqi Dong", "The clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited because of its cardiotoxicity. However, the pathogenic mechanism of DOX and the role of miRNA in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remain to be further studied. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-199 in DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity. A mouse model of myocardial cell injury induced by DOX was established. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression changes of miR-199 and TATA-binding protein associated factor 9B (TAF9b) in DOX-induced cardiac injury. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, namely, Bax and Bcl-2, were detected by qPCR. The expression of Beclin-1 and LC3b was detected by western blotting. The binding effect of miR-199 with TAF9b was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In this study, overexpression of miR-199 could promote cardiotoxicity. Inhibition of miR-199 could alleviate DOX-mediated myocardial injury. Further studies showed that miR-199 targeted TAF9b. Moreover, miR-199 promoted apoptosis of myocardial cells and aggravated autophagy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TAF9B knockdown reversed the myocardial protective effect of miR-199 inhibitors. Therefore, miR-199 promoted DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity by targeting TAF9b, thereby aggravating apoptosis and regulating autophagy.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective and commonly implemented anticancer drug for hematological diseases and solid tumors, and it is implemented as a first-line drug for a variety of cancers [1\u20133]. However, DOX can lead to multiple-organ toxicity in patients. As an anticancer agent, DOX can lead to long-term dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and heart failure [4, 5]. Mechanisms of DOX-mediated myocardial injury comprised cardiomyocyte abiosis [6], atrophy [7], autophagy disturbance [8], and oxidative stress [9].", "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective and commonly implemented anticancer drug for hematological diseases and solid tumors, and it is implemented as a first-line drug for a variety of cancers [1\u20133].

The results revealed that the apoptotic rate in the miR-199 mimics\u2009+\u2009TAF9b group was evidently lower than that in the miR-199 mimic group (Figure 6(c)). Third, we detected the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in each group. The results revealed that Bax in the miR-199 mimics\u2009+\u2009TAF9b group was evidently lower than that in the miR-199 mimic group (Figure 6(d)), and Bcl-2 in the miR-199 mimics\u2009+\u2009TAF9b group was distinctly lower than that in the miR-199 mimic group (Figure 6(e)). Finally, we detected autophagy-related proteins, including Beclin-1 and LC3B by western blot. The results showed that overexpression of miR-199 promoted the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3B compared with the control group. However, Beclin-1 and LC3B decreased in miR-199 mimics\u2009+\u2009TAF9b group (Figure 6(f)). Therefore, overexpression of TAF9b can reverse miR-199-mediated autophagy in cardiomyocytes.", "Our study showed that overexpression of TAF9b could reverse the myocardial injury of miR-199. DOX induction was divided into the following groups: mimics-NC group, miR-199 mimic group, vector-NC group, and miR-199 mimics\u2009+\u2009TAF9b group. First, we detected the apoptosis in each group by flow cytometry. The results suggested that the apoptotic rate in the miR-199 mimic\u2009+\u2009TAF9b group was lower than that in the miR-199 mimic group (Figures 6(a)-6(b)). Second, we used TUNEL staining to detect apoptosis in each group. The results revealed that the apoptotic rate in the miR-199 mimics\u2009+\u2009TAF9b group was evidently lower than that in the miR-199 mimic group (Figure 6(c)).

Discussion", "4. Discussion", "DOX is a widely used anticancer drug [35\u201337]. However, the clinical application of DOX is limited because of its potential to cause severe heart failure and degenerative cardiomyopathy in the elderly patients with previous heart disease [38,39]. Its cardiotoxicity limits its clinical treatment. Although several mechanisms of toxicity have been proposed [40\u201342], the mechanism of toxicity in other organs remains elusive, but the role of oxidative stress shows great potential as a mechanism of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity [43\u201345]. Some scholars have proposed the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) mechanism, but AOP is still in its infancy, which plays a little role in the establishment of complex toxicology. However, the tools of AOP can be used for toxicology and risk assessment in the future, as it can comply with the OECD guidelines [46]. Chemically mediated skin allergy, cholestasis, and liver-related diseases are examples of AOPs [47]. In addition, in 6 to 8-week-old C57BL/6N mice, the destruction of intestinal epithelial cells was the common cause of adverse reactions caused by DOX (20\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), which led to the leakage of intestinal microorganism-related endotoxin and enhanced TLR4 signal. Immunotoxicity is caused by systemic inflammation and multiple-organ injury [48,49].", "DOX is a widely used anticancer drug [35\u201337].

Zhao et al. screened 18 differentially expressed microRNAs using the microRNA microarray analysis technique in rat heart tissue mediated by DOX [51]. The results displayed that DOX increased miR-140-5p. Liu et al. proposed that let-7f-2-3p regulated by lncRNA NEAT1 aggravated DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity by inhibiting the HAX-1 nuclear outlet [52].
