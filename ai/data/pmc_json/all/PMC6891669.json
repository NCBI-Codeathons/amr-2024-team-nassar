["In trichothecene-producing fusaria, isotrichodermol (ITDol) is the first intermediate with a trichothecene skeleton. In the biosynthetic pathway of trichothecene, a 3-O-acetyltransferase, encoded by Tri101, acetylates ITDol to a less-toxic intermediate, isotrichodermin (ITD). Although trichothecene resistance has been conferred to microbes and plants transformed with Tri101, there are no reports of resistance in cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we found that a 3-O-acetyl group of trichothecenes is liable to hydrolysis by esterases in fetal bovine serum and FM3A cells. We transfected the cells with Tri101 under the control of the MMTV-LTR promoter and obtained a cell line G3 with the highest level of C-3 acetylase activity. While the wild-type FM3A cells hardly grew in the medium containing 0.40 \u03bcM ITDol, many G3 cells survived at this concentration. The IC50 values of ITDol and ITD in G3 cells were 1.0 and 9.6 \u03bcM, respectively, which were higher than the values of 0.23 and 3.0 \u03bcM in the wild-type FM3A cells. A similar, but more modest, tendency was observed in deoxynivalenol and 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. Our findings indicate that the expression of Tri101 conferred trichothecene resistance in cultured mammalian cells.", "Key Contribution", "This is the first study to demonstrate that transfection of Tri101 encoding trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase confers resistance to trichothecenes in mammalian cells. As the C-3 acetyl group of trichothecenes is liable to be digested by esterases present in cell culture, the toxicities of 3-O-acetyltrichothecenes may have been overestimated in previous studies.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Trichothecenes are a group of mycotoxins produced by several filamentous fungi including Fusarium. They have a trichothecene skeleton of 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene in common, but their side chain modification greatly varies, resulting in a large difference in their toxicity [1,2]. They exert toxicity mainly through the inhibition of protein synthesis in eukaryotes [3].

In the early biosynthetic pathway of trichothecenes, trichodiene is first synthesized through the cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate by Tri5p [6]. Trichodiene is then oxygenated to isotrichotriol, followed by spontaneous cyclization to produce the following t-type trichothecenes: Fusarium graminearum produces deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, and their acetylated forms; Fusarium sporotrichioides produces T-2 toxin, neosalaniol, and diacetoxyscirpenol. On the other hand, in non-fusaria, including Myrothecium, Trichoderma, Trichothecium, Stachybotrys, and Spicellum [7], trichodiene is oxygenated to isotrichodiol followed by spontaneous cyclization to produce d-type trichothecenes. There is another classification method of dividing trichothecenes into four types (A\u2013D) based on their chemical structures [8]. Type B group is distinguished from type A group by the presence of a ketone at C-8, and either type is synthesized by both t-type and d-type trichothecene producers. Type C group, which contains a 7,8-epoxide, and type D group, which contains a macrocyclic ring between C-4 and C-15, are exclusively produced by d-type trichothecene producers.", "Based on the biosynthetic pathways, trichothecenes are largely divided into two groups: t-type trichothecenes, with a modifying group at C-3 position, and d-type trichothecenes, without a modifying group [4,5].

Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Each Trichothecene in WT and G3 Cells", "2.5. Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Each Trichothecene in WT and G3 Cells", "2.5. Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Each Trichothecene in WT and G3 Cells", "We performed a water-soluble tetrazolium salts (WST) assay to evaluate the cytotoxicity of DON, 3-ADON, ITDol, and ITD more accurately, based on the assumption that the cytotoxicity of 3-acetyltrichothecenes had been overestimated in previous studies. First, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of ITDol and ITD in WT cells were determined using N-medium or B-medium (Supplementary Figure S1). The observed IC50 values of ITDol and ITD were close when WT cells were incubated in N-medium (0.19 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.26 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5M, respectively), however, a large difference was evident when assayed in B-medium (0.20 \u00b1 0.01 and 2.14 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5M, respectively). The higher sensitivity of cultured mammalian cells to ITD in N-medium seems to be attributed to the contaminating esterases that act on ITD (Supplementary Table S1), resulting in the formation of much more toxic ITDol. This observation strongly suggests that without an elaboration to keep the 3-acetyl group attached to the ITDol ring, the toxicity of 3-acetyltrichothecene tends to be overestimated. Although the apparent IC50 value of 2.14 \u00b5M observed for ITD in B-medium could be closer to the actual IC50 value of intact ITD, this value may in fact be lower than the actual value, as an acetyl group may not remain attached to the C-3 position of the trichothecene skeleton due to the presence of intrinsic esterases hydrolyzing the 3-O-acetyl group in cultured mammalian cells (Figure 1, chemical reactions). Thus, we attempted to measure the concentration of ITDol possibly produced from ITD in the cell culture medium in this assay; however, ITDol was not detected in our HPLC analysis (limit of detection; 1.2 \u00b5M). As the IC50 value of FM3A cells against ITDol was as low as 0.22 \u00b5M (Figure 3), ITDol levels below the detection limit possibly affected cell growth. The higher toxicity of ITD may be explained by the C-3 deacetylation of ITD during the assay.", "We performed a water-soluble tetrazolium salts (WST) assay to evaluate the cytotoxicity of DON, 3-ADON, ITDol, and ITD more accurately, based on the assumption that the cytotoxicity of 3-acetyltrichothecenes had been overestimated in previous studies.
