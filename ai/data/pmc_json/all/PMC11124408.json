["Surfactin is widely used in the petroleum extraction, cosmetics, biopharmaceuticals and agriculture industries. It possesses antibacterial and antiviral activities and can reduce interfacial tension. Bacillus are commonly used as production chassis, but wild-type Bacillus subtilis 168 cannot synthesise surfactin. In this study, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene sfp* (with a T base removed) was overexpressed and enzyme activity was restored, enabling B. subtilis 168 to synthesise surfactin with a yield of 747.5 \u00b1 6.5 mg/L. Knocking out ppsD and yvkC did not enhance surfactin synthesis. Overexpression of predicted surfactin transporter gene yfiS increased its titre to 1060.7 \u00b1 89.4 mg/L, while overexpression of yerP, ycxA and ycxA-efp had little or negative effects on surfactin synthesis, suggesting YfiS is involved in surfactin efflux. By replacing the native promoter of the srfA operon encoding surfactin synthase with three promoters, surfactin synthesis was significantly reduced. However, knockout of the global transcriptional regulator gene codY enhanced the surfactin titre to 1601.8 \u00b1 91.9 mg/L. The highest surfactin titre reached 3.89 \u00b1 0.07 g/L, with the yield of 0.63 \u00b1 0.02 g/g DCW, after 36 h of fed-batch fermentation in 5 L fermenter. This study provides a reference for further understanding surfactin synthesis and constructing microbial cell factories.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Surfactin is a lipopeptide biosurfactant with a cyclic structure composed of seven amino acid residues (both L- and D-amino acids) connected to a long \u03b2-hydroxyl fatty acid chain (usually C13\u2212C15) by a lactone bond, making it an amphiphilic molecule [1,2,3]. Due to its strong ability to reduce interfacial tension between oil and water, surfactin is used to reduce the emulsification and viscosity of crude oil for enhanced oil recovery in the petroleum extraction industry [4,5,6]. Moreover, it can be effectively applied in cosmetics in the form of solvents, soaps and facial cleansers due to its emulsification, washing, foaming, solubilisation, wetting, penetration, dispersion and low toxicity characteristics [7,8]. The long-chain fatty acid of surfactin can penetrate into the interior of cell membranes, causing dissolution and damage, which is the basis for its antibacterial activity [9,10]. Surfactin can also break down viral lipid membranes, and it has antiviral properties [11]. Therefore, it can be applied as a biological preservative to effectively control the growth of harmful microorganisms in food [12], and it may prevent fungal infections and skin diseases [13]. In addition, it has broad application prospects in the agricultural field [14], such as controlling apple scab [15].", "Surfactin is a lipopeptide biosurfactant with a cyclic structure composed of seven amino acid residues (both L- and D-amino acids) connected to a long \u03b2-hydroxyl fatty acid chain (usually C13\u2212C15) by a lactone bond, making it an amphiphilic molecule [1,2,3].

However, low productivity of surfactin remains an important limiting factor in its industrial production [16,17]. For instance, combinatorial metabolic engineering of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332, including enhanced nitrate reduction, fatty acid hydroxylation, rational transporter engineering and feeding, yielded 14.4 g/L of surfactin, with the productivity of 0.6 g/L/h, the highest reported productivity to date [18]. Therefore, the development of microbial cell factories is crucial for its overproduction. Surfactin was first discovered in the fermentation broth of B. subtilis in 1968, with four isomers identified [19]. Moreover, B. subtilis, a model Gram-positive bacterium, grows fast and is easy to cultivate. It has excellent expression systems with good genetic stability, excellent protein secretion ability, no strong codon preferences and mature gene modification technologies. It has been recognised by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a \u2018Generally Recognised as Safe\u2019 (GRAS) strain [20]. Therefore, B. subtilis is commonly used as a chassis for producing surfactin through metabolic engineering [18,21,22].", "Currently, the main production methods for surfactin include chemical synthesis and microbial fermentation, with the latter favoured due to superior environmental friendliness and biocompatibility.

B. subtilis synthesises the corresponding precursors through primary metabolism, such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, protein metabolism, lipid metabolism and other pathways (Figure 1). The assembly of surfactin is then catalysed by a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) system, which includes initiation, peptide chain extension, cyclisation and release [23,24]. The NRPS, also known as surfactin synthase, is a multi-domain protein composed of multiple modules, including the SrfAA, SrfAB, SrfAC and SrfAD subunits. They are encoded by srfAA, srfAB, srfAC and srfAD, respectively, together forming the 27 kb srfA operon [24]. Transcription of the srfA operon is regulated by the quorum sensing system ComQXPA, and phosphorylated ComA binds to a specific region of its promoter, activating its transcription [25,26,27]. In addition, downstream of the srfA operon, there is a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene sfp that is essential for surfactin synthesis, which functions to activate surfactin synthase [28]. However, sfp is an inactive pseudogene in wild-type B. subtilis 168, which cannot synthesise surfactin. Wu et al., (2019) integrated the sfp gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MT45 into the genome of B. subtilis 168 at the same locus, resulting in a surfactin titre of 400 mg/L [21]. Subsequently, biofilm formation-related genes were knocked out, potential self-resistance associated proteins were overexpressed, the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway was engineered, comQXPA from B. amyloliquefaciens MT45 was overexpressed and the global transcriptional regulator gene codY was knocked out, resulting in a surfactin titre of 12.8 g/L [21]. Wang et al., (2019) integrated sfp from B. amyloliquefaciens DSM7 into the ydeO (encoding an unknown protein) locus of the genome of B. subtilis 168, resulting in a surfactin titre of 450 mg/L [29]. The clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) technology was used to inhibit the expression of L-glutamate racemase genes yrpC and racE, resulting in a surfactin titre of 750 mg/L [29]. Hu et al., (2020) integrated sfp from Bacillus velezensis BS-37 into the genome of B. subtilis 168 at the same locus, resulting in a surfactin titre of 982 \u00b1 98 mg/L [30]. Medium-chain acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase (encoded by bte) and fatty acyl CoA ligase (encoded by yhfL) were overexpressed, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene fadE was knocked out, resulting in a surfactin titre of 2203 mg/L, with xylose as the carbon source [30]. However, there have been no studies on the overexpression of endogenous active sfp in B. subtilis 168. In addition, the efflux of surfactin is an important factor limiting its synthesis. Overexpression of three putative lipopeptide transporters genes: yerP (endogenous), ycxA and krsE (heterologous) in B. subtilis THY-7 resulted in a 145%, 89% and 52% increase in surfactin production, respectively [31], and overexpression of endogenous yerP in B. subtilis 168 resulted in a 35.3% increase in surfactin production [21], demonstrating that YerP acts as the major surfactin exporter. Research by Xia et al., (2024) showed that preprotein translocase SecA, signal recognition particle receptor FtsY and cell division ATP-binding protein FtsE are also involved in the transport of surfactin in B. subtilis ATCC 21332 [18].", "In B. subtilis, the biosynthesis of surfactin mainly involves the synthesis and structural assembly of precursors (fatty acids and amino acids).

Due to the presence of an additional T496 base in the nucleotide sequence of sfp in B. subtilis 168, its transcription is terminated prematurely (Figure S1). Therefore, sfp is an inactive pseudogene in B. subtilis 168. Indeed, no surfactin was detected in the supernatant of its fermentation broth (Figure 2A and Figure S2A). To make the PPTase active, we designed primers to amplify the preceding and following nucleotide sequences of the sfp gene, removing the T496 base in the process. These two nucleotide sequences were spliced together through overlapping PCR, then spliced with the strong TP2 promoter [36] to integrate into the yrpC locus of the genome of strain BS168N, yielding recombinant strain BSSF2 (Table 1). In addition, we constructed yrpC gene knockout strain BSSF1 as a control for BSSF2. In B. subtilis, yrpC encodes glutamate racemase, which catalyses the racemisation of L-glutamate to produce D-glutamate [42]. L-glutamate is one of the precursors for synthesising surfactin, so the knockout of yrpC should reduce the consumption of L-glutamate. Moreover, Wang et al.

CodY binds to the promoter of the srfA operon, occupying the binding site between DNA and positive regulatory proteins, leading to inhibition of the transcription of this operon [53]. We knocked out the codY gene of strain BSSF52 to generate knockout strain BSSF64.

Increasing Surfactin Production through Fed-Batch Fermentation", "3.5. Increasing Surfactin Production through Fed-Batch Fermentation", "3.5. Increasing Surfactin Production through Fed-Batch Fermentation", "To improve the fermentation level of surfactin, we performed fed-batch fermentation of recombinant strain BSSF64 in a 5 L fermenter. After 6 h of fermentation, a large number of bubbles were evident, and the addition of soybean oil and polyether defoamer had no defoaming effect. Hence, fermentation could not proceed normally. A defoaming effect could only be achieved by adding organosilicon defoamer. After 36 h of fermentation, the maximum OD600 value of BSSF64 was 11.54 \u00b1 1.83 (Figure 6A). Although its growth was almost twice that of flask fermentation, it was far below the growth achieved when using engineered B. subtilis for fed-batch fermentation to produce other high value-added chemicals [34,54].

This might be due to inappropriate fermentation conditions leading to poor growth or to the toxicity of surfactin or organosilicon defoamer toward cells, which may have inhibited bacterial growth and surfactin synthesis. By optimising the fermentation medium and conditions alone, the OD600 of B. subtilis ATCC 21332 reached 60, and surfactin production was increased from 335 mg/L to 5.3 g/L [18]. Therefore, optimising the fermentation conditions, including carbon sources, nitrogen sources, pH, inoculum size and metal ions by adding Fe nanoparticles [55] or EDTA-Fe2+ [56], may be crucial for improving surfactin production in the future.

Conclusions", "The wild-type B. subtilis 168 strain cannot synthesise surfactin due to the presence of a frameshift mutation in the nucleotide sequence of sfp encoding PPTase, resulting in its inactivation. This study first removed the T496 base and integrated the overexpression of sfp*, which restored the activity of PPTase and increased the surfactin titre from zero to 747.5 \u00b1 6.5 mg/L. The knockout of ppsD and yvkC had a minimal effect on surfactin synthesis. Overexpression of yerP, yfiS, ycxA and ycxA-efp indicated that YfiS might be the main surfactin transporter, and its overexpression increased surfactin production by 37.4% compared to the control strain. Replacing the native promoter of the srfA operon with three constitutive promoters significantly reduced the ability to synthesise surfactin, with yields ranging from 3.1 \u00b1 0.2 mg/L to 16.5 \u00b1 1.3 mg/L. However, the knockout of codY increased the surfactin titre by 51% to 1601.8 \u00b1 91.9 mg/L. Finally, fed-batch fermentation was carried out in a 5 L fermenter without the need for antibiotics and inducers, and the highest titre of surfactin was 3.89 \u00b1 0.07 g/L, with a yield of 0.63 \u00b1 0.02 g/g DCW.
