 Calicheamicin γ1I (1)
is an enediyne antitumor compound produced by Micromonospora
echinospora spp. calichensis, and its biosynthetic gene cluster
has been previously reported. Despite extensive analysis and biochemical
study, several genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 remain functionally unassigned. Using a structural genomics approach
and biochemical characterization, two proteins encoded by genes from
the 1 biosynthetic gene cluster assigned as “unknowns”,
CalU16 and CalU19, were characterized. Structure analysis revealed
that they possess the STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein related
lipid Transfer (START) domain known mainly to bind and transport lipids
and previously identified as the structural signature of the enediyne
self-resistance protein CalC. Subsequent study revealed calU16 and calU19 to confer resistance to 1, and reminiscent of the prototype CalC, both CalU16 and CalU19 were
cleaved by 1in vitro. Through site-directed
mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, we identified the site of cleavage
in each protein and characterized their function in conferring resistance
against 1. This report emphasizes the importance of structural
genomics as a powerful tool for the functional annotation of unknown
proteins. The calicheamicins
are a prototype
of the naturally occurring 10-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotic
family and were first reported in 1989 as metabolites of Micromonospora
echinospora spp. calichensis.1−3 Members of this family
share a structurally conserved bicyclo[7.3.1]enediyne core, also often
referred to as the “warhead” as this structural unit
is central to the fundamental enediyne mechanism of action (Figure 1A).4−6 In all family members, the enediyne core is strategically
decorated with a bioorthogonal “triggering” system and
specific appendages that enhance affinity to the metabolite’s
target (DNA/RNA). The calicheamicin trigger system (and that of esperamicins,
shishijimicins, and namenamicins) is comprised of a unique trisulfide
that, upon reduction by bioreductants such as glutathione, induces
an intramolecular hetero-Michael addition at C-9 (Figure 1B).7−9 The resulting fused enediyne core ring strain invokes
a spontaneous cycloaromatization reaction which proceeds via a highly
reactive diradical intermediate that is rapidly quenched by any suitable
hydrogen source.7,10 Calicheamicin’s high affinity
for the minor groove of DNA, by virtue of its aryltetrasaccharide,
insures that the diradical species is quenched via hydrogen abstraction
from the backbone of opposing strands of dsDNA to form DNA radicals
that, in the presence of oxygen, result in facile double-strand scission.11−13 The study of calicheamicin’s many fascinating architectural
and functional facets have led to numerous discoveries/advances in
chemistry,14,15 enzymology,16−26 and anticancer drug development27,28 over the past
three decades. Yet, while the gene cluster encoding for calicheamicin
biosynthesis was cloned from M. echinospora and sequenced
nearly a decade ago,16 there remain a number
of genes (∼30%) within this locus annotated as “unknowns”
due to a lack of homologues and/or biochemical characterization of
corresponding gene products. Figure 1(A) Selected structures of naturally occurring

The “warhead” is highlighted in red. (B) Proposed mechanism
of cycloaromatization of 1 and its effect on DNA scission
and CalC self-sacrifice mechanism. Herein, we describe the application of structural genomics
as a
basis for the functional characterization of two proteins encoded
by such “unknowns”—CalU16 and CalU19. Specifically,
structure elucidation (via both NMR and X-ray crystallography) revealed
CalU16 to be a structural homologue of CalC, a protein previously
characterized as among the first reported enediyne “self-sacrifice”
resistance proteins.18,19 Prompted by this structure-based
revelation, subsequent biochemical characterization of CalU16 and
its homologue CalU19 revealed both to serve in a similar capacity
wherein CalU19 also displayed the unprecedented ability to trigger
enediyne cycloaromatization in the absence of endogenous reducing
agents. Cumulatively, this work extends the body of work focused upon
understanding how bacteria construct and control highly reactive and
lethal metabolites and expands the number of known “self-sacrifice”
enediyne resistance proteins. This work also serves to illustrate
the impact of structure determination as a critical tool for the functional
annotation of unassigned genes. Results and Discussion Results and Discussion CalU16

Structure Initiative (PSI- Biology) employs a complementary combination
of NMR spectroscopy and/or X-ray crystallography to determine 3D-structures
of biologically relevant targets. The structure of CalU16 was solved
both by X-ray crystallography (Protein Database Bank (PDB: 4FPW)) and NMR (PDB: 2LUZ). The crystal structure
of CalU16 was determined at 2.50 Å resolution, refined to an Rcryst and Rfree of
24.1% and 28.2% (Table 1), respectively, and
is comprised of two subunits in an asymmetric unit belonging to space
group P61 (Figure 2). Of the 182 residues of CalU16, the first 4 residues, the last
2 residues, and a dynamic loop containing 19 residues (a.a. 141–159)
from subunit A and 15 residues (a.a. 144–158) from subunit
B were not modeled due to insufficient electron density. Structure
and quality statistics are given in Table 1. The corresponding solution structure of CalU16 was determined by
multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (Supporting Information Figures S1–S3). Nearly complete 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments were obtained
and structures were calculated from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs),
chemical shift-derived dihedral angle constraints, and Nuclear Overhauser
Effect (NOE)-derived distance constraints via standard protocols.
Structure and quality statistics are given in Table 2 for the ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures, indicating
the high quality of the structure. Intrinsic disorder was observed
for the first 6 residues, the last 3 residues, and 21 residues that
includes a loop and part of the following helix (a.a. 143–163)
and is corroborated by a lack of long-range NOEs and low (<0.6) 15N{1H} heteronuclear values (Supporting Information Figure S3). Protein

that the structures are quite similar. The major difference between

symmetry, with a small contact interface (calculated to be ∼530

analytical static light scattering in-line (Supporting

NMR correlation time estimates, CalU16 exists as a monomer in solution.

α-helices and seven antiparallel β-strands in the order:
β1-β2-α1-α2-β3-β4-β5-β6-β7-α3-loop-α4
(Figure 2). The domain exhibits a common tertiary

Calicheamicin Our initial cloning of the 1 biosynthetic
gene cluster was facilitated by employing a selection for 1 resistance using a M. echinospora cosmid library
in E. coli.(16) From positive
cosmids identified, an iterative subcloning and selection process
ultimately led to the discovery of calC gene and
subsequent elucidation of the CalC mechanism.18 It is important to note that the initial screen for resistance genes
relied upon the native Micromonospora promoters for
heterologous expression in E. coli, and thus, calU16 and calU19 could have been missed
simply due to poor heterologous expression in E. coli. However, the ability of calC (and presumably other
self-sacrifice resistance protein encoding genes) to confer resistance
upon E. coli provides a convenient indicator for
putative function. As a preliminary assessment of potential CalU16/19
function, the genes encoding each protein were expressed in E. coli and the corresponding recombinant strains tested
for 1 resistance in a manner reminiscent to that previously
reported for CalC.18 To do so, calU16 and calU19 were cloned into pET28a
to provide pSECalU16-E. coli and pSECalU19-E. coli, respectively, and the corresponding heterologous
production levels of both CalU16 and CalU19 in E. coli were confirmed via SDS-PAGE to be comparable (Supporting Information Figure S8). A subsequent disc diffusion
assay was used to test for 1 resistance of pSECalU16-E. coli, pSECalU19-E. coli, pET28a-E. coli (an empty vector negative control), and pJB2011-E. coli (a calC-expressing positive control).18 Figure 4 illustrates
the rank order of in vivo resistance to be CalC ≈
CalU19 > CalU16 with no resistance in the empty vector-containing
negative control. Consistent with this qualitative assessment, the
determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Table 3, Supporting Information Figure
S9), revealed both pJB2011-E. coli and pSECalU19-E. coli to be 330-fold more tolerant to 1 than
the pET28a-E. coli empty vector control while pSECalU16-E. coli was 80-fold more resistant than the control strain.
Importantly, this supports the contention that CalU16/19 function
in a manner similar to CalC. To further confirm that the 1-resistance pattern of CalC, CalU16, and CalU19 is specific and not
an artifact related to general proteins encoded by genes in the calicheamicin
gene cluster, an identical study using the unknown-encoding gene calU17 revealed no resistance toward 1 (Supporting Information Figure S10). It is also
important to note that 1 does not indiscriminately cleave
other proteins such as bovine serum albumin, illustrating the importance
of the START domain hydrophobic core for enediyne binding and functional
enediyne resistance.18 Our initial cloning of the 1 biosynthetic

CalU16 Biochemical Characterization CalU16 Biochemical Characterization CalU16 Biochemical Characterization The prototype self-sacrifice
protein CalC functions via binding calicheamicin and providing an
alternative hydrogen source for quenching the highly reactive diradical
species formed upon calicheamicin cycloaromatization. In competition
assays using the real-time fluorescence-based molecular break light
assay,13 CalC was found to out-compete
DNA for calicheamicin and thereby prevent calicheamicin-induced strand
scission. In the presence of CalC, the calicheamicin diradical species
abstracts the Cα hydrogen of G113 to generate a protein
radical that, in the presence of oxygen, leads to proteolysis into
two distinct CalC fragments (Figure 1B).18 Thus, a similar series of proteolysis experiments
were conducted to determine whether CalU16 utilizes an analogous mechanism.
Figure 4 highlights the outcome of this analysis
using N-His6-CalU16. Importantly, incubation
of CalU16 with 1 alone led to no reaction, incubation
of CalU16 and 1 in the presence of reducing agent (dithiothreitol,
DTT) led to the specific cleavage of CalU16 into two fragments of
estimated size 16 kDa and 6 kDa based upon SDS-PAGE (Figure 4E). LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic digestion of
the isolated fragments identified two nontryptic peptides flanking
Gly128: 101LSEEGDGTLLELEHATTSEQMLVEVG127V(−NH2) and 129WEMALDFLGMFI141R (see MS/MS spectra of the two peptides in Supporting Information Figure S11). The first
peptide ends with a nontryptic residue 127V with an amine
group (−NH2) from the 128Gly residue
attached. The second peptide starts with 129W further supports
that Gly128 is likely the cleavage site due to hydrogen abstraction.
In addition, the LC-MS/MS data suggested 142G as another
potential cleavage site, based upon a weak peptide signal [129WEMALDFLGMFI141R(−NH2), ion score =24].
However, the corresponding peptide starting with 143D was
not identified. Nevertheless, we included both Gly128 and Gly142 in
CalU16 as putative sites in the subsequent mutational study to further
determine which glycine is the critical point of hydrogen abstraction. The prototype self-sacrifice

CalU16 as putative sites in the subsequent mutational study to further

putative hydrogen donor, four targeted CalU16 glycine mutants (G128V,
G128R, G142V, and G142R) were created and tested both in vivo and in vitro. Strains expressing CalU16ΔG142
mutations (pSEU16G142V-E. coli and pSEU16G142R-E. coli) retained wtCalU16 (pSECalU16-E. coli) resistance levels to 1 while mutation of Gly128 (pSEU16G128V-E. coli and pSEU16G128R-E. coli) reduced
or abolished tolerance to 1 (Figure 5, Supporting Information Figure S12, Table 3). Consistent with this, 1-based proteolysis of N-His6-CalU16 mutant
proteins (Supporting Information Figure S13) revealed CalU16G142V and CalU16G142R to cleave in an identical
manner to wtCalU16 in the presence of 1 and DTT while
CalU16G128V and CalU16G128R were resistant to cleavage under identical
conditions. Cumulatively, this data is consistent with CalU16 Gly128
as the key hydrogen donor in self-sacrifice mechanism, reminiscent
of CalC Gly113, wherein cleavage of CalU16 (or CalC) inactivates 1 in a stoichiometric manner. To elucidate the key CalU16 glycine residue that serves as the

the CalU16 homologue CalU19 presents a 1 self-sacrifice
resistance function analogous to CalC and CalU16, the expressed N-His6-CalU19 was purified and incubated with 1 alone or in the presence of a reducing agent (DTT). In this
study, CalU19 was also cleaved into two fragments by 1 but, in stark contrast to CalC and CalU16, 1-induced
CalU19 cleavage occurred even in the absence of the reducing agent
DTT (Figure 4F). The estimated sizes of the
corresponding CalU19 fragments were ∼21 and 6 kDa based upon
SDS-PAGE (Supporting Information Table S2). LC-MS/MS analysis of the chymotrypsin digestion of the isolated
fragments identified two nonchymotryptic peptides flanking Gly177: 142RLTPSGDATVLELEHAPVPAEIIPNAAPGAWGIG176A(−NH2) and 178WEMGLVALDDYLAGTLPEGRAVD201W (see MS/MS spectra of the two peptides in Supporting Information Figure S14). The first
peptide ends with a nonchymotryptic residue 176A with an
amine group (−NH2) from the 177Gly residue
attached. The second peptide starts with 178W further supports
that Gly177 is likely the cleavage site due to hydrogen abstraction. To determine whether

mutants (G177V and G177R) were created and tested both in
vivo and in vitro. To rule out any other
possible glycine residues that might be involved in the protein cleavage,
four additional glycine residues (Gly181, Gly191, Gly196 and Gly206)
were mutated and the corresponding mutants tested in parallel. The E. coli strains expressing CalU19G181V, CalU19G191V, CalU19G196V,
CalU19G206V (pSEU19G181V-E. coli, pSEU19G191V-E. coli, pSEU19G196V-E. coli, and pSEU19G206V-E. coli, respectively) retained wtCalU19 (pSECalU19-E. coli) resistance levels to 1 while mutation
of Gly177 (pSEU19G177V-E. coli and pSEU19G177R-E. coli) reduced or abolished tolerance to 1 (Figure 5, Supporting

as depicted by disc diffusion and MIC assays. Consistent with this, 1-based proteolysis of N-His6-CalU19
mutant proteins revealed CalU19G177V and CalU19G177R to be resistant
to cleavage when compared with wtCalU19 under identical conditions
(Supporting Information Figure S16). In
aggregate, this data is consistent with CalU19 Gly177 as the key hydrogen
donor in the context of 1 inactivation and served as
a basis for modeling the interactions of 1 with CalU16
and CalU19. Notably, the modeled orientation of 1 bound
to CalU16 or CalU19 appears to be different from 1 with
CalC (Figure 5A–C) consistent with prior
observations that the late stage biosynthetic intermediates en route
to 1 bind the glycosyltransferases involved in 1 maturation via distinct orientations.45 To confirm the key CalU19 glycine residue, two targeted CalU19ΔGly177

CalU19G206V (pSEU19G181V-E. coli, pSEU19G191V-E. coli, pSEU19G196V-E. coli, and pSEU19G206V-E. coli, respectively) retained wtCalU19 (pSECalU19-E. coli) resistance levels to 1 while mutation
of Gly177 (pSEU19G177V-E. coli and pSEU19G177R-E. coli) reduced or abolished tolerance to 1 (Figure 5, Supporting

of Gly177 (pSEU19G177V-E. coli and pSEU19G177R-E. coli) reduced or abolished tolerance to 1 (Figure 5, Supporting

in the absence
of a reducing agent–implicating a residue within CalU19 as
a putative reductive activator of the process. CalU19 contains two
cysteines (Cys25 and Cys120) where the CalU19 homology model suggests
Cys25 to potentially be closer to the trisulfide of 1 in a ligand-bound model than Cys120 (estimated distance 14.80 Å, Supporting Information Figure S17). To test the
putative role of Cys25 and Cys120, the corresponding alanine mutants
were generated and tested in vivo and in

observed between wtCalU19, CalU19Cys25A, CalU19Cys120A and the double
mutant CalU19Cys25A/Cys120A (Supporting Information
Figure S18), suggesting 1 activation via CalU19
occurs via a nonredox mechanism. Notably, cycloaromatized calicheamicin
ε (Figure 1B) was detected in all CalU19
proteolysis experiments (including those with the double mutant CalU19Cys25A/Cys120A),
indicating there is an alternative CalU19 contributor to trisulfide
reductive initiation event. Distinct from CalC and CalU16, CalU19 functioned
in the absence
of a reducing agent–implicating a residue within CalU19 as
a putative reductive activator of the process. CalU19 contains two
cysteines (Cys25 and Cys120) where the CalU19 homology model suggests
Cys25 to potentially be closer to the trisulfide of 1 in a ligand-bound model than Cys120 (estimated distance 14.80 Å, Supporting Information Figure S17). To test the
putative role of Cys25 and Cys120, the corresponding alanine mutants
were generated and tested in vivo and in
vitro. Surprisingly, no differences in DTT-dependence were

CalU16 and CalU19 confer resistance against other 10-membered enediynes, in vivo and in vitro studies similar to
those described in the previous sections were performed where 1 was substituted with dynemicin (2) or esperamicin
A1 (3). CalU16 and CalU19 each failed to cause
any cross resistance against 2 or 3in vivo (Supporting Information Figure

could be cleaved via 2 or 3 in the absence
or presence of reducing agent (Supporting Information

are powerful tools to implicate putative function but are still limited
by three primary liabilities: (i) functional misannotation due to
mistakes propagated throughout large sequence databases; (ii) functional
misannotation due to the fact that even highly homologous proteins
can present dramatically distinct mechanisms/functions; and (iii)
a lack of suitably characterized homologues within existing large
sequence databases.46−48 Structural genomics can augment the use of sequence
homology for functional annotation by presenting opportunities to
identify structural homologues even where sequence homology may be
too low to identify suitable homologues.49−51 The current
study highlights the power of structural genomics to inform putative
function as the basis for subsequent biochemical characterization/confirmation
and, in doing so, reveals two new enediyne self-sacrifice proteins
(CalU16 and CalU19) encoded by genes in the calicheamicin biosynthetic
gene cluster. The elucidation of these genes serve as potential new
genetic markers which, in conjunction with the signature minimal enediyne

natural product biosynthetic loci that also encode for more than one
resistance mechanism for the encoded natural product,52,53 the encoded redundancy highlighted by the current study is uncommon
and may suggest discrete self-sacrifice proteins to contribute to
subtle distinctions in their localization and/or function. For example,
the predicted isoelectric point of CalC (10.16) is dramatically different
from CalU16 (4.24) or CalU19 (4.69) (Supporting
Information Table S2) and is consistent with CalC’s
demonstrated ability to bind DNA (the target of enediynes) under physiological
pH.19 Under identical conditions, CalU16/U19
are predicted to possess an overall negative charge, which may contribute
to distinct intracellular localization and/or unique protein–protein
interactions possibly including those proteins/enzymes involved in 1 biosynthesis. While there exist many

corresponding encoded proteins
have been validated in the context of conferring enediyne resistance,
but it remains possible that such proteins or their proteolytic fragments
could also serve alternative roles in Micromonospora. For example, many members of the START domain family function as
molecular chaperones as exemplified by the Coq10 homologue CC1736,
responsible for transporting ubiquinone to or within the respiratory
chain complexes and contributes to dramatically higher biosynthetic
efficiency.54 Although the precedent for
molecular chaperones in the context of the structurally related 9-membered
enediynes is well established,5,55 it remains to be determined
whether such proteins play additional roles beyond stabilizing the
highly reactive 9-membered enediyne chromophore. Preliminary evidence,
based upon the location of the key glycines in CalC, CalU16, and CalU19,
suggest that CalC binds 1 in a manner distinct from CalU16/CalU19
which, in the context of a molecular chaperone model, suggests different
regions of the cargo would be accessible to putative associated partner
proteins (Figure 5A–C). While CalC homologues
lack apparent polyketide aromatase/cyclase TcmN Aro/Cyc catalytic
residues based upon sequence (Supporting Information
Figure S21) and structural (Supporting
Information Figure S22) alignments, this relationship raises
the intriguing possibility of CalC homologues as the long sought after
contributors to enediyne polyketide core folding/cyclization. Indeed,
the surface area of the hydrophobic cavities of CalU16 (3986 Å2), CalC (3931 Å2), and TcmN ARO/CYC (3655
Å2) are similar (Supporting Information
Figure S23), the latter of which accommodates large (≤C20)
linear polyketides.35 Alternatively, certain
proteolytic fragments from CalC, CalU16, and/or CalU19 could also
potentially serve as intracellular signals of enediyne concentrations,
in a manner conceptually similar to the vancomycin- or β-lactam-inducible
three-component regulatory systems, where hydrolytic fragments of
the bacterial cell wall serve as key inducers.56,57 Studies are underway to further probe whether the functions of START
domain congeners encoded by the calicheamicin gene cluster extend
beyond simple protection of host against these highly reactive and
toxic metabolites. The enediyne self-sacrifice genes and

by microbatch methods at 18 °C. The protein was mixed in a 1:1
ratio with the precipitant containing 2.9 M sodium malonate pH 6.5.
The crystals were cryo-protected by 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and
2.6 M sodium malonate pH 6.5 prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen
for data collection at 100 K. A single crystal of Se-Met labeled protein
was used for data collection at a wavelength of 0.978 Å and diffracted
to 2.5 Å resolution. The data was collected at beamline X4A at
the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory,
and further processed and scaled using HKL-2000 (Table 1).63 Eight of the ten selenium
sites in the asymmetric unit were successfully located by the SHELXD64 program for initial phasing. RESOLVE65 was utilized for automated model building and
the model was further built by manual refitting with the program Coot.66 The data were twinned, and a twin refinement
was performed. The refinement involved iterations of manual model-building
in Coot and Refmac.67 The quality of the
final structure was validated by PROCHECK.68 The diffraction images illustrate diffuse scattering perpendicular

of the disorder are also evident in the data anisotropy where the
B-factor component along the 61 axis is less than half
of the B-factor in the perpendicular direction. The unmodeled disorder
leads to higher than expected R-factors and is likely contributing
to the lower percentage of residues in the Ramachandran favored regions

by microbatch methods at 18 °C. The protein was mixed in a 1:1
ratio with the precipitant containing 2.9 M sodium malonate pH 6.5.
The crystals were cryo-protected by 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and
2.6 M sodium malonate pH 6.5 prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen
for data collection at 100 K. A single crystal of Se-Met labeled protein
was used for data collection at a wavelength of 0.978 Å and diffracted
to 2.5 Å resolution. The data was collected at beamline X4A at
the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory,
and further processed and scaled using HKL-2000 (Table 1).63 Eight of the ten selenium
sites in the asymmetric unit were successfully located by the SHELXD64 program for initial phasing. RESOLVE65 was utilized for automated model building and
the model was further built by manual refitting with the program Coot.66 The data were twinned, and a twin refinement
was performed. The refinement involved iterations of manual model-building
in Coot and Refmac.67 The quality of the
final structure was validated by PROCHECK.68 The diffraction images illustrate diffuse scattering perpendicular
to the 61 screw axis indicative of order/disorder (Supporting Information Figure S24). The effects
of the disorder are also evident in the data anisotropy where the
B-factor component along the 61 axis is less than half
of the B-factor in the perpendicular direction. The unmodeled disorder
leads to higher than expected R-factors and is likely contributing
to the lower percentage of residues in the Ramachandran favored regions
(Table 1). The atomic coordinates and structure
factors have been deposited in the PDB (4FPW). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure

of each of CalU16 and CalU19 were added to 2 mol equiv of 1 in the presence of 0.2 mM DTT. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C
for 30 min. A fraction of each reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE
to confirm completion of the reaction. For proteolytic digestion,
the protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gel, washed with 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide
(IAA), and subjected to trypsin (for CalU16) or chymotrypsin (for
CalU19) digestion at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides resulting from
the proteolytic digestion were extracted from gel pieces and analyzed
by LC-MS/MS as previously described.69 Briefly,

of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) Determination
of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) Fourteen strains
created in this study (Supporting
Information Table S4, strains 2–15) were grown overnight
in LB supplemented with kanamycin 30 mg L–1. Each
overnight culture was diluted to OD600 ∼ 0.1 using
an Overnight Express Autoinduction System 1 (Novagen) supplemented
with kanamycin 30 mg L–1. Enediyne 1 was serially diluted 1:2 in DMSO such that the final concentrations
ranged from 2.4 μM to 4.5 nM for pSE28a-E. coli and from 12 μM to 22 nM for all other strains. Ampicillin
and kanamycin were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
All plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm. The residual
metabolic activity was monitored based on the irreversible reduction
of resazurin (7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one-10-oxide, blue) to resorufin
(7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, pink). For this assay, 10 μL
of resazurin (final concentration 100 μM) was added to each
well and allowed to incubate at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm
for 1 h to allow viable cells to convert resazurin to resorufin. The
well with the minimum concentration of 1 that did not
display bacterial growth but did display a red color after incubation
with resazurin was recorded as the MIC of that strain (Supporting Information Figure S9; Table 3). Fourteen strains
