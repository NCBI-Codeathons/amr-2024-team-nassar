In this study, the kalimantacin biosynthesis gene cluster is analyzed by yeast two-hybrid analysis, creating a protein\u2013protein interaction map of the entire assembly line. In total, 28 potential interactions were identified, of which 13 could be confirmed further. These interactions include the dimerization of ketosynthase domains, a link between assembly line modules 9 and 10, and a specific interaction between the trans-acting enoyl reductase BatK and the carrier proteins of modules 8 and 10. These interactions reveal fundamental insight into the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. This study is the first to reveal interactions in a complete biosynthetic pathway. Similar future studies could build a strong basis for engineering strategies in such clusters.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Natural polyketides (PKs) and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) are key research objects in view of their potential as therapeutics, including antibacterials, antifungals and immunosuppressant agents. While chemical synthesis approaches to effectively synthesize these complex molecules in the test tube remain challenging and cumbersome, the biological biosynthesis process, using polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), has naturally evolved into a very efficient pathway in which multiple PKS and NRPS modules are responsible for the incorporation and/or modification of consecutive building blocks.", "Natural polyketides (PKs) and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) are key research objects in view of their potential as therapeutics, including antibacterials, antifungals and immunosuppressant agents.

However, in so-called trans-AT type I PKS clusters, the AT domain is a discrete protein that acts in trans to deliver the new building block (Piel, 2010; Helfrich and Piel, 2015). All modules can be further expanded by the presence of a ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) and/or an enoyl reductase (ER) domain, which change the degree of saturation of the \u03b2-carbon of the previous building block, and cis methyltransferase (MT) domains can additionally methylate the \u03b1-carbon (Smith and Tsai, 2007). Adding to this diversity, trans-acting domains, such as oxygenases, reductases, different group transferases, halogenases and cyclases, can further modify the polyketide, both during and after assembly line biosynthesis (Olano et al., 2010). Finally, a thioesterase (TE) domain releases the covalently bound polyketide by hydrolysis, transesterification or by intramolecular cyclization creating linear, macrolacton or macrolactam compounds (Horsman et al., 2015).", "In active type I PKS modules, at least three enzymatic domains are present: the acyltransferase (AT) domain selects and recruits an acyl or malonyl coenzyme A building block, the acyl carrier protein (ACP) covalently binds acyl components and the ketosynthase (KS) domain is responsible for the condensation between the growing intermediate and the new building block.

Although most NRPs consist of only 3\u201315 amino acids, the diversity that can be achieved is astonishing (Mootz et al., 2002). This is due to the capability of the A domains to activate natural and non-natural L- and D-amino acids and the presence of additional modifying domains in cis or in trans, like epimerization, methylation, cyclization, halogenation or oxidative and glycosylation domains (Samel et al., 2008).", "Non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules minimally consist of an adenylation (A) domain, selecting the amino acid building block, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) that covalently binds the amino acid precursor and the peptide intermediate, and a condensation (C) domain that connects the new amino acid building block and the growing intermediate.

In the past, numerous efforts have been made in finding new PKs, NRPs or hybrid molecules. However, more and more, focus is being shifted toward the engineering of existing gene clusters to create new compounds. The modularity of PKSs and NRPSs seems particularly suited for these engineering approaches and the possibilities of deleting or adding modules or domains, changing the module\u2019s order or combining different gene clusters look to be limitless (Medema et al., 2011). However, these synthetic biology approaches require a relaxed substrate specificity of downstream domains and the different domains or modules need to be able to connect through protein interactions (Giessen and Marahiel, 2012; Wong and Khosla, 2012; Williams, 2013). These requirements appear crucial, since several studies show that the enzyme complexes resulting from manipulated clusters suffer from efficiency problems resulting in low production yields (Gaisser et al., 2003; Menzella et al., 2005, 2007; Kellenberger et al., 2008; Weissman, 2016; Winn et al., 2016). As such, the importance of protein interactions in PKSs and NRPSs systems has been underestimated for many years. Although many researchers have concluded that more insight is needed in protein interactions, only very recently we can see an increase in studies unraveling the modular structure of these systems (Davison et al., 2014; Dutta et al., 2014; Whicher et al., 2014).", "The similar biosynthetic approach in PKSs and NRPSs enables the formation of hybrid clusters and many hybrid PK-NRP compounds have been discovered already (Du et al., 2001).

Research on so-called docking domains in the N-terminal and C-terminal region of PKS proteins proved that the dissociation constants of such interactions are very low and thus the proteins interact only transiently (Buchholz et al., 2009; Whicher et al., 2013). Possibly, the interactions are not strong enough to be detected in this pooled assay.", "ACP and PCP domains are core proteins in PKS and NPRS clusters, respectively. They carry the new building block and the growing intermediate and are thought to be responsible for the transport of all compounds to the different active sites in the module. Hence, ACP domains are expected to interact with a lot of different proteins. In our analysis, the amount of interactions involving ACP domains was limited. As ACP domains adopt different structures depending on the attachment of the phosphopantetheinyl arm, it can be important that they are in their active holo-form for interaction with their partner proteins (Evans et al., 2009). In yeast cells, it is possible that the ACP domains of the kalimantacin cluster do not carry this arm, since not all phosphopantetheinyl transferases show a broad specificity for ACP domains (Lambalot et al., 1996). It might be interesting to repeat the assay described here with a yeast strain heterologously expressing the broad spectrum Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Quadri et al., 1998).", "ACP and PCP domains are core proteins in PKS and NPRS clusters, respectively.

Indeed, a total of 63 domains were generated to identify interaction partners in the assembly line, resulting in 3969 tested protein-protein interactions. Based on the analysis, 28 interaction partners were identified, of which 13 pairs could be confirmed independently after co-transformation and an additional four combinations resulted in growth on the least selective medium. In future, the results obtained here can be expanded with other, complementary and more focused interaction analyses, including bacterial two-hybrid and in vitro interactomics using pull-down assays.", "The pooled array-based Y2H screening as performed here provides a general first insight in the interactions in the kalimantacin cluster and currently remains the only way to analyze interaction at this scale in a relatively fast manner.
