["Kasugamycin (KSM), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is composed of three chemical moieties: D-chiro-inositol, kasugamine and glycine imine. Despite being discovered more than 50 years ago, the biosynthetic pathway of KSM remains an unresolved puzzle. Here we report a structural and functional analysis for an epimerase, KasQ, that primes KSM biosynthesis rather than the previously proposed KasF/H, which instead acts as an acetyltransferase, inactivating KSM. Our biochemical and biophysical analysis determined that KasQ converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc as the initial step in the biosynthetic pathway. The isotope-feeding study further confirmed that 13C, 15N-glucosamine/UDP-GlcNH2 rather than glucose/UDP-Glc serves as the direct precursor for the formation of KSM. Both KasF and KasH were proposed, respectively, converting UDP-GlcNH2 and KSM to UDP-GlcNAc and 2-N\u2019-acetyl KSM. Experimentally, KasF is unable to do so; both KasF and KasH are instead KSM-modifying enzymes, while the latter is more specific and reactive than the former in terms of the extent of resistance. The information gained here lays the foundation for mapping out the complete KSM biosynthetic pathway.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Kasugamycin (KSM), an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kasugaensis, was discovered in 1965. KSM is composed of three structurally distinct sub-components: a glycine imine, an unusual amino-sugar kasugamine and D-chiro-inositol (Figure 1) [1,2]. It has long been known that KSM binds specially to the interface between E- and P-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit to control fungal and bacterial protein translation [3]. KSM was used as an agricultural supplement to protect rice from fungus-derived diseases [4]. Beyond that, a number of new findings revealed that KSM possesses several unexpected biological activities effectively countering some recalcitrant human diseases: (i) an in vitro and in vivo study showed that the combination of KSM with rifamycin is in a position to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis, [5] (ii) KSM was recently shown to be capable of inhibiting herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), [6] and (iii) KSM has also been shown to have a promising activity against COVID-19 by inhibiting 3a-channel [7] and chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) proteins [8]. We were attracted by these new findings and thus eager to investigate the biosynthetic pathway of KSM in the hope of generating new and useful KSM analogs in the future.", "Kasugamycin (KSM), an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kasugaensis, was discovered in 1965.

However, the gene products responsible for the formation of UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and myo-inositol, the possible starting units for the formation of the kaugamine moiety, were still unclear (Figure S1). Five enzymes (KasF codes for an acetyltransferase, KasD codes for a NAD-dependent dehydratase, KasR codes for a PLP-dependent dehydratase, KasP codes for an oxidoreductase, and KasC codes for an aminotransferase) were proposed to act on UDP-GlcNAc in sequence to form the UDP-kasugamine precursor. Two downstream gene products\u2014KasN, a glycine oxidase, and KasQ, an epimerase\u2014may drive reactions toward UDP-kasugamine and UDP-carboxyformimidoyl-kasugamine sequentially. KasA, a glycosyltransferase, could couple UDP-carboxyformimidoyl-kasugamine and myo-inositol to form a KSM disaccharide precursor, then KasJ, an epimerase, could complete the synthetic pathway by epimerizing the equatorial C1-OH of myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol (with an axial C1-OH) to afford KSM (Figure S1) [9,10,11]. KasH was reported as a self-resistance enzyme inactivating KSM by N2\u2032-acetylation [12]. F. Kudo et al. recently came up with a new biosynthetic pathway for KSM [13], whereas no intrinsic in vitro biochemical evidence was provided therein unequivocally delineating the actual roles of the enzymes designated in the biosynthesis of KSM. With the aim of determining the roles of these enzymes, our in silico analysis revealed that KasQ shares a high sequence similarity with many UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases, especially RffE (also referred to as WecB, 47% identity) and to SecA (44% identity). RffE converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc in the early stage of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis [14]. Likewise, SecA performs the same reaction in the first step of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis [15]. L. Zhang et al. further examined the substrate specificity of SecA with a group of C2 N-acyl-modified UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-ManNAc derivatives, concluding that the C2 N-acyl group in the UDP-acylhexosamines is critical for molecular recognition [16]. Of these facts, we speculated that KasQ should stand in the early stage of the biosynthetic pathway (converting UDP-GlcNAc 1 to UDP-ManNAc 4; Figure 1 and Figure S2) instead of the reported pathway where UDP-deoxy aminosugar is epimerized to UDP-kasugamine (Figure S1) [9,10,11]. This viewpoint, however, conflicted with the roles assigned for KasH and KasF; namely, they were proposed to prime and regulate the biosynthesis of KSM. We were thus prompted to resolve this long-standing issue by employing in vitro biochemical and biophysical analyses alongside in vivo isotope feeding assays, whereby we concluded that KasQ is the starter enzyme rather than KasF, and both KasF and KasH are self-resistant enzymes in the biosynthesis of KSM.", "The KSM biosynthetic pathway was proposed on the basis of the gene sequence similarity of each gene encoded in its biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) [9,10,11].

The reaction of UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of KasQ and MgCl2 emanated the peak of a singlet at 6.60 ppm corresponding to an alkenyl proton of AAG and an appreciable amount of UDP-ManNAc was determined by its anomeric proton at 5.35 ppm. In contrast, a lesser number of UDP-GlcNAc anomeric protons at 5.41 ppm was observed (Figure S8). Extensive studies at various time intervals of the enzymatic reaction were executed (Figure 3). AAG formed at 10 min and increased consistently with respect to time (Figure 3B), whereas UDP-ManNAc formation from 10\u2013120 min remained almost the same and slightly increased at 12 h (Figure 3C). The equilibrated existence of phosphorus in the epimerase reaction was tracked at various time periods by P31 NMR spectrometry. At 10 min, UDP extrusion was observed with P\u03b1 at \u22128.7 ppm and P\u03b2 at \u22124.5 ppm, along with UDP-GlcNAc P\u03b1 at \u221211.7 ppm and P\u03b2 at \u221210.0 ppm. At a wider timespan, the UDP-GlcNAc peak was reduced and the UDP peak was intensified, whereas UDP-ManNAc P\u03b1 and P\u03b2 at \u221212.8 and \u221212.7 ppm moderately increased with respect to time (Figure 3D). Enzymatic isotope labeling studies of UDP-GlcNAc were scantly documented [14,28]. To gain further insight into the KasQ epimerization reaction, a reversibility experiment was performed. UDP-GlcNAc with or without KasQ in the presence of MgCl2 was incubated in D2O at different time intervals and the reaction mixtures were subjected to HPLC-MS analysis (Figure S9). No deuterium scrambling was observed when UDP-GlcNAc was incubated in D2O without KasQ up to 12 h (m/z 605.98 [M-H]) (Figure 3E and Figure S9A). Moreover, in the presence of KasQ with UDP-GlcNAc and MgCl2 in D2O, deuterium was labeled from 2 min to 12 h (m/z 606.96 [M-H]) (Figure 3E and Figure S9B). To validate the position of the deuterium incorporation, NMR studies were performed (Figure 3F,G). The C2 position of the UDP-GlcNAc was deuterated (97%) and appeared as a doublet at 5.36 ppm with minor traces of C2-deuterated UDP-ManNAc (<1%). Heavily incorporated deuterium at the C2 position of the UDP-GlcNAc clearly suggests that the abstraction of protons at the C2 position is highly reversible with the surrounding active-site residues of KasQ. It also postulates that first step of the reaction mechanism is highly reversible. A control experiment was performed to recognize the ability of thermodynamically stable AAG with UDP to generate UDP-ManNAc or UDP-GlcNAc. KasQ incubated with AAG and UDP in the presence of MgCl2 was monitored by 1H NMR (Figure S12). The absence of anomeric proton signals of UDP-ManNAc or UDP-GlcNAc concluded that the enzymatic reaction was ultimately futile. A similar finding was also noticed with SacA [16]. An ITC experiment for AAG with KasQ showed unfavored binding in the medium (Table 4). This implies that, thermodynamically, there is no binding affinity with KasQ for AAG. Enzyme binding interactions of UDP-GlcNAc were determined by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR (Figure 3H). The proton binding epitope of UDP-GlcNAc with KasQ suggested that the ribose framework accumulated a major zone of interactions, whereas the GlcNAc and uridine moieties occupied a minor zone with KasQ. Both uridine H13 (the alkenyl group) and ribose H7 bind closely with KasQ, acquiring major STD effects. Moderate binding was attained on H8 and H9 of the ribose ring. GlcNAc H5, H14, and ribose H11 formed weak binding interactions with KasQ. Based on these binding studies of STD NMR and ITC analyses, we propose that the KasQ epimerase may proceed through a kinetically favorable or an enzyme-bound reaction mechanism. The proposed pathway for this epimerization reaction is from UDP-GlcNAc which undergoes an anti-elimination to generate AAG and UDP. Then, it undergoes subsequent syn-addition to afford an epimer UDP-ManNAc 4. Overall, our biochemical investigations indicate that KasQ converts UDP-GlcNAc 1 to UDP-ManNAc 4 in a shorter reaction time, whereas in a prolonged reaction it releases a higher amount of AAG 2 and UDP 3.", "The KasQ epimerase reaction was parallelly probed by NMR spectrometry.

Biochemical Characterization of Acetyltransferases", "3.2. Biochemical Characterization of Acetyltransferases", "3.2. Biochemical Characterization of Acetyltransferases", "The primary sequence analysis revealed that both KasF and KasH belong to enzymes of the acetyltransferase superfamily, while both share very low sequence identity (<10%) (Figure S13). Purified KasF forms monomers but KasH forms dimers in solution (Figure S3). The in vivo acetylation (resistance) activity of KasF and KasH versus KSM was evaluated with a disc diffusion assay (Figure S14). Individually, we introduced the pET28a+ plasmid carrying the kasF or kasH gene into the BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. The E. coli cells (carrying the empty pET28a+ plasmid without the given acetyltransferase gene) were used as a control. We observed a clear zone of inhibition (ZOI) in the E. coli cells (not carrying the acetyltransferase gene) representing the cells\u2019 inability to grow in the presence of KSM (the disc contained ~5 \u03bcL of 7.6 mg/mL of KSM). The growth of E. coli that carried the kasH gene was not affected in the presence KSM, whereas moderate growth of E. coli was observed in the cells carrying the kasF gene (Figure 4A and Figure S14). This phenomenon indicated that KasH serves as a resistance gene specific to KSM. Whether KasF is a resistance gene against other aminoglycoside antibiotics was further examined (Figure 4B,C and Figure S15). The activities of these two acetyltransferases against a number of commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin B, sisomicin, streptothricin-F, and tobramycin) were examined. The appearance of ZOI in all conditions strongly suggested that neither KasH nor KasF are active towards these aminoglycoside antibiotics (Figure 4B,C and Figure S15). Based on this in vivo assay we concluded that KasH serves as a self-resistance gene, while KasF partially acts as a self-resistance gene to KSM. To support this finding, an in vitro assay was performed. KasF or KasH were incubated with 1 mM KSM and 0.5 mM AcCoA at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h. KasH completely acetylated KSM (m/z 380.16 [M+H]) to produce 2\u2032N-acetyl-kasugamycin (Ac-KSM; m/z 422.38 [M+H]). Consistent with the in vivo analysis, KasF partially acetylated KSM (m/z 380.10 [M+H]) to form Ac-KSM (m/z 422.07 [M+H]) (Figure 4J\u2013M). As a result, KasH is the main self-resistance enzyme in the biosynthesis of KSM, but KasF may play a supportive role in the overall resistance system. Additionally, both KasF and KasH that are unable to acetylate the generally used aminoglycoside antibiotics (Figure 4D\u2013I) suggested that the two enzymes are a pair of resistance enzymes specific to KSM, the latter stronger than the former in terms of antimicrobial effectiveness. The specificity of KasF and KasH is due likely to their regioselectivity on KSM because it is an atypical aminoglycoside antibiotic, thereby incapable of acetylating other aminoglycosides. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantify the binding affinity of KasH versus CoA (Kd = 96.1 \u00b5M), AcCoA (Kd = 160.7 \u00b5M), and KSM (Kd = 56.1 \u00b5M). Among these binding affinity parameters, KasH and KSM concentrations are 2.9- and 1.7-fold higher than AcCoA and CoA, respectively (Figure S17 and Table S1). Although KasF is capable of partially acetylating KSM, it may not be a direct substrate. In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, KasF catalyzes the first step of reactions by converting UDP-GlcNH2 to UDP-GlcNAc. To check this proposition, KasF was incubated with 1 mM UDP-GlcNH2 and 0.5 mM AcCoA at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h. We could not observe the formation of UDP-GlcNAc, thus ruling out the possibility that KasF primes the KSM biosynthesis (Figure S18). The origin of UDP-GlcNH2 or UDP-GlcNAc may be directly from the first metabolism, as they are fundamental metabolites. To test whether KasF carries out the deacetylation reaction in the KSM biosynthesis pathway (given UDP-GlcNAc the precursor, a deacetylase is required but not found in the KSM BGCs), KasF was incubated with 1 mM UDP-GlcNAc and 0.1 mM divalent ion (Zn2+). We found that neither KasF nor KasH was able to catalyze the deacetylation reaction (Figure S19).", "The primary sequence analysis revealed that both KasF and KasH belong to enzymes of the acetyltransferase superfamily, while both share very low sequence identity (<10%) (Figure S13).

KasH completely acetylated KSM (m/z 380.16 [M+H]) to produce 2\u2032N-acetyl-kasugamycin (Ac-KSM; m/z 422.38 [M+H]). Consistent with the in vivo analysis, KasF partially acetylated KSM (m/z 380.10 [M+H]) to form Ac-KSM (m/z 422.07 [M+H]) (Figure 4J\u2013M). As a result, KasH is the main self-resistance enzyme in the biosynthesis of KSM, but KasF may play a supportive role in the overall resistance system. Additionally, both KasF and KasH that are unable to acetylate the generally used aminoglycoside antibiotics (Figure 4D\u2013I) suggested that the two enzymes are a pair of resistance enzymes specific to KSM, the latter stronger than the former in terms of antimicrobial effectiveness. The specificity of KasF and KasH is due likely to their regioselectivity on KSM because it is an atypical aminoglycoside antibiotic, thereby incapable of acetylating other aminoglycosides. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantify the binding affinity of KasH versus CoA (Kd = 96.1 \u00b5M), AcCoA (Kd = 160.7 \u00b5M), and KSM (Kd = 56.1 \u00b5M). Among these binding affinity parameters, KasH and KSM concentrations are 2.9- and 1.7-fold higher than AcCoA and CoA, respectively (Figure S17 and Table S1). Although KasF is capable of partially acetylating KSM, it may not be a direct substrate. In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, KasF catalyzes the first step of reactions by converting UDP-GlcNH2 to UDP-GlcNAc. To check this proposition, KasF was incubated with 1 mM UDP-GlcNH2 and 0.5 mM AcCoA at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h. We could not observe the formation of UDP-GlcNAc, thus ruling out the possibility that KasF primes the KSM biosynthesis (Figure S18). The origin of UDP-GlcNH2 or UDP-GlcNAc may be directly from the first metabolism, as they are fundamental metabolites. To test whether KasF carries out the deacetylation reaction in the KSM biosynthesis pathway (given UDP-GlcNAc the precursor, a deacetylase is required but not found in the KSM BGCs), KasF was incubated with 1 mM UDP-GlcNAc and 0.1 mM divalent ion (Zn2+). We found that neither KasF nor KasH was able to catalyze the deacetylation reaction (Figure S19).", "A number of studies revealed that modified aminoglycoside antibiotics carried encouraging antimicrobial activity to inhibit some human pathogens [29,30,31,32]. For example, the enzymatically modified isepamicin (ISP), 6\u2032-N-acetylated ISP analogs, manifested stronger antimicrobial activity but less cytotoxicity than ISP against ISP-resistant Gram-negative pathogens [33].

Importantly, the carboxyl group of Asp97 that is located on top of the sugar plane relative to the C2 atom (3.8 \u00c5) likely serves as the general base to deprotonate C2 in the first half of the reaction, yielding AAG and UDP; the Arg309/Glu291 dyad, on the other hand, acts as the general acid, likely protonating AAG to afford UDP-ManNAc, thus completing the epimerization reaction (Figure 6D). Samuel et al. created five mutants of catalysis-related residues K15A, D95Q, E117Q, E131Q, and H213N to evaluate their biochemical importance [34]: they observed that all the mutants can release the AAG intermediate. The activity of mutants D95Q and E131Q was 100-fold slower than that of the wild type. Although non-hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases have been extensively studied, the catalytic residues that engage in the anti-elimination and syn-addition to form the product remain unclear. On the basis of the KasQ structural complexes, we highlighted the importance of two residues, Q95 and E308, which were mentioned less frequently in all UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases reported thus far (Figure S21). To confirm their importance, we prepared four mutants, Q95A, Q95E, E308A and E308Q, and performed biochemical assays by incubating them with UDP-GlcNAc and MgCl2 at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h. For mutants E308A and E308Q, both HPLC and TLC analyses did not show the appearance of the intermediates, thereby confirming their importance in the catalysis (Figure S22). Moreover, given their special and geographic position relative to the AAG intermediate, we propose that Asp97 acts as the active site general base to trigger the elimination reaction, resulting in the formation of UDP and AAG. In contrast, both mutants Q95A and Q95E performed equally well, as did the wild type in terms of biochemical reactions, thus negating their direct participation in the epimerization reactions. To this end, obtaining the UDP-Glc or UDP bound complexes along with the mutagenesis studies allowed us to summarize the catalytic mechanism of KasQ: Asp97 may serve as the first base to abstract the C2 proton from GlcNAc, resulting in the formation of AAG and the neglect of UDP that is stabilized by nearby Arg210. Since the anti-elimination and syn-addition follow different electron-configuration courses, an oxocarbenium intermediate may be transiently present for buffering the transition state as well as helping change the reaction path. The positively charged oxocarbenium intermediate may be stabilized by the negatively charged UDP nearby [35]. In the UDP-addition course, the Arg309/Glu291 dyad opposite to Asp97 may serve as the general acid to protonate AAG so that UDP-ManNAc is derived in a syn-addition manner, completing the epimerization reaction.", "3.4.

The fact is that none of the other NDP-sugars can be hydrolyzed by KasQ, suggesting that UDP-GlcNAc is the only valid substrate (Figure S25).

To address the insufficiency, we used Streptomyces lividans TK64 harboring pMKBAC08-KAS as a model system to produce KSM, for which the susceptibility of E. coli to KSM was gauged by disc diffusion assay to profile its production. The inhibition zone appeared in agar plates on the third day, suggesting that KSM had been produced to a considerable quantity by manifesting a significant inhibition zone against E. coli (Figure 8A and Figure S33). Samples collected from the culture medium were subjected to HPLC-TQ-MS (positive mode), whereby the molecular weight of KSM was determined with m/z at 380.1 [M+H] as a reference. To see if KSM directly derived from glucose or glucosamine, we fed three precursors, 13C1-D-glucose, 13C1-D-glucosamine, and 13C1,15N2-D-glucosamine, to the culture of Streptomyces lividans TK64. We found that only 13C1-D-glucose is partially incorporated into KSM, as shown by the isotopic profile of KSM with m/z at 380.1 [M+H], 381.2 [M+1+H], and 382.1 [M+2+H], in which the latter two displayed a ratio close to unit, likely as a result of D-glucose that serves as the precursor for both kasugamine and inositol in the KSM biosynthetic pathway (Figure 8B, Figures S1 and S32). Given 13C1-D-glucosamine, the isotopic profile is dissimilar to 13C1-D-glucose, where it showed a dominant m/z at 381.2 [M+1+H] and a second dominant m/z at 382 [M+2+H] with a ratio close to 2 in contrast to the almost vanished native KSM (m/z at 380.1 [M+H]), suggesting that glucosamine instead of glucose is the main or direct precursor of kasugamine and is readily convertible back to glucose at a high rate, an alternative source to myo-inositol (Figure 8B and Figure S32). Given 13C1,15N2-D-glucosamine, the isotopic profile showed the dominant m/z at 382.2 [M+2+H] and 383 [M+3+H] with a ratio close to unit confirming the above reasoning. D-glucose is an indirect substrate, while glucosamine is the \u201cdirect\u201d substrate in terms of utilization efficiency towards incorporation into KSM. On the other hand, given 15N-glycine, the molecular weight of KSM increased by one mass unit (m/z 381.2 [M+1+H]), indicating that glycine is the key precursor for the carboxyformidoyl group at C4-NH2 of KSM. Although UDP-N-Glc derivatives are the key precursors for KSM, the origin of the C4 amino group was parallelly investigated using 15N-aspartic acid or 15N-glutamic acid. An equal isotopic increment at M+H and M+1+H and a relatively minor extent of M+2+H for KSM were observed, suggesting that both 15N-aspartic acid and 15N-aspartic acid are the C4-NH2 donor of KSM and a minor C2-NH2 donor of glucosamine (Figure 8B,C). Based on our bioinformatics analysis, we put forward that KasC, the committed transaminase (28% similarity to PDB entry 5ghg, \u03c9-Transaminase), may transfer the amino group given by either of these two amine donors to the precursor of KSM [44]; KasN, the committed glycine oxidase (42% similarity to fms14), may oxidatively add the glycine to the kasugamine precursor, forming carboxyformimidoyl-kasugamine [45].", "4. Conclusions", "4. Conclusions", "In summary, KSM is produced by Streptomyces kasugaensis, isolated in 1965 [2]. It has been widely used in agriculture because of good activities against a plethora of plant bacterial diseases, for example, to control rice bacterial grain and seedling rot [4]. Beyond this, a number of new findings have highlighted that KSM is a promising drug lead, as it effectively counters some recalcitrant human diseases [5,6,7,8]. Unlike other aminoglycosides, KSM is composed of two unusual sugars, a D-chiro-inositol and a kasugamine with a glycine imine appendage. Whereas KSM has been discovered more than 50 years, its biosynthetic pathway remains still elusive due to lack of biochemical evidence. Based on the previous hypothesis, KasF was proposed as a starter enzyme involved in the formation of UDP-GlcNAc to initiate the biosynthesis of KSM, KasH as a self-resistance enzyme to regulate its biosynthesis, and KasQ as an enzyme standing in the middle of the pathway for the formation of kasugamine. In this study, we took advantage of in vitro biochemical and biophysical analyses alongside in vivo isotope feeding assays to solve these outstanding issues. First, we biochemically characterized the function of KasQ, which indeed is an epimerase converting UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc, likely serving as the first step in the KSM biosynthesis. Mechanistically, we made use of NMR, stable isotope labelling, and synthetic AAG to ascertain that KasQ belongs to the un-hydrolyzing 2-epimerase protein family, in which the 2-epimerization reaction is carried out following the anti-elimination and syn-addition dual mechanisms. Structurally, we determined three crystal structures of KasQ for the wild type and its complex with UDP or UDP-Glc, thus allowing insights into the molecular recognition and catalytic mechanism at the molecular level. KasF was previously proposed as an enzyme that primes the biosynthesis of KSM; our in vivo and in vitro biochemical assays, however, ruled out this possibility. The fact is that UDP-GlcNH2 cannot be converted to UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of KasF alongside AcCoA. KasF, nevertheless, shares the KSM-inactivation activity to some extent. By contrast, KasH is literally the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme transferring the acetyl group from AcCoA specific to KSM to form 2-N\u2019-acetyl KSM. Finally, the isotope-feeding study confirmed that 13C,15N-glucosamine/UDP-GlcNH2 rather than glucose/UDP-Glc is the direct precursor in the formation of KSM. To this end, we have addressed several long-standing unresolved issues, which should be conducive toward mapping out the correct KSM biosynthetic pathway. The information garnered should also pave the way for developing novel KSM-based medicines using chemoenzymatic and synthetic biology approaches.", "In summary, KSM is produced by Streptomyces kasugaensis, isolated in 1965 [2].
