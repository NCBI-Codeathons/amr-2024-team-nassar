While next generation sequencing revolutionized our understanding of microbiota communities, we still lack high-throughput technologies to precisely determine their functionality. Here we show how cultivation of individual bacteria inside droplets of microfluidic double water-in-oil-in-water emulsion enables us to isolate the clones with a desired activity. This approach allows us not only to select the potent antibiotic producer but also to discover a distinct mechanism of self-resistance as well as assess its efficiency on entire microbiomes. The outcome of this methodology shows that it could be effectively transferred to numerous applications in microbiology and biotechnology.", "Microbiome spectra serve as critical clues to elucidate the evolutionary biology pathways, potential pathologies, and even behavioral patterns of the host organisms. Furthermore, exotic sources of microbiota represent an unexplored niche to discover microbial secondary metabolites. However, establishing the bacterial functionality is complicated by an intricate web of interactions inside the microbiome. Here we apply an ultrahigh-throughput (uHT) microfluidic droplet platform for activity profiling of the entire oral microbial community of the Siberian bear to isolate Bacillus strains demonstrating antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Genome mining allowed us to identify antibiotic amicoumacin A (Ami) as responsible for inhibiting the growth of S. aureus. Proteomics and metabolomics revealed a unique mechanism of Bacillus self-resistance to Ami, based on a subtle equilibrium of its deactivation and activation by kinase AmiN and phosphatase AmiO, respectively. We developed uHT quantitative single-cell analysis to estimate antibiotic efficacy toward different microbiomes and used it to determine the activity spectra of Ami toward human and Siberian bear microbiota. Thus, uHT microfluidic droplet platform activity profiling is a powerful tool for discovering antibiotics and quantifying external influences on a microbiome.", "The latest insights into microbiome revealed close links between the spectra of coexisting bacteria and progression of several pathologies in human hosts (1\u20133). Microbiome spectra turned out to be a viable marker of behavior and habits of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, as well as the environmental and historical conditions they lived in (4). The bactericide properties of microbiome spectra and bacterial coexistence are becoming a hallmark of present-day biomedical investigations in humans (5, 6). Scrutinizing the microbiota of a plethora of organisms is becoming a mainstream of modern microbiology. The microbiota of wild, captive, and domesticated animals as well as birds, reptiles, and gene-modified animal models (6\u201310) were analyzed, offering valuable answers to the long-standing issues of biology. Microbiomes have also come into the limelight of evolutionary studies (11).", "The revolution in screening technologies complemented by that of functional and structural analyses of large arrays of microbiota species on a single-cell level (12) allows us to isolate and characterize clones with different activities, such as microbial killers, antifungi and antiparasite drugs, as well as probiotic bacterial strains. Microbiota of wild animals is an underestimated resource for this type of screenings. The ability of wild animals to thrive while surrounded by aggressive microorganisms may be partially mediated by their microbiota, making this kind of microbiota a potentially attractive niche for a targeted screening of antibiotics and prospective probiotic strains. In this work, we adjusted our ultrahigh-throughput (uHT) microfluidic droplet platform (13) to perform functional screening of wild-animal microbiota. Our platform allows for packaging the individual bacterial clones in double emulsion droplets and screening these microcompartments by FACS. This technique enables functional screening of the cell libraries with an enormous biodiversity displaying productivity reaching 108 variants per hour. The critical advantage of the system lies in the possibility of microbiome functional profiling on a single-cell level.", "Here we present the analyses of the microbiome collected from East Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos collaris) obtained immediately after capture in the taiga. We aimed to screen this microbiome resource and search for probiotics and physiologically active compounds. A Bacillus pumilus strain producing an unstable antibiotic amicoumacin A (Ami) was isolated, enabling us to identify the B. pumilus Ami biosynthetic gene cluster and discover a crucial role of Ami kinase/phosphatase in the regulation of Ami production. We than applied uHT screening to quantify the external influence on the microbiome diversity, thus obtaining a detailed description of Ami activity spectra toward human and Siberian bear microbiota.", "Results", "Results", "Microfluidic Selection of Antibiotic Activity.", "Microfluidic Selection of Antibiotic Activity.", "Microfluidic Selection of Antibiotic Activity.", "The saliva samples collected from an oral cavity of the Siberian brown bear were screened for bacteria inhibiting the growth of pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus cells using a microfluidic platform (Fig. 1).

Furthermore, it is active against some bacteria relevant to dysbiosis, and we suppose that Ami-producing strains could be used for controlled microbiota remodeling. Further investigations of this approach, however, must be done in terms of its safety and efficiency in vivo. Finally, we assume that the demonstrated approach is not limited to bacterial communities and could be efficiently expanded to the deep functional profiling of eukaryotic cells in applications such as biomarker probing and chemotherapy resistance/efficiency screening.", "Materials and Methods", "Materials and Methods", "Selection of Bacteria Displaying Anti-S. aureus Activity.", "Selection of Bacteria Displaying Anti-S. aureus Activity.", "Selection of Bacteria Displaying Anti-S. aureus Activity.", "The detailed selection procedure was previously described in ref. 13 and is specified in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.", "The detailed selection procedure was previously described in ref. 13 and is specified in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.", "The detailed selection procedure was previously described in ref. 13 and is specified in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.", "Microbiota Collection and Storage.", "Microbiota Collection and Storage.", "Microbiota Collection and Storage.", "The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the Federal Research and Clinical Centre of Physical-Chemical Medicine (FRCC PCM), conclusion No. 2017/02 from 13.04.2017.

Calcein Violet AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the droplet emulsion to the final concentration of 10 \u03bcM for metabolic activity staining after 10 h of incubation at 35 \u00b0C. Following the incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the droplets with Calcein Violethigh fluorescence (450/50-nm filter) were sorted using a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The collected droplets were frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze dried, and analyzed by whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatics resulted in quantification of bacteria in samples (Fig. 5B). Bacteria distributions in samples with Ami were normalized to the respective distribution in samples without Ami, resulting in shift fold calculated for each bacterium in the sample (Fig. 5A). The natural logarithm of the shift fold was defined as a score. Bacteria that have negative scores (depleted) at 10 \u00b5g/mL Ami concentration were defined as susceptible (MIC < 10 \u00b5g/mL), positive scores (increased) at 100 \u00b5g/mL as resistant (MIC > 100 \u00b5g/mL), and positive scores at 10 \u00b5g/mL and negative scores at 100 \u00b5g/mL as intermediate (MIC = 10\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), respectively.
