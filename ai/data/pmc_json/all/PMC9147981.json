["The survival, proliferation, and epidemic spread of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) in hospital settings is associated with several characteristics, including resistance to many commercially available antibiotics as well as the expression of multiple virulence mechanisms. This severely limits therapeutic options, with increased mortality and morbidity rates recorded worldwide. The World Health Organisation, thus, recognises A. baumannii as one of the critical pathogens that need to be prioritised for the development of new antibiotics or treatment. The current review will thus provide a brief overview of the antibiotic resistance and virulence mechanisms associated with A. baumannii\u2019s \u201cpersist and resist strategy\u201d. Thereafter, the potential of biological control agents including secondary metabolites such as biosurfactants [lipopeptides (surfactin and serrawettin) and glycolipids (rhamnolipid)] as well as predatory bacteria (Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus) and bacteriophages to directly target A. baumannii, will be discussed in terms of their in vitro and in vivo activity. In addition, limitations and corresponding mitigations strategies will be outlined, including curtailing resistance development using combination therapies, product stabilisation, and large-scale (up-scaling) production.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is one of the primary microorganisms linked to hospital-acquired infections such as central line-associated bacteraemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as meningitis, bioprosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) [1]. The global estimated incidence rate of A. baumannii infections is approximately 1 million cases annually, with crude mortality rates ranging from 20 to 80% [2,3]. Previous studies have indicated that several risk factors predispose patients to A. baumannii infection including age (premature babies), immunosuppression, prior hospitalisation [exposure to intensive care unit (ICU)], hospitalisation duration, surgery (invasive procedures), presence of medical indwelling devices (intravascular catheters, urinary catheter, or drainage tubes), and prior or inappropriate antimicrobial therapy [4].", "Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is one of the primary microorganisms linked to hospital-acquired infections such as central line-associated bacteraemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as meningitis, bioprosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) [1].

Acinetobacter baumannii Virulome\u2014Virulence Factors and Mechanisms", "3. Acinetobacter baumannii Virulome\u2014Virulence Factors and Mechanisms", "In addition to the resistome of MDR, XDR, and PDR A. baumannii isolates, this opportunistic pathogen employs a variety of virulence factors and mechanisms facilitating survival, which enhances the colonisation and subsequent infection of susceptible hosts. These virulence factors include but are not limited to; cellular envelope factors, outer membrane proteins, secretion systems, phospholipases, and biofilm formation, which concomitantly contribute to the pathogenicity of A. baumannii (extensively reviewed by Harding et al. [16]) (Figure 1). The cellular envelope factors, including glycoconjugates or glycans (carbohydrates) such as capsular polysaccharides (CPS), LPS, glycosylated proteins, and peptidoglycan, provide an interface between A. baumannii and its environment, thus facilitating survival and persistence [16] (Figure 1). For example, the CPS of A. baumannii has been associated with water retention, which facilitates desiccation tolerance. Tipton et al. [39] observed that acapsular (CPS absent) A. baumannii AB5075, exhibited a 2.5-fold decrease in desiccation tolerance in comparison to capsular parental strains. In addition, the acapsular (\u0394wzc) mutant strain exhibited an 8-log reduction in the colony forming units (CFU) at 24 h post-infection of a murine (mouse lung/lungs) model, in comparison to the wild-type, capsular (wzc) strain, indicating that the capsule functions as an important virulence factor in infection and pathogenesis. The LPS has also been linked to desiccation tolerance with Boll et al. [40] demonstrating the association between lipid A acetylation and desiccation tolerance in A. baumannii. Moreover, strains of A. baumannii, with LPS devoid of the hepta-acylated lipid A, exhibited decreased desiccation tolerance, which was proposed to be due to an increased membrane fluidity resulting in the leakage of water and nutrients [40]. In addition to OMPs, several secretion systems have been detected and associated with virulence amongst A. baumannii strains, including the Type II secretion system (T2SS), Type V secretion system (T5SS), and Type VI secretion system (T6SS) [16] (Figure 1). The T2SS facilitates the excretion of toxins, hydrolytic enzymes (lipases, lipoproteins, and proteases), aids in the acquisition of nutrients, and is required for in vivo survival and virulence [41,42]. Johnson et al.

Through the generation of A. baumannii \u2206gspD and \u2206gspE mutants, decreased LipA secretion was achieved resulting in decreased growth and significantly reduced in vivo fitness (decreased colonisation of spleen and liver) in murine (CBA/J mice) models.

Biofilm formation has also been associated with increased pathogenicity, with Khalil et al. [51] reporting on an increased killing rate (50 to 90%), observed in a larva (G. mellonella) model, by strong biofilm-forming A. baumannii strains in comparison to moderate and weak biofilm-forming strains. Structures such as the chaperone-usher (Csu) pili and CsuA/BABCDE-independent short pili system, as well as biofilm associated-proteins (Bap or BAP), allow A. baumannii to adhere to both abiotic (polyethylene, polystyrene, titanium, and Teflon) and biotic (human bronchial epithelial (H292) cells and neonatal keratinocyte cells) surfaces [52] (Figure 1). Two Bap-like proteins (BLP: BLP1 and BLP2) have also been identified in different A. baumannii strains, facilitating both adherence and biofilm formation on bronchial epithelial (A549) cells [53] (Figure 1). Moreover, extracellular polymeric substances form part of A. baumannii biofilms and are composed of poly-\u03b2-(1-6)-N-acetylglucosamine and extracellular DNA, providing structural support and intracellular connectors, which allows for biofilm formation under diverse environmental conditions [6]. Biofilm formation and maintenance have also been associated with intracellular communication, mediated by 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic diguanylic acid and quorum sensing, which is facilitated by AtaI autoinducer synthase and the AbaR cognate receptor [50] (Figure 1). Additionally, the association or correlation between biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance has been extensively investigated [54,55,56]. For example, Thummeepak et al. [54] investigated the association between biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance phenotype, and virulence genes in clinical A. baumannii (n = 225) isolates, with 86.2% of the strains characterised as MDR, of which 76.9% were biofilm producers. The biofilm formation genes, ompA and bap were further linked/associated with the MDR phenotype of the A. baumannii isolates.", "Through the implementation of numerous surface and extracellular-associated structures, A. baumannii is also able to form biofilms, which has been characterised as a major virulence factor contributing to the bacterium\u2019s pathogenicity [6,50]. Biofilm formation has also been associated with increased pathogenicity, with Khalil et al. [51] reporting on an increased killing rate (50 to 90%), observed in a larva (G. mellonella) model, by strong biofilm-forming A. baumannii strains in comparison to moderate and weak biofilm-forming strains. Structures such as the chaperone-usher (Csu) pili and CsuA/BABCDE-independent short pili system, as well as biofilm associated-proteins (Bap or BAP), allow A. baumannii to adhere to both abiotic (polyethylene, polystyrene, titanium, and Teflon) and biotic (human bronchial epithelial (H292) cells and neonatal keratinocyte cells) surfaces [52] (Figure 1). Two Bap-like proteins (BLP: BLP1 and BLP2) have also been identified in different A. baumannii strains, facilitating both adherence and biofilm formation on bronchial epithelial (A549) cells [53] (Figure 1). Moreover, extracellular polymeric substances form part of A. baumannii biofilms and are composed of poly-\u03b2-(1-6)-N-acetylglucosamine and extracellular DNA, providing structural support and intracellular connectors, which allows for biofilm formation under diverse environmental conditions [6]. Biofilm formation and maintenance have also been associated with intracellular communication, mediated by 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic diguanylic acid and quorum sensing, which is facilitated by AtaI autoinducer synthase and the AbaR cognate receptor [50] (Figure 1). Additionally, the association or correlation between biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance has been extensively investigated [54,55,56]. For example, Thummeepak et al.

Trimethoprim then exhibited the lowest activity against B. bacteriovorus HD100 and highest activity towards E. coli, which implied that this antibiotic could potentially be employed in combination therapy with the predatory bacterium. Furthermore, the development of this novel screening method implies that other B. bacteriovorus strains could potentially be screened and applied in combination with commercial antibiotics, broadening the antibacterial application of B. bacteriovorus and simultaneously circumventing the potential development of predation and antibiotic resistance.", "While B. bacteriovorus resistance has not been detected amongst A. baumannii strains, previous studies have observed that certain bacterial species exhibit (1) population-based resistance (plastic phenotypic resistance) and (2) cell-wall based resistance (production of procrystalline protein or S-layer), when exposed to various predatory strains (Figure 3) (Shemesh and Jurkevitch 2004). Thus, as Bdellovibrio spp. have been observed to exhibit inherent resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and antifolates, it has been hypothesised that Bdellovibrio spp. could serve as potentiators or adjuvants to conventional antibiotics (penicillins, carbapenems, and trimethoprim) or antimicrobials, which, in turn, may mitigate the development of predator and/or antibiotic resistance [82,83]. Im et al. [90] demonstrated the antimicrobial efficacy of B. bacteriovorus HD100 in combination with violacein (bis-indole pigment derived from Pseudoduganella violaceinigra sp. NI28) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including MDR S. aureus, Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), E. coli, MDR K. pneumoniae, and MDR A. baumannii in mono- and dual-culture experiments as well as polymicrobial cultures. Violacein in combination with B. bacteriovorus HD100, resulted in a 99.8% reduction in S. aureus and A. baumannii cell counts, respectively, in the monoculture experiments. In addition, treatment (violacein and B. bacteriovorus HD100) of dual cultures of either A. baumannii or K. pneumoniae with S. epidermidis, resulted in an average cell count reduction of 99.3% for each of the pathogens. Moreover, the treatment of a polymicrobial culture consisting of S. aureus, A. baumannii, B. cereus, and K. pneumoniae, with violacein and B. bacteriovorus HD100, also resulted in a 99.96% cell count reduction.

For example, in the study conducted by Im et al. [91], serum albumin and osmolarity (environmental factor) were observed to inhibit B. bacteriovorus HD100 predation on E. coli MG1655, K. pneumoniae (clinical isolate), and S. enterica KACC 11595 in a human serum model. Using different concentrations of NaCl [0.65 to 1% (w/v)] to adjust the osmolarity of the HEPES buffer, the authors observed a reduction in the predation activity of B. bacteriovorus HD100 at an osmolarity greater than 200 mOsm/kg (milliosmoles per kilogram) (0.65% NaCl), whereas predation was completely inactivated at 250 mOsm/kg (0.82% NaCl). Stabilisation of the predatory bacterium could, however, be carried out through biopolymeric encapsulation [92]. Cao et al. [92] implemented spray drying to encapsulate Bdellovibrio sp. strain F16 in gelatin, allowing the predatory bacterium to remain viable at a concentration of 3.5 \u00d7 107 plaque-forming units (PFU)/g after 120 days at room temperature. Additionally, the encapsulated Bdellovibrio sp. strain F16 retained predatory activity and exhibited antimicrobial activity towards shrimp-pathogenic vibrios at a concentration of 0.8 mg/L. Thus, while the development of bioactive biopolymers for encapsulation of the predator may allow for environmental stabilisation and long-term storage, the implementation of a living bacterium for the treatment of MDR, XDR, and PDR infections may be problematic due to several pharmaceutical and medical legislation and regulations.", "In addition to predatory resistance, environmental conditions, or factors (viscosity, osmolarity, and temperature) have been identified as a potential limitation for the application of the predatory bacteria as biological control agents [83].

Following co-culturing of the T4 bacteriophage and E. coli B strain for 24 hours, a bacteriophage titre of 1.2 \u00d7 1016 PFU/mL was obtained.

[16]).Two T5SS have been identified amongst Acinetobacter spp., namely, Type Vb (T5bSS) and Type Vc (T5cSS). The T5bSS are classified as two-partner secretion (TPS) systems and have been found to be associated with increased adherence to human epithelial alveolar (A549) cells, and in vivo virulence in nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) and murine (BALB/c mice) models [43]. Another T5bSS, the contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) system or CdiA/CdiB system, facilitates bacterial competition through the secretion of the CdiA toxin into the cytoplasm of neighbouring bacteria [44] (Figure 1). Apart from T5bSS, the T5cSS, the Acinetobacter trimeric autotransporter (Ata) type Vc secretion system, has been described as multifactorial, facilitating biofilm formation, extracellular matrix/basal membrane protein (collagen IV cell) adhesion, as well as pathogenesis in murine (C57BL/6 mice) models (Figure 1). The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is primarily associated with bacterial competition (secretions of peptidoglycan hydrolyses and nucleases) and has also been observed to contribute to in vivo virulence in a larva [Galleria mellonella (G. mellonella)] model [16,45]. This secretion system further facilitates virulence through the release of phospholipases of which phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) have been detected and described for A. baumannii strains. Three PLDs (PLD1, PLD2, and PLD3) have then been found to mediate human serum resistance (higher propensity to cause bacteraemia), invasion of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), and pathogenicity in murine (C57BL/6 mice) models and larva (G. mellonella) models [46] (Figure 1). For example, the authors observed that pld triple mutants (\u0394pld1-3 triple mutant) exhibited a reduced (74.2 \u00b1 3.6%) in vivo virulence in comparison to wild-type A. baumannii (89.8 \u00b1 2.6%), highlighting the role of phospholipase in the pathogenesis of this opportunistic bacterium.
