However, antibiotic resistance genes are not confined to the clinic; instead they are widely prevalent in different bacterial populations in the environment. Therefore, to understand development of antibiotic resistance in pathogens, we need to consider important reservoirs of resistance genes, which may include determinants that confer self-resistance in antibiotic producing soil bacteria and genes encoding intrinsic resistance mechanisms present in all or most non-producer environmental bacteria. While the presence of resistance determinants in soil and environmental bacteria does not pose a threat to human health, their mobilization to new hosts and their expression under different contexts, for example their transfer to plasmids and integrons in pathogenic bacteria, can translate into a problem of huge proportions, as discussed in this review. Selective pressure brought about by human activities further results in enrichment of such determinants in bacterial populations. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand distribution of resistance determinants in bacterial populations, elucidate resistance mechanisms, and determine environmental factors that promote their dissemination. This comprehensive review describes the major known self-resistance mechanisms found in producer soil bacteria of the genus Streptomyces and explores the relationships between resistance determinants found in producer soil bacteria, non-producer environmental bacteria, and clinical isolates. Specific examples highlighting potential pathways by which pathogenic clinical isolates might acquire these resistance determinants from soil and environmental bacteria are also discussed. Overall, this article provides a conceptual framework for understanding the complexity of the problem of emergence of antibiotic resistance in the clinic. Availability of such knowledge will allow researchers to build models for dissemination of resistance genes and for developing interventions to prevent recruitment of additional or novel genes into pathogens.", "Introduction: A Brief Historical Perspective", "Introduction: A Brief Historical Perspective", "Selman Waksman, a prominent researcher in the field of actinomycetes in the early part of the twentieth century, described the term antibiotic as a chemical compound generated from microorganisms that inhibits or destroys other microbes (Hopwood, 2007; Davies and Davies, 2010). Most antibiotics in use today originated from the phylum Actinobacteria with nearly 80% of actinobacterial-derived antibiotics produced by soil-dwelling bacteria of the genus Streptomyces (Barka et al., 2016). Before the discovery of natural antibiotics, synthetic compounds, including salvarsan, sulfa drugs and quinolones, were in use as chemotherapeutic agents (Aminov, 2010). Penicillin was the first natural antibiotic to be discovered accidentally by Alexander Fleming in 1928 when the Penicillium fungus contaminated a culture plate in his laboratory, however, penicillin was not developed for use until the late 1930s (Hopwood, 2007). Penicillin inhibits cell wall synthesis and was found to be very effective against Gram-positive but not against Gram-negative bacteria (due to the presence of the outer membrane) or the tubercle bacillus (because of the extra thick cell wall) (Hopwood, 2007). Following the discovery of penicillin by Fleming, other scientists, including Rene Dubos and Selman Waksman, started a deliberate search for antibacterial agents among soil microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. It was soon realized that antibacterial activity was most often present in actinomycete cultures and less often in other bacteria or fungi. During this period, several antibiotics were discovered in the screens designed by these scientists but many of these were of little use in the clinic due to their toxicity in animals. The next biggest discovery came about in 1943, resulting in identification of streptomycin produced by Streptomyces griseus. Streptomycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome and was found to be effective not only against Gram-negative bacteria but also against the tubercle bacillus (Hopwood, 2007). With the discovery of streptomycin, the golden age of antibiotic discovery and development (1940\u20131990) ensued. This involved efforts of many academic institutions and major pharmaceutical companies in the United States and other countries. Currently, antibiotics affecting almost every process in the bacterial cell are known. Based on their structure and mode of action, at least seven major groups of antibiotics have been described. These include \u03b2-lactams (inhibit cell wall synthesis), aminoglycosides (protein synthesis), macrolides (protein synthesis), tetracyclines (protein synthesis), daptomycin (cell membrane function), platensimycin (fatty acid biosynthesis), and glycopeptides (cell wall synthesis).", "Selman Waksman, a prominent researcher in the field of actinomycetes in the early part of the twentieth century, described the term antibiotic as a chemical compound generated from microorganisms that inhibits or destroys other microbes (Hopwood, 2007; Davies and Davies, 2010).

In addition, co-existence of producer and non-producer bacteria is also believed to have resulted in co-evolution of resistance mechanisms in non-producing environmental bacteria. Resistance determinants found in these two groups of bacteria have garnered significant attention in recent years because of their possible link with the emergence of resistance in pathogenic clinical isolates (Surette and Wright, 2017; Martinez, 2018).

This review article provides an up-to-date understanding of the antibiotic self-resistance mechanisms found in producer soil bacteria of the genus Streptomyces and explores relationships between resistance determinants found in producer and non-producer soil and environmental bacteria and the clinical pathogenic bacteria. The topic of self-resistance in producer bacteria has never before been reviewed in its entirety, while antibiotic resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates have been extensively described (Munita and Arias, 2016).

These two sections were kept separate in this review because resistance mechanisms of producers and clinical isolates are currently at very different levels of understanding. In the last sections of this review, origins of resistance determinants in clinical strains and potential mechanisms for their mobilization are discussed. Although every attempt has been made to be inclusive of all available literature, the information on each topic addressed in this review is broad and constantly growing, therefore any omission is unintentional.

Although these enzymes have been shown to be very prevalent in clinical strains (Schwarz et al., 2004) and are also likely to be common in Streptomyces, only a few reports of identification of CAT enzymes from Streptomyces species are available (Murray et al., 1989).", "In contrast to the modification of antibiotics described above, resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is normally conferred by antibiotic-hydrolyzing enzymes known as \u03b2-lactamases. These enzymes are widespread among Streptomyces, and, together with similar enzymes found in pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, they constitute the \u2018\u03b2-lactamase superfamily\u2019 of proteins (Sattler et al., 2015; Ogawara, 2016b). \u03b2-lactamases are generally grouped into four classes (A,B,C,D) based on their amino acid sequence and use of a catalytic serine or zinc ion (King et al., 2016). In a recent phylogenetic screen conducted by Ogawara, it was found that diverse \u03b2-lactamases belonging to classes A, B, and C exist in many Streptomyces species. However, a clear relationship between the level of \u03b2-lactamases and the degree of resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in these species has not been established (Ogawara, 2016b). This is due to the fact that most Streptomyces species produce \u03b2-lactamases constitutively, and their production is not related to resistance or synthesis of \u03b2-lactams. As discussed previously for AMEs, Streptomyces \u03b2-lactamases also exhibit diverse species-specific properties, again suggesting convergent evolution from different proteins to perform the same function, i.e., hydrolysis of the \u03b2-lactam ring (Allen et al., 2009). The presence of \u03b2-lactamases in producers also presents an evolutionary conundrum \u2013 how can \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactamases co-exist simultaneously in producer cells? Perhaps these enzymes play alternative cellular functions in Streptomyces, are expressed at low levels, or are expressed in a growth phase different from biosynthesis? Overall, therefore, it has been proposed that \u03b2-lactamases may not play an important role in resistance in Streptomyces species, which may instead involve the function of low-affinity penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) (Ogawara, 2015) discussed in Section \u201cTarget Modification/Bypass/Protection Mechanisms\u201d in this article.", "In contrast to the modification of antibiotics described above, resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is normally conferred by antibiotic-hydrolyzing enzymes known as \u03b2-lactamases.

The best studied example of antibiotic efflux among producers is found in Streptomyces peucetius, which produces two closely related anticancer antibiotics, daunorubicin (Dnr) and doxorubicin (Dox). These two antibiotics intercalate with DNA preventing further rounds of replication. Efflux of these antibiotics in S. peucetius occurs by an ABC (ATP Binding Cassette) family transporter DrrAB coded by the drrAB genes embedded within the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of these antibiotics (Guilfoile and Hutchinson, 1991). The DrrAB system has been studied in significant molecular and biochemical detail. The DrrAB pump is assembled from two subunits each of the ABC protein DrrA and the integral membrane protein DrrB. DrrA protein functions as the catalytic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). DrrB protein functions as the carrier protein and forms the transmembrane domain (TMD). In an in vitro assay using inverted membrane vesicles, the DrrAB proteins were shown to carry out efflux of Dox in ATP or GTP-dependent manner (Li et al., 2014). Because of the location of the drrAB genes in the Dox biosynthesis gene cluster, this system is considered to be a dedicated transporter of Dnr and Dox in S. peucetius.

In this regard, the DrrAB system is similar to the mammalian ABC multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is overexpressed in human cancer cells and is one of the major causes for failure of chemotherapy (Chufan et al., 2015). Recent studies showed that critical aromatic residues, contributed by multiple helices in DrrB, form part of a large (common) drug-binding pocket (Li et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2017).

This likely occurs when tetracycline exported to the periplasm by a Tet protein can be captured by the RND pump and exported to the outside (Nikaido and Takatsuka, 2009), illustrating how acquired resistance mechanisms can be augmented by the intrinsic mechanisms potentially resulting in major implications in the clinic.", "Target Modification/Bypass/Protection", "Target Modification/Bypass/Protection", "Target Modification/Bypass/Protection", "Target Modification/Bypass/Protection", "A large number of target replacement and protection mechanisms are also found in clinical isolates.

Indeed, resistance genes are much more widespread in environmental non-pathogenic microbial populations than was originally believed (D\u2019Costa et al., 2006; Nesme et al., 2014; Surette and Wright, 2017). In an interesting study, which tested 500 Streptomyces strains enriched and isolated from soil against 21 antibiotics (including natural, semisynthetic, synthetic as well as recently introduced antibiotics), surprisingly all strains were multidrug resistant to 7 or 8 of the 21 tested antibiotics (D\u2019Costa et al., 2006), suggesting widespread resistance mechanisms among modern organisms. The genome sequence analyses carried out in recent years have also shown that not only are the intrinsic resistance mechanisms widely prevalent in all microbes (Fajardo et al., 2008; Cox and Wright, 2013), but that homologs of the resistance determinants of clinical isolates are commonly present in non-pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Seoane and Garcia Lobo, 2000; Mukhtar et al., 2001; Sugantino and Roderick, 2002).

Analysis of microbial DNA isolated from the dental plaque of ancient human remains showed the existence of gene sequences homologous to those conferring resistance to \u03b2-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracycline, and bacitracin in clinical strains (Warinner et al., 2014; Olaitan and Rolain, 2016). In another study, metagenomic analysis of ancient DNA derived from 30,000-year-old permafrost showed the presence of homologs of tetM, vanX, and bla genes (D\u2019Costa et al., 2011). Interestingly, the vanHAX cluster in permafrost DNA exhibited the same invariant organization as seen in modern vancomycin resistant isolates, confirming that these genes predate the use of antibiotics.

These examples provide definitive evidence of genetic transfer from environmental organisms and also illuminate how an intrinsic resistance gene located in the genome of a non-pathogenic organism can result in a pandemic when mobilized to a conjugative plasmid or a phage and transferred to a clinically relevant strain. Overall, these examples suggest that both producer and non-producer environmental bacteria play a role in dissemination of resistance genes although recent direct transfers to clinical strains seem to have mainly occurred from non-producer environmental bacteria.", "Role of HGT in Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance Genes", "Role of HGT in Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance Genes", "Transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between bacterial populations occurs by genetic exchange mechanisms involving transformation with free DNA, transduction by bacteriophages, or conjugation involving plasmids (Wright, 2007; Hu et al., 2017), collectively referred to as the HGT mechanisms. All three HGT mechanisms are widely used in nature, although certain species of bacteria tend to employ one mechanism more heavily over the others (Barlow, 2009). For example, streptococci can become naturally competent and thus participate effectively in transformation, whereas enterobacteria commonly use conjugative plasmids for exchange of genetic information. Transformation is best characterized in Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis although many Gram-negative bacteria also become competent (Johnston et al., 2014). The factors that control competence generally include the nutritional status of the bacterium (Claverys et al., 2006) and environmental stressors, such as antibiotics or DNA damaging agents (Prudhomme et al., 2006). Although the physiological role of transformation is still debated, its main purpose is believed to be DNA repair or genetic diversification to enhance adaptability (Johnston et al., 2014). Indeed, transformation seems to have played an important role in evolution of antibiotic resistance strains of Streptococcus and Neisseria. For example, it is thought that the persistence of penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae may be related to the high frequency of natural transformation in this organism (Hoffman-Roberts et al., 2005). Transformation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with DNA from resistant commensal Neisseria flavescens is believed to have resulted in generation of a mosaic penA variant that confers resistance to \u03b2-lactams in clinical isolates (Spratt, 1988; Spratt et al., 1992).

In S. aureus, which exhibits high strain variability and carries a large accessory genome consisting of phages, plasmids, transposons, genomic islands, and SCCmec (most of which carry resistance genes), it is generally accepted that HGT in general, and transduction in particular, play a major role in antibiotic resistance gene transfer (Haaber et al., 2017). Indeed, moderate rates of transfer (about 10-5 or 10-6) of genes for penicillinase, metallo \u03b2-lactamase, and tetracycline resistance by transducing phages have been reported in S. aureus (Varga et al., 2012; Lee and Park, 2016; Varga et al., 2016). However, transduction of even the small SCCmecs (20\u201325 kb in size) from MRSA strains of S. aureus to methicillin-sensitive strains was shown to occur at low frequencies (10-9 to 10-10) (Scharn et al., 2013). Another study, which used qPCR to quantify S. aureus genes in viral particles, showed the presence of parts of the SCCmec element (specifically mecA and ccrA1) in phage particles at relatively high frequency of about 10-4 (Maslanova et al., 2013). Quantitative studies, however, do not take into consideration the transmission capability of the particles, therefore they likely reflect an overestimation of the transduction frequency (Torres-Barcelo, 2018). Interestingly, other resistance and virulence genes of S. aureus associated with special MGEs referred to as PICIs (phage-induced chromosomal islands), which include SaPIs (S. aureus pathogenicity islands), are known to be transduced by bacteriophages at remarkably high frequencies approaching 10-1 (Chen and Novick, 2009; Penad\u00e9s and Christie, 2015). These islands include many antibiotic resistance genes, suggesting that transduction may contribute significantly to variability and evolution of resistance in S. aureus (Novick et al., 2010).

Nevertheless, certain environments considered to be hot-spots for genetic exchange, such as sewage and wastewater treatment plants, hospital effluents, aquaculture, agricultural and slaughterhouse waste, are prime locations for exchange events because of the high density of bacteria, phages, and plasmids in these settings (Kenzaka et al., 2010; von Wintersdorff et al., 2016). In one study, qPCR analysis showed that blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and mecA were indeed present in phage particles isolated from sewage samples (Colomer-Lluch et al., 2014). Other reports showing the prevalence of phage carrying blaTEM and blaCTX-M genes in soil, water, and sewage are also available (Balcazar, 2014; Larranaga et al., 2018; Mohan Raj et al., 2018). When combined with high selection pressure in these environments, resulting from the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics, metals, and toxic materials, which can lead to induction of competence (Prudhomme et al., 2006) as well as induction of prophages (Motlagh et al., 2015), it further enhances the possibility of HGT by these two mechanisms.

Plasmids are capable of autonomous replication, and they carry genes for resistance against all major classes of antibiotics. In fact, plasmids can carry a collection of resistance genes as part of transposons, thus simultaneously conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics and metal ions (Nikaido, 2009). Moreover, they can transfer genes over long genetic distances to different species, genera, and even kingdoms depending on the host range of the plasmid. Using mathematical modeling analysis, one study recently showed that conjugation may be 1000-fold more common than transduction as a resistance gene transfer mechanism (Volkova et al., 2014). Since gene transfer by conjugation can be easily tracked by DNA sequencing and PCR-based approaches, there is sufficient evidence for its contribution to worldwide dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants both in community and hospital environments (Carattoli, 2013). Some of the most successful known plasmids are the ones that have resulted in the spread of carbapenemase, blaCTX-M ESBL, and quinolone resistance genes among Gram-negative bacteria over very large geographical distances (Carattoli, 2013). In Gram-positive bacteria, other DNA elements, known as conjugative transposons or integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), can also mediate conjugation. These elements integrate into the chromosome but contain the ability to excise and transfer themselves by conjugation. ICEs often carry resistance genes, for example Tn916 family members that encode tetracycline resistance (Roberts and Mullany, 2011).

Although some resistance determinants have been plasmid-associated for a long time (Barlow and Hall, 2002), others are mobilized to plasmids from chromosomes, and the rate at which these genes are being mobilized has increased since the widespread use of antibiotics about 70 years ago (Barlow et al., 2008). Another worrisome emerging trend is the clustering of antibiotic resistance genes on plasmids, perhaps as a response to selective pressures in the environment. A well-characterized mechanism of clustering is provided by the S. aureus conjugative plasmid pSK41 that contains an insertion sequence IS257, which promotes capture of small resistance plasmids (Haaber et al., 2017).", "Plasmid-mediated conjugation as a gene transfer mechanism is, however, still considered to be far more prevalent in disseminating resistance genes in nature than either transformation or transduction.

Further, the ability of a mobile genetic element to establish in a population also depends on whether it can replicate autonomously and therefore get vertically transmitted. The most successful conjugative plasmids, such as the incompatibility group IncP, have a broad host range (Davies and Davies, 2010), which facilitates their transfer to and maintenance in distantly related phyla (Klumper et al., 2015). The ability of MGEs or DNA to persist in the environment also determines success of HGT. For example, while cell-to-cell contact is essential for conjugation, it provides better protection to DNA. On the other hand, naked DNA is vulnerable to being degraded quickly, which reduces the time period during which it remains intact to successfully encounter a competent cell.

It is not clear, however, why and how resistance genes are captured or transferred from chromosome to the plasmids. In addition to the role of insertion sequences and transposons, mobilization of resistance genes may also be greatly aided by the presence of integrons. While they are not self-mobile, they can be mobilized to plasmids or phages by transposons, thus gaining the ability to move between cells by HGT. Integrons typically contain three genetic elements, which include a gene for site-specific recombination (IntI), a site-specific recombination site (attI), and a promoter upstream of the attI site used for expression of the recruited gene cassette (often containing resistance determinants) (Domingues et al., 2012). Thus they are able to exchange and/or recruit gene cassettes by site-specific recombination between the attC site on the cassette and the attI site on the integron, or they can excise gene cassettes by site-specific recombination, therefore conferring the ability on the host to rearrange resistance and virulence determinants (Gillings, 2014).

In this mechanism, conjugation mediated by a broad-host range conjugative plasmid (Klumper et al., 2015) may transfer a carrier sequence of DNA (a fragment from a widely spread class 1 integron In4) from Proteobacteria to Actinobacteria, followed by recombination, resulting in actinobacterial DNA flanked by proteobacterial DNA. Dead actinobacteria cells would release the actinobacterial DNA flanked by proteobacterial DNA into the environment, and proteobacteria can take up this DNA by transformation and incorporate into their genome using homologous recombination. Using such a mechanism, cmx and lmrA genes are believed to have been recently transferred from Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria with the help of the broad-host range conjugative plasmids and integrons (Jiang et al., 2017). Once these genes are transferred to proteobacteria, it is easy to envision their transfer to pathogenic bacteria which also mostly belong to the phylum Proteobacteria.

This process is envisioned to go through four stages: emergence of novel resistance genes, mobilization, transfer to pathogens, and dissemination. While emergence and mobilization events likely occur all the time, environmental factors, such as selective pressure, fitness cost, and dispersal, determine whether these events actually result in establishing novel genes in populations (Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2018). Of these, selection is perhaps the single most important factor which plays a critical role in maintenance of resistance genes/MGEs at each stage of the acquisition process described above. What creates selective pressure strong enough to promote persistence and longevity of resistance genes? Antibiotic producers present one such scenario where resistance genes can be selected naturally in a competitive environment, thus preserving the pool of resistance genes in that niche (Laskaris et al., 2010). The most important source of selective pressure, however, is the widespread and indiscriminate usage of antibiotics by humans, which results in dominance of resistant and multiply resistant strains of bacteria not only among human pathogens but also in environments where human activities (such as antibiotic manufacturing facilities) result in pollution with antibiotics (Larsson, 2014). Other settings, considered to be hot-spots (described in section \u201cRole of HGT in Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance Genes\u201d), where human-associated and environmental bacteria co-exist, also provide significant opportunities for exchange of resistance genes as well as selection for resistance (Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2018). Such environments are ideal not only for transfer of resistance genes to pathogens, but they can also result in transfer of resistance from pathogens to environmental bacteria or opportunistic pathogens, resulting in persistence and possible reemergence of resistance genes in the future (Ashbolt et al., 2013; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2014; Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2018). Recent studies have shown that antibiotic concentrations significantly below the minimum inhibitory concentration for sensitive bacteria can be selective (Gullberg et al., 2011, 2014). Moreover, other contaminants, such as heavy metals, can also co-select for antibiotic resistance (Pal et al., 2015; Andersson and Hughes, 2017).", "By now it is well-recognized that the environment itself plays an important role in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by pathogenic organisms.

Recent studies have shown that antibiotic concentrations significantly below the minimum inhibitory concentration for sensitive bacteria can be selective (Gullberg et al., 2011, 2014). Moreover, other contaminants, such as heavy metals, can also co-select for antibiotic resistance (Pal et al., 2015; Andersson and Hughes, 2017).", "There is indeed evidence that selective pressure caused by human activities in the last 70 years has resulted in a significant enrichment of resistance genes in bacterial populations. One study compared pre-antibiotic era microbes with modern environmental bacteria in archived soils collected from 1940 to 2008 in the Netherlands and showed that genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and \u03b2-lactams increased in abundance over time (Knapp et al., 2010). Interestingly, an increased rate of mobilization of \u03b2-lactamase genes from the chromosome to the plasmids was also reported (Barlow et al., 2008). A novel hypothesis advanced recently suggests that the use of antibiotics may provide a strong selection for \u2018capture\u2019 of antibiotic resistance genes by mobile genetic elements (including plasmids, transposons, and integrons) and acting as a strong force in shaping evolution of microorganisms (Gillings, 2014; Surette and Wright, 2017). Other reports also suggest that antibiotic selection promotes competence in S. pneumoniae (Prudhomme et al., 2006), induction of prophages in S. aureus (Goerke et al., 2006), and enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes in phages present in the gut microbiome (Modi et al., 2013), all processes that could increase the rate of HGT. Interestingly, a more recent study showed that the ratio of transducing particles to virulent phages varies upon induction by sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics, suggesting that antibiotics affect packaging of genes into phage particles (Stanczak-Mrozek et al., 2017). Antibiotic exposure has also been shown to result in increased rates of mutations and recombination as well as an increase in integrase activity (Maiques et al., 2006; Lopez et al., 2007; Blazquez et al., 2012), thus compounding the multiple effects that excessive usage of antibiotics can have on emergence and enrichment of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. In conclusion, mitigation strategies focused on limiting selective pressure, for example by reducing unnecessary usage of antibiotics and avoiding settings which select for and promote persistence, are needed to prevent further recruitment of novel resistance genes into pathogens.", "There is indeed evidence that selective pressure caused by human activities in the last 70 years has resulted in a significant enrichment of resistance genes in bacterial populations.

These determinants may be transferred to clinical strains by a variety of HGT mechanisms, including transformation of naturally competent bacteria, phages, and the use of conjugative plasmids, transposons, and integrons. Despite barriers to the exchange of genetic information between different genera of bacteria, widespread transfer of resistance genes from chromosomes of environmental and soil bacteria to the mobilizable elements in clinical isolates seems to have occurred. Indeed several examples of recent transfers from environmental bacteria to the clinical strains are available (Route 3, Figure 2); however, very limited evidence for recent direct transfer from producers to clinical strains has been obtained (Route 1, Figure 2). Nevertheless, transfer from producer bacteria to other actinomycetes in soil is possible (Route 2A), which could provide a pathway for further transfer of these determinants to proteobacterial clinical strains (Route 2B). Based on the available evidence, we conclude that Routes 2 and 3 are much more prevalent in nature as compared to Route 1 for transfer of resistance genes to pathogens.", "Antibiotic producing bacteria of the genus Streptomyces as well as non-pathogenic environmental bacteria are important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance determinants.
