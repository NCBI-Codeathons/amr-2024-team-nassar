["As an important microbial resource, Actinomycetes, especially Streptomyces, have important application values in medicine and biotechnology. Streptomyces fungicidicus SYH3 was isolated from soil samples in tomato-growing areas and showed good inhibitory effects on Alternaria solani in tomato. To obtain pure active compounds, SYH3 fermentation broth was subjected to XAD-16 macroporous resin and silica gel column chromatography. Combined with the repeated preparation and separation of preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a total of four monomer compounds were obtained after activity tracking. Compound 4 was identified as a new six-membered lactone ring compound named 6-(5-hydroxy-6-methylheptyl)-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and mass spectrometry (MS). The other three active compounds belong to the cyclodipeptide, and their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against A. solani were 43.4, 42.9, and 30.6 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Compound 4 significantly inhibited the spore germination and induced swollen and deformed local hyphae of A. solani with an IC50 value of 24.9 \u03bcg/mL. Compound 4 also had broad-spectrum antifungal activity and had a good antifungal effect on the tested plant-pathogenic fungi.
