This provides an effective self-defense mechanism, preventing any fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A formed from being further metabolized to 4-hydroxy-trans-aconitate, a lethal inhibitor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Remarkably, FlK does not accept acetyl-coenzyme A as a substrate. Crystal structure analysis shows that FlK forms a dimer, in which each subunit adopts a hot dog fold as observed for type II thioesterases. Unlike other type II thioesterases, which invariably utilize either an aspartate or a glutamate as catalytic base, we show by site-directed mutagenesis and crystallography that FlK employs a catalytic triad composed of Thr42, His76, and a water molecule, analogous to the Ser/Cys-His-acid triad of type I thioesterases. Structural comparison of FlK complexed with various substrate analogues suggests that the interaction between the fluorine of the substrate and the side chain of Arg120 located opposite to the catalytic triad is essential for correct coordination of the substrate at the active site and therefore accounts for the substrate specificity.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "In 1986, Sanada et al. (1) discovered that Streptomyces cattleya is able to produce fluoroacetate (FAc)8 from fluoride. Attempts to elucidate the mechanism of this unusual transformation have led to the discovery of a fluorinase enzyme catalyzing the formation of 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine from S-adenosyl-l-methionine and fluoride (2\u20136). We have cloned the fluorinase gene flA (5) and subsequently identified a gene cluster (fl) surrounding the fluorinase gene from S. cattleya (7). Characterization of the 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine phosphorylase (3), the enzyme responsible for the second step of the FAc biosynthesis encoded by the flB gene located next to the flA, has confirmed the involvement of the fl gene cluster in the biosynthesis of FAc (7). In our efforts to further elucidate the functions of the fl gene cluster, the protein encoded by the flK gene located close to the 3\u2032-end of the cluster was characterized as a thioesterase that cleaves fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A (FAcCoA) to produce FAc and CoA. It is noteworthy that acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) is not hydrolyzed by FlK (7). Previous studies have shown that FAc can be used by AcCoA synthase to synthesize FAcCoA, and citrate synthase can catalyze formation of 2-fluorocitrate from FAcCoA and oxaloacetate (8). Lauble et al. (9) have shown that the (\u2212)-erythro diastereomer of 2-fluorocitrate is further converted to 4-hydroxy-trans-aconitate, a lethal competitive inhibitor of aconitase, thereby blocking the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The presence of a FAcCoA-hydrolyzing enzyme that has no effect on the metabolically important intermediate AcCoA may therefore serve as a self-resistance mechanism for the FAc-producing S. cattleya.", "In 1986, Sanada et al.

However, none of these putative homologues has a defined function. Two groups of thioesterases have been identified, thioesterases I and thioesterases II, based on differences in their amino acid sequence, protein folds, and catalytic mechanisms. Type I thioesterases have evolved within the \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold superfamily and are usually present as a product-releasing domain of multidomain proteins, such as type I fatty acid synthases, polyketide synthases, and nonribosomal peptide synthases. Type I thioesterases use serine or cysteine as the catalytic residue (10, 11). Type II thioesterases are discrete proteins associated with activities of hydrolyzing short- or medium-chain acyl-CoAs and exist either as a homodimer of a single hot dog fold (12) or as a monomer comprising a duplicated hot dog fold (13). It has been shown that the active sites of type II thioesterase enzymes contain either a glutamate or an aspartate residue acting as a general base or nucleophile responsible for the catalytic function (14, 15), although the precise catalytic mechanism has remained controversial. FlK, a discrete protein catalyzing hydrolysis of a short-chain acyl-CoA (fluoroacetyl CoA), apparently belongs to the type II thioesterase family and is therefore expected to have a carboxylic side chain at the active site. Protein sequence alignment analysis has revealed that nine amino acid residues in FlK (Gly8, Thr42, Glu50, Leu61, Gly69, His76, Ala78, Gly83, and Gly116) are all conserved in homologues that have a similar protein size to FlK (ranging from 127 to 180 amino acids). The presence of Thr42 and His76 together with Glu50 among the conserved residues led us to speculate that FlK may employ a variation of the classical catalytic triad-type mechanism with Thr42 (instead of a Ser or a Cys), His76, and Glu50 (instead of an Asp). His76 would then serve as a base to deprotonate Thr42. The deprotonated Thr42-O\u03b31 is proposed to act as a nucleophile attacking the fluoroacetyl carbonyl carbon of FAcCoA to initiate the hydrolysis reaction and the carboxylic side chain of Glu50 to neutralize the charge developed on the His76 side chain during the transition state of the reaction by hydrogen bonding with the imidazole nitrogen of His76 (7). Although a hydroxyl derived from threonine rather than from a serine residue has been found to act as the catalytic nucleophile in some proteinases, including the individual activities of the proteosome (16), to the best of our knowledge, no functionally characterized thioesterase has been reported to use threonine in this way.", "FlK is homologous to many predicted thioesterases and hypothetical proteins according to protein-protein BLAST searches against a non-redundant protein sequence data base (7).

Not surprisingly, T42SFlK is still able to hydrolyze FAcCoA with a kcat/Km value of 27.3 mm\u22121 s\u22121, which is about 19 times higher than that for WtFlK (1.47 mm\u22121 s\u22121), and a relatively smaller Km value (15 \u03bcm, 50% lower than that for WtFlK (30 \u03bcm)). It is noteworthy that T42SFlK activity was inhibited at a substrate concentration above 12 \u03bcm. These results suggest that the Ser42-O\u03b3 in T42SFlK is able to carry out the nucleophilic attack and that the absence of the Thr42-C\u03b3 in the T42S mutant may have led to decreased ability to ensure correct substrate binding, resulting in the substrate inhibition.

The hot dog fold was first observed for the structure of \u03b2-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydratase (12). A diverse range of enzymes with distinct catalytic activities has been found to have this fold. Thioesterases are important members of the hot dog superfamily and include 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases from Pseudomonas sp. CBS-3 (29) and from Arthrobacter sp. SU (30), Escherichia coli thioesterases II (13), and acyl-CoA thioesterases YciA from Hemophilus influenzae (HI0827) (31). Despite the conserved hot dog fold, these thioesterases share a very low degree of identity at amino acid sequence level. The FlK asymmetric unit contains a dimer with pseudosymmetry about a 2-fold axis as observed previously in the structure of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Pseudomonas sp. (29). and (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase from Aeromonas caviae (32). Most other thioesterases with the hot dog fold form tetramers, although hexameric structures have also been observed (31, 33). The main contacts between the two protomers in the FlK dimer are through strand 2 (residues 70\u201376) of the two protomers. The \u03b2-strands of the two protomers form together a 10-strand \u03b2-sheet with the putative active site at the interface between the protomers. A disulfide bond formed by their respective Cys73 residues covalently connects the two subunits. Wrapping around the disulfide bond are the Ile72 and the Val74 from both protomers with their side chains within hydrophobic interaction distance of each other. The C\u03b32 of the putative catalytic Thr42 also makes a hydrophobic contact with Ile72-C\u03b32 of the partner protomer. All of these interactions contribute to bringing the two protomers together. Furthermore, there are two salt bridges formed between the two protomers; the Lys21-N\u03b6 interacts with the Glu29-O\u03f52, and Lys135-N\u03b6 interacts with the carboxyl O\u03b42 groups of Asp111 and Asp108 in the partner protomer. Hydrogen bonds formed by Ser30-O\u03b3 and Glu32-O\u03f51 with Trp51-N\u03f51, Gly43-N with Glu50-O\u03f52 through a water molecule, and Tyr27-OH with Phe44-O also serve to stabilize the FlK dimer. The contact area between two protomers is \u223c1750 \u212b2, corresponding to 30% of the accessible surface area of each protomer, suggesting strong interactions between them. These observations have led us to assume that the minimal active unit of FlK is a dimer.", "The protomer of FlK has a hot dog fold that comprises a five-strand antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (the bun) wrapping around a central \u03b1-helix (the sausage) (Fig. 1A).

When FAcCoA concentration was higher than 12 \u03bcm, however, excess-substrate inhibition (38) was observed for the mutant. In other words, high concentrations of FAcCoA inhibited the activity of T42SFlK. We speculate that the absence of the Thr42-C\u03b3 in T42SFlK may have created more space, allowing an easier access of substrate to the active site, especially at low substrate concentrations, giving rise to the lower Km value and the higher turnover of T42SFlK reaction as compared with WtFlK activity. However, the same mutation also increased protein flexibility, as shown by the double confirmations of the active site residues in some of the protomers of the mutant (Fig. 6). The enzyme-substrate complex formed between these abnormal active sites and substrate could be non-productive. At high substrate concentrations, the chance of non-productive enzyme-substrate complex formation increases when more and more normal active sites are occupied by FAcCoA.
