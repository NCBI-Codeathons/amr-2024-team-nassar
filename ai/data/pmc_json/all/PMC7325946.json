Driven by the issue of the never-stopping evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance, research on GPA biosynthesis and resistance is developing fast in modern \u201cpost-genomic\u201d era. It is today widely accepted that resistance mechanisms emerging in pathogens have been acquired from the soil-dwelling antibiotic-producing actinomycetes, which use them to avoid suicide during production, rather than being orchestrated de novo by pathogen bacteria upon continued treatment. Actually, more and more genomes of GPA producers are being unraveled, carrying a broad collection of differently arranged GPA resistance (named van) genes. In the producer actinomycetes, van genes are generally associated with the antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) deputed to GPA biosynthesis, being probably transferred/arranged together, favoring a possible co-regulation between antibiotic production and self-resistance. GPA BGC-associated van genes have been also found mining public databases of bacterial genomic and metagenomic sequences. Interestingly, some BGCs for antibiotics, seemingly unrelated to GPAs (e.g., feglymycin), carry van gene homologues. Herein, we would like to cover the recent advances on the distribution of GPA resistance genes in genomic and metagenomics datasets related to GPA potential/proved producer microorganisms. A thorough understanding of GPA resistance in the producing microorganisms may prove useful in the future surveillance of emerging mechanisms of resistance to this clinically relevant antibiotic class.", "Gpa Mode of Action and Resistance Genes in Gram-Positive Pathogens", "Gpa Mode of Action and Resistance Genes in Gram-Positive Pathogens", "According to a recent report (WHO, 2017), drug-resistant infections will kill more people than cancer in just over three decades: by 2050, 10 million people are going to die every year due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Consequently, it is mandatory to stimulate discovery and development of novel antibiotics to counteract AMR (O\u2019Neill, 2016). Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are frequently used to treat life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., and Clostridium difficile (for a review on their discovery and development, see Marcone et al., 2018; on their antimicrobial activity and clinical use, Zeng et al., 2016). GPAs inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria by binding to d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) dipeptide terminus of peptidoglycan (PG) precursors, sequestering the substrate from transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions in the late extracellular stages of PG cross-linking. Thus, GPA action ultimately results in destabilizing cell wall integrity, causing bacterial cell death (Perkins and Nieto, 1974). Gram-negative microorganisms are intrinsically resistant to GPAs, because of their outer membrane, which prevents these molecules entering into the periplasm. In Gram-positive bacteria, the onset of vancomycin resistance was long-delayed in comparison to other antibiotic classes. The first vancomycin-resistant clinical isolate \u2013 an Enterococcus faecium strain \u2013 was reported in 1987, more than 30 years after the clinical introduction of vancomycin (Leclercq et al., 1988, Miller et al., 2016). Unfortunately, today a vast majority of E. faecium isolates harbor vancomycin resistance genes (van) (Vehreschild et al., 2019). The first vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolate was reported in 2002 as a result of horizontal gene transfer from resistant enterococci (Bartley, 2002; Weigel et al., 2003); nowadays, 52 VRSA strains have been described worldwide (Cong et al., 2020).", "According to a recent report (WHO, 2017), drug-resistant infections will kill more people than cancer in just over three decades: by 2050, 10 million people are going to die every year due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Gram-positive pathogens escape GPA action by reprogramming PG precursor biosynthesis, replacing the terminal d-Ala with d-lactate (d-Ala-d-Lac) or d-serine (d-Ala-d-Ser), thus reducing the affinity for cellular targets (Arthur et al., 1992, 1996; Courvalin, 2006). In enterococci, many different GPA-resistant phenotypes have been described according to their van gene operon organization (for a review, see Binda et al., 2014): in vanA, vanB, vanD, and vanM the key ligase determines the replacement of the terminus d-Ala with d-Lac, whereas in vanC, vanE, vanG, vanL, and vanN\nd-Ala. The d-Ala-d-Lac-type operons are located either on plasmids or on chromosomes, whereas the d-Ala-d-Ser-type ones are exclusively on the bacterial chromosome, except the case of vanN found on a plasmid in E. faecium. Operon expression could be inducible by GPAs (vanA, vanB, vanG, vanE, vanL, and vanM) or constitutive (vanC, vanD, and vanN) (Reynolds and Courvalin, 2005; Depardieu et al., 2007; Binda et al., 2014). The most clinically relevant manifestation of GPA resistance occurs in VanA enterococci and staphylococci, and in VanB enterococci. The first group is highly resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, whereas the second group only to vancomycin. In both of them, resistance is mediated by the GPA-induced expression of the transposone-located vanHAX gene operon under the transcriptional control of the VanR/VanS two-component system (TCS). VanS is a membrane-associated sensor that in VanA bacteria is activated by the presence of either vancomycin or teicoplanin, whereas in VanB it is activated only by vancomycin. Consequently, VanB enterococci are sensitive to teicoplanin (Arthur et al., 1997, 1999; Arthur and Quintiliani, 2001). Activated VanS transfers a phosphoryl group to VanR, which is the response regulator that controls the co-transcription of the vanH, vanA, vanX, and vanY genes (Wright et al., 1993; Arthur et al., 1997, 1999; Arthur and Quintilliani, 2001). VanH is a dehydrogenase that reduces pyruvate to d-lactate; VanA is the key ligase that catalyzes the formation of the d-Ala-d-Lac resistant depsipeptide (Bugg et al., 1991; Arthur et al., 1992); VanX is a d,d-dipeptidase, which removes the intracellular pool of d-Ala-d-Ala produced by the native enterococcal ligase, ensuring that d-Ala-d-Lac is incorporated into PG precursors (Reynolds et al., 1994; Wu et al., 1995); and finally VanY has an ancillary role as a d,d-carboxypeptidase cleaving the last d-Ala from the residual pentapeptide PG precursors terminating in d-Ala-d-Ala (Arthur et al., 1998). Among the d-Ala-d-Ser-type operons, the better investigated was the vanC. It encodes for a racemase (VanT) that converts l-Ser to d-Ser, a ligase (VanC) that synthesizes d-Ala-d-Ser, and a bi-functional d,d-dipeptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase (VanXYc) that cleaves the residual pools of d-Ala-d-Ala (Billot-Klein et al., 1994; Reynolds and Courvalin, 2005). In VanC phenotype, the TCS VanRcSc is located downstream the operon, but the resistance is constitutive due to mutations in the sensor VanSc (Healy et al., 2000; Hong et al., 2008; Koteva et al., 2010). VanC enterococci are intrinsically resistant to low levels of vancomycin, although they remain sensitive to teicoplanin.", "The GPA resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens were intensively studied starting from the pioneering work published in the 1990s (Arthur et al., 1992, 1996).

A novel vancomycin vanF operon (vanYFZFHFFXF) was described in Paenibacillus popilliae, an environmental bacteria used as biopesticide to counteract beetle larvae that caused milky disease in Japan (Patel et al., 2000; Ahmed and Baptiste, 2018). The dissemination of GPA resistance more recently reached zoonotic pathogens such as the emergent Streptococcus suis, where the low level of vancomycin-resistance is due to the presence of a vanG-like operon (Huang et al., 2018). Herein, we focus our attention on van genes distribution and function in the GPA-producing actinomycetes, which are considered the putative primary source of the variety of GPA-resistant determinants occurring in environmental bacteria and pathogens (Marshall et al., 1998; Beltrametti et al., 2007; Marcone et al., 2010, 2014; Sch\u00e4berle et al., 2011).", "Additional variants of these van gene operons were found in other Gram-positive pathogens including Listeria spp., streptococci, clostridia (Biavasco et al., 1996; Poyart et al., 1997; Peltier et al., 2013), and also in nonpathogenic Gram-positives, including Bacillus circulans, Oerskovia spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Streptomyces coelicolor (Power et al., 1995; Fontana et al., 1997; Hong et al., 2004).

Deletion of vanHAbAAbXAb genes makes Am. balhimycina significantly more sensitive to its own product, decreasing its MIC from 5 to 0.25 mg/ml, and causing an earlier expression of the BGC-situated vanYAb (Frasch et al., 2015). However, vanYAb itself does not play a decisive role in GPA-resistance since its deletion did not alter the GPA resistance phenotype (Frasch et al., 2015).

The residual GPA resistance in these mutants is probably due to an accessory Ddl1Ab, a putative d-Ala-d-Lac ligase encoded in the genome of Am. balhimycina, which shares 72% of amino acid sequence identity with VanAAb (Frasch et al., 2015). Ddl1Ab might add d-Lac to the tetrapeptide PG precursors generated by the d,d-carboxypetidase VanYAb (although the presence of some other d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidases encoded in the genome cannot be completely ruled out considering the resistant phenotype of the \u0394vanYAb mutant). In the absence of VanHAb, d-Lac for this reaction is probably obtained from the primary metabolic pool.

VanYn is a d,d-carboxypeptidase that cleaves the last d-Ala from pentapeptide PG precursors generating tetrapeptides, drastically reducing GPA affinity for cellular targets (Binda et al., 2012).

Direct VanYn carboxypeptidase activity measurement in N. gerenzanensis growing with the addition of different GPAs, unambiguously showed that VanYn activity is induced by vancomycin, teicoplanin, and A40926 (Binda et al., 2018). vanRS homologues \u2013 dbv6 and dbv22 \u2013 are present in the dbv BGC, but the knockout of dbv6 did not exert any influence on A40926 production and growth of N. gerenzanensis (Lo Grasso et al., 2015). Unfortunately, the GPA resistance phenotype of this mutant was not described. On the other side, transcriptional analysis of dbv genes indicated that the expression of dbv5-6-7 and dbv23-22 operons is rather constitutive (Alduina et al., 2007). Although the presence of other GPA-sensitive TCS beyond the borders of A40926 BGC cannot be ruled out, role of Dbv6 and Dbv22 in N. gerenzanensis A40926 self-resistance merits further investigations.", "In N. gerenzanensis producing the teicoplanin-like A40926, vanHAX orthologues were not found neither in the BGC nor in the genome (D\u2019Argenio et al., 2016). The only known mechanism of resistance relies on the action of VanYn, whose coding gene (dbv7) is within the dbv BGC (Figure 2C) and whose knockout abolishes the resistance phenotype (Marcone et al., 2010, 2014; Figure 2C). VanYn is a d,d-carboxypeptidase that cleaves the last d-Ala from pentapeptide PG precursors generating tetrapeptides, drastically reducing GPA affinity for cellular targets (Binda et al., 2012). A l,d-transpeptidase (Ldt) then uses the tetrapeptide acyl donors supplied by VanYn to synthetize the mature cell wall (Hugonnet et al., 2014). The role of this protein and its features that assimilate/distinguish it from enterococcal VanY and from VanYAb were investigated in detail (Marcone et al., 2010, 2014; Binda et al., 2012, 2013).

The BGC-located vanHStAStXSt operon was shown to be crucial for A47934 resistance and vanASt knockout made S. toyocaensis completely sensitive to A47934 (Pootoolal et al., 2002). At the same time, vanHAX-genes from the vancomycin producer Am. orientalis C329.2 were able to restore A47934 resistance phenotype in the knocked-out mutant (Pootoolal et al., 2002). Functions of VanRSt and VanSSt (both present in the A47934 BGC, Figures 1, 2D) were also studied in detail, showing that VanSSt has a remarkable specificity for A47934 and it is unable to sense teicoplanin or vancomycin (Koteva et al., 2010; Novotna et al., 2016). Moreover, also the interaction between VanRSt and VanSSt was found to be very specific, since VanRSt could not be phosphorylated by a non-cognate sensor-histidine kinase (Novotna et al., 2016). The roles (if there are any) of staP and staO (orthologues of S. coelicolor vanK and vanJ) in S. toyocaensis A47934 self-resistance were not investigated, thus the importance of these auxiliary resistance genes remains to be proved.", "Finally, S. toyocaensis possesses, perhaps, the most straightforward resistance mechanism among all the investigated GPA producers (Figure 2D), reminding the situation in S. coelicolor (Hong et al., 2004).

According to these authors, vanA had likely originated within Amycolatopsis genus, whereas vanH, vanX, and vanRS within Actinoplanes; and vanY probably originated within genus Nonomuraea and it was then distributed among GPA BGCs by multiple transfer events. Combination of these genes in pathogens is today determining the urgent clinical need for new drugs to combat multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens.", "Soil GPA producers are considered the putative source of GPA resistance determinants, which might had been recruited and differently combined in pathogens.
