["Interaction of Salinispora tropica with phytoplankton. Marine phototrophs release photosynthate that triggers the biosynthesis of novel cryptic metabolites in S.\u00a0tropica. S.\u00a0tropica produces an unknown antimicrobial molecule that kills phytoplankton.", "Summary", "Filamentous members of the phylum Actinobacteria are a remarkable source of natural products with pharmaceutical potential. The discovery of novel molecules from these organisms is, however, hindered because most of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding these secondary metabolites are cryptic or silent and are referred to as orphan BGCs. While co\u2010culture has proven to be a promising approach to unlock the biosynthetic potential of many microorganisms by activating the expression of these orphan BGCs, it still remains an underexplored technique. The marine actinobacterium Salinispora tropica, for instance, produces valuable compounds such as the anti\u2010cancer molecule salinosporamide but half of its putative BGCs are still orphan. Although previous studies have used marine heterotrophs to induce orphan BGCs in Salinispora, its co\u2010culture with marine phototrophs has yet to be investigated. Following the observation of an antimicrobial activity against a range of phytoplankton by S.\u00a0tropica, we here report that the photosynthate released by photosynthetic primary producers influences its biosynthetic capacities with production of cryptic molecules and the activation of orphan BGCs. Our work, using an approach combining metabolomics and proteomics, pioneers the use of phototrophs as a promising strategy to accelerate the discovery of novel natural products from marine actinobacteria.", "Microbial Biotechnology (2021) 14(1), 291\u2013306", "Funding Information A.C. was supported by an MIBTP PhD scholarship (BB/M01116X/1) and D.S. by a NERC CENTA DTP studentship (NE/L002493/1).

Identification of novel secondary metabolites from this extensively studied phylum has, however, stalled over the last few decades as a result of the recurring rediscovery of already known compounds. This has led in recent years to a thriving interest for the study of new microorganisms, with the rational that ecologically distinct microorganisms produce equally distinct secondary metabolites (Molinski et\nal., 2009; Wilson and Brimble, 2009; Bull and Goodfellow, 2019). For instance, the heterotrophic bacteria Salinispora drew particular attention when discovered, as it was the first obligate marine actinomycete described (Jensen et al., 1991; Mincer et al., 2002; Jensen and Mafnas, 2006) and has since proven to be an important source of new natural products for the pharmaceutical industry (Feling et al., 2003; Maldonado et al., 2005; Buchanan et al., 2005; Asolkar et al., 2010). Despite the increasing number of novel strains identified with promising biosynthetic capacities, many hurdles in natural product discovery remain. Most of these microbial secondary metabolites are encoded by groups of colocalized genes, called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are now more easily identified because of the improvement in sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools (Medema et al., 2011). The majority of these discovered BGCs, however, have yet to be linked to their products and are called orphan BGCs. They are generally considered to be either silent \u2010 because of a low level of expression or inactivation of their biosynthetic genes \u2010 or the metabolites they produce are cryptic \u2010 difficult to detect and isolate (Reen et al., 2015; Rutledge and Challis, 2015). The observation of numerous orphan BGCs in genome\u2010sequenced microorganisms has resulted in a growing interest in developing biological or chemical means to activate such clusters (Abdelmohsen et al., 2015; Onaka, 2017). One of the simplest and most efficient methods described in the literature relies on co\u2010cultivation of different microbes to elicit novel natural product biosynthesis (Slattery et al., 2001; Bertrand et al., 2014; Wakefield et al., 2017).", "Soil actinomycetes are a rich source of drug\u2010like natural products, to which we owe up to 70% of all microbial antibiotics used today (B\u00e9rdy, 2012).

MS/MS analyses confirmed that both molecules 4 and 6 had an identical molecular fragment (i.e. m/z 276.1600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0001 [M\u00a0+\u00a0H]+, with the empirical chemical formula C16H22NO3), indicating that the two molecules share a core backbone (Table\u00a02; Fig.\u00a0S6, S7). Similarly, molecule 7 had the same chemical formula as 6 but with the addition of a methyl group (14.0155\u00a0Da mass difference; Table\u00a02). Finally, MS/MS fragmentation of the three molecules 4, 6 and 7 resulted in the related molecular fragments m/z 171.088, 142.0979 and 156.1135, respectively, which showed differences in masses and empirical formulae identical to that observed between their corresponding parent ions (Table\u00a02; Fig.\u00a0S6, S7). Molecule 3 did not share an obvious link to any other metabolites and, therefore, was considered a new biosynthesized product of S.tropica (Table\u00a02). Most interestingly, the search for compounds with the same molecular formulae as 3, 4, 6 or 7 in multiple databases (e.g. Reaxys, SciFinder, Dictionary of NP) returned no known natural product, suggesting that they are novel compounds.

Virtually all organisms across the tree of life have a system for targeted proteolysis for protein turnover, with most bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts relying on a ClpP\u2010type proteasome while eukaryotes, archaea and some actinobacteria typically possess the homologous 20S proteasome structure (Becker and Darwin, 2016; Snoberger et al., 2017).
