Biosynthesis is performed by polyketide synthases (PKSs), and the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a small acidic protein, that transports the growing polyketide chain and is essential for activity. Here we report the synthesis of two aromatic probes and a linear octaketide mimic that have been tethered to actinorhodin ACP. These experiments were aimed at probing the ACP's capacity to sequester a non-polar versus a phenolic aromatic ring (that more closely mimics a polyketide intermediate) as well as investigations with extended polyketide chain surrogates. The binding of these mimics has been assessed using high-resolution solution NMR studies and high-resolution structure determination. These results reveal that surprisingly a PKS ACP is able to bind and sequester a bulky non-polar substrate containing an aromatic ring in a fatty acid type binding mode, but the introduction of even a small degree of polarity favours a markedly different association at a surface site that is distinct from that employed by fatty acid ACPs.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Actinorhodin 1 (Fig. 1) produced by the archetype type II polyketide synthase from Streptomyces coelicolor, is an aromatic polyketide antibiotic that has served as a paradigm for the genetic, mechanistic and structural elucidation of aromatic polyketide biosynthesis.1\u20134 It is produced by a type II polyketide synthase, derived from a cluster of genes (23 in total) coding for each of the biosynthetic, self-resistance and export proteins associated with the actinorhodin pathway. Both studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that proteins encoded by actI (KS/CLF and ACP) form a minimal PKS5 that catalyses the generation of the full length polyketide chain 1 (Fig. 1). Successive reductive (actIII, KR), cyclisation/aromatisation (actVII, ARO/CYC) and further tailoring steps then complete the biosynthesis. Whereas these latter tailoring steps follow a simpler enzyme\u2013substrate model, the initial chain elongation steps involve precisely seven iterative decarboxylative condensations of seven malonate units with a malonate derived acetate unit primer to give the desired chain length.", "Actinorhodin 1 (Fig. 1) produced by the archetype type II polyketide synthase from Streptomyces coelicolor, is an aromatic polyketide antibiotic that has served as a paradigm for the genetic, mechanistic and structural elucidation of aromatic polyketide biosynthesis.1\u20134 It is produced by a type II polyketide synthase, derived from a cluster of genes (23 in total) coding for each of the biosynthetic, self-resistance and export proteins associated with the actinorhodin pathway.

Very little is actually known about the mechanism by which a linear polyketide is successfully stabilised and transferred from the KS/CLF to the next enzyme in the sequence, actIII KR.

We observed CSPs relative to holo-ACP for both analogues although the magnitude of the changes was reduced compared to the CSPs observed with 5-phenyl-3-oxo-pentyl ACP. This indicated that that sequestration within the cavity of the ACP and concomitant conformational changes in the protein were reduced, suggestive of a transient, possibly surface interaction with the protein. In fact a second conformation was observed for 3,7-dioxo-octyl ACP 20 (Fig. 5A) with chemical shifts of the minor form suggestive of shallow binding similar to that observed in butyryl act ACP11. Based on these observations we calculated the three-dimensional structure of 3,7-dioxo-octyl ACP by solution state NMR (Fig. 5B, see ESI Table S2\u2020). This structure corresponded to the major conformer (with the smallest CSPs) as the minor conformations were not in sufficient concentrations for NOEs to be observed. For the major conformer we observed numerous NOEs within the 4\u2032-PP side-arm (methylenes H6\u2032\u2032 and H9\u2032\u2032, see ESI Fig. S2\u2020) which were not observed in holo-ACP but were also detected when the ACP was previously derivatised with shorter non-polar side-chains.11 In addition 4\u2032-PP \u2013 protein NOEs were observed from Leu 43 and Met 46.

This association is likely to be stronger in the two other sub-states that show greater protein CSPs and suggest the ACP is sensitised to the polar cargo and confers modest sequestration of the substrate, most likely by binding weakly along the charged groove between helices two and three (at the surface, rather than buried). Weak NOEs were observed previously from a short triketide analogue and emodic acid,13 a surrogate for a more highly elaborated actinorhodin scaffold, to residues in helix two in act ACP.

Why is fatty acid sequestration important in fatty acid biosynthesis? The binding cavity employed by type II FAS ACPs offers some protection from thioester hydrolysis which has been shown to increase in rate as the fatty acid exceeds \u223c14 carbons in length and outgrows the capacity of the ACP cavity although in vitro C18-ACP preparations of these ACPs are stable for many days.20 Burial of the fatty acid requires \u2018chain-flipping\u2019 of the fatty acid from the dynamic ACP to the more static fatty acid synthase enzymes (KS, KR, DH and ER) where neither association can be too stable as it would hinder the next flip.21 By comparison, a model for the initial steps of polyketide biosynthesis involves the stabilisation of the polyketide by the catalytic KS/CLF during chain elongation to a precisely controlled chain length.22 The active site is tube-like and located at the interface of the two domains.23 The elongated geometry of the site may assist in preventing unwanted spontaneous cyclisations and the amphipathic nature of this region may complement the nascent polyketide with suitable stabilising interactions, e.g. select ketide groups of the intermediate may be enolised to interact with two backbone carbonyls and a carboxylate side chain present in the amphipathic tunnel. In addition, a water molecule in the active tunnel may also play a role in stabilising the polyketide intermediate by donating a hydrogen bond to a ketone group. Once the mature polyketide has reached the correct length, a suitably strong interaction with the ACP might trigger dissociation with the ACP providing a suitably polar, but shallow cavity. The partial sequestration of the polyketide may be sufficient to act as a solvent shield during transit to the KR. Within the complex milieu of the bacterial cell, the KR may of course be associated with the KS/CLF as a non-covalent complex requiring minimal translocation.24 Our results taken together with related studies18 suggest that the ACP offers a degree of protection but in the absence of the next (i.e. KR) synthase component, the formation of SEK4b occurs, via an off-pathway C10\u2013C15 cyclisation. In the normal pathway, the correctly C7\u2013C12 cyclised product is then reduced to alcohol 2 by the KR and blockage of biosynthesis at this point leads to the formation of mutactin.25", "The work of our group and others18,19 now provides clear evidence that polyketide ACPs sequester their intermediates through a binding mode that is quite distinct from that employed in fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 6).

The association is strong enough to induce multiple conformers in the ACP when the polyketide chain is of sufficient length and contains polar atoms. These polar intermediates do not however induce the large cavity opening we observed when act ACP was derivatised with non-cognate fatty acids and the role, if any, of this potential internal hydrophobic pocket remains elusive. The observed association of the 4\u2032-PP chain with the ACP would still therefore require a degree of chain flipping involving dissociation from the ACP surface prior to insertion into the active site of the next synthase partner in the biosynthetic sequence. This may be more easily or rapidly achieved in the case of a surface associated polyketide intermediate versus a strongly bound fatty acid within a FAS ACP.", "It appears therefore that a polyketide ACP protects a more polar intermediate through an association at the surface of the protein between the cleft formed by helix two and three rather than deep burial of the non-polar chains observed in fatty acid synthesis.
