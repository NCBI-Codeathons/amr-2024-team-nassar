["Conspectus", "", "The genomic era has dramatically changed how we discover and investigate\nmicrobial biochemistry. In particular, the exponential expansion in\nthe number of sequenced microbial genomes provides investigators with\na vast wealth of sequence data to exploit for the discovery of biochemical\nfunctions and mechanisms, as well as novel enzymes and metabolites.\nIn contrast to early biochemical work, which was largely characterized\nby \u201cforward\u201d approaches that proceed from biomass to\nenzyme to gene, the availability of genome sequences enables the discovery\nof new microbial metabolic activities, enzymes, and metabolites by\n\u201creverse\u201d approaches that originate with genetic information\nor by approaches that incorporate features of both forward and reverse\nmethodologies. In the genomic era, the canonical organization of microbial\ngenomes into gene clusters presents a singular opportunity for the\nutilization of genomic data. Specifically, genomic context (information\ngleaned from the genes surrounding a gene of interest in the chromosome)\nis a powerful tool for chemical discovery in microbial systems because\nof the functional and/or physiological relationship that usually exists\nbetween genes found within a gene cluster. This means that the investigator\ncan use this inferred link to generate hypotheses about the functions\nof individual genes in the cluster or even the function of the entire\ncluster itself. Here, we discuss how analysis of genomic context in\ncombination with a mechanistic understanding of enzymes can facilitate\nnumerous facets of microbial biochemical research including the identification\nof biosynthetic gene clusters, the discovery of important and novel\nenzymes, the elucidation of natural product structures, and the identification\nof new metabolic pathways. We highlight work from our laboratory using\ngenomic context to discover and study biosynthetic pathways that produce\nnatural products, including the cylindrocyclophanes, nitrogen\u2013nitrogen\nbond-containing metabolites, and the gut microbial genotoxin colibactin.\nAlthough use of genomic context is most commonly associated with studies\nof natural product biosynthesis, we also show that it can be applied\nto the study of primary metabolism. We illustrate this with examples\nfrom our work studying the members of the glycyl radical enzyme superfamily\ninvolved in choline and 4-hydroxyproline degradation in the human\ngut. Looking forward, we envision increased opportunities to use such\ninformation, with the combination of biochemical knowledge and computational\ntools poised to fuel a new revolution in our ability to connect genes\nand their biochemical functions. In particular, we note a need for\nmethods that computationally formalize the functional association\nbetween genes when such associations are not obvious from manual gene\nannotations. Such tools will drastically augment the feasibility and\nscope of gene cluster analysis and accelerate the discovery of new\nmicrobial enzymes, metabolites, and metabolic processes.", "Special Issue", "Published as part of\nthe Accounts of Chemical Research special issue \u201cBacterial Multi-Drug Resistance\u201d.", "Key References", "Key References", "\u2022 NgT.
