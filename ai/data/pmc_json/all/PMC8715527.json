These interactions are essential for understanding anti-infective immunity as well as pathogenesis. In this study, the host-pathogen interaction was analyzed using a model of acute infection where channel catfish were infected with Yersinia ruckeri. The infected fish showed signs of body surface hyperemia as well as hyperemia and swelling in the trunk kidney. Double RNA sequencing was performed on trunk kidneys extracted from infected channel catfish and transcriptome data was compared with data from uninfected trunk kidneys. Results revealed that the host-pathogen interaction was dynamically regulated and that the host-pathogen transcriptome fluctuated during infection. More specifically, these data revealed that the expression levels of immune genes involved in Cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling and other immune-related pathways were significantly upregulated. Y. ruckeri mainly promote pathogenesis through the flagellum gene fliC in channel catfish. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package was used to reveal that the infection of catfish is closely related to metabolic pathways. This study contributes to the understanding of the host-pathogen interaction between channel catfish and Y. ruckeri, more specifically how catfish respond to infection through a transcriptional perspective and how this infection leads to enteric red mouth disease (ERM) in these fish.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Aquaculture is one of the most dynamic sectors in the global food system and has made significant contributions to the production of protein rich food consumed by humans (1). The global aquaculture industry has grown by 5% annually over the past 20 years (2, 3). However, more recently, the practice of aquaculture has encountered many challenges, one being disease outbreak caused by microbial pathogens (4). Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were introduced to China from the United States in 1984. After adapting to the environment in China, there was an explosive growth rate in the breeding yield and area. Channel catfish are a major component of freshwater fish culture in China. However, disease in these fish lead to a bottleneck restricting further growth of the channel catfish industry. The main pathogenic microorganisms infecting channel catfish include Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia ruckeri, Edwardsiella ictaluri and Streptococcus iniae, which have resulted in great economic loss for the aquaculture industry (4\u201310). Y. ruckeri is a gram-negative bacterium and the cause of enteric red mouth disease (ERM) in fish (11). ERM is a serious disease prevalent in aquaculture worldwide and is commonly observed in rainbow trout, sturgeon and channel catfish (12\u201316).", "Aquaculture is one of the most dynamic sectors in the global food system and has made significant contributions to the production of protein rich food consumed by humans (1).

During the early stage of infection, the pathogen may invade into the gills and gastrointestinal epitheliums. Later, the infection may enter the blood circulation system and infect the spleen and trunk kidney, accumulate in the lymphoid organs and finally destroy the immune system (17). Y. ruckeri is a facultative, intracellular pathogen that can survive in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. In fact, there is quite a bit more to understand about the physiology of Y. ruckeri since most research has been focused on single virulence factors, such as extracellular toxins, high affinity iron uptake systems and resistance to innate immune mechanisms (18\u201326). Liu et\u00a0al. identified that Toll/IL-1 receptors containing the proteins stir-1, stir-2 and stir-3 synergistically assisted the immune escape of Y. ruckeri SC09 (27, 28). This study also found that the virulence protein of Y. ruckeri TIR mediated immune escape by targeting the MyD88 receptor (29).

As the first line barrier, innate immune-related molecules and pathways are rapidly expressed. With more serious and progressed infection, channel catfish require fatty acid and amino acid metabolism to provide energy and proteins. Changes in tryptophan metabolism were also observed in many fish such as zebrafish, large yellow cordon, Atlantic salmon and abalone, indicating that tryptophan and its metabolites may play an important role in the immune system of aquatic animals (66\u201368).", "For pathogens that invade the host, flagella play a key role, including colonizing and invading the host, reaching the optimal host site, maintaining the infection site and spreading after infection (69\u201371). To date, flagella have been implicated in the virulence of many aquatic pathogenic bacteria, such as Y. ruckeri (46, 72), Edwardsiella tarda (73), and Vibrio anguillarum (74). In this study, the flagellar gene fliC was significantly upregulated from 6-24 hpi, indicating that it was involved in the infection process of Y. ruckeri (72). KEGG was significantly enriched in the two-component system of Y. ruckeri at 6-12 hpi. This indicates that the bacteria adapt to the state of the fish by sensing environmental changes, regulating the expression of survival and virulence factors and maintaining their own survival (23). At 24 hpi, the gene expression levels of the bacterial two-component system decreased, indicating that the pathogen adapted to the fish environment and the host developed symptoms and began to due. At the same time, the pathogen was significantly enriched in the sucrose of bacterial secretion system, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, one carbon pool by folate and other signaling pathways (75). These results indicated that the pathogen used its secretory system to escape and consume energy during the invasion process.", "For pathogens that invade the host, flagella play a key role, including colonizing and invading the host, reaching the optimal host site, maintaining the infection site and spreading after infection (69\u201371).

The turquoise module was considered to be the most important in the infection process, showing the dynamic process of the life-and-death struggle between the host and the pathogen, reflecting how the innate immunity of the host copes with pathogen invasion and how the pathogen achieves immune escape. In the interaction network diagram, 50 pathogenic genes were found to be associated with the host immune response. The pathogen mainly relied on SpaR and SpaP for immune escape through the type II secretion system, which has not been identified in previous studies (76, 77). The pathogen HlyB was up-regulated in the infection, indicating that the pathogen rely on hemolysin to cause harm\nin the host trunk kidney. The uvry regulatory gene and flagella transcriptional regulator flhd were also significantly down-regulated, consistent with previous studies that uvry gene mutations did not affect the survival rate of Y. ruckeri in fish (23), Therefore, the pathogen mainly depended on fliC flagellin for attachment and virulence. With progression of the infection, the expression of the multidrug resistant proteins mdtc and MDTA were seriously inhibited, suggesting that the drug resistance of the strains decreased.", "WGCNA was divided into 19 modules and the results showed that the relationship between the host and pathogen is very complex.

For the host, innate immunity is an important means to resist bacterial invasion and bacterial flagella is an important tool for infection used by the pathogen. WGCNA reveals the strong interaction and relationship between the host and pathogen genomes throughout the infection process, which is most closely related to metabolic activities.
