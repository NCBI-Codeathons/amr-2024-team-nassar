Acylation by addition of a leucine residue at the beta amine group of arginine side chain of demethylblasticidin S (DBS) has been proposed as a novel self-resistance to the cytotoxic biosynthetic intermediate. But the resultant product leucyldemethylblasticidin S (LDBS) has not been isolated as a metabolite, and LDBS synthetase activity remained to be demonstrated in S. griseochromogenes. In this study, we isolated LDBS in a BS heterologous producer S. lividans WJ2 upon the deletion of blsL, which encodes a S-Adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase. Purified BlsL efficiently methylated LDBS at the delta N of beta-arginine to generate the ultimate intermediate LBS, but nearly didn\u2019t methylate DBS to final product BS. Above experiments demonstrated that LDBS is indeed an intermediate in BS biosynthetic pathway, and acylation of beta-amino group of arginine side chain is prerequisite for efficient guanidine N-methylation in addition to being a self-resistance mechanism.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Blasticidin S (BS) was first isolated from the broth of Streptomyces griseochromogenes as an effective non-mercurial fungicide (Takeuchi et al., 1958). BS displayed wide-range antimicrobial spectrum, it exerts its biological activities by inhibiting protein translation through a unique mechanism by which it traps the deformed P-site tRNA and strongly suppresses peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis by release factors and peptide bond formation (Svidritskiy et al., 2013). As it\u2019s friendly to environment and not harmful to fish, blasticidin S was soon used on a large scale by foliar application in Asia to control rice blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae (Misato et al., 1958). Now it has been increasingly used as the selection reagent in mammalian transgenic studies (Kamakura et al., 1990; Freitas et al., 2002). Moreover, BS strongly inhibits the production of aflatoxin by fungus Aspergillus flavus that is toxic and highly carcinogenic (Yoshinari et al., 2013).", "Blasticidin S (BS) was first isolated from the broth of Streptomyces griseochromogenes as an effective non-mercurial fungicide (Takeuchi et al., 1958).

Unfortunately, studies on BS biosynthesis have proceeded slowly since the cloning of BS biosynthetic gene cluster as gene deletion in BS native producer S. griseochromogenes was never successful. In order to bypass the restriction barrier, we engrafted BS biosynthetic gene cluster onto the chromosome of S. lividans and generated a BS heterologous producer S. lividans WJ2 (Li et al., 2013), which here was used for in vivo study.", "Blasticidin S is consisted of a N-methyl-guanidine tail attached to a pyranose ring and bonded to a cytosine (\u014ctake et al., 1966), its core moiety cytosylglucuronic acid (CGA) is shared by mildiomycin, gougerotin, arginomycin (Fox et al., 1968; Harada et al., 1978; Argoudelis et al., 1987).

However, several steps and their catalyzed enzymes remain to be established. A most intriguing question regarding BS biosynthesis is BS maturation. Demethylblasticidin S (DBS) had been isolated as a minor metabolite in the broth of S. griseochromogenes, and was proposed as the penultimate metabolite for N-methylation to give the final BS. But in the presence of S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM), the CFE of S. griseochromogenes could only methylate DBS at a ratio of as low as 0.85%. In contrast, a derivative named AcDBS, with the beta amino group of guanidine acetylated, could be methylated to form AcBS at a ratio of 21% (Zhang et al., 2000). However, AcBS cannot be hydrolyzed by the CFE of S. griseochromogenes to form mature BS, therefore both DBS and AcDBS were excluded as the direct precursors for N-guanidine methylation. On the other hand, leucylblasticidin S (LBS) was sometimes isolated as an intermediate in the broth of S. griseochromogenes when the pH of the culture medium was kept below 4 (Seto et al., 1968), it was later isolated from Streptomyces sp. SCC 1785 (Cooper et al., 1988) and S. griseochromogenes under normal laboratory conditions (Zhang et al., 2000). Discovery of LBS as the metabolite implied that the real intermediate for N-methylation might be LDBS rather than DBS. Interestingly, chemically synthesized LDBS displayed 20-fold less inhibition activity against Bacillus circulans than DBS. Therefore, leucylation of DBS into LDBS was postulated to be a novel self-resistance mechanism to protect the host from the toxic biosynthetic intermediate. However, the intermediacy of LDBS in BS biosynthesis remains elusive because LDBS is rarely detected in the native producer S. griseochromogenes, and the attempts to demonstrate LDBS synthetase activity were not successful (Zhang et al., 2000).", "The putative BS biosynthetic pathway was proposed based on feeding experiments (Seto et al., 1968) and determination of metabolites (Prabhakaran et al., 1988; Guo and Gould, 1991; Gould and Zhang, 1995).

In view of present situation of BS biosynthesis, failure in isolation of LDBS and only accumulation of very minor of LBS in the broth of S. griseochromogenes are attributed to efficient excision of leucine group from above two metabolites by standalone PepN and its homologs (Yu et al., 2015).

Chemically synthesized LDBS showed decreased cytotoxicity by 20-folds compared to DBS, and thus leucylation of DBS was regarded as a novel self-resistance because of inactivation of an antibiotic with an amino acid (Zhang et al., 2000). This proposal was challenged by the failures both in isolations of intermediate LDBS and confirmation of LDBS synthetase activity in S. griseochromogenes. In view of present situation of BS biosynthesis, failure in isolation of LDBS and only accumulation of very minor of LBS in the broth of S. griseochromogenes are attributed to efficient excision of leucine group from above two metabolites by standalone PepN and its homologs (Yu et al., 2015). Different from in the BS native producer, LBS is often presented as the dominant metabolite in a heterologous producer S. lividans WJ2, particularly when the pH of broth was kept below 6, this case usually occurred when the medium is contaminated in later phase of fermentation by acid-producing bacteria, such as E. coli. Also, LDBS could also be detected in WJ2, its production was apparently enhanced when the methyltransferase gene blsL was deleted (Figure 2). Furthermore, purified BlsL in vitro can effectively catalyze LDBS into LBS in the presence of SAM, but not methylate DBS, thus demonstrating the intermediacy of LDBS in BS biosynthesis.", "Acylation of DBS at the beta-amine including AcDBS as well as LDBS significantly increased the methylation efficiency by BlsL S. griseochromogenes, implying that acylation of beta-amine might change the distribution of the charge or provide better fit each other between BlsL and the substrate either in recognition or catalysis. This work provided a solid base for demonstration of last four biosynthesis steps in BS biosynthesis.", "Acylation of DBS at the beta-amine including AcDBS as well as LDBS significantly increased the methylation efficiency by BlsL S. griseochromogenes, implying that acylation of beta-amine might change the distribution of the charge or provide better fit each other between BlsL and the substrate either in recognition or catalysis.
