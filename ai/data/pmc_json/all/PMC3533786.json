The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is found in many bacterial species and is used to target either eukaryotic cells or competitor bacteria. However, T6SS-secreted proteins have proven surprisingly elusive. Here, we identified two secreted substrates of the antibacterial T6SS from the opportunistic human pathogen, Serratia marcescens. Ssp1 and Ssp2, both encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, were confirmed as antibacterial toxins delivered by the T6SS. Four related proteins encoded around the Ssp proteins (\u2018Rap\u2019 proteins) included two specifically conferring self-resistance (\u2018immunity\u2019) against T6SS-dependent Ssp1 or Ssp2 toxicity. Biochemical characterization revealed specific, tight binding between cognate Ssp\u2013Rap pairs, forming complexes of 2:2 stoichiometry. The atomic structures of two Rap proteins were solved, revealing a novel helical fold, dependent on a structural disulphide bond, a structural feature consistent with their functional localization. Homologues of the Serratia Ssp and Rap proteins are found encoded together within other T6SS gene clusters, thus they represent founder members of new families of T6SS-secreted and cognate immunity proteins. We suggest that Ssp proteins are the original substrates of the S. marcescens T6SS, before horizontal acquisition of other T6SS-secreted toxins. Molecular insight has been provided into how pathogens utilize antibacterial T6SSs to overcome competitors and succeed in polymicrobial niches.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Protein secretion systems and their substrates are central to bacterial virulence and interaction with other organisms (Gerlach and Hensel, 2007). Six different secretion systems (Types I\u2013VI) are used by Gram-negative bacteria to transport specific proteins to the exterior of the bacterial cell or further inject them into target cells. The most recently described of these is the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) (Filloux et al., 2008). T6SSs are complex multi-protein assemblies that span both bacterial membranes and inject effector proteins directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into target cells (Bonemann et al., 2010; Cascales and Cambillau, 2012). T6SSs are encoded by large, variable gene clusters that contain 13 \u2018core\u2019 essential components, believed to make up the basic secretion apparatus. Two core proteins, Hcp and VgrG, form the extracellular part of the secretion machinery and depend on a functional T6SS apparatus for their movement to the outside of the bacterial cell (indeed, the presence of Hcp in the secreted fraction has provided a useful assay for basic T6SS assembly and activity; Pukatzki et al., 2009). Hcp and VgrG most likely form a needle-like membrane-puncturing device related to the bacteriophage tail spike; this structure is believed to be pushed to the outside of the secreting cell and likely into target cells upon contraction of a tail sheath-like structure (Leiman et al., 2009; Bonemann et al., 2010; Basler et al., 2012). T6SSs occur in many pathogenic bacteria and are implicated in virulence in important pathogens, including Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Zheng and Leung, 2007; Cascales, 2008; Jani and Cotter, 2010; de Pace et al., 2010; Burtnick et al., 2011; Rosales-Reyes et al., 2012). In several cases, the action of such \u2018anti-eukaryotic\u2019 T6SSs appears to result in disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (Pukatzki et al., 2007; Aubert et al., 2008; Suarez et al., 2010). Exciting recent work has demonstrated that some T6SSs are used to target other bacteria, efficiently killing or inhibiting competitors. This has been reported for T6SSs in P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia thailandensis, V. cholerae and Serratia marcescens (Hood et al., 2010; MacIntyre et al., 2010; Schwarz et al., 2010; Murdoch et al., 2011). The discovery that certain T6SSs may be \u2018antibacterial\u2019 rather than, or in addition to, \u2018anti-eukaryotic\u2019 is highly relevant to the competitive fitness and success of pathogens, particularly within polymicrobial infection sites. Such a system could provide the pathogen with a large competitive advantage against other bacteria in the host or the environment, enabling it to proliferate and mount a successful infection.", "Protein secretion systems and their substrates are central to bacterial virulence and interaction with other organisms (Gerlach and Hensel, 2007).

A special case of T6-secreted effector is the class of \u2018evolved\u2019 VgrG proteins found in a minority of T6SSs which have extra C-terminal effector domains, e.g. the actin cross-linking domain of V. cholerae VgrG1 that is translocated into mammalian cells (Pukatzki et al., 2007; Jani and Cotter, 2010). However, excluding the structural components VgrG and Hcp, very few \u2018true\u2019 T6SS-secreted proteins have been confirmed so far. Best characterized are three effector proteins, antibacterial toxins named Tse1\u20133, secreted by the antibacterial HSI-1 T6SS of P. aeruginosa. Tse1 and 3 are peptidoglycan hydrolases that attack the cell wall of target bacteria (Hood et al., 2010; Russell et al., 2011). Tse2 is active in the cytoplasm of target cells, where it efficiently induces quiescence (Li et al., 2012).

In order to determine whether the cluster did indeed contain self-resistance determinants (such as specific immunity proteins analogous to the Tsi proteins), we generated a mutant lacking the entire T6SS gene cluster (\u0394T6SS) and examined whether it was fully resistant to the T6SS of the wild type strain. Co-culture of two target strains, wild type Db10 and the \u0394T6SS mutant, each with a wild type and a \u0394clpV attacker, showed that the \u0394T6SS mutant had lost resistance to T6SS-mediated inhibition or killing by the wild type strain (Fig. 1A, left). Recovery of \u0394T6SS was decreased 100-fold when it was co-cultured with the wild type strain, compared with when the wild type strain was co-cultured with itself.

The ATPase ClpV is one of the core, structural components of the T6SS and we have shown previously that it is essential for Hcp secretion and T6-mediated antibacterial killing activity of S. marcescens Db10 (Murdoch et al., 2011). To simplify the analysis of multiple mutants, we defined the \u2018resistance index\u2019 of a strain as the difference between recovery when co-cultured with the wild type strain and recovery when co-cultured with the \u0394clpV mutant, specifically log2[recovery vs. wild type/recovery vs. \u0394clpV]. The wild type or other resistant strain will show no difference and have a resistance index of 0.

Complex formation was demonstrated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. All Rap proteins were dimeric in solution, whereas Ssp1 and Ssp2 were monomeric (Fig. 4A and B). When equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a were mixed, all of the protein was detected in a higher molecular weight complex (Fig. 4A) and the same was also observed on mixing Ssp2 and Rap2a (Fig. 4A).

As mixing equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a resulted in detection of only the complexed species, with no unbound form of either protein detectable, this implied a 1:1 molar complex. The 1:1 molar stoichiometry of the Rap1a\u2013Ssp1 complex was confirmed by quantitative analysis of the composition of the higher molecular weight peak using in-gel SYPRO Orange staining (Rickman et al., 2004) (Fig. 4C).

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis of complex formation between Ssp1 and the Rap1a dimer and between Ssp2 and the Rap2a dimer (Fig. 4D) showed that, in both cases, binding was clearly exothermic and tight, at least in the low nanomolar Kd range.

We have determined the structures of two members of this family, Rap1b and Rap2b, revealing a new protein fold. Given the sequence homology, conservation of key residues and shared predicted secondary structure throughout all members of the family (Fig. 7; Russell et al., 2012), this fold appears to be shared across members from different organisms. A conserved disulphide bond and the observed stable dimerization interface, together with canonical N-terminal signal sequences, are consistent with a periplasmic localization for all Rap family proteins. To date, the structures of two other T6 immunity proteins have been solved. The first is the cytoplasmic Tsi2 protein (Li et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2012). Like the Rap proteins, Tsi2 exhibits a helical fold, is acidic and exists as a stable dimer in solution. However, the structures of Tsi2 and the Rap proteins are unrelated. Second, and very recent, is the structure of the periplasmic Tsi1 protein, complexed with the secreted peptidoglycan hydrolase effector, Tse1 (Ding et al., 2012). Tse1 possesses a strikingly accessible active site, facilitating its promiscuous and toxic peptidoglycan amidase activity (Chou et al., #b1001). Tsi1 binds to Tse1 in a 1:1 complex, occluding the substrate-binding site of Tse1 in order to neutralize its activity (Ding et al., 2012).

Tsi1 exhibits an all \u03b2 fold, related to a classical \u03b2-propeller, whereas Rap family proteins exhibit a novel helical fold. This indicates that the mechanisms by which immunity proteins confer resistance may be divergent even among those with effectors of similar function. Rap1a and Rap2a have an obvious immunity phenotype specific to their cognate secreted toxins, Ssp1 and Ssp2. However, the role of Rap1b and Rap2b is not yet known. While they do not appear to play a role in self-resistance, they may play a role in resistance towards closely related bacteria secreting similar toxins.

Rap1a and Rap2a have an obvious immunity phenotype specific to their cognate secreted toxins, Ssp1 and Ssp2. However, the role of Rap1b and Rap2b is not yet known. While they do not appear to play a role in self-resistance, they may play a role in resistance towards closely related bacteria secreting similar toxins. It is worth noting that other organisms also possess multiple Rap family proteins for a given Ssp family protein (Fig. 1C and data not shown); therefore, whatever the function of Rap1b and 2b turns out to be, it may not be unique to Serratia.", "Complementing our genetic and phenotypic demonstration of the cognate toxin-immunity function of Ssp1\u2013Rap1a and Ssp2\u2013Rap2a, we report detailed biochemical characterization of the interactions between these purified T6-secreted toxins and immunity proteins. For efficient self-protection, these interactions should be tight and highly specific, as was observed. Formation of Ssp1\u2013Rap1a and Ssp2\u2013Rap2a complexes is exothermic, with low nanomolar Kd, and with a stoichiometry of 2:2. A binding affinity of this order agrees well with the Kd of 3 nM reported for the Tsi1\u2013Tse1 interaction (Ding et al., 2012); however, the Tsi1\u2013Tse1 complex has a stoichiometry of 1:1, again highlighting significant differences between different pairs of toxin-immunity proteins. The structure of a Ssp\u2013Rap complex and arrangement of the subunits has yet to be determined, although it is likely that the two Ssp proteins bind to the same part of each Rap monomer, exploiting the twofold symmetry. Li et al. suggest that Tse2 interacts with an acidic patch on Tsi2 distal to the dimer interface (Li et al., 2012). They also note that, like many toxin\u2013antitoxin pairs, the resistance proteins Tsi1\u20133 are more acidic than the toxin proteins Tse1\u20133. This pattern is strikingly followed with the Ssp (theoretical pI 9) and Rap (theoretical pI 5\u20136) proteins. Nevertheless, while the highly acidic Rap proteins bind their cognate Ssp partners, which are noticeably basic, with high affinity, the story is not as simple as charge complementarity. Surprisingly for proteins with such low pI values, the striking surface feature conserved in Rap1b and Rap2b structures is a crescent-shaped basic patch on either side of the dimer (Fig. 6C and D). It is possible that such a basic crescent, if present on toxin-binding Rap proteins, may contribute to orientation of the partner during binding; conversely, it might contribute to the lack of Ssp binding by Rap1b and Rap2b. Additionally, all four S. marcescens Rap proteins are acidic and both Ssp proteins basic, yet only two, highly specific interactions are observed (Rap1a\u2013Ssp1 and Rap2a\u2013Ssp2). While charge complementarity would be expected to be important for specific complex formation, it is likely that shape considerations play an equally important role. The structure of a toxin-immunity protein complex will be necessary to delineate the molecular features that govern specific Rap\u2013Ssp association. We are working towards that goal.", "Complementing our genetic and phenotypic demonstration of the cognate toxin-immunity function of Ssp1\u2013Rap1a and Ssp2\u2013Rap2a, we report detailed biochemical characterization of the interactions between these purified T6-secreted toxins and immunity proteins.

If this is an isogenic sibling, the cognate Rap proteins provide an efficient protective barrier, effectively binding and sequestering the toxin, whereas if it is a competitor, Ssp1/2 are free to attack the cell wall. However, Ssp1 and Ssp2 are only two of multiple distinct T6-secreted toxins. This provides the observed redundancy of function: if Ssp1/2 are missing, the other toxins still cause the efficient death of a competitor. This \u2018belt and braces\u2019 approach provides great robustness: if a competitor becomes resistant to one or two toxins, the others will still provide the ability to kill or inhibit the competitor efficiently. Of course, the toxic effect of Ssp1/2 can be seen against self (if the cognate Rap is missing) as Db10 has resistance proteins to neutralize the other toxins. We believe that other effectors most likely act on different cellular targets, analogous to the Pseudomonas-specific, cytoplasmic-acting toxin, Tse2 (Li et al., 2012). Finally, we speculate that as the Ssp and Rap proteins are encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, and related genes are found associated with other T6SSs, particularly closely related ones, they may represent the ancestral substrates of the S. marcescens T6SS. Subsequently, other toxins could have been horizontally acquired from diverse sources and adopted by this highly versatile secretion machine. The exciting task of deciphering how such species- and strain-specific arsenals of toxins and immunity proteins are co-ordinated by the producing cell and how they contribute to the dynamic composition of polymicrobial communities in infection and the environment lies ahead.", "In summary, our data support a model (Fig. 8) whereby Ssp1 and Ssp2 are toxins secreted by the S. marcescens T6SS into the periplasm of a neighbouring cell.

In brief, proteins were overproduced in E. coli with a TEV protease-cleavable His6 tag and isolated by Ni2+ affinity purification. If required, the His6 tag was cleaved using TEV protease and the protein re-isolated by reverse Ni2+ chromatography. A final SEC step was then always performed. For SEC analysis of complex formation, His6-tagged proteins (10 nmol each) in 50 mM Tris\u00b7HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl were separated on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column, calibrated using molecular weight standards (GE Healthcare).
