["", "The rapid development\nof antibiotic resistance, especially among\ndifficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria, is recognized as a serious\nand urgent threat to public health. The detection and characterization\nof novel resistance mechanisms are essential to better predict the\nspread and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Corramycin is a novel\nand modified peptidic antibiotic with activity against several Gram-negative\npathogens. We demonstrate that the kinase ComG, part of the corramycin\nbiosynthetic gene cluster, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates\ncorramycin, leading to the resistance of the host. Remarkably, we\nfound that the closest structural homologues of ComG are aminoglycoside\nphosphotransferases; however, ComG shows no activity toward this class\nof antibiotics. The crystal structure of ComG in complex with corramycin\nreveals that corramycin adopts a \u03b2-hairpin-like structure and\nallowed us to define the changes leading to a switch in substrate\nfrom sugar to peptide. Bioinformatic analyses suggest a limited occurrence\nof ComG-like proteins, which along with the absence of cross-resistance\nto clinically used drugs positions corramycin as an attractive antibiotic\nfor further development.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The spread of antimicrobial resistance\n(AMR) represents one of\nthe principal public health problems of this century and has consequently\nbeen declared as one of the top 10 global public health threats by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019.1,2 Infections\nwith Gram-negative bacteria, in particular those included in the list\nof ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus\naureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter\nbaumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) pathogens, are a major concern due to\ntheir tendency to acquire multidrug resistance.3,4 Research\nefforts have thus largely focused on the development of new bioactive\ncompounds against Gram-negative bacteria, ideally addressing innovative\ntargets.5,6", "The spread of antimicrobial resistance\n(AMR) represents one of\nthe principal public health problems of this century and has consequently\nbeen declared as one of the top 10 global public health threats by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019.1,2 Infections\nwith Gram-negative bacteria, in particular those included in the list\nof ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus\naureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter\nbaumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) pathogens, are a major concern due to\ntheir tendency to acquire multidrug resistance.3,4 Research\nefforts have thus largely focused on the development of new bioactive\ncompounds against Gram-negative bacteria, ideally addressing innovative\ntargets.5,6", "The investigation of the specialized\nmetabolism of myxobacteria,\n\u03b4-proteobacteria known for their complex life cycle and social\nbehavior, has resulted in the isolation of natural products exhibiting\nhigh chemical diversity and unusual modes of action.7Corallococcus coralloides species are\nthe producers of the natural products corramycins, which were isolated\nin an activity-guided isolation process aiming to identify novel chemical\nscaffolds exhibiting activity against Gram-negative pathogens.

The majority of the tested isolates are multidrug-resistant\n(Table 1, Table S9); thus, it appears likely that the loss\nof susceptibility is caused by a distinct mechanism. To identify the\nculprit of resistance, we carefully reassessed the genome of the isolate\nwith a particular focus on the sbmA gene. We have\npreviously described that mutations of SbmA, a transporter responsible\nfor the uptake of the antibiotic in E. coli, can\nconfer resistance to corramycin.8 Strikingly,\nwe found a point mutation in the sbmA gene resulting\nin a premature stop codon and, hence, a truncated protein. We further\nassessed the susceptibility of the uptake-deficient strain in M9 minimal\nmedium and found that corramycin activity was restored with an MIC\nof 1 \u03bcg mL\u20131. This result supports our hypothesis\nof SbmA inactivation being the root of resistance in E. coli, as corramycin uses an additional uptake system under minimal conditions\nand does not solely rely on SbmA.
