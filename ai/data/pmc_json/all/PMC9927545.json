To study these phenomena, it is crucial to examine the origins of AMR in pristine environments, i.e., limited anthropogenic influences. In this context, epilithic biofilms residing in glacier-fed streams (GFSs) are an excellent model system to study diverse, intra- and inter-domain, ecological crosstalk. We assessed the resistomes of epilithic biofilms from GFSs across the Southern Alps (New Zealand) and the Caucasus (Russia) and observed that both bacteria and eukaryotes encoded twenty-nine distinct AMR categories. Of these, beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and multidrug resistance were both abundant and taxonomically distributed in most of the bacterial and eukaryotic phyla. AMR-encoding phyla included Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria among the bacteria, alongside Ochrophyta (algae) among the eukaryotes. Additionally, biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) involved in the production of antibacterial compounds were identified across all phyla in the epilithic biofilms. Furthermore, we found that several bacterial genera (Flavobacterium, Polaromonas, Superphylum Patescibacteria) encode both atimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and BGCs within close proximity of each other, demonstrating their capacity to simultaneously influence and compete within the microbial community. Our findings help unravel how naturally occurring BGCs and AMR contribute to the epilithic biofilms mode of life in GFSs. Additionally, we report that eukaryotes may serve as AMR reservoirs owing to their potential for encoding ARGs. Importantly, these observations may be generalizable and potentially extended to other environments that may be more or less impacted by human activity.", "IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is an omnipresent phenomenon in the anthropogenically influenced ecosystems. However, its role in shaping microbial community dynamics in pristine environments is relatively unknown. Using metagenomics, we report the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and their associated pathways in epilithic biofilms within glacier-fed streams. Importantly, we observe biosynthetic gene clusters associated with antimicrobial resistance in both pro- and eukaryotes in these biofilms. Understanding the role of resistance in the context of this pristine environment and complex biodiversity may shed light on previously uncharacterized mechanisms of cross-domain interactions.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Today, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a well-known threat to human health with an estimated number of 700,000 people per year dying of drug-resistant infections (1). The dramatic rise of antimicrobial resistance over the past decade has even led to the moniker \u201csilent pandemic\u201d (2). Therefore, AMR is often directly associated with human impacted environments with a global increase in resistant bacteria linked to the over- and misuse of antibiotics (3). However, contrary to public perception, AMR is a natural phenomenon, which has existed for billions of years (4). Long before the rather recent use of antibiotics in the clinical setting, microorganisms have used these, along with corresponding protective mechanisms, to establish competitive advantages over other microbes contending for the same environment and/or resources (5).", "Today, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a well-known threat to human health with an estimated number of 700,000 people per year dying of drug-resistant infections (1).

Such secondary metabolites, including metal transporters and quorum-sensing molecules (7, 8) are associated with enhanced fitness by driving growth, including by inhibiting the growth of other bacteria by depleting iron through increased capacity to compete for this essential resource. Consequently, many of these natural products have found their applications in industrial settings, but also as anti-infective drugs in human medicine (7, 9, 10). The biosynthetic pathways responsible for producing these specialized metabolites are encoded by locally clustered groups of genes known as \u201cbiosynthetic gene clusters\u201d (BGCs). Typically, BGCs include genes for expression control, self-resistance, and metabolite export (11). They can, however, be further divided into various classes, including nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), type I and type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), terpenes, and bacteriocins, alongside others (10). NRPSs and PKSs specifically have been of interest due to their known synthesis of putative antibiotics (12, 13). Furthermore, evidence suggests that within these BGCs at least one resistance gene conferring resistance can be found as a self-defense mechanism against the potentially harmful secondary metabolites encoded by the BGC (14). For instance, the tylosin-biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces fradiae also encodes three resistance genes (tlrB, tlrC, and tlrD) (15), while in another report, Streptomyces toyacaensis, the vanHAX resistance cassette, is proximal to the vancomycin biosynthesis gene cluster, thereby encoding inherent resistance (16).", "Microorganisms, in general, produce a range of secondary metabolites with diverse chemical structures, which in turn confer a variety of functions, including antibiotics (6).

Therefore, to further validate our observations regarding the antibiotic biosynthesis pathways, we assessed the abundance of BGCs, in the epilithic bioficlms within the MAGs, that are known to encode genes for secondary metabolite synthesis, including antibiotics. We found six different structural classes of BGCs by annotating 537 medium-to-high-quality (>50% completion and <10% contamination) bacterial and 30 eukaryotic MAGs using antiSmash (29) and DeepBGC (30). Using this ensemble approach, we identified one or more BGCs in most bacterial (n\u2009=\u2009490, ~91% of all bacterial MAGs) and eukaryotic (n\u2009=\u200928) MAGs. Of these BGCs, those annotated with an antibacterial function were dominant across the microbial populations, represented here by the MAGs, and were found across all phyla (Fig.\u00a03a).

(4) identified a collection of ARGs encoding resistance to beta-lactams as well as tetracyclines and glycopeptides in 30,000-year-old Beringian permafrost sediments. In agreement with these previous studies, we identified 29 AMR categories, including the previously mentioned resistance categories, in the studied biofilm communities. Among these, the highest ARG abundance was associated with aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance. Our study further suggests that although the overall abundance differs, the epilithic resistome was highly similar in all GFSs, independent of origin (i.e., New Zealand or Russia). Furthermore, our results agree with the results obtained in other resistomes identified in pristine environments such as Antarctic soils and permafrost in terms of the identified ARGs. Unlike previous studies, where ARGs were primarily associated with bacteria, we report for the first time that AMR was associated with both bacteria and eukaryotes in various abundances in environmental samples, including GFSs. A previous study by Brown et al. (36) reported that the IRS-HR (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase\u2014high resistance) type gene conferring resistance against mupirocin was identified in Staphylococcus aureus. More importantly, they suggested that horizontal gene transfer led to the acquisition of IRS-HR genes by bacteria from eukaryotes (36). Despite these early reports, the contribution of eukaryotes to most resistomes, including from pristine environments, has largely been unexplored thus far. An exception to this was the report by Fairlamb et al.

However, most of these modes of resistance were highly specific toward particular drug treatments (37). Our results specifically revealed that taxa from the phylum Ochrophyta encoded resistance to 28 AMR categories, and this was also reflected in other (micro-)eukaryotes. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses revealed shared homology between the ARGs from the GFSs compared to reference databases. There were also other ARGs that formed separate clades indicating that they may either be distantly related or previously unidentified resistance genes.

This phenomenon was also observed by Antelo et al. (45) and others (46) who detected ARGs in soils in Antarctica, especially in proximity to scientific bases. A similar trend manifested in our analyses, where quinolone (synthetic antibiotic) resistance was found in the glacier streams from the Southern Alps. Interestingly, we observed that the quinolone resistance was higher in a glacier that was accessible to hikers along the Cascade Saddle, a famous trekking hot spot. This observation is along the lines of a recent report by Hwengwere et al. suggesting that the concentrations of anthropogenically derived ARGs are greater in regions closer to the research stations in Antarctica (17). Although it is plausible that some of the GFSs sampled in our study may indeed be under anthropogenic influence, albeit minimal, the majority of them are considered to be pristine environments. In this context, AMR is likely derived from natural antibiotics produced by microorganisms as a competitive advantage given the oligotrophic conditions. Microorganisms acquire resistance either as a protective measure against other microorganisms (47, 48) or as a self-defense mechanism to prevent inadvertent suicide by damaging metabolites (14). Accordingly, we found both antibiotic biosynthesis pathways and BGCs within the epilithic resistomes. We identified pathways for the biosynthesis of glycopeptides, beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides, among others, concurrent with the high abundance of ARGs against said antibiotics. Additionally, we identified BGCs with a predicted antibacterial function in both eukaryotes and bacteria. While a limited number of studies such, as Waschulin et al. (49) and Liao et al. (50), have shown BGCs in pristine environments, none of these studies have contextualized the cooccurrence of BGCs with AMR. Hence, we not only found that most of our MAGs contain BGCs, of which many have an antibacterial function, but also found all MAGs to encode multiple resistance genes. Additionally, we found several BGCs closely localized to ARGs on the same contig, thereby indicating an immediate self-defense mechanism against the encoded secondary metabolites. This agrees with the resistance hypothesis highlighted by Tran et al. stating that a gene conferring resistance to potentially harmful metabolites produced by the organism is to be found within the BGC-encoding operons (14). We also observed that the recently identified CPR bacteria (51) (in our case, phylum Patescibacteria) not only encoded AMR but also harbored genes associated with the production of molecules with antibacterial effects. Although Patescibacteria have been identified in oligotrophic environments (52, 53) with carbon and/or nutrient limitations similar to those observed for GFSs, it is plausible that their ability to survive with minimal biosynthetic and metabolic pathways may indeed depend on the expression of BGCs and AMR. At the time of this writing, a preprint by Maatouk et al. (54), described the presence of ARGs across publicly available CPR bacterial genomes. In addition, we report the identification of AMR within GFS-derived CPR genomes, likely as a means of competitive inhibition against other taxa. Alternatively, biofilms may also allow for collective resistance, tolerance, and exposure protection to antibacterial compounds (55). The AMR and BGCs encoded by most phyla may therefore affect cooperation and/or interactions associated with nutrient exchange, leading to the privatization of public goods (55). Such a phenomenon may be achieved due to the competition within taxa, both at the intra- and interspecies levels, via secretion of toxins (48) and occupying spatial niches (56, 57) thereafter. Furthermore, Stubbendieck and Straight previously highlighted the multifaceted effects of bacterial competition which include the potential taxation and subsequent increase in bacterial fitness (58). Thus, the in-situ competition within multispecies biofilms may allow for cross-phyla and cross-domain interactions while simultaneously increasing the overall fitness of the endogenous epilithic microbial community. Alternatively, these interactions or lack thereof may shape the overall community, including spatial organization (59), especially in energy-limited systems such as the GFSs.", "Studies delving into the origins of AMR have reported that fecal pollution may explain ARG abundances in anthropogenically impacted environments (44).

Accordingly, we found both antibiotic biosynthesis pathways and BGCs within the epilithic resistomes. We identified pathways for the biosynthesis of glycopeptides, beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides, among others, concurrent with the high abundance of ARGs against said antibiotics. Additionally, we identified BGCs with a predicted antibacterial function in both eukaryotes and bacteria. While a limited number of studies such, as Waschulin et al. (49) and Liao et al. (50), have shown BGCs in pristine environments, none of these studies have contextualized the cooccurrence of BGCs with AMR. Hence, we not only found that most of our MAGs contain BGCs, of which many have an antibacterial function, but also found all MAGs to encode multiple resistance genes. Additionally, we found several BGCs closely localized to ARGs on the same contig, thereby indicating an immediate self-defense mechanism against the encoded secondary metabolites. This agrees with the resistance hypothesis highlighted by Tran et al. stating that a gene conferring resistance to potentially harmful metabolites produced by the organism is to be found within the BGC-encoding operons (14). We also observed that the recently identified CPR bacteria (51) (in our case, phylum Patescibacteria) not only encoded AMR but also harbored genes associated with the production of molecules with antibacterial effects. Although Patescibacteria have been identified in oligotrophic environments (52, 53) with carbon and/or nutrient limitations similar to those observed for GFSs, it is plausible that their ability to survive with minimal biosynthetic and metabolic pathways may indeed depend on the expression of BGCs and AMR. At the time of this writing, a preprint by Maatouk et al. (54), described the presence of ARGs across publicly available CPR bacterial genomes. In addition, we report the identification of AMR within GFS-derived CPR genomes, likely as a means of competitive inhibition against other taxa. Alternatively, biofilms may also allow for collective resistance, tolerance, and exposure protection to antibacterial compounds (55). The AMR and BGCs encoded by most phyla may therefore affect cooperation and/or interactions associated with nutrient exchange, leading to the privatization of public goods (55). Such a phenomenon may be achieved due to the competition within taxa, both at the intra- and interspecies levels, via secretion of toxins (48) and occupying spatial niches (56, 57) thereafter. Furthermore, Stubbendieck and Straight previously highlighted the multifaceted effects of bacterial competition which include the potential taxation and subsequent increase in bacterial fitness (58). Thus, the in-situ competition within multispecies biofilms may allow for cross-phyla and cross-domain interactions while simultaneously increasing the overall fitness of the endogenous epilithic microbial community. Alternatively, these interactions or lack thereof may shape the overall community, including spatial organization (59), especially in energy-limited systems such as the GFSs.", "Conclusions.", "Conclusions.", "Conclusions.", "Epilithic biofilms are an integral and key mode of survival in the extreme environment of glacier-fed streams.
