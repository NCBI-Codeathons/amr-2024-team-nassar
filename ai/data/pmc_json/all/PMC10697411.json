["Current address: VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd., Tietotie 2, FIN-02044 Espoo, Finland", "Abstract", "Streptomyces produce complex bioactive secondary metabolites with remarkable chemical diversity. Benzoisochromanequinone polyketides actinorhodin and naphthocyclinone are formed through dimerization of half-molecules via single or double carbon-carbon bonds, respectively. Here we sequenced the genome of S. arenae DSM40737 to identify the naphthocyclinone gene cluster and established heterologous production in S. albus J1074 by utilizing direct cluster capture techniques. Comparative sequence analysis uncovered ncnN and ncnM gene products as putative enzymes responsible for dimerization. Inactivation of ncnN that is homologous to atypical co-factor independent oxidases resulted in the accumulation of fogacin, which is likely a reduced shunt product of the true substrate for naphthocyclinone dimerization. In agreement, inactivation of the homologous actVA-3 in S. coelicolor M145 also led to significantly reduced production of actinorhodin. Previous work has identified the NAD(P)H-dependent reductase ActVA-4 as the key enzyme in actinorhodin dimerization, but surprisingly inactivation of the homologous ncnM did not abolish naphthocyclinone formation and the mutation may have been complemented by an endogenous gene product. Our data suggests that dimerization of benzoisochromanequinone polyketides require two-component reductase-oxidase systems.", "Here, we have elucidated how antibiotic producing bacteria are able to synthesize complex natural products using highly sophisticated chemical transformations.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Streptomyces are soil-dwelling prokaryotes with a capability to generate numerous bioactive secondary metabolites that are harnessed for medical usage as antibiotics, anticancer agents and immunosuppressants (Newman and Cragg 2020).

Surprisingly, much of this chemodiversity is generated via a limited number of biosynthetic systems that classify secondary metabolites to the main classes of polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, ribosomally synthesized, and post-translationally modified peptides, and terpenes (Fewer and Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 2020).", "Streptomyces are soil-dwelling prokaryotes with a capability to generate numerous bioactive secondary metabolites that are harnessed for medical usage as antibiotics, anticancer agents and immunosuppressants (Newman and Cragg 2020).

Naphthocyclinones pertinent to this study were originally discovered in 1974 from Streptomyces arenae DSM 40737 (Zeeck and Mardin 1974, Zeeck et al. 1974) and subsequently confirmed to be asymmetrical dimers (Krone et al. 1982, Ando et al. 2015). Three different conformations of naphthocyclinones, the \u03b1, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-forms, have been identified, but only the \u03b2- and \u03b3-forms show bioactivities against Gram-positive bacteria (Br\u00fcnker et al. 2001).

The molecular genetics of actinorhodin biosynthesis have been studied since the 1970s (Rudd and Hopwood 1979).

The highly reactive polyketide is tethered to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to prevent aberrant cyclization events. The polyketide is folded to a bicyclic intermediate that is released from the ACP by a distinct 9-ketoreductase (9-KR), first ring aromatase/cyclase (ARO/CYC) and second ring cyclase (CYC). Next 3-ketoreduction (3-KR) promotes pyran ring cyclization and the monomer unit of actinorhodin, dihydrokalafungin, is formed by a set of redox enzymes (Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 et al. 2013).
