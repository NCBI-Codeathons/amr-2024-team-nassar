["Abstract", "The time\u2010of\u2010day influence on neuromuscular function is well\u2010documented, but important details remain elusive. It is currently unknown whether males and females differ in their diurnal variation for optimal neuromuscular performance. The purpose of this study is to identify the time\u2010of\u2010day influence on neuromuscular function between sexes and determine whether these responses differ for the upper versus lower limbs. A group of males (n\u00a0=\u00a012) and females (n\u00a0=\u00a015) completed neuromuscular performance testing in the morning (07:00\u201309:00) and evening (17:00\u201319:00) on separate days in a randomized order. Maximal force, the normalized rate of force development, EMG, normalized EMG rise, and submaximal force steadiness were compared between morning and evening hours. The main findings show that maximal force was greater in the evening for the knee extensors (d\u00a0=\u00a00.570, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but not the elbow flexors (d\u00a0=\u00a00.212, p\u00a0=\u00a00.281), whereas maximal muscle excitation was greater in the evening for the biceps brachii (d\u00a0=\u00a00.348, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but not the vastus lateralis (d\u00a0=\u00a00.075, p\u00a0=\u00a00.526) with no influence of sex. However, force steadiness during knee extension was superior in the evening versus the morning for males (d\u00a0=\u00a00.734, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) and compared to evening values for females (g\u00a0=\u00a01.19, p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). Overall, these findings show that time\u2010of\u2010day affects the knee extensors more than the elbow flexors and that diurnal variability between sexes appears to be task\u2010dependent.", "Augsburger, G.

These circadian rhythms exist in virtually every physiological measure of performance and are controlled by a \u2018brain clock\u2019 located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (Bailey & Silver, 2014; Douglas et al., 2021; Kuljis et al., 2013). Time\u2010dependent variations in maximal performance during waking hours have been documented in laboratory settings (Gauthier et al., 1996; Guette et al., 2005a; Sedliak et al., 2008) and competitive sports events (Lok et al., 2020). Evidence exists for alterations in neural excitation (Gueldich et al., 2016; Lang et al., 2011; Martin et al., 1999), neurohormonal flux (Chtourou et al., 2012; Racinais et al., 2005; Tamm et al., 2009), contractile alterations at the muscle fiber level (Mirizio et al., 2020; Sedliak et al., 2008), and some recent hypotheses implicate circadian clock genes (Douglas et al., 2021; Dyar et al. 2012). Compelling evidence shows that maximal strength peaks in the evening (~16:00\u201320:00 h) and is lowest in the morning (~06:00\u201310:00 h) (Hatfield et al., 2016; Mirizio et al., 2020; Sedliak et al., 2008).

There is some evidence (Guette et al., 2005a; 2005b, Knaier et al., 2019) that different muscle groups may respond uniquely in the morning versus evening, yet direct comparisons between limbs are lacking. Since the muscles of the lower limb are involved in locomotor activity throughout the day, it may be that ambulation provides a passive warmup effect not shared by the muscles of the upper limb. Moreover, additional force and electromyographic (EMG) metrics that are strongly related to neural input are not as well described in the literature. The rate of force development (RFD) and EMG rise (RER) are heavily influenced by the volitional neural drive at contraction onset (Andersen & Aagaard, 2006; Del Vecchio et al., 2018; Klass et al., 2008). The time\u2010dependent rise of these metrics during rapid contractions allows inferences on the magnitude of motor unit activation during the initial phase (<75\u00a0ms) of contraction, whereas intrinsic properties of the activated muscle are more dominant in the later phases (>150\u00a0ms)(Andersen & Aagaard, 2006; Maffiuletti et al., 2016). Additionally, measurements of force steadiness provide another view of motor unit activity since force fluctuations are influenced by the common oscillations in synaptic input delivered to the active alpha motor neurons (Brown et al., 2010; Harwood et al., 2010; Inglis & Gabriel, 2021; Jakobi et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2003). The intrinsic input\u2010output properties within force steadiness measurements therefore provide a general indication of the stability of descending neural drive (Dideriksen et al., 2012). Compared to maximal isometric force, these variables are underrepresented in the literature and may provide additional inferences relating to the neural contributions to the time\u2010of\u2010day effect on neuromuscular function. A series of recent experiments have shown that females demonstrate greater force variability than males during low\u2010force isometric contraction (Brown et al., 2010; Jakobi et al., 2018). Importantly, the vast majority of the published literature regarding the time\u2010of\u2010day influence on neuromuscular function has focused on males, with very little data available on how neuromuscular function varies across the day in female participants (Bambaeichi et al., 2004; Birch & Reilly, 2002; Giacomoni et al., 2005).", "The influence of time of day on maximal isometric force has been documented across many muscle groups (Drust et al., 2005; Gauthier et al., 1996; K\u00fc\u00fcsmaa et al., 2016).

The majority of participants (~60%) showed greater EMG amplitude values in the evening versus the morning for the biceps brachii but there was considerable interindividual variability and a few high responders to evening testing (Figure 3) so this finding should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the EMG data are interesting as previous work shows a parallel increase in EMG with force in the evening versus the morning (Castaingts et al., 2004; K\u00fc\u00fcsmaa et al., 2015).

Importantly, these studies show that maximal force is generally greater in the evening despite similar muscle excitation levels in the morning and evening. Although neural drive is a determinant of muscle force, potential neural mechanisms to explain diurnal variation in force levels remain elusive. Since others (Gauthier et al., 1996; Gueldich et al., 2016; Martin et al., 1999; Sedliak et al., 2008) have shown that the rate of force development is greater in the evening, we examined several intervals of the force\u2010 and EMG\u2010time curves during ballistic intent contraction as an indirect way to infer volitional neural drive since these measurements are largely determined by motor neuron behavior (Del Vecchio et al., 2019). We show no time\u2010of\u2010day effect for RFD or RER, though the effect sizes followed a similar pattern as the maximal force values for the respective limbs.

(2009) show that differences in corticospinal excitability levels between the morning and evening depend on the diurnal chronotype of the individual, similar interindividual variation in the time\u2010of\u2010day response between diurnal chronotypes has been shown in training studies (Chtourou et al., 2012; K\u00fc\u00fcsmaa et al., 2016).

(2009) show that differences in corticospinal excitability levels between the morning and evening depend on the diurnal chronotype of the individual, similar interindividual variation in the time\u2010of\u2010day response between diurnal chronotypes has been shown in training studies (Chtourou et al., 2012; K\u00fc\u00fcsmaa et al., 2016). Nevertheless, our EMG inferences provide little insight into the neural contributions to the present force data.", "The EMG data shows that maximal muscle excitation was opposite of participant maximal force, with the vastus lateralis showing no significant difference in excitation between morning and evening while the excitation of the biceps brachii was slightly higher in the evening than in the morning on average. The majority of participants (~60%) showed greater EMG amplitude values in the evening versus the morning for the biceps brachii but there was considerable interindividual variability and a few high responders to evening testing (Figure 3) so this finding should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the EMG data are interesting as previous work shows a parallel increase in EMG with force in the evening versus the morning (Castaingts et al., 2004; K\u00fc\u00fcsmaa et al., 2015). However, this is not a consistent finding as other studies have shown no significant time\u2010of\u2010day influence on muscle excitation for the biceps brachii (Gauthier et al., 1996) and vastus lateralis (Guette et al., 2005a; Nicolas et al., 2008; Sedliak et al., 2008). Importantly, these studies show that maximal force is generally greater in the evening despite similar muscle excitation levels in the morning and evening. Although neural drive is a determinant of muscle force, potential neural mechanisms to explain diurnal variation in force levels remain elusive. Since others (Gauthier et al., 1996; Gueldich et al., 2016; Martin et al., 1999; Sedliak et al., 2008) have shown that the rate of force development is greater in the evening, we examined several intervals of the force\u2010 and EMG\u2010time curves during ballistic intent contraction as an indirect way to infer volitional neural drive since these measurements are largely determined by motor neuron behavior (Del Vecchio et al., 2019). We show no time\u2010of\u2010day effect for RFD or RER, though the effect sizes followed a similar pattern as the maximal force values for the respective limbs. There is compelling evidence from transcranial stimulation data that diurnal variations influence GABA\u2010mediated intracortical inhibition and cortical excitability (Lang et al., 2011; Tamm et al., 2009). Tamm et al.

Nevertheless, our EMG inferences provide little insight into the neural contributions to the present force data.", "The diurnal changes in the contractile properties of the muscle may be attributed to intracellular variation of calcium kinetics and excitation\u2010contraction coupling mechanisms (Edgar & Dement, 1991; Partch et al., 2014), the circadian rhythm in core temperature (Racinais et al., 2004, 2005; Racinais & Oksa, 2010; Taylor et al., 2011), and diurnal variation of circadian clock genes (Douglas et al., 2021). For example, evoked responses from the quadriceps muscles have shown greater twitch torque and rates of twitch torque development in the evening versus the morning (Guette et al., 2005b; Martin et al., 1999). The role of core body temperature is important too as diurnal differences are diminished in warm environments (Racinais et al., 2004) and following extended warmups (Taylor et al., 2011). The increase in maximal muscle strength that occurs with slight elevations (1\u00b0C) in central body temperature (Racinais et al., 2004, 2005; Racinais & Oksa, 2010) has been attributed to enhanced contractile kinetics and greater muscle fiber conduction velocity (Shephard, 1984). More recently the discovery of skeletal muscle clock genes has revealed the existence of rhythmic pathways in human skeletal muscle that affect approximately 8% of muscle genes (Dyar et al., 2014). The data show the transcription of human skeletal muscle clock genes enriched genes associated with inflammation, immune responses, myofilament phosphorylation, and mitochondrial activity (Dyar et al., 2014), thus influencing time\u2010of\u2010day differences in maximal isometric muscle force (Partch et al., 2014; Takashima, 2009). More research is needed on the role that skeletal muscle clock genes may have on altering diurnal muscle performance, but it remains a potential mechanism for time\u2010of\u2010day alterations seen in the present study (Douglas et al., 2021; Vaara et al., 2018).", "The diurnal changes in the contractile properties of the muscle may be attributed to intracellular variation of calcium kinetics and excitation\u2010contraction coupling mechanisms (Edgar & Dement, 1991; Partch et al., 2014), the circadian rhythm in core temperature (Racinais et al., 2004, 2005; Racinais & Oksa, 2010; Taylor et al., 2011), and diurnal variation of circadian clock genes (Douglas et al., 2021).

This topic has received attention lately and the current data offers new insights. Our findings show that at 30% of maximal isometric force, there were small, nonsignificant effects for lower force steadiness for females compared to males for the elbow flexors in the morning (g\u00a0=\u00a00.303) and evening (g\u00a0=\u00a00.396).
