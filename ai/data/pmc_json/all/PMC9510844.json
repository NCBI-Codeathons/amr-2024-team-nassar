One of the most puzzling microbiome molecules is colibactin, a genotoxin encoded in some commensal and extraintestinal microbes and is implicated in initiating colorectal cancer. The colibactin cluster was discovered more than 15\u00a0years ago, and most of the research studies have been focused on revealing the biosynthesis and precise structure of the cryptic encoded molecule(s) and the mechanism of carcinogenesis. In 2022, the Balskus group revealed that colibactin not only hits targets in the eukaryotic cell machinery but also in the prokaryotic cell. To that end, colibactin crosslinks the DNA resulting in activation of the SOS signaling pathway, leading to prophage induction from bacterial lysogens and modulation of virulence genes in pathogenic species. These unique activities of colibactin highlight its ecological role in shaping gut microbial communities and further consequences that impact human health. This review dives in-depth into the molecular mechanisms underpinning colibactin cellular targets in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, aiming to understand the fine details of the role of secreted microbiome chemistry in mediating host\u2013microbe and microbe\u2013microbe interactions. This understanding translates into a better realization of microbiome potential and how this could be advanced to future microbiome-based therapeutics or diagnostic biomarkers.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Trillions of microbes reside in the human gut interacting with each other and the outcome of their interaction affects human health and diseases (Sharon et al., 2014; Dhanaraju and Rao 2022; de Vos et al., 2022). This interaction is mediated by evolved small molecules, of which the vast majority are still dark matter (Wilson, Zha, and Balskus 2017; Zha et al., 2022). A few examples of microbiome secreted products are reported, each with a unique activity such as the microbial genotoxin colibactin (Wernke et al., 2020). Colibactin is a hybrid polyketide\u2013non-ribosomal peptide product encoded in the genome of some Enterobacteriaceae that belong to the phylogenetic group B. Colibactin is implicated in causing colorectal cancer (CRC) by inducing a signature mutation in DNA. Isolation and structural elucidation of colibactin has challenged the scientific field for over 15 years because of its contact-dependent synthesis, minimal expression, and chemical instability. The bulk of the research study on colibactin is centered around revealing its structure, mainly through bioinformatic analysis, comparative metabolomics, and mutational studies (Tang et al., 2022). However, to appreciate the evolved function of colibactin(s) and other microbiome products, we must understand their ecological role in enhancing the competency and fitness of producers. There are some reports on the antimicrobial-like activity of colibactin, but most of the data come from observational or associational studies without revealing the underpinning mechanism of action (T. Fa\u00efs et al., 2016). In a pioneering study, the group of Dr. Balskus revealed that colibactin induces prophage activation on a wide scale in multiple phage\u2013bacteria systems. This activity is mediated by its ability to damage DNA activating the SOS response. Moreover, induction of prophages affects prophage-encoded genes such as some bacterial toxins, which are crucial for their pathogenicity. This finding reveals another interesting role of colibactin in mediating microbe\u2013microbe interaction and shaping the structure of gut microbes (Silpe et al., 2022; Tronnet et al., 2020).", "Trillions of microbes reside in the human gut interacting with each other and the outcome of their interaction affects human health and diseases (Sharon et al., 2014; Dhanaraju and Rao 2022; de Vos et al., 2022).

Intensive research reports confirm that all of these genes are essential for genotoxicity, except for clb M, S, and R (Nougayr\u00e8de et al., 2006). Our current understanding of colibactin structure is shaped through understanding the organization of its biosynthetic genes, mutational studies, heterologous expression, and structure prediction using bioinformatics models. Over the last 16 years, there have been multiple hypotheses for the biosynthesis of colibactin, and the most recent is the prodrug activation theory (Figure 1) developed by the Balskus group (Brotherton and Balskus 2013; Balskus 2015).

Purification of colibactin from native or heterologous hosts is challenging due to its minimal production upon fermentation, instability, and contact or inflammation-dependent gene expression. To overcome this challenge, several research groups developed alternative strategies to characterize the more stable derivatives or precursors of colibactin, named precolibactins (Vizcaino et al., 2014; Li et al., 2019; Vizcaino and Crawford 2015; Brotherton et al., 2015; Bian et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Healy, Vizcaino, et al., 2016b).

This evidence includes the presence of the product in the extract of native colibactin-harboring E. coli CFT073 as detected by MS\u2013MS analysis and the ability of the compound to induce the characteristic DNA double-strand breaks (Li et al., 2019). In the same year, Crawford/Herzon and Balskus groups independently elucidated the structure of another colibactin molecule with an MWT of 770 and validated its genotoxic activity (Xue et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019). Crawford/Herzon predicted the structure by a DNA adductome approach followed by total synthesis. The Balskus group predicted the structure by studying clbP/clbL double mutants, labeling experiments, and an adductome approach. The clbL is predicted to encode amidase functions by hydrolysis of an amide bond; however, the authors validated that this enzyme is rather the final step in the production of intact precolibactin (Jiang et al., 2019). In 2022, the Watanabe group isolated a colibactin molecule with an MWT of 788 from the pks + E. coli strain-50, a strain isolated from colorectal cancer tissues that produces 26-fold more colibactin than Nissle 1917 (Hirayama et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2021). Of note, the same group has developed an activity-based fluorescent probe to identify high colibactin producers from clinical samples 3 years before elucidating the first-isolation-based structure of colibactin (Hirayama et al., 2019). At first, the authors obtained two fragments of the compound whose structures are suggestive of spontaneous hydrolysis of the candidate molecule at the 1,2-diketone moiety as previously described by the Herzon group (Healy et al., 2019). Next, they managed to protect the compound from hydrolysis by adding o-phenylenediamine to convert the 1,2-diketone moiety into quinoxaline, which is not subjected to hydrolysis and isolated a few micrograms of colibactin sufficient for further NMR spectroscopic analysis (Zhou et al., 2021).

For example, in a mixed culture, Salmonella enterica induces its prophages, leading to the killing of some self-cells while the others are converted back to lysogens.

Similarly, some cells of E. faecalis V583 and Streptococcus mitis induce prophages to express phage genes to help the remaining cells adhere to human platelets, leading to systemic infection (Matos et al., 2013; Seo et al., 2010). This regulatory activity of microbiome-secreted molecules has been noted before. For example, quinolone antibiotics increase the production of Stx toxin via activation of prophages via SOS response (Pleguezuelos-Manzano et al., 2020). Co-culture of colibactin with Citrobacter rodentium increases the production of Stx (Silpe et al., 2022). Another interesting activity of colibactin was reported by Marcq et al. (2014). Driven by the association between pks+\nE. coli strains and septicemia, the authors investigated the effect of colibactin-harboring strains on lymphopenia and sepsis. The results show that colibactin-producing E. coli causes the characteristic double-strand break in the DNA of lymphocytes, leading to an exaggerated lymphopenia and subsequent low survival rate from bacteremia in mice (Marcq et al., 2014).", "Conclusion", "Conclusion", "Colibactin demonstrates the potential of microbiome secreted chemistry to hit multiple targets spanning prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell machinery. It is interesting to speculate that colibactin gives the producing species an ecological advantage in occupying specific niches such as the human gut by controlling other competitive microbes. Understanding how precisely colibactin-producing strains alter gut microbiome composition and their further indirect impact on human health and diseases seems exciting. Of note, we still do not appreciate all the microbiome species that we host in our bodies or their cryptic genes and encoded chemistry. Revealing the microbiome products that exert microbial control and affect population dynamics will help to advance better strategies to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis. Microbiome chemistry is certainly a new uncharted Frontier for understanding mediators of human conditions and developing innovative therapeutics or diagnostic biomarkers. For example, delivering colibactin mimics or genes to induce the lethal killing of a cancer cell or as an antimicrobial for life-threatening biofilm infection.", "Colibactin demonstrates the potential of microbiome secreted chemistry to hit multiple targets spanning prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell machinery.

From an ecological perspective, we can imagine colibactin as a beneficial microbial product that is produced to shape the microbial community and confer beneficial traits to the host, such as decreasing inflammation as long as the mutualistic relationship is established. Evidence for this hypothesis came from the research on Nissle 1917. The efficacy of probiotic E-coli Nissle 1917 in treating colitis and preventing further remission is even comparable to that of mesalazine, the gold standard drug in the treatment of colitis (Kruis et al., 2004). The mechanism of action involves modulation of cytokine expression. Interestingly, further investigation on Nissle 1917 activity suggests that its beneficial anti-inflammatory activity is dependent on the expression of the colibactin biosynthetic pathway (Olier et al., 2012). Knockout strains that lost the ability to express the colibactin cluster not only lost the anti-inflammatory activity but also resulted in more inflammation (Olier et al., 2012). Moreover, inflammation is thought to be a triggering signal for further expression of the colibactin gene cluster. Chronic inflammation and accumulation of DNA damage will eventually lead to cancer development. The question now is, do these microbiome strains, or more specifically colibactin, initiate cancer or evolved to combat cancer and act as an immunomodulin based on the activity profile of E. coli Nissle 1917? One can postulate that it produces colibactin to kill transformative cells at the beginning of inflammation in a similar way to chemotherapeutic agents and more inflammation triggers more synthesis of the mysterious molecule(s). This bidirectional dependency is puzzling and poses an outstanding question on the directionality of microbiome diseases association and warns of the urgent need for a holistic deep understanding of the microbiome secreted chemistry evolved to hit multiple cellular targets under very tight and complex regulation resulting in a variety of negative and positive outcomes for the host. Another interesting hypothesis is that the colibactin biosynthetic cluster encodes or supplies precursor molecules with immunomodulatory activity as originally proposed (Olier et al., 2012). Support for this hypothesis comes from the strong association between colitis and microbial dysbiosis, so it is interesting to speculate on the role of colibactin in shaping microbiome structure and whether it may restore the balanced composition to the pre-colitis status. However, the members of Enterobacteriacea are often considered proinflammatory, and some reports show significant enrichment in Enterobacteriacea with the onset of gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions (Garrett et al., 2010) and the dominant presence of adherent-invasive strains of E. coli such as LF82 (Carvalho et al., 2008), belonging to the same phylogenetic group as Nissle 1917, although it lacks the colibactin genomic cluster.
