["Microbial natural products are a tremendous source of new bioactive chemical entities for drug discovery. Next generation sequencing has revealed an unprecedented genomic potential for production of secondary metabolites by diverse micro-organisms found in the environment and in the microbiota. Genome mining has further led to the discovery of numerous uncharacterized \u2018cryptic\u2019 metabolic pathways in the classical producers of natural products such as Actinobacteria and fungi. These biosynthetic gene clusters may code for improved biologically active metabolites, but harnessing the full genetic potential has been hindered by the observation that many of the pathways are \u2018silent\u2019 under laboratory conditions. Here we provide an overview of the various biotechnological methodologies, which can be divided to pleiotropic, biosynthetic gene cluster specific, and targeted genome-wide approaches that have been developed for the awakening of microbial secondary metabolic pathways.", "Keywords", "Microbes: promising and prolific source of new drug leads", "Microbes: promising and prolific source of new drug leads", "Natural products (also referred to as secondary metabolites or specialized metabolites; SMs) represent a group of low-molecular weight structurally diverse and complex bioactive compounds occupying an unusual chemical property space [1].

Investigations into the RNA polymerase/ppGpp complex in a thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus revealed three modes of transcriptional regulation by ppGpp depending on the nucleic acid composition of the promoter, which influenced the conformation of the RNAP [64]. Therefore it is unsurprising that ppGpp has also been linked to secondary metabolism and initiation of antibiotic production [67]. In Streptomyces, relA/relC mutants with significantly decreased ppGpp contents display lowered production of SMs when transferred to a media with nutritional shift-down [[68], [69], [70]] (Fig. 3A and B). It has been revealed that mutations conferring resistance to rifampicin in the rpoB gene, which encodes the RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit, alter the conformation of the RNAP to resemble ppGpp bound status. Therefore, the requirement for ppGpp for the expression of silent or poorly expressed gene clusters is bypassed in these mutants in various actinomycetes [[71], [72], [73]].Fig. 3Pleiotropic approaches for activation of silent gene clusters: A) Events that occur in the RNAP when an organism is grown in alternative conditions: (i) Nutrient rich-medium, where the conditions suppress secondary metabolism and transcription levels from BGCs are low; (ii) Microbe subjected to nutritional down-shift (depletion of amino-acids) conditions, which leads to the production of ppGpp (Guainosine tetraphosphate), that ultimately binds to RNAP, giving rise to high transcription levels from the BGC; (iii) Addition of antibiotics like rifampicin induces a mutation in the \u03b2-subunit of the polymerase, which in turn increases the transcription level of the BGC.

Both biotic (microbial lysates or soil extracts) and abiotic (antibiotics, synthetic compounds) chemical elicitors have been proved to be effective strategies for the induction of silent gene clusters. Two small molecule elicitors have been particularly successful; ARC2, a synthetic compound discovered through large scale screening [104], and goadsporin [105,106], a natural product that promotes secondary metabolism in Streptomyces. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of other xenobiotic antibiotics, such as jadomycin B [107] and monensin [108] have been shown to induce endogenous production of SMs. Interestingly, it has been shown that the addition of rare earth elements, e.g. scandium and lanthanum, at low concentrations resulted in the activation of the cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters [78,109].", "Co-cultivation, mimicking the ecological habitats of micro-organisms, has been emerged as an effective strategy to increase the chemical diversity of secondary metabolites (Fig. 4A). It is believed that the social networking in ecological environment is mediated by diffusible low-molecular-weight signaling molecules that are secreted from and received by cells [110,111]. For example, co-cultivation of the marine-derived fungal isolate A. fumigatus MR2012 with S. leeuwenhoekii strain C34 led to induction of metabolite production in both organisms, while co-cultivation of the fungus with bacterial strain C58 resulted in the detection of pentalenic acid from the bacteria [112]. Another marine-derived fungus Emericella sp. was induced to produce emericellamides A and B upon co-culture with Salinispora arenicola [113], whereas promomycin produced by one Streptomyces strain led to initiation of antibiotic production in another strain by cross-feeding [114]. Interestingly, dialysis experiments and electron microscopy have revealed that not only diffusible signals, but also intimate physical interactions contribute to the networking and induction of silent clusters during co-cultures of A. nidulans with S. hygroscopicus [115] or A. fumigatus with S. rapamycinicus [116].Fig. 4Pleiotropic approaches for the activation of the silent gene clusters: Global regulators, PPTases and the OSMAC approach.
