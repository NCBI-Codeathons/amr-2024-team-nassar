Immediately following the drying period, plates were inoculated at their center with 5 \u03bcl of bacterial culture and placed at 30\u00b0C.", "For swarming assays, cultures were grown overnight, diluted in fresh medium and subcultured until OD600~6.0 was reached. Swarm plates were prepared as follows: freshly autoclaved medium consisting of NB supplemented with 0.5% dextrose (Fisher) and 0.5% Bacto-agar (Difco) was poured into standard Petri dishes and dried under laminar flow for 30 min, as before [42]. Immediately following the drying period, plates were inoculated at their center with 5 \u03bcl of bacterial culture and placed at 30\u00b0C.", "For swarming phenotype restoration, 1, 5, 10 and 25 mg/L of purified B. thailandensis E264 rhamnolipids were deposited (10 \u03bcl) at the center of respective plates and left to dry for 15 minutes before spot inoculation with swarming-deficient \u0394rhlA mutant strains. For cross-feeding experiments, either equal parts of the cultures were mixed before being plated at the center on the swarm plate, or cultures were simply spotted side-by-side.", "For swarming phenotype restoration, 1, 5, 10 and 25 mg/L of purified B. thailandensis E264 rhamnolipids were deposited (10 \u03bcl) at the center of respective plates and left to dry for 15 minutes before spot inoculation with swarming-deficient \u0394rhlA mutant strains.
