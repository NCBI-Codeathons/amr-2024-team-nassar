["Effect of microRNA-27b (miR-27b) on cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was investigated to provide a reference for clinical prevention of OSCC cell resistance. The clinical tissues of 34 patients with OSCC-resistant cancer and 28 patients with cisplatin-sensitive OSCC in Nanjing General Hospital were collected. The expression levels of miR-27b and Frizzled-7 (FZD7) in cancer tissues were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reation (RT-qPCR). After a certain gradient of cisplatin was used to induce stable acquired resistance of OSCC cell line Tca8113/CDDP, a dose of miR-27b was added to construct a cell line overexpressing miR-27b in the drug-resistant cell line. The effect of cisplatin on the proliferation of drug-resistant OSCC cells was detected by colony formation assay. In addition, the scratch test and Transwell formation assay was performed to examine the effect of cisplatin drug stimulation on proliferation and migration of Tca8113/CDDP. Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to detect the effect of miR-27b on apoptosis of OSCC-resistant cells after cisplatin chemotherapy. The expression level of miR-27b in cancer tissues of patients with drug-resistant OSCC was significantly lower than that of patients with OSCC cisplatin sensitivity (P<0.05). After high expression of miR-27b, the number of clones of drug-resistant OSCC cells after adding cisplatin drugs can be significantly inhibited. The proliferation and migration ability of drug-resistant OSCC was significantly decreased after the addition of cisplatin in miR-27b overexpression (P<0.05). miR-27 mimic enhanced the pro-apoptotic ability of cisplatin drugs (P<0.05). The expression of FZD7 in cisplation-resistant patients was significantly higher (P<0.05). miR-27b significantly inhibited the expression of FZD7 and \u03b2-catenin proteins. miR-27b can inhibit the resistance of OSCC to cisplatin drugs, increase apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of FZD7/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activation in drug-resistant cell lines by miR-27b.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common head and neck cancers, accounting for 90% of the total number of malignant oral tumors (1). The 5-year survival rate for OSCC patients is ~60\u201380%, and if not diagnosed, the survival rate will be reduced to 50% (2). Cisplatin compounds are widely used in the clinical treatment of OSCC and have a variety of advantages, including reducing distant metastasis rate, improving patient survival and maintaining organ function. The main mechanism is exerting its cytotoxic effect through the formation of intrachain DNA cross-linking in tumor cells (3,4). Most OSCC patients are less sensitive to cisplatin compounds, which is the main reason for the low survival rate of OSCC patients (5). Therefore, to clarify the molecular mechanism of chemotherapy drug resistance in OSCC patients is of great significance for improving the survival and prognosis of patients with OSCC.", "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common head and neck cancers, accounting for 90% of the total number of malignant oral tumors (1).

By binding to specific genes, miRNAs can regulate the expression of multiple genes, and thus play an important role in physiological activities such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (7,8). Studies have shown that targeted inhibition of miR-27b can increase the sensitivity to doxorubicin of human thyroid cancer, and its mechanism may be related to the activation of PPAR (9). In addition, studies have shown that miR-27b expression levels are significantly reduced in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, possibly related to methylation of the miR-27b promoter region, whereas overexpression of miR-27b can enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen chemotherapeutic drugs through targeted inhibition of HMGB3 expression (10).", "miRNAs (microRNAs) are a group of single stranded non-coding RNAs (6) that are 20 to 24 nt in length and exist in eukaryotes.

The classical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascade can be activated through the binding of Wnt ligand and the seven-pass transmembrane FZD7 receptor protein and co-receptors of Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6), and this interaction can lead to the stable transfer of intracellular \u03b2-catenin into the nucleus, thereby regulating the expression of related genes (18,19). FZD7 is located on human chromosome 2q33 and is one of the most abundant proteins in the frizzled protein family (19). FZD7 is highly expressed in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer, thus promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion by activating Wnt signaling pathway (20). Recent studies have found that FZD7 can increase the resistance of cancer cells by activating Wnt signaling. For example, FZD7 silencing can promote the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to 5-fluorouracil by blocking Wnt signaling and downregulation of P-gp expression. Quercetin can reverse the resistance of hepatoma cells to 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting the activation of the FZD7/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway (21). This study first examined the mRNA expression of miR-27b and FDZ7 in clinically cisplatin-resistant OSCC patients and cisplatin-sensitive OSCC patients. It was found that cisplatin-sensitive OSCC patients had a higher expression of miR-27b in cancer tissues, but the level of FDZ7 expression was lower. Therefore, we further stimulated the cisplatin-resistant OSCC cell line by gradient concentration of cisplatin, and added miR-27b to upregulate the expression level of miR-27b. It was found that when the expression level of miR-27b was increased, the sensitivity of OSCC cells to cisplatin drugs was significantly increased, mainly manifestations were significantly inhibited in cell proliferation ability, significantly promoted apoptosis, and significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration ability. These results suggested that miR-27b can improve the resistance of OSCC cells to cisplatin drugs to a certain extent. Finally, by detecting the relevant protein signaling pathways affecting drug-resistant cells, we found that the expression levels of FDZ7 and \u03b2-catenin were inhibited by miR-27b, which partially explained the inhibitory effect of miR-27b on cell resistance. However, there are still some limitations in this study: i) Only one cell line was used in this study; ii) Only the expression of FDZ7/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway was detected in this study, but the mechanism of cisplatin resistance in OSCC cells is complex with many signaling pathways.
