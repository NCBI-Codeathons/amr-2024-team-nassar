["", "This review focuses entirely on the\nnatural bengamides and selected\nsynthetic analogues that have inspired decades of research. Bengamide\nA was first reported in 1986 from the sponge Jaspis cf. coriacea, and bengamide-containing sponges\nhave been gathered from many biogeographic sites. In 2005, a terrestrial\nGram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus virescens, was\nadded as a source for bengamides. Biological activity data using varying\nbengamide-based scaffolds has enabled fine-tuning of structure\u2013activity\nrelationships. Molecular target finding contributed to the creation\nof a synthetic \u201clead\u201d compound, LAF389, that was the\nsubject of a phase I anticancer clinical trial. Despite clinical trial\ntermination, the bengamide compound class is still attracting worldwide\nattention. Future breakthroughs based on the bengamide scaffold are\npossible and could build on their nanomolar in vitro and positive\nin vivo antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties. Bengamide\nmolecular targets include methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP1 and MetAP2)\nand nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells\n(NF-\u03baB). A mixed PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster appears\nto be responsible for creation of the bengamides. This review highlights\nthat the bengamides have driven inspirational studies and that they\nwill remain relevant for future research, even 30 years after the\ndiscovery of the first structures.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The study of structurally unique small\nmolecules of the bengamide\nclass, first isolated from coral reef sponges, has been ongoing throughout\nthe world for more than three decades. The bengamide chronicle is\nan example of research sustained by seeking new knowledge and outcomes\nparallel to those realized from the chemical study of terrestrial\nbiota. The discovery of the bengamides illustrates that the shift\nto examining the marine environment was a productive avenue for uncovering\nbiosynthetic products new to science and not discoverable from terrestrial\nspecies. Such results have stimulated many laboratories to engage\nin and develop the field of marine natural products. We view the finding\nand continued study of the bengamides as a milestone in a subject\narea rooted in part in the quest to build on past lessons learned\nfrom studying communities of rainforest trees and microorganisms.\nThe research on the bengamides began through bioactivity-guided probing\nof coral reef sponge metabolites and has been extended by examining\nbengamide-producing terrestrial microorganisms. We predict and discuss\nherein how such research will also continue into the future, driven\nby the use of molecular genetic tools to examine the sponge and its\nmicrobial associants for output of this compound class.", "The study of structurally unique small\nmolecules of the bengamide\nclass, first isolated from coral reef sponges, has been ongoing throughout\nthe world for more than three decades.

Approximately 200 synthetic bengamide analogues\nhave been created and evaluated against cancer cell lines, allowing\nfor a detailed SAR scenario to be constructed. The SAR has been significantly\nbuttressed by several (at least 10) cocrystal structures of bengamide\nanalogues in complex with various human and bacterial methionine aminopeptidases.", "The synthetic and medicinal chemistry contributions\nto the bengamide\nstory are massive.

The unanticipated cardiotoxicity and other\noff-target effects encountered were very unfortunate, but recent developments\nin predictive model systems using various cell types to test candidate\ncompounds will help to alleviate this problem in the future.
