Transmembrane transcription regulators (TTRs) are a family of one-component transcription regulators that respond to extracellular information and influence gene expression from the cytoplasmic membrane. How TTRs function to modulate expression of their target genes while localized to the cytoplasmic membrane remains poorly understood. In part, this is due to a lack of knowledge regarding the prevalence of TTRs among prokaryotes. Here, we show that TTRs are highly diverse and prevalent throughout bacteria and archaea. Our work demonstrates that TTRs are more common than previously appreciated and are enriched within specific bacterial and archaeal phyla and that many TTRs have unique transmembrane region properties that can facilitate association with detergent-resistant membranes.", "IMPORTANCE One-component signal transduction systems are the major class of signal transduction systems among bacteria and are commonly cytoplasmic. TTRs are a group of unique one-component signal transduction systems that influence transcription from the cytoplasmic membrane. TTRs have been implicated in a wide array of biological pathways critical for both pathogens and human commensal organisms but were considered to be rare. Here, we demonstrate that TTRs are in fact highly diverse and broadly distributed in bacteria and archaea. Our findings suggest that transcription factors can access the chromosome and influence transcription from the membrane in both archaea and bacteria. This study challenges thus the commonly held notion that signal transduction systems require a cytoplasmic transcription factor and highlights the importance of the cytoplasmic membrane in directly influencing signal transduction.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Signal transduction is the process through which microorganisms regulate their cellular programs according to their extracellular environment. Microorganisms are known to transduce information from outside the cell to the cytoplasm via two-component and one-component signal transduction systems (1, 2). Two-component signal transduction cascades are typically composed of a membrane localized sensor histidine kinase that, when stimulated, transfers a phosphate to a soluble response regulator, resulting in a cellular response (1\u20133). In contrast, one-component signal transduction systems are composed of a single protein that both directly detects a stimulus and modulates a cellular response (1\u20133). The vast majority of signal transduction systems in bacteria are one-component systems with most harboring DNA-binding domains and thereby controlling gene expression (2). A majority of one-component regulators are predicted to be localized within the cytoplasm, presumably to have unimpeded access to their DNA target(s) (2). Nonetheless, there are known examples of one-component regulators that are localized to the cytoplasmic membrane (Table\u00a01). Here, we define these one-component regulators and those with similar features (i.e., the presence of a predicted transmembrane [TM] region and a predicted DNA-binding domain) as TM transcription regulators (TTRs). Functional TTRs are found in bacteria and archaea, but not in eukaryotes, due to the separation of the cytoplasmic membrane and their genomes by the nucleus (2, 4, 5). Within archaea, TTRs are known to regulate motility and pilin gene expression in response to dangerous temperatures and nutrient-limiting conditions (6, 7). TTRs are better studied in bacteria, where they have been shown to regulate bile salt resistance (8, 9), toxin production (10, 11), antibiotic resistance (12, 13), acid resistance (14\u201316), natural competence (17), pilin/fimbria expression (18\u201324), type 3 secretion systems (25, 26), biofilm formation (27, 28), and metabolism (29\u201331), and have been implicated in modulation of the human immune system (32) (see Table\u00a01 for additional details).", "Signal transduction is the process through which microorganisms regulate their cellular programs according to their extracellular environment.

In total, we identified 50,302 TTRs (48,918 bacterial and 1,384 archaeal) across 9,673 genomes (see File S1). On average, bacterial genomes contain 5 TTRs (\u00b17) and archaeal genomes contain 4 TTRs (\u00b12) containing one or more TM regions (Fig.\u00a01; see also File S1). Species within the Coriobacteriia, Bacteroidota, Bacteroidia, Spirochaetota, Leptospirae, Acidobacteriae, and Methanomicrobia (here and throughout the manuscript: bacterial and archaeal taxonomy is according to Genome Taxonomy Database [36]), on average, contain more TTRs per genome compared to other prokaryotes (Fig.\u00a01A and B; see also File S1). However, the number of TTRs per genome varies dramatically among phyla, with some species encoding only 1 TTR and others encoding up to 158 TTRs (e.g., Raoultibacter timonensis) (see File S1). Given that the genome size also varies dramatically between species (see File S1), we next explored whether the number of TTRs per genome was due to differences in genome size. To address this question, we normalized the number of TTRs to the total number of protein-coding sequences per genome. Across all species, we found that on average 0.15% and 0.13% of bacterial and archaeal coding sequences were composed of TTRs (Fig.\u00a02). This normalization still indicated that species within the Coriobacteriia, Bacteroidota, Bacteroidia, Spirochaetota, Leptospirae, and Methanomicrobia were enriched with TTRs in their genomes. In addition, the Acidobacteriae, Clostridia, Thermoanaerobacteria, Bacilli, Methanobacteriota, and Thermoproteota have a slightly higher abundances of TTRs compared to other bacteria and archaea (Fig.\u00a02). Since TTRs are a distinct type of signal transduction system, we next analyzed what portion of known signal transduction systems within both the bacterial and the archaeal domains were composed of TTRs. Across all species, we found that, on average, 1.5 to 2% of all signal transduction genes were TTRs across bacterial and archaeal species, respectively (Fig.\u00a03).

A common phenomenon across bacteria and eukaryotes is the formation of small (i.e., nanometer) lipid regions, referred to here as lipid rafts (43\u201345). Lipid rafts and non-lipid-raft membrane regions have been shown to influence various cellular processes, including signal transduction, in part due to their ability to promote interaction between membrane localized proteins (46\u201355). Association with lipid raft and non-lipid-raft membrane regions is determined by the properties of the transmembrane region with length and overall surface area of the transmembrane helix being the most critical factors (56).

One possibility is that the membrane itself serves as a signal to further fine tune these signal transduction pathways. It is generally recognized that the membrane environment is not a homogenous. For example, a vast majority of integral membrane proteins are heterogeneously distributed in Bacillus subtilis cells, indicating that their diffusion within the cytoplasmic membrane is limited (64, 65).", "The advantage of TTRs versus classical one- and two-component systems is not obvious: why bring the response regulator and DNA-binding domain to the cytoplasmic membrane?

Generally speaking, lipid raft and non-lipid-raft membrane regions differ by their overall fluidity and thickness, with lipid rafts having a lower fluidity and increased thickness, as a consequence of the phospholipid species that occupy these membrane environments (45, 46, 66\u201369). These membrane regions have been shown to influence many signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells, in particular T cells (46\u201355). There is also evidence that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids can influence formation and stability of lipid ordered membrane domains thereby influencing signal transduction (48, 49). Here, we demonstrate that a large fraction of TTRs (approximately 43%) can associate with lipid raft membrane regions.

That is, not only do TTRs require a signal to impact gene expression, but that the target promoter sequence(s) must be in close proximity to the cytoplasmic membrane. This would imply that the structure of the chromosome (which is influenced by nucleoid associated proteins, transcription, translation, DNA supercoiling, and condensins) also contributes to TTR gene regulation. This would indicate that TTRs could contribute to regulation of complex lifestyles among microorganisms. Within the Alphaproteobacteria, a family of LytTR response regulators, not exclusively TTRs, were identified (70). Curiously, within Caulobacter cresentus all instances of the LytTR response regulator domain contain one or more TM regions (70).
