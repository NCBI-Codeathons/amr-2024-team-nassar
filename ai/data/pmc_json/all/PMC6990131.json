Various studies have been performed to study the resistance of P. ostreatus to heat stress. Here, the metabolome was evaluated to determine the response of P. ostreatus mycelia to heat stress at different times (6, 12, 24, 48 h). More than 70 differential metabolites were detected and enriched in their metabolic pathways. Dynamic metabolites changes in enrichment pathways under heat stress showed that heat stress enhanced the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids and nucleotides, increased the content of amino acids and vitamins, and accelerated glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in P. ostreatus. The time course changes of P. ostreatus metabolites under continuous heat stress demonstrated that amino acids continuously changed with heat stress, nucleotides clearly changed with heat stress at 12 and 48 h, and lipids exhibited an increasing trend with prolonged heat stress, while few types saccharides and vitamins changed under heat stress. Additionally, heat-treated P. ostreatus produced salicylic acid and other stress-resistant substances that were reported in plants. This study first reported the metabolites changes in P. ostreatus mycelia during 48 h of heat stress. The metabolic pathways and substances that changed with heat stress in this research will aid future studies on the resistance of P. ostreatus and other edible fungi to heat stress.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Pleurotus ostreatus has economic and ecological values and medicinal properties and has thus been intensely studied and cultivated in many different areas of the world (S\u00e1nchez, 2010). However, the cultivation of P. ostreatus is still dependent on the natural environmental temperature in China and many other developing countries (Lei et al., 2019). Thus, high temperature is the most adverse stress in the cultivation of P. ostreatus. After high-temperature stress, mycelial growth is inhibited, mycelia are susceptible to infection by pathogens, such as Trichoderma asperellum, and apoptotic-like cell death can occur (Song et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2017). These adverse effects cause enormous economic losses, which urgently call for studies on the mechanism of P. ostreatus resistance to heat stress.", "Pleurotus ostreatus has economic and ecological values and medicinal properties and has thus been intensely studied and cultivated in many different areas of the world (S\u00e1nchez, 2010).

First, relevant reports on heat shock proteins (HSPs) are abundant. Zou et al. (2018) found that the expression of some HSPs increased under heat stress, and the expression of HSPs was also upregulated in Ganoderma lucidum (Zhang et al., 2016). Second, cell signals were involved in the heat stress response. Kong et al. (2012) discovered that nitric oxide (NO) can alleviate heat stress-induced oxidative damage in Pleurotus eryngii. Other signaling molecules similar to NO, such as calcium (Ca2+), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), were found to participate in the heat stress response in G. lucidum (Zhang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018b; Tian et al., 2019). Finally, further studies have reported activated phospholipase D (PLD), a significant accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) (Liu et al., 2017a), and increased cell membrane fluidity upon heat stress (Liu et al., 2017b). These studies analyzed the mechanisms of the edible and medicinal fungal response to heat stress at different levels, and yet, it remains unclear whether there are other heat-response strategies.", "Fortunately, a few correlative studies have been performed on some edible and medicinal fungi.

However, different from the results of the total carbohydrate content detected before (Supplementary Figure S1E), there were few kinds of saccharides that changed with heat stress. Only sucrose (with the peak change value of 1.914-fold under heat stress; multiple changes below were expressed in the same way) and mannitol (1.961-fold) increased with continued heat stress and decreased correspondingly when mycelia resumed growth (Figure 3), which may attribute to the extracon medium (methanol) does not extract high molecular weight compounds such as the polysaccharides. Thus, the experiments just detected the low molecular weight saccharides, and the results showed that heat stress had little effect on low molecular weight saccharides, even the trehalose, a disaccharide act as stress protectant to stabilize cell membranes and protect biological structures (Lei et al., 2019), has not changed significantly here.", "To explain the response of mycelia to heat stress in more detail, we first made a diagram of all substances involved in saccharides metabolism according to the data of model fungus S. cerevisiae in the MetaboAnalyst 4.0 database, which mainly consisted of starch, sucrose, dextrin, trehalose, maltose, fructose, chitosan, mannose and galactose.

In fact, cAMP has been reported in many studies to act as a signal molecule, in addition to acting as an intermediate metabolite involved in metabolism. In these studies, cAMP is shown to be involved in the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, in which elevated cAMP activated PKA, and then, the PKA pathway promotes the activation of the Efg1 transcription factor, inducing the expression of downstream genes (Saputo et al., 2014; Parrino et al., 2017). In S. cerevisiae, cAMP signaling is the downstream of glucose-sensing G proteins; thus, the cAMP-PKA pathway is considered to be associated with fungal secondary metabolism (Choi and Xu, 2010). Similarly, the downregulated Efg1-mediated cAMP/PKA pathway may activate the alcohol dehydrogenase and glycolytic enzymes in Candida albicans (Ku et al., 2017), and the cAMP signaling pathways were also reported to regulate hyphal growth coordinately with the tricarboxylic acid cycle in C. albicans (Tao et al., 2017). Moreover, the cAMP-PKA pathway has also been shown to regulate stress responses, as a mutant with reduced intracellular levels of cAMP showed increased heat resistance (Choi and Xu, 2010), which may agree with the results in this study and indicate the role of cAMP as a signaling molecule.
