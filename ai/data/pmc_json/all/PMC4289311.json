The best-known and characterized lanthipeptide is nisin, which was first reported in 1928, although its structure was only finally elucidated in the 1970s\n[9, 10]. The biosynthetic genes for nisin had to wait until the late 1980s to be uncovered, and since this time many lan biosynthetic loci have been identified. The synthesis of the unusual lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues occurs by dehydration of serine and threonine to dehydroalanine (dha) and dehydrobutyrine (dhb), respectively, via phosphorylated intermediates, which subsequently undergo a Michael-type addition (cyclization) with a cysteine residue\n[1, 5, 19] (Figure\u00a0\n3).Figure 3\nLichenicidin-like lanthipeptides.

Screening of the genes surrounding the encoded radical SAM proteins for sactipeptide like accessory genes (such as transporters and other proteins related to peptide maturation or secretion) led to the exclusion of many putative gene clusters, with those remaining listed in Table\u00a0\n4. Several of the gene clusters showed similarities to thuricin CD (Figure\u00a0\n5A) as mentioned above, however, the gene organization and number of precursor peptides differ between strains. It appears that the number of radical SAM enzymes encoded within a gene cluster correlates with the number of putative precursor peptides, except in case of Clostridium cellulolyticum H10 where only one radical SAM per two precursor peptides and Clostridium difficile 630 where two radical SAM enzymes per precursor peptide are encoded (Figure\u00a0\n5A).Table 4\nDetected putative sactipeptide gene cluster\nPhylumLocus tag of radical SAMSimilar to\n\u2020\nReference\n#\n\nClostridium acetobutylicum DSM 1731Firmicutes\nSMB_G0673\n\nClostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824Firmicutes\nCA_C0658\n\nClostridium acetobutylicum EA 2018Firmicutes\nCEA_G0670\n\nClostridium cellulolyticum H10Firmicutes\nCcel_0328\nthuricin[37]\nClostridium difficile 630Firmicutes\nCD630_1620\nthuricin[37]\nClostridium kluyveri DSM 555Firmicutes\nCKL_0375\n\nClostridium lentocellum RHM5, DSM 5427Firmicutes\nClole_0089\n\nClostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405Firmicutes\nCthe_1695\n\nAnaerococcus prevotii PC1, DSM 20548Firmicutes\nApre_1837\nthuricin[37]\nRuminococcus albus 7, ATCC 27210Firmicutes\nRumal_0164\n\nSyntrophobotulus glycolicus FIGlyR, DSM 8271Firmicutes\nSgly_1407\n\nThermoanaerobacter mathranii mathranii A3, DSM1142Firmicutes\nTmath_1976\nthuricin[37]\nCaldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii 177R1B, DSM 12137Firmicutes\nCalkr_0222\nthuricin[37]\nHalothermothrix orenii H 168Firmicutes\nHore_04320\n\nDesulfobacca acetoxidans ASRB2, DSM 111069\u03b4- Proteobacteria\nDesac_0107\n\nThermosipho melanesiensis BI429Thermotogae\nTmel_0409\n\n\u2020Cluster shows similarities to characterized RiPP cluster;

As such, we have identified >25% of anaerobes are capable of producing RiPPs either alone or in conjunction with other secondary metabolites, such as polyketides or non-ribosomal peptides. As with the possession of NRPS and PKS gene clusters, the most likely RiPP producer organisms lie within the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. However, in contrast to their NRPS and PKS biosynthetic potential, which was minimal, anaerobic Actinobacteria appear to have a greater propensity for RiPP production. Interestingly, we found that the phylum Spirochaetes also contains a number of potential RiPP producing organisms, something that has not previously been found. In general, it also appears that non-pathogenic organisms have a greater potential for RiPP production, which aligns well with what is known about NRPS/PKS potential in anaerobes. Remarkably, anaerobes were found to have the potential to produce a variety of different RiPP classes, with the LAPs and lactococcins appearing to be favored by pathogenic anaerobes, whilst the other classes are more prominent in non-pathogenic isolates. Surprisingly, isolates from extreme environments contain a wide range of different RiPPs, in particular head-to-tail cyclized peptides and lanthipeptides. Despite the fact that their environmental niche is already restricted, it appears as though it must still be necessary for these organisms to have some way to defend themselves against competitors. In total we identified 81 putative RiPP clusters of which 43 had not been previously described and appear to be unique among known RiPP biosyntetic gene clusters. Furthermore, we were able to identify 23 gene clusters with similarities to known RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters, but that have not been previously identified in anaerobes and we were able to confirm a further 15 previously identified RiPP gene clusters.", "Here we have surveyed the genomes of 211 anaerobic bacteria for the presence of RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters. As such, we have identified >25% of anaerobes are capable of producing RiPPs either alone or in conjunction with other secondary metabolites, such as polyketides or non-ribosomal peptides. As with the possession of NRPS and PKS gene clusters, the most likely RiPP producer organisms lie within the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. However, in contrast to their NRPS and PKS biosynthetic potential, which was minimal, anaerobic Actinobacteria appear to have a greater propensity for RiPP production. Interestingly, we found that the phylum Spirochaetes also contains a number of potential RiPP producing organisms, something that has not previously been found. In general, it also appears that non-pathogenic organisms have a greater potential for RiPP production, which aligns well with what is known about NRPS/PKS potential in anaerobes.

These include a number of potential class II lanthipeptides from the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, with similarity to the lichenicidin gene cluster from Bacillus licheniforme; sactipeptides identified in the phylum Firmicutes with similarities to the thuricin CD gene cluster of B. thuringiensis; head-to-tail cyclized peptides within the phyla Chloroflexi and Firmicutes with homology to the circularin A biosynthetic gene cluster from C. beijerinckii ATCC 25752; and lactococcin 972-like RiPPs from the phylum of Actinobacteria. The distribution of similar gene clusters amongst diverse organisms suggests that horizontal gene transfer has been active in the distribution of RiPP gene clusters amongst organisms that share similar environments.", "Amongst the analyzed genomes, several gene clusters with good correlation to known RiPPs were identified.
