See https://doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02094g", "In the search for structurally novel metabolites with antibacterial activity, innovative approaches must be implemented to increase the probability of discovering novel chemistry from microbial sources. Here we report on the application of metabolomic tools to the genus Actinoallomurus, a poorly explored member of the Actinobacteria. From examining extracts derived from 88 isolates belonging to this genus, we identified a family of cyclodepsipeptides acylated with a C20 polyketide chain, which we named allopeptimicins. These molecules possess unusual structural features, including several double bonds in the amino-polyketide chain and four non-proteinogenic amino acids in the octapeptide. Remarkably, allopeptimicins are produced as a complex of active and inactive congeners, the latter carrying a sulfate group on the polyketide amine. This modification is also a mechanism of self-protection in the producer strain. The structural uniqueness of allopeptimicins is reflected in a biosynthetic gene cluster showing a mosaic structure, with dedicated gene cassettes devoted to formation of specialized precursors and modular assembly lines related to those from different pathways.", "Untargeted metabolomic analysis of Actinoallomurus spp. unveiled an unprecedented acylated cyclodepsipeptide with unusual features and potent antibacterial activity.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The spread of antibiotic resistance is a serious threat to public health that is forecast to reach dramatic levels by 2050, exacerbated by the scarcity of new antibacterial drugs in the development pipeline.1 Most of the antibiotics in clinical use today are microbial metabolites or derivatives thereof,2 while alternative approaches to antibiotic discovery have so far failed to be as successful as microbial product screening.2 However, through several decades of large screening efforts, thousands of metabolites with antibacterial activity have been reported in the literature, rendering the discovery of new scaffolds by bioactivity-based screening a labor-intensive endeavor.", "The spread of antibiotic resistance is a serious threat to public health that is forecast to reach dramatic levels by 2050, exacerbated by the scarcity of new antibacterial drugs in the development pipeline.1 Most of the antibiotics in clinical use today are microbial metabolites or derivatives thereof,2 while alternative approaches to antibiotic discovery have so far failed to be as successful as microbial product screening.2 However, through several decades of large screening efforts, thousands of metabolites with antibacterial activity have been reported in the literature, rendering the discovery of new scaffolds by bioactivity-based screening a labor-intensive endeavor.", "It is generally believed that the known metabolites represent the tip of the iceberg of molecules produced by microorganisms and that alternative approaches can reduce the biases imposed by bioassay-based screens.1,3,4 An attractive approach is represented by employing mass-spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic tools to navigate the chemical complexity observed in microbial fermentation extracts.

With the help of homonuclear Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) and Total Correlated Spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments, these signals were associated with a C20 polyketide chain containing six double bonds: starting from the acyl group (C1), we could identify a methylated double bond (C2\u2013C3 methylated in C2), two methylenes (C4\u2013C5), two conjugated double bonds (C6 to C9), two further methylenes (C10\u2013C11), a triene system (C12 to C17) and a methylene (C18) (Fig. S8\u2020).

The methyl at C2 shows a strong NOE cross peak with the Ile amide at 7.01 (Fig. S8A and B\u2020), which suggests an E configuration of the C2\u2013C3 double bond, with the methyl at C2 and the proton at C3 on the opposite side of the double bond. The configuration of C19 could not be assigned from spectroscopic data. However, biosynthetic considerations (see below) suggest an S configuration. Overall, these analyses established the structure of the polyketide portion of allopeptimicins as a C20 chain carrying an amino group at C19 and three unsaturation systems (Fig. 2).", "Heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) experiments revealed several cross peaks between 5.5 and 6.5 ppm (H) and 126 and 136 ppm (C).

The methyl at C2 shows a strong NOE cross peak with the Ile amide at 7.01 (Fig. S8A and B\u2020), which suggests an E configuration of the C2\u2013C3 double bond, with the methyl at C2 and the proton at C3 on the opposite side of the double bond. The configuration of C19 could not be assigned from spectroscopic data. However, biosynthetic considerations (see below) suggest an S configuration.

With the help of homonuclear Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) and Total Correlated Spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments, these signals were associated with a C20 polyketide chain containing six double bonds: starting from the acyl group (C1), we could identify a methylated double bond (C2\u2013C3 methylated in C2), two methylenes (C4\u2013C5), two conjugated double bonds (C6 to C9), two further methylenes (C10\u2013C11), a triene system (C12 to C17) and a methylene (C18) (Fig. S8\u2020). The proton at 3.30 ppm, belonging to the C19 methine, showed COSY correlation with the terminal methyl group (C20) at 1.22 ppm and with the C18 methylene group at 2.34 ppm (Fig. S7B\u2020). The chemical shift of the corresponding carbon (47.9 ppm, C19) was compatible with an amine functionalization. We also observed eight 3JH,H coupling constants of about 15 Hz and two of 11 Hz (Table 2).
