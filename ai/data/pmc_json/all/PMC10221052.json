["Constantly evolving drug-resistant \u201csuperbugs\u201d have caused an urgent demand for novel antimicrobial agents. Natural products and their analogs have been a prolific source of antimicrobial agents, even though a high rediscovery rate and less targeted research has made the field challenging in the pre-genomic era. With recent advancements in technology, natural product research is gaining new life. Genome mining has allowed for more targeted excavation of biosynthetic potential from natural sources that was previously overlooked. Researchers use bioinformatic algorithms to rapidly identify and predict antimicrobial candidates by studying the genome before even entering the lab. In addition, synthetic biology and advanced analytical instruments enable the accelerated identification of novel antibiotics with distinct structures.

Sarcophyton trocheliophorum, a species of soft coral found in the Red Sea, has been found to produce five terpenoid compounds. Two of these compounds are novel and pyrane-based and were exemplified by sarcotrocheliol (91). Sarcotrocheliol showed substantial antibiotic activity with MICs of 1.53 \u03bcM against S. aureus and 3.06 \u03bcM against MRSA.

Sordarin has been studied increasingly since its discovery to allow for the discovery of more, similar antimicrobial compounds [89,90]. The antifungal agent targets elongation factor II and halts protein synthesis. Sordarin is the subject of many studies now, with the aim of finding new analogs through genome mining and synthesis.

Combating Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacteria", "Resistance mechanisms are emerging and currently exist for all currently available antibiotics [94]. The common resistance mechanisms are summarized in Figure 7. Among the most prescribed drugs, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are characterized by the four-membered cyclic amide ring (e.g., penicillin in Figure 3). \u03b2-lactam antibiotics covalently bind to penicillin-binding proteins, which are enzymes involved in the last stages of peptidoglycan cross-linking in bacteria and inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell walls [95]. There are at least two common bacterial resistance mechanisms to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics: (1) producing \u03b2-lactamase, an enzyme that breaks the \u03b2-lactam ring structure and (2) producing altered penicillin-binding proteins with a decreased affinity for most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [96]. Another common type of antibiotic are macrolides, which contain a macrocyclic lactone. Represented by erythromycin (1), macrolides impede the bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Resistance mechanisms of macrolides include (1) upregulating efflux pump expression levels to remove intracellular macrolides, (2) mutating bacterial ribosome proteins and ribosomal RNA, and (3) reducing the binding affinity of the macrolides by phosphorylating the sugar moiety or hydrolyzing the macrocyclic lactone [97]. In addition, broad spectrum antibiotic rifampin represents the ansamycin-type of antibiotics. Rifampin is a frontline treatment for tuberculosis, whose bactericidal properties stem from high-affinity binding to and inactivating the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase [98]. Goldstein argued that rifampin resistance is caused by a genetic modification in the bacterial RNA polymerase \u03b2 subunit [99], whereas Javid et al. concluded that phenotypic resistance to rifampicin is caused by the mistranslation of mycobacterial proteins, suggesting that mistakes in protein translation might affect how bacteria respond to stress [100]. Resistance to conventional antibiotics has caused polymyxins to be reexamined as viable treatment choices. Polymyxins represented by colistin (30) are considered the last resort for multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Colistin exerts a bactericidal effect by binding to the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide, an important Gram-negative bacteria outer surface component, leading to rupture of the cell membrane [39]. Even though colistin resistance is infrequent due to its limited usage, several strains of colistin-resistant clinical isolates have recently been found. Other than the common antibiotic resistance mechanisms, researchers have speculated that lipopolysaccharide modification may contribute to colistin resistance [101].

Macolacin (30) is an analog of colistin, the discovery of which by genome mining we briefly discussed previously. It is important to examine the mode of action for macolacin to overcome colistin resistance. Wang et al. postulated the distinct structure of macolacin may improve the ability to interact with the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide for colistin-resistant strains. Teixobactin (28) inhibits the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall by binding to a highly conserved motif of lipid II and lipid III, both of which are precursors of the bacteria cell wall components (peptidoglycan and teichoic acid, respectively) [39]. The most outstanding finding is that researchers did not detect acquired resistance after passaging S. aureus and M. tuberculosis for 25 days with a sub-MIC level of teixobactin, this finding implies the natural resistance to teixobactin may take years to develop. The above two candidates both belong to the nonribosomal peptide category, whereas the next candidate is a ribosomally synthesized peptide with an interesting loop and tail structure. Lassomycin (44) targets ATP-dependent protease and kills M. tuberculosis with a high specificity while offering no hemolysis and low cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. Without the clear presence of persistence, lassomycin demonstrated a stronger bactericidal effect against stationary M. tuberculosis than rifampin [51].

Azole resistance mechanisms are developed by (1) altering 14-\u03b1-demethylase to decrease the binding affinity, (2) overexpressing efflux pump ABC transporters, and (3) altering sterol biosynthesis to incorporate 14-\u03b1-methyl fecosterol in the cell membrane instead of ergosterol [108]. Another frontline prescription for a systemic fungal infection is amphotericin B, a polyene macrolide antibiotic produced by the type I polyketide synthetase (PKS) of Streptomyces nodosus [112]. The most accepted fungicidal mode of action is the pore creation model, in which polyenes bind to ergosterol to create an ion-channel-like complex and leak intracellular contents from the fungal cells. Other study models propose that amphotericin B acts similar to a hydrophobic \u201csponge\u201d and specifically extracts ergosterol from the fungal membrane. Given the mode of action of polyenes is heavily dependent on ergosterol, resistance mechanisms have been developed by changing the fungal membrane sterol composition.

By inhibiting the activity of fungal ribosomes and elongation factor 2, both of which are absent in mammalian cells, sordarins specifically impede the production of fungal proteins. However, no obvious candidates have been reported for clinical development and clinical trials [116,117]. Secondly, heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF) (17 in Figure 2), a tetramic-acid-containing macrolactam encoded by a PKS-NRPS hybrid gene cluster from Lysobacter enzymogenes C3, demonstrates strong activity in a wide range of fungi [118]. The antifungal mode of action and biosynthesis regulation factors were later thoroughly investigated by Prof. Du\u2019s lab; they found that HSAF inhibits the production of fungal sphingolipids by specifically targeting ceramide synthases of filamentous fungi which do not present in mammals and plants. Additionally, HSAF induced ROS-medicated apoptosis in Candida albicans and significantly reduced the fungal burden in a murine model [119,120]. Thirdly, turbinmicin (14), which we discussed previously as a great candidate from the polyketide class for multidrug-resistant fungal infection. Mode-of-action studies suggested that turbinmicin targets fungal-specific Sec14 of the vesicular trafficking pathway, in contrast to other antifungal drugs. In addition to its potent efficacy in vitro and in vivo, the low toxicity and well-tolerant dosage of turbinmicin pave the way for its imminent preclinical study and translational development [27].", "4.

Nowadays, genomic sequencing generates massive data and has become an integral part of modern biotechnological research. Its rapid growth has led to the development of bioinformatics tools that can analyze this information. The accumulative biosynthetic pathway research of numerous known compounds has assisted the development of algorithms to predict the enzymatic assembly lines (e.g., PKS and NRPS) and the structures of NPs derived from gene sequences. In addition to searching for NP biosynthesis enzymes, other mining approaches include (1) phylogeny-based excavation, (2) regulator screening, (3) tailored enzyme screening, (4) untargeted metabolomics, etc. Moreover, synthetic biology, molecular biology, and advanced analytical technologies are often integrated into today\u2019s natural product discovery strategies.
