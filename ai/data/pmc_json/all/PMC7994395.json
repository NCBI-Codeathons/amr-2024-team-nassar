["Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus colonize similar niches in mammals and conceivably compete for space and nutrients. Here, we report that a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus chromogenes ATCC43764, synthesizes and secretes 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a purine analog that suppresses S. aureus growth by inhibiting de novo purine biosynthesis. We identify a 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes and other coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis, S. pseudintermedius and S. capitis. Recombinant S. aureus strains harbouring this operon produce 6-TG and, when used in subcutaneous co-infections in mice with virulent S. aureus USA300, protect the host from necrotic lesion formation. Used prophylactically, 6-TG reduces necrotic skin lesions in mice infected with USA300, and this effect is mediated by abrogation of toxin production. RNAseq analyses reveal that 6-TG downregulates expression of genes coding for purine biosynthesis, the accessory gene regulator (agr) and ribosomal proteins in S. aureus, providing an explanation for its effect on toxin production.", "Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus colonize similar niches in mammals.

Moreover, lugdunin can stimulate host production of antimicrobial peptides and recruit immune cells to clear S. aureus infections12. Another strategy used by some CoNS including S. schleiferi and S. caprae is the secretion of autoinducing peptides that specifically block the activation of the agr quorum sensing system in S. aureus.

Mass spectrometry confirmed that both RN4220 pVCU116 tgs and S. epidermidis M23864:W2 produce 6-TG. Moreover, supernatants from both tgs-positive S. capitis strains had detectable levels of 6-TG, although ~20-fold less than that of RN4220 pVCU116 tgs or the other tgs-positive species that showed growth-inhibitory effects on S. aureus (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03A). Therefore, it is likely that the S. capitis strains did not inhibit S. aureus growth due to low amounts of secreted 6-TG. Next, we assessed whether expression of the tgs operon from both S. chromogenes and S. capitis is detrimental to RN4220, a S. aureus cloning strain. Both RN4220 ptgs and RN4220 pVCU116 tgs show a growth defect compared to RN4220 pEmpty, revealing that 6-TG production is detrimental to the growth of the producing S. aureus strain RN4220 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03B).", "Expression of tgs genes ameliorates S. aureus virulence in vivo", "Expression of tgs genes ameliorates S. aureus virulence in vivo", "Expression of tgs genes ameliorates S. aureus virulence in vivo", "Our results demonstrated that staphylococci that express the tgs operon inhibit S. aureus growth in vitro. To determine whether these strains can offer protection to the host and antagonize S. aureus in vivo, we performed co-infection experiments using S. aureus USA300 and tgs-negative or -positive S. epidermidis strains in a subcutaneous infection model, as these species are known to co-colonize on human skin11,24. We mixed S. aureus with either a tgs-negative or -positive S. epidermidis strain in a 1:1 ratio and measured the size of lesions over time. Importantly, we observed that co-infections with a tgs-positive S. epidermidis strain reduced skin damage caused by S. aureus compared to co-infections with a tgs-negative S. epidermidis strain (Fig.\u00a04a, b). Admittedly, these experiments using different S. epidermidis strains were correlative. However, to demonstrate a causative effect of tgs genes, we repeated these co-infection experiments by combining S. aureus USA300 (produces necrotic lesions) with S. aureus RN4220 (does not produce necrotic lesions) carrying either pEmpty or ptgs. Remarkably, we observed that co-infections with RN4220 ptgs resulted in significantly smaller lesions compared to co-infections with RN4220 pEmpty (Fig.\u00a04c, d).

To accomplish this, we cultured both wild-type S. aureus and its purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 derivative to exponential phase (OD600\u2009=\u20091.0) and exposed them to 6-TG for 1\u2009h before collecting the cells and extracting the RNA to perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Some of the most upregulated genes upon exposure to 6-TG were CodY-regulated genes, such as branched chain amino acid synthesis genes. We attribute this to the effects 6-TG has on repressing guanine levels and, thus, guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is an effector molecule of CodY DNA binding and thus its transcriptional repression34. However, to understand how 6-TG inhibits toxin production in S. aureus, we focused our analyses on transcripts that were repressed by 6-TG. As expected, transcripts from the pur operon were significantly downregulated in wild-type cells treated with 6-TG, owing to the drug\u2019s effect on purine biosynthesis. Surprisingly, transcripts from the agr operon and over 40 genes that encode for ribosomal proteins were also significantly reduced by 6-TG in wild-type cells (Fig.\u00a07a). These results suggest that 6-TG abrogates toxin production in S. aureus in two ways; it downregulates transcription from the global virulence regulator agr and it globally reduces protein synthesis by preventing ribosomal proteins from being synthesized, which consequently impedes toxin production. Indeed, 1-h treatment with 6-TG already reduces the expression of hla by 1.65-fold (40%) (Supplementary Data\u00a02). To determine which effects are purine-dependent or -independent, we compared transcript levels between WT and purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 in cultures treated and untreated with 6-TG (Fig.\u00a07b). Strikingly, there was a strong overlap in genes that were affected by the purK mutation in S. aureus (Fig.\u00a07b), versus WT treated with 6-TG (Fig.\u00a07a). Indeed, there was a significant reduction in transcripts from the pur operon because purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 is inherently deficient in purine synthesis. However, the number of transcripts from genes that encode for many ribosomal proteins was also reduced compared to wild-type cells, suggesting a link between purine biosynthesis and ribosome synthesis. Interestingly, transcripts from the agr operon are reduced to a lesser extent in the purine biosynthesis mutant compared with WT that has been treated with 6-TG (Fig.\u00a07b, c.f. a), suggesting that the effects 6-TG has on agr are not fully purine-dependent. In support of this, transcripts from agr are reduced further when the purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 culture is treated with 6-TG relative to the untreated purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 culture (Fig.\u00a07c).

Altogether, these data show that 6-TG drastically reduces ribosome synthesis in a purine-dependent manner and blocks agr activation in both a purine-dependent and -independent manner.

Surprisingly, transcripts from the agr operon and over 40 genes that encode for ribosomal proteins were also significantly reduced by 6-TG in wild-type cells (Fig.\u00a07a). These results suggest that 6-TG abrogates toxin production in S. aureus in two ways; it downregulates transcription from the global virulence regulator agr and it globally reduces protein synthesis by preventing ribosomal proteins from being synthesized, which consequently impedes toxin production. Indeed, 1-h treatment with 6-TG already reduces the expression of hla by 1.65-fold (40%) (Supplementary Data\u00a02). To determine which effects are purine-dependent or -independent, we compared transcript levels between WT and purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 in cultures treated and untreated with 6-TG (Fig.\u00a07b). Strikingly, there was a strong overlap in genes that were affected by the purK mutation in S. aureus (Fig.\u00a07b), versus WT treated with 6-TG (Fig.\u00a07a). Indeed, there was a significant reduction in transcripts from the pur operon because purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 is inherently deficient in purine synthesis. However, the number of transcripts from genes that encode for many ribosomal proteins was also reduced compared to wild-type cells, suggesting a link between purine biosynthesis and ribosome synthesis. Interestingly, transcripts from the agr operon are reduced to a lesser extent in the purine biosynthesis mutant compared with WT that has been treated with 6-TG (Fig.\u00a07b, c.f. a), suggesting that the effects 6-TG has on agr are not fully purine-dependent. In support of this, transcripts from agr are reduced further when the purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 culture is treated with 6-TG relative to the untreated purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 culture (Fig.\u00a07c). No significant differences in the number of transcripts were found when comparing the transcriptome of the purK::\u03a6\u039d\u03a3 mutant and wild-type cells when both cultures were treated with 6-TG (Fig.\u00a07d). Altogether, these data show that 6-TG drastically reduces ribosome synthesis in a purine-dependent manner and blocks agr activation in both a purine-dependent and -independent manner. As a result, production of proteinaceous toxins will be significantly diminished as translation is blocked by 6-TG.Fig. 76-TG abrogates toxin production by reducing transcription from the agr locus and from genes encoding for ribosomal proteins.a RNA-seq analysis of wild-type S. aureus cultures treated with a vehicle control or 6-TG (10\u2009\u00b5g/mL) in TSB.
