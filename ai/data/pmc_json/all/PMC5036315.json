["In enterococci and in Streptomyces coelicolor, a glycopeptide nonproducer, the glycopeptide resistance genes vanHAX are colocalized with vanRS. The two-component system (TCS) VanRS activates vanHAX transcription upon sensing the presence of glycopeptides. Amycolatopsis balhimycina, the producer of the vancomycin-like glycopeptide balhimycin, also possesses vanHAXAb genes. The genes for the VanRS-like TCS VnlRSAb, together with the carboxypeptidase gene vanYAb, are part of the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which is located 2 Mb separate from the vanHAXAb. The deletion of vnlRSAb did not affect glycopeptide resistance or balhimycin production. In the A. balhimycina vnlRAb deletion mutant, the vanHAXAb genes were expressed at the same level as in the wild type, and peptidoglycan (PG) analyses proved the synthesis of resistant PG precursors. Whereas vanHAXAb expression in A. balhimycina does not depend on VnlRAb, a VnlRAb-depending regulation of vanYAb was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNA-seq analyses. Although VnlRAb does not regulate the vanHAXAb genes in A. balhimycina, its heterologous expression in the glycopeptide-sensitive S. coelicolor \u0394vanRSSc deletion mutant restored glycopeptide resistance. VnlRAb activates the vanHAXSc genes even in the absence of VanS. In addition, expression of vnlRAb increases actinorhodin production and influences morphological differentiation in S. coelicolor.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Bacteria need to respond to changes in their environment. Therefore, they require adequate means to gain and process information on the immediate surroundings. Such means are represented by two-component systems (TCSs), which are ubiquitous in all prokaryotes. A typical TCS consists of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR).1 The HK measures a specific external signal and autophosphorylates at a conserved histidine residue within the cytosol. This phosphoryl group is transferred to the associated RR. The activated RR initiates the cellular response.2 Most RRs are transcription factors that not only change the gene expression pattern of one or more genes of the cell, but also post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of RNAs and proteins, respectively, by RRs has been reported.3 The ability of bacteria to sense the signal enables them to react with an adaptive response.", "Bacteria need to respond to changes in their environment.

Its C-terminus extends into the cytoplasm and contains the kinase domain and the phosphorylation site.7 VanS senses the presence of glycopeptides and catalyses adenosine triphosphate-dependent autophosphorylation of a specific histidine residue. Subsequently, VanS transfers the phosphate group to an aspartate residue of VanR, which then activates the transcription of the resistance genes. However, under noninduction conditions, VanS acts as a phosphatase, removing the phosphate group from VanR.8", "Of special interest is the glycopeptide-sensing TCS VanRS that controls the expression of glycopeptide resistance genes in gram-positive pathogens,4,5 some glycopeptide producers, and other actinomycetes.6 VanS is a membrane-standing HK.

These substitutions result in a 1000-fold11 or 6-fold12 decreased binding affinity of the glycopeptide to its target, respectively.

Since regulatory genes are often colocalized with its target genes, we speculated that VnlRSAb might control vanYAb, which is located directly adjacent to vnlRAb and which encodes a carboxypeptidase. Previous studies showed that VanYAb cleaves the d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide from the PG precursors, but it is not able to cleave the d-Ala-d-Lac depsipeptide.27 To investigate, whether VnlRAb regulates the expression of vanYAb, transcriptional analyses were performed. RT-PCR analyses revealed that vanYAb was only transcribed when vnlRAb was expressed under the control of the strong promoter ermE*p (Fig. 2 (A. balhimycina [vnlRAb]). In A. balhimycina WT, transcription was detectable on a low level only after 63\u2009hr of cultivation and in the A. balhimycina \u0394vnlRAb mutant, vanYAb transcription was not induced at all (Fig. 2). This result was confirmed by RNA-seq analyses where we compared the transcription level of vanYAb in the A. balhimycina WT and A. balhimycina \u0394vnlRAb (data not shown). The transcription of vanYAb was 25-fold decreased in A. balhimycina \u0394vnlRAb compared with A. balhimycina WT.
