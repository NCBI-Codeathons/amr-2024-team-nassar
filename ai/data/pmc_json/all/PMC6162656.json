A rational solution against fungal infection aims to manipulate fungal metabolism or to block enzymes essential for Aspergillus survival. Here we discuss and compare different bioinformatics approaches to analyze possible targeting strategies on fungal-unique pathways. For instance, phylogenetic analysis reveals fungal targets, while domain analysis allows us to spot minor differences in protein composition between the host and fungi. Moreover, protein networks between host and fungi can be systematically compared by looking at orthologs and exploiting information from host\u2013pathogen interaction databases. Further data\u2014such as knowledge of a three-dimensional structure, gene expression data, or information from calculated metabolic fluxes\u2014refine the search and rapidly put a focus on the best targets for antimycotics. We analyzed several of the best targets for application to structure-based drug design.

These, however, are often associated with a high mortality rate. The majority of fungal-related deaths are caused by the four genera: Cryptococcus, Candida, Pneumocystis, and Aspergillus. Aspergillus causes several types of infection: (i) chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, (ii) an invasive aspergillosis, and (iii) it is a strong aeroallergen, causing allergies and asthma (reviewed in [7]).

Large-scale interspecies host\u2013pathogen protein networks (HP-PPIN) are moreover an important foundation for the understanding of the ways how pathogens interact, invade, and seize control of the human host. Pathogenic proteins tend to interact mainly with hubs and bottlenecks in the PPIN [39,40]. The connectivity in the host\u2013pathogen interactome is directly related to the pathogen fitness during infection [41]. Therefore, high degree proteins of the pathogen in HP-PPIN are promising drug targets. The wiring of PPIN can be determined by a variety of binary and co-complex methods, however, these methods are not suitable for genome-scale prediction of HP-PPIN. Nevertheless, experimental high throughput assays typically include a high number of false positive protein\u2013protein interactions [42] so that there is an enduring need for efficient computational methods to scrutinize and counter-screen existing experimental data. Such methods include the interolog method [43], domain information [44], gene ontology (GO) annotations [45], and information about cellular localization [46,47]. Demonstrating such features in a graphical representation of the interaction network provides an intuitive overview and useful insights to help and analyze complicated relations between host and pathogen [48,49,50]. For instance, the A. fumigatus-human and C. albicans\u2013human host\u2013pathogen protein\u2013protein interaction network was determined starting from human and yeast intraspecies networks and looking at sequence similar proteins in these fungi with similar interactions with the host [48]. Such a network represents all predicted host\u2013pathogen interactions which were found to be conserved by sequence conservation. To determine the best drug targets in pathogens from such a network, it is necessary to analyze the network further, in particular in terms of topology of the proteins in the network and function of interacting host-proteins.", "In this pursuit, the availability of the sequenced genome of A. fumigatus [51] has paved the way to discover drug targets through network analysis [28]. Topological analysis of the A. fumigatus interactome reveals several hubs and bottlenecks. Because of the higher connectivity compared to other proteins in the network, hubs are often involved in multiple functions, while connecting proteins, so-called bottlenecks, are important for the flow of information among different functional modules. Consequently, deletion of a hub protein or a connecting bottleneck protein can be lethal for the fungus. The top 20% of network proteins based on (hub) degree rank and (bottleneck connectivity rank can be considered to be functionally important, and re-ranking of protein \u201ciP\u201d can be calculated based on HBrank(iP) that gives both ranks equal weight\nHBrank(iP)=Rankde(iP)+Rankbe(iP)", "In this pursuit, the availability of the sequenced genome of A. fumigatus [51] has paved the way to discover drug targets through network analysis [28].

Metabolic processes are a key component of the factors that determine the dynamics and virulence of the pathogens. In the host\u2013pathogen interaction, many interactions rely on metabolic processes. This includes the competition for common resources, exchange of nutrients, and chemical communications. Metabolic networks can be reconstructed for the pathogen on both the small-scale and genome scale. Small-scale reconstruction focuses on a specific metabolic pathway network. For instance, the central carbohydrate metabolism may be easily calculated, pointing out central enzymes involved in many pathways or carrying a lot of flux. Hereby, some previous knowledge or bioinformatics data or biochemical data can help to reveal promising targets in central fungal pathways. In contrast, genome-scale reconstruction requires the complete genome sequence and refined annotation of all the reactions and biomass data [70]. This is very time-consuming and labor-intensive, however, the sum of calculations then directly points out the best targets in pathogens. Thus, Lee and coworkers reconstructed a model of Staphylococcus aureus and identified various antimicrobial drug targets [71]. The authors constructed the metabolic network using the genome annotation, functional-pathway analysis, and comparative genomic approaches and finally performed flux balance analysis (FBA)-based in silico single and double gene deletion experiments to identify novel drug targets. Similarly, to analyze fungal drug targets comprehensively, genome-scale metabolic network of A. fumigatus can be reconstructed [28]. Reconstruction means starting from biochemical databases to get a full list of all involved enzymes, and critically reexamining this list taking genome annotation, domain, and sequence analysis into account. Otherwise, one cannot be sure on the full repertoire of enzyme in this organism. Next, EMA takes this well-established list of enzymes and their reactions (the so-called stoichiometric matrix) to calculate the elementary flux modes (EFMs). The set of EFMs is unique and can represent any possible physiological situation in a cellular system. Aside from recovering canonical pathways, the EFM prediction approach also predicts a large number of unobserved potential pathways that emerge from a combination of active reactions in the network [72]. For this reason, the EFM approach is ideal to explore the richness inherent in a metabolic network and consequently to elucidate novel pathways [73,74]. To reconstruct a model for EMA, the set of directional metabolic reactions is a prerequisite. Defining the directionality of the reactions and finding all the optimal EFMs in a big reaction set is particularly challenging. Hence one needs a set of rules that can be followed to solve the problems with enzyme directionality and to have a tool that can break up big reaction sets into smaller connected networks that are easier to calculate using the EMA [75].

It was shown before that Aspergillus species can produce several toxic intermediates. Aspergillomarasmines were isolated from A. oryzae, A. flavus, and another fungal species [114] and have an inhibitory effect on angiotensin-converting enzymes and bacterial metallo-\u03b2-lactamases. The latter effect can defeat antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria and be a targeting molecule for the treatment of bacterial diseases [115]. Gliotoxin, the molecule of the epipolythiodioxopiperazines family, is produced by several fungal species including A. fumigatus and C. albicans. Gliotoxin is very toxic with the oral LD of 67 mg/kg with an immunosuppressive and proapoptotic effect on the mammalian cells [116,117]. Two toxicity modes of the gliotoxin were already reported: it acts as a redox-activator and generates the reactive oxygen species which can have a lethal effect on the cells, and it interacts with the proteins containing the free thiol groups [118]. Gliotoxin self-induces its biosynthesis by the activating of the gli cluster, however, the fungi are able to protect themselves against its harmful effect. The gli cluster consists of 13 genes in a positive feedback manner, where the transcriptional activator gliZ initiates the gliotoxin biosynthesis [119]. Self-protection of the fungus against the own gliotoxin is mediated by the enzyme GliT, a gliotoxin reductase [120]. The deletion of the gliT affects cell growth only in the presence of the gliotoxin and is not essential for its virulence [121]. Surprisingly, similar enzymes have been found in bacteria besides fungi, which can also facilitate the auto-protection against the epipolythiodioxopiperazines, such as holomycin production by Yersinia ruckeri and Streptomyces clavuligerus [122,123].

Hu at al. demonstrated that inactivation of erg11A or erg11B genes does not lead to a clear phenotype in A. fumigates. The erg11 homologs can compensate the inactivation of the other gene, thus a drug treatment would have to effectively target both genes to inhibit the growth of the fungi [127]. An in vivo transposon mutagenesis system (random insertional mutagenesis) for searching of essential genes of A. fumigatus was introduced in the paper in Firon et al.

The aflatoxin metabolic pathway can be inhibited by several proteins produced by Streptomyces.

These metals are two-facing players in the fungal body: they are essential coenzymes for enzymes (e.g., Sod1, CrpA, CmtA, AceA); however, they are also a catalyst in toxic ROI-generating Fenton chemistry [134]. Hence, the iron-acquisition system is a promising target for drug design because the proteins importing the ferri-siderophores were found only in the fungi, thus they do not affect the human cells. Adaptive behavior of A. fumigatus in the excess or lack of the metals can be investigated through several approaches. Linde et al. [135], in his pioneering work, designed the top-down method using the gene expression time-series data to build the regulatory network and predict the interactions between the transcription factors and target genes to study the iron regulation. However, this method requires a large set of data and parameters, which can be incomplete and thus this approach has limitations. Brandon et al.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that fungi can effectively respond to metal starvation and oxidative stress at the transcriptome and proteome level. A comprehensive study recently published by Kurucz et al. [137] involved trancriptomic analysis, functional annotation, and proteomic profiling to reveal response of A. fumigatus to iron depletion.

We describe several different bioinformatics pipelines, by which we can find numerous new fungal targeting strategies. In general, one should consider the biology of the fungal species, compare virulence and pathogenesis to spot interesting fungal-specific differences. For this, an evolutionary perspective is important, too. For instance, A. fumigatus is a versatile survivor, usually with a saprophytic life style and only causes disease, if there is an immunocompromised person infected. Thus, the only real \u2018weapon\u2019 it uses are toxins such as gliotoxin, developed against amoeba\u2014its natural enemy that exists in its usual ecosystem. The adequate strategy to cope with the fungal infection is to take a closer look at metabolic pathways, enzymes involved in the synthesis and maintenance of the cell wall and regulation.
