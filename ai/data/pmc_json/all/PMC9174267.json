["Notwithstanding the fact that streptomycetes are overlooked in clinical laboratories, studies describing their occurrence in disease and potential pathogenicity are emerging. Information on their species diversity in clinical specimens, aetiology and appropriate therapeutic treatment is scarce. We identified and evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility profile of 84 Streptomyces clinical isolates from the Czech Republic. In the absence of appropriate disk diffusion (DD) breakpoints for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of Streptomyces spp., we determined DD breakpoints by correlation with the broth microdilution method and by the distribution of zone diameters among isolates. Correlation accuracy was high for 9 antibiotics, leading to the establishment of the most valid DD breakpoints for Streptomyces antibiotic susceptibility evaluation\u00a0so far. Clinical strains belonged to 17 different phylotypes dominated by a cluster of strains sharing the same percentage of 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with more than one species (S. albidoflavus group, S. hydrogenans, S. resistomycificus, S. griseochromogenes; 70% of isolates). AST results showed that Streptomyces exhibited intrinsic resistance to penicillin, general susceptibility to amikacin, gentamycin, vancomycin and linezolid, and high percentage of susceptibility to tetracyclines and clarithromycin. For the remaining antibiotics, AST showed inter- and intra-species variations when compared to available literature (erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), indicating a region-dependent rather than species-specific patterns.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Despite the great contribution of Streptomyces to medicine as a source of many bioactive compounds (antibiotics, immunosuppressants, antifungals and antivirals), they also have a potentially dark side and can cause infections in humans. The most common infection caused by Streptomyces is actinomycetoma, an endemic disease associated with S. somaliensis, S. sudanensis, S. griseus and S. viridis1\u20135. In addition to mycetoma, Streptomyces can also cause rare invasive infections such as pulmonary infections, bacteremias, brain abscesses, peritonitis and other diseases, mainly in immunocompromised patients (reviewed in6,7). New approaches using next generation sequencing have recently shown that Streptomyces are likely a common part of the human8\u201311. However, the role of clinical Streptomyces isolates of unknown aetiology reported in numerous studies12\u201314 remains unclear. Indeed, many Streptomyces secondary metabolites exhibit harsh effects in vitro (strong cytotoxic and \u03b2-hemolytic activities) and can play a significant role in the human immune response6. Moreover, examination of the genome of Streptomyces sp.

This may be due to increasing air pollution in industrial and agricultural areas (dust as a vector for Streptomyces spores), but also to a growing number of immunodeficient patients caused by extrinsic/external factors (e. g. HIV infection, immunosuppressive drugs, environmental toxins or malnutrition)20. Nevertheless, streptomycetes are still neglected in clinical practice, due to a lack of awareness of their clinical relevance and probably due to difficulties associated with their growth characteristics, which complicates their isolation in clinical laboratories. Streptomyces are usually slow-growing bacteria that are rapidly overgrown by common respiratory microbiota during routine cultivations. To eliminate the fast-growing bacteria, some mycobacteriological laboratories decontaminate clinical specimens with N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine-Sodium Hydroxide (NALC-NaOH). However, the negative effects of NALC-NaOH on the recovery of mycobacteria and Nocardia spp. have been reported21\u201323.

Antibiotics are grouped into categories according to zone diameter breakpoint settings. Table shows the proposed zone diameter breakpoints based on ZD-MIC correlation analysis altogether with ZDs distribution among clinical strains, proposed MIC breakpoints according to available breakpoints values in CLSI and EUCAST guidelines and according to ZDs distribution among clinical strains. Parameters of the correlation analysis are provided: Pearson correlation coefficient (r), VM \u2013 very major error, false-susceptible by DD; M \u2013 major error, false-resistant by DD; m- minor error, one of the test results is intermediate and the other is susceptible or resistant. Antibiotic susceptibility distribution of clinical strains based on proposed ZD breakpoints and wild type cut-off (COWT) calculated for clinical strains in the cluster C. Abbreviations: R = resistant, I = intermediate susceptible, S = susceptible; \u2460 minimum ZD values were proposed as susceptibility breakpoints (type strain DSM 40783 was excluded for vancomycin and BCCO 10_1638 for amikacin), since predominantly susceptible strains (BM method) were present; \u2461 only 78 clinical isolates were included, cluster D was excluded; \u2462 abnormal standard deviation; \u2463 only 29 clinical isolates were tested.

For the first time, we performed a correlation between the BM and DD method in AST of Streptomyces. Most of the strains in our study were isolated from patients suffering from chronic respiratory disease (59.5%), although it is not clear whether they were the cause of the disease, represented a secondary bacterial infection, or they were common colonizers of the human body.

Nevertheless, there are indications that most of the MDR systems are suppressed under laboratory conditions and Streptomyces species are therefore generally considered to be drug sensitive66. In our study, we found strains with a wide range of resistance patterns, from generally susceptible to MDR strains. It is noteworthy that one of the most resistant clinical strains in our study, Streptomyces sp.

The ZD value of the only one non-wild type isolate of cluster C that changed susceptibility category compared to wild type isolates balances at the ZD breakpoint value. Therefore, our data suggest a rather species-specific susceptibility profile of Streptomyces. To confirm our findings, we compared the antibiograms of the cluster C strains with those presented in the only study on clinical isolates of S. albidoflavus (Spain) in the literature to date14. All our isolates from cluster C were resistant to ERY and SXT, as reflected also in a low COWT value in case of ERY (COWT for SXT was not calculated since all strains lacked an inhibition zone). Contrary, only 24% of S. albidoflavus isolates from Spain were resistant to ERY. This discrepancy suggests local adaptation of the cluster C species to unique selection pressures in different regions, including differences in agriculture, industry, lifestyle, and also antibiotic and other drug policy (higher consumption of SXT and macrolides in Czech Republic compared to Spain)67,68. Spontaneous mutations conferring ERY-resistance under selection pressure have already been demonstrated in the model actinomycetes S. coelicolor and S. lividans69 and are associated with point mutations in rrnA-23S rRNA\u00a0and rrnC-23S rRNA70.

This led to the determination of DD susceptibility breakpoints derived from MIC breakpoints for Streptomyces\u2014related organisms. To the best of our knowledge, these are the most valid DD breakpoints for Streptomyces reported to date. Tentative breakpoints have been proposed for 10 additional antibiotics, however, these breakpoints were designed primarily for the purpose of this study. Further analyses, such as correlation analyses, are recommended. All tested clinical isolates were susceptible to AKN, GEN, VAN and LIZ which is in agreement with literature, therefore these antibiotics can be chosen as empiric treatment for Streptomyces-associated infections. A low percentage of resistant isolates (\u02c2 10%) was found in our study for tetracyclines, CLR, CIP and AMC, however, data for CIP and AMC susceptibility differs in literature (Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, Streptomyces are intrinsically resistant to penicillin, and have a high percentage of resistance to cephalosporins. Other antibiograms (ERY and SXT) appear to be regionally driven, rather than species-specific and thus AST must be performed prior therapy. The treatment with ERY and SXT associates with a high risk of failure due to acquired resistance and should be reconsidered. Our study also emphasizes that Streptomyces are emerging in clinical practice, although still largely neglected, and points out the importance of optimizing techniques for selective isolation from clinical specimens.
