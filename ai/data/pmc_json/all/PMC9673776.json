["ABSTRACT", "Plant-based secondary metabolite production system is well established. However, host\u2013endophyte interaction in the production of secondary metabolite is a new less exploited area that is overcoming barriers and evolving as one of the prospective fields. Endophytes such as bacteria or fungi have the ability to produce some of the secondary metabolites that mimic the plant metabolites therefore escaping the host defence system. Coumarin is one such metabolite with immense biological functions. Most of the studies have demonstrated coumarin production from fungal endophytes but not bacterial endophytes. Herein, we present an overview of all the coumarin derivatives produced from endophytic sources and their biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, the review also throws light on the isolation of these coumarins and different derivatives with respect to their biological activity. The biotransformation of coumarin derivatives by the action of endophytic fungi is also elaborated. The present review provides an insight on the challenges faced in the coumarin production through fungal endophytes.", "KEYWORDS", "Introduction", "Introduction", "An intricate cost\u2013benefit plant-microbe association that remains symptomless and unobtrusive inside the plant tissues is represented as endophytism. This phenomenon is described as the ability of the microorganism to remain within the plant host without discernibly harming the host (Salvatore et al. 2020). An amalgamation of an extremely committed mutualism and ardent parasitism and saprophytism causes specialised interactions between the microbe and its host plant. Studies have proven the association of plants with microbes right from the first appearance of plants on earth. Studies by Guerin (1898) identified the first fungi associated with plant; de Bary (1866) coined the term endophyte referring to the microorganisms present in the plant tissues. The discovery of the presence of Neotyphodium coenophialum in the grass Festuca arundinacea is marked as a milestone in the endophyte research that was identified to cause fescue toxicosis in cattle (Bacon et al. 1977). Eventual research identified that in fact these plants contained toxic alkaloids that were the cause of the disease and that the fungi itself was imparting tolerance to the plant from biotic and abiotic stress (Schardl et al. 2004).", "An intricate cost\u2013benefit plant-microbe association that remains symptomless and unobtrusive inside the plant tissues is represented as endophytism.

As a result of this crosstalk, a large amount of complex metabolic flux occur leading to the production of several primary and secondary metabolites that contain a huge medicinal and pharmacological significance (Borges et al. 2009; Debbab et al. 2013; Mousa and Raizada 2013). A large number of bioactive substances are produced by the endophytic microorganisms with potential therapeutic applications. Some of the popular metabolites produced from these endophytes include azadirachtin (Shirahatti et al. 2015), paclitaxel or taxol (Stierle et al. 1993), podophyllotoxin, hypericin, and emodin (Srikantaramas et al. 2007). The production of secondary metabolites is not a mere biochemical reaction but impacted at the molecular level and thus has a significant impact from the ecological standpoint. A plethora of novel bioactive compounds have been isolated and characterised from these endophytes and therefore attract enormous research on these lines. Variations in parameters such as pH, temperature, agitation, media composition, pO2, pCO2, and other physiological components result in the optimisation of the metabolite production (Stierle et al. 1993). Yet, the feasibility of their commercial production is still under question and requires attention. One of the key challenges that need to be addressed is the reduction of metabolite production owing to continuous subculturing of the axenic monoculture (Salvatore et al. 2020). To add to the woes, discoveries of the presence of secondary metabolites from such endophytes have mostly been performed from monocultures, and thus, the current understanding is insufficient to optimise the same for large-scale production (Guerin 1898).", "Similar studies towards understanding this multispecies crosstalk have led to direct effects on the organisms\u2019 phenotype and functional trait.

Recent study carried out by Srikantaramas et al. (2007) revealed that a plant product camptothecin produced by Camptotheca acuminata is also produced by its endophyte Fusarium solani. The role of this plant metabolite is known to inhibit topoisomerase I by associating with the complex formed between DNA and the enzyme. However, camptothecin produced by the endophyte imparts protection from the plant metabolite by altering specific amino acid residue on its topoisomerase I. A similar alteration was also observed in the topoisomerase I obtained from another endophyte thriving within the same plant, suggesting this modification of the endophyte to be against the host secondary metabolite (Guerin 1898). This demonstrates that while the plant employs secondary metabolite production as a mechanism to counter predation, the endophyte has evolutionarily adapted itself to prevent from being eliminated from the host. Without this intrinsic ability, the invading fungus is most likely to be killed by the action of camptothecin. Herein, the fungi should be programmed to prevent the attack by camptothecin before biosynthesis of its own. A similar camptothecin resistance is also observed in certain plants such as Ophiorrhiza japonica that possesses partial resistance against camptothecin inhibition by the modification of a few amino acids. However, this plant does not itself produce camptothecin, suggesting complex unknown mechanisms contributing to the imparted resistance (Srikantaramas et al. 2007). The concept of co-evolutionary adaptation does not explain the driving force for such an adaptation in this plant.

The simplest member of the coumarin family was first a plant derived compound obtained from Coumarouna odorata isolated by Vogel in 1820 (Guerin 1898). They are chemically made of a benzo-\u03b1-pyrone (2\u00a0H-1-benzopiran-2-one) nucleus. They have been classified as simple coumarins, furanocoumarins, pyranocoumarins, biscoumarins, triscoumarins, and coumarinolignans. They are biologically important molecules owing to the characteristics such as high solubility, simple structure, low molecular weight, and low toxicity, thus facilitating them to possess potent pharmacological properties. They are also used as additives in the food industry owing to their characteristic aroma.
