["Echinomycin is a natural product DNA bisintercalator antibiotic. The echinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces lasalocidi includes a gene encoding the self-resistance protein Ecm16. Here, we present the 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of Ecm16 bound to adenosine diphosphate. The structure of Ecm16 closely resembles that of UvrA, the DNA damage sensor component of the prokaryotic nucleotide excision repair system, but Ecm16 lacks the UvrB-binding domain and its associated zinc-binding module found in UvrA. Mutagenesis study revealed that the insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for DNA binding. Furthermore, the specific amino acid sequence of the insertion domain allows Ecm16 to distinguish echinomycin-bound DNA from normal DNA and link substrate binding to ATP hydrolysis activity. Expression of ecm16 in the heterologous host Brevibacillus choshinensis conferred resistance against echinomycin and other quinomycin antibiotics, including thiocoraline, quinaldopeptin, and sandramycin. Our study provides new insight into how the producers of DNA bisintercalator antibiotics fend off the toxic compounds that they produce.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Quinomycin antibiotics act by noncovalently binding to the DNA double helix1. They are DNA bisintercalators, compounds that bind reversibly to the DNA duplex by inserting a pair of aromatic ring groups in between adjacent base pairs of the DNA. There has been much interest in this family of compounds due to their potent antimicrobial and antitumor activity, culminating in a large body of biochemical, structural, and clinical knowledge2. However, mechanistic details about bacterial resistance against DNA bisintercalators remains limited. While no resistance element against these compounds has been discovered so far in pathogenic bacteria, it is prudent to identify and elucidate resistance mechanisms that are present in the natural environment. Knowledge of basic resistance mechanisms will allow researchers to develop new therapeutic strategies before quinomycin resistance becomes a clinical problem.", "Quinomycin antibiotics act by noncovalently binding to the DNA double helix1.

To test whether the insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for DNA binding, we prepared Ecm16-\u0394ID in which the insertion domain was replaced with a glycine-serine linker (Supplementary Figs.\u00a07, 8). We monitored the binding of Ecm16 and Ecm16-\u0394ID to a 32-bp DNA that contains a single echinomycin binding site (Supplementary Table 2). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that Ecm16 bound more tightly to echinomycin-bound DNA than normal DNA, whereas Ecm16-\u0394ID did not bind to either type of DNA (Fig.\u00a02a). Next, we measured the DNA binding affinity of Ecm16 and Ecm16-\u0394ID using fluorescence polarization. The dissociation constant for Ecm16-DNA-echinomycin and Ecm16-DNA was 11.8\u00a0nM and 60.2\u00a0nM, respectively (Fig.\u00a02b, Table 3).

Because Ecm16* bound preferentially to echinomycin-containing DNA yet it failed to confer echinomycin resistance, we predicted that Ecm16* could not hydrolyze ATP. To test this idea, we measured the ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16, Ecm16-\u0394ID, Ecm16*, and UvrA in the presence of drug-free DNA, echinomycin-bound DNA, fluorescein-modified DNA, and doxorubicin-bound DNA (Supplementary Table 2).
