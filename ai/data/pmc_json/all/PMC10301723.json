["Edited by: Yasser Nehela, University of Florida, United States", "Reviewed by: Alessandro Passera, University of Milan, Italy; Manoj Kumar Solanki, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland; Manish Kumar Dubey, Chandigarh University, India", "In the search for new crop protection microbial biocontrol agents, isolates from the genus Streptomyces are commonly found with promising attributes. Streptomyces are natural soil dwellers and have evolved as plant symbionts producing specialised metabolites with antibiotic and antifungal activities. Streptomyces biocontrol strains can effectively suppress plant pathogens via direct antimicrobial activity, but also induce plant resistance through indirect biosynthetic pathways. The investigation of factors stimulating the production and release of Streptomyces bioactive compounds is commonly conducted in vitro, between Streptomyces sp. and a plant pathogen. However, recent research is starting to shed light on the behaviour of these biocontrol agents in planta, where the biotic and abiotic conditions share little similarity to those of controlled laboratory conditions. With a focus on specialised metabolites, this review details (i) the various methods by which Streptomyces biocontrol agents employ specialised metabolites as an additional line of defence against plant pathogens, (ii) the signals shared in the tripartite system of plant, pathogen and biocontrol agent, and (iii) an outlook on new approaches to expedite the identification and ecological understanding of these metabolites under a crop protection lens.", "Introduction: Streptomyces-plant interactions and their role in crop protection", "Introduction: Streptomyces-plant interactions and their role in crop protection", "Microbial biocontrol offers an attractive \u2018green\u2019 alternative to widely used synthetic chemicals in the management of plant diseases and weeds, and there is a long history of bioprospecting for novel biocontrol strains (Barratt et\u00a0al., 2018; Collinge et\u00a0al., 2022). A microbial biological control agent (MBCA) is defined as a microorganism \u2013 or its natural products \u2013 used to combat pests, weeds, and diseases. MBCAs can function through one or more modes of action, (Collinge et\u00a0al., 2022). These include competition for nutrients and space, parasitism, host-induced resistance, or antibiosis through the action of antimicrobial specialised metabolites, hydrolytic enzymes, or phytotoxins (K\u00f6hl et\u00a0al., 2019; Boro et\u00a0al., 2022). Differing modes of action can be delivered through individual microbes, with varying specificity and efficacy towards individual pathogens, or alternatively, brought together in assembled microbial consortia (Mukherjee et\u00a0al., 2013; Fira et\u00a0al., 2018; Mukhopadhyay and Kumar, 2020; Blake et\u00a0al., 2021; Boro et\u00a0al., 2022). The association of multiple MBCAs leads to combined modes of action that can act synergistically, providing more effective disease control than individual microbes (Bahkali et\u00a0al., 2014; Minchev et\u00a0al., 2021). Recent studies highlight that the strategic combination and deployment of multiple modes of action should be considered to overcome current gaps in the design of microbial inoculants for crop protection. Identifying the ecological function and chemical diversity of microbial specialised metabolites is essential to predict synergistic interactions in biocontrol consortia and during host microbiome assembly.", "Microbial biocontrol offers an attractive \u2018green\u2019 alternative to widely used synthetic chemicals in the management of plant diseases and weeds, and there is a long history of bioprospecting for novel biocontrol strains (Barratt et\u00a0al., 2018; Collinge et\u00a0al., 2022).

In the field of plant health, Streptomyces spp. can exhibit beneficial functional traits through the production of specialised metabolites that enhance nutrient uptake, promote plant growth, alleviate abiotic stress, induce resistance, and prevent pathogen or pest invasion and establishment through nematicidal or insecticidal activities (Barka et\u00a0al., 2016; Rey and Dumas, 2017; Newitt et\u00a0al., 2019; O\u2019Sullivan et\u00a0al., 2021a; Park et\u00a0al., 2023). Although predominantly associated with beneficial relationships, a small group of Streptomyces can produce phytotoxins and show pathogenic characteristics towards plants (Rey and Dumas, 2017; Alam et\u00a0al., 2022).

Furthermore, for those Streptomyces spp. that reside as endophytes (most of which originate from bulk and rhizosphere soils), larger repertoires of specialised metabolites may be required, both to outcompete other organisms in multiple ecological niches (e.g., soil and plant endosphere), and as signals mediating interactions with host and associated microbiome. Given the size of BGCs, the expression of the biosynthetic components and subsequent biosynthesis of the specialised metabolites are energy demanding processes. To compensate for this energy cost, the benefit of their biological activity must be substantial, and the process tightly regulated (Hoskisson and Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez, 2018). In addition, the bacterium must maintain physiological regulation of specialised metabolite production for survival, growth, and sporulation processes.

As Streptomyces secondary metabolite diversity seems linked to interactions with hosts and microbial communities, future research on the characterisation of Streptomyces silent BGCs and cryptic secondary metabolites should take place in response to host environments (Seipke et\u00a0al., 2012; Nazari et\u00a0al., 2013).", "Recent advances in metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and metagenomics has helped to bridge the knowledge gap, shedding light on the activity of individual biocontrol agents within soils, the rhizosphere, and the endosphere, including the metabolic potential of the entire microbial community associated with plants (\nFigure\u00a02\n).", "Recent advances in metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and metagenomics has helped to bridge the knowledge gap, shedding light on the activity of individual biocontrol agents within soils, the rhizosphere, and the endosphere, including the metabolic potential of the entire microbial community associated with plants (\nFigure\u00a02\n).", "Figure\u00a02Schematic of current and emerging approaches used to identify and characterise Streptomyces MBCA and specialised metabolites.

As such, they can be engineered to respond to specialised metabolite activity (Liu et\u00a0al., 2015). For example, under the control of a metabolically responsive promoter or a specific metabolite ligand-binding receptor, biosensors are often expressed in a microbial host that in the presence or absence of a target molecule in the microbes environment activates a signal, such as fluorescence. Biosensors with sufficient sensitivity and/or adequate abundance of the reporter protein can facilitate spatial and temporal detection of metabolites. Biosensors have been frequently applied to Streptomyces within in vitro settings to identify conditions that improve antibiotic production or in molecular approaches to manipulate BGC expression (Ostash et\u00a0al., 2010; Guo et\u00a0al., 2015; Sun et\u00a0al., 2017; Kasey et\u00a0al., 2018; Li et\u00a0al., 2019).
