Here, we report an unexpected 2\u2019-phosphorylation of nucleoside biosynthetic intermediates in the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways. This phosphorylation is a unique cryptic modification as it is introduced in the third of seven steps during aminohexuronic acid (AHA) nucleoside biosynthesis, retained throughout the pathway\u2019s duration, and is removed in the last step of the pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of reported nucleoside BGCs suggests the presence of cryptic phosphorylation in other pathways and the importance of functional characterization of kinases in nucleoside biosynthetic pathways in general. This study also functionally characterized all of the enzymes responsible for AHA biosynthesis and revealed that AHA is constructed via a unique oxidative C-C bond cleavage reaction. The results suggest a divergent biosynthetic mechanism for three classes of antifungal nucleoside natural products.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Nucleoside natural products constitute an important class of molecules with diverse structures and biological activities useful in medicine, agriculture, and research1,2.

Interpretation of the 1H NMR spectra of a mixture of this product and its degraded compounds were challenging, but the absence of 1H signals at 2.0 \u2013 2.5 ppm suggested an oxidation of C6\u2019 (Supplementary Note). Based on the exact mass of this compound determined by LC-HRMS (+ 31.989 Da from 2\u2019-OAP, Supplementary Note) and its acceptance by the PLP-dependent aminotransferase NikK (Figure 3c; see below for details), which requires the presence of a ketone, the structure of this compound was inferred as a hydrate form of 6\u2019-hydroxy-5\u2019-keto-octosyl acid 2\u2019-phosphate (HKOAP, 15). The stereochemistry of C4\u2019, C6\u2019 and C7\u2019 of HKOAP cannot be assigned.

Nine of these kinases belong to the P-loop NTPase superfamily, including MalE (malayamycin; Figure 6a)22, PumH (pseudouridimycin)23, Mur28 (muraymycins)24, and Cpz12 and Cpz27 (caprazamycins)25. The malayamycin22 and pseudouridimycin23 BGCs contain other AHA biosynthetic enzymes or NikS homologs (Figure 6b). Mur28 kinase from the muraymycin pathway catalyzes the 3\u201d-OH phosphorylation of a GlyU-ADR disaccharide biosynthetic intermediate24, and homologous kinases are conserved among GlyU-ADR containing nucleoside BGCs (caprazamycin25, A-9028926, and muraminomycin27). A 3\u201d-phosphorylated caprazamycin precursor has been isolated28. More recently, while this manuscript was in revision, one of the muraymycin biosynthetic enzymes (Mur24) was reported to act specifically on 3\u201d-phosphorylated GlyU-ADR29. Therefore, these pathways likely involve cryptic phosphorylation. Eight other nucleoside BGCs contain putative kinases in families related to phosphorylation of nucleosides and carbohydrates (Supplementary Figure 8), and thus it is still conceivable that these kinases catalyze phosphorylation of carbohydrates or nucleoside/nucleotide biosynthetic intermediates.
