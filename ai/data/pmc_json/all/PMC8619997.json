["The activity of fumagillin, a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus fumigatus, has not been studied in depth. In this study, we used a commercial fumagillin on cultures of two cell types (A549 pneumocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages). This toxin joins its target, MetAP2 protein, inside cells and, as a result, significantly reduces the electron chain activity, the migration, and the proliferation ability on the A549 cells, or affects the viability and proliferation ability of the RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, the toxin stimulates the germination and double branch hypha production of fungal cultures, pointing out an intrinsic resistant mechanism to fumagillin of fungal strains. In this study, we also used a fumagillin non-producer A. fumigatus strain (\u2206fmaA) as well as its complemented strain (\u2206fmaA::fmaA) and we tested the fumagillin secretion of the fungal strains using an Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) method. Furthermore, fumagillin seems to protect the fungus against phagocytosis in vitro, and during in vivo studies using infection of immunosuppressed mice, a lower fungal burden in the lungs of mice infected with the \u2206fmaA mutant was demonstrated.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic fungus that can colonize diverse ecological niches facilitated by its great plasticity to adapt to different environments and the wide dispersal of its small, airborne spores called conidia [1,2]. The conidia allow A. fumigatus to reach all chambers of the human respiratory tract, where the fungus is able to cause a wide range of infections depending on the immune status of the patient [3,4,5,6].", "Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic fungus that can colonize diverse ecological niches facilitated by its great plasticity to adapt to different environments and the wide dispersal of its small, airborne spores called conidia [1,2].

These include the fungal cell wall and the proteins involved in its formation, the resistance of the conidia to ultraviolet radiation and dryness, the mechanisms to evade the immune response, and the production of proteases and toxins [6]. In fact, the A. fumigatus genome contains a great variety of biosynthetic clusters [7,8] that provide the fungus with complex and bioactive secondary metabolites, including the production of toxins [9,10,11]. Among the variety of toxins produced by A. fumigatus, several have been linked with enhanced virulence and include gliotoxin [12,13,14,15], fumitremorgin A and B [16,17], hexadehydroastechrome [18], hemolysin, and mitogillin [19].", "The biological characteristics that allow A. fumigatus to colonize and/or infect the respiratory tract are known as virulence factors.

This toxin has been widely studied for other reasons, such as tumor control due to the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and its effect as an anti-tumor molecule [20]. Furthermore, it has been used as an antibiotic agent in the treatment against different pathogens, such as microsporidia, parasites, and as a treatment of diseases such as AIDS and obesity [21]. The mycotoxin is produced by a series of enzymes encoded in a biosynthetic cluster located on chromosome 8 of A. fumigatus [22]. The members of the biosynthetic cluster are overexpressed in the lungs of intranasally infected mice [23] and include the fumagillin pathway-specific transcription factor [24].

(D) Phagocytosis results of co-incubation of the three fungal strains and BMMs. (E) TNF production by BMMs during co-incubation with each fungal strain. All the experiments were done in triplicate in three independent assays. In each case and time point, co-cultures of Wt strain were used as control (* p < 0.05). In the case of panel (B), a solid triangle means p < 0.005 in comparison with the same time point in panel (A). Comparisons between different time points were not plotted.", "Figure 7Intranasal infection of a leukopenic mouse model with A. fumigatus. (A) Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis of infected mice during 20 days post intranasal exposition to Wt, \u2206fmaA, and \u2206fmaA::fmaA. The panel also shows the fumagillin production ability of the conidia used to inoculate the mice. (B) Fungal burden analysis of mouse lungs. The numbers inside the symbols represent the death day of each mouse; day 20 indicates survival at the end of the study period. Vertical lines show 50% mortality in each case. (C) Values of the clinical score throughout the experiment. (D) Evolution of the mice weight during the experiment. All the experiments were done in triplicate in three independent assays. Data of Wt strains were used as control (* p < 0.05).", "Intranasal infection of a leukopenic mouse model with A. fumigatus.
