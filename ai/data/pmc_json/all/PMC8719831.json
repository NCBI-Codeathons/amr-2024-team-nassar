["Summary", "Argyrins represent a family of cyclic octapeptides exhibiting promising immunomodulatory activity via inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis, which leads to reduced IL\u201017 production by the T\u2010helper 17 cells. Argyrins are formed by a non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), originating from the myxobacterial producer strains Archangium gephyra Ar8082 and Cystobacter sp. SBCb004. In this work, a previously established heterologous production platform was employed to provide evidence of direct D\u2010configured amino acid incorporation by the argyrin assembly line. An adenylation domain of the argyrin NRPS was characterized and shown to have a high preference for D\u2010configured amino acids. Eight novel argyrin derivatives were generated via biosynthetic engineering of the heterologous production system. The system was also optimized to enable formation of methylated argyrin C and D derivatives with improved immunosuppressive activity compared with their unmethylated counterparts. Furthermore, the optimization of cultivation conditions allowed exclusive production of one major derivative at a time, drastically improving the purification process. Importantly, engineering of transcription and translation initiation resulted in a substantially improved production titre reaching 350\u2013400\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121. The optimized system presented herein thus provides a versatile platform for production of this promising class of immunosuppressants at a scale that should provide sufficient supply for upcoming pre\u2010clinical development.", "In this study an adenylation domain of the argyrin NRPS was characterized and shown to have a high preference for D\u2010configured amino acids.

Among various compound classes with immunomodulatory activity, the best known examples are cyclosporine (Canafax and Ascher, 1983), FK506 (Wallemacq and Reding, 1993) and rapamycin (Dumont and Su, 1995), the latter approved for application in humans by the FDA in 1999 (Mann, 2001). Recent results have highlighted the importance of argyrins, identifying them as non\u2010competitive inhibitors of the human immunoproteasome (Allardyce and Bell, 2019). They were also shown to exhibit strong immunosuppressive activity by targeting the mitochondrial elongation factor (EF\u2010G1) in yeast and mammalian cells, thereby reducing the IL\u201017 production by the human T\u2010helper 17 cells (Almeida et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition to the immunosuppressive activity, argyrin A induces apoptosis and blocks angiogenesis by preventing the destruction of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27kip1 through proteasome inhibition (Nickeleit et\u00a0al., 2008; Stauch et\u00a0al., 2010).

A complex mixture of numerous derivatives, produced by the native or the heterologous producers, poses a downstream processing challenge when trying to produce a specific derivative with high purity. We applied extensive medium optimization to decrease the number of produced derivatives and thus simplify the future purification process. The heterologous argyrin producer yields about the same amount of argyrins A and B when cultivated in CTT medium. In contrast, it has previously been noticed that the argyrin production profile shifts substantially in favour of argyrin A when the Mx. DK1622::pArg2345 is cultivated in M7/s4 medium, probably due to the low external supply of L\u2010\u03b1\u2010aminobutyric acid (L\u2010Abu) (Fig.\u20093A) (Pogorevc et\u00a0al., 2019b).

Even though the argyrins N and N3 were not detected before, we also searched for them in the extract of the Mx. DK1622::pArg2345\u2010arg1 cultivated in the L\u2010serine supplemented medium. We indeed found very low amounts based on the MS peak intensity (Fig.\u20097). Cultivation in M7/s4 medium without addition of L\u2010Abu, but with supplementation of D\u2010serine, resulted in the detection of the L\u2010alanine (R1\u2009=\u2009CH3) and D\u2010serine (R2\u2009=\u2009CH2OH) containing argyrins M and M3 after HPLC\u2010MS analysis of the respective crude extracts (Table\u2009S5).

For assembly purposes, the StuI R\u2010site present in the promoter sequence had to be removed by exchange of a single nucleotide. The Ppm\n normally acts as an inducible promoter in pseudomonads; however, in M. xanthus, it was shown to work constitutively (Perlova et\u00a0al., 2006). The promoter fragments with the lengths of 233\u2009bp (Ppm\n), 803\u2009bp (Ptet\n), 169\u2009bp (Ptet\u0394R\n), 245\u2009bp (PnptII\n), 1145\u2009bp (Pvan) and 200\u2009bp (Pvan\u0394R\n) were released from the respective gene synthesis vectors and ligated into the pArg2345\u2010V1\u2010BsaI expression vector after restriction hydrolysis with SwaI and StuI.", "To evaluate the influence of other promoter systems on the production titre of argyrin, six new expression constructs with different promoter\u20105\u2019\u2010untranslated region (5\u2019\u2010UTR) combinations were designed. To minimize the transcriptional/translational influence of the native 5\u2019\u2010UTRs downstream of each promoter, a synthetically engineered 31\u2010bp\u2010long 5\u2019\u2010UTR (TACGAGAGCAAAAACGAGGAGAGGAGAAGAT) optimized for expression in M. xanthus DK1622 was designed using the RBS calculator tool (Salis and Mirsky, 2009; Espah Borujeni and Channarasappa, 2014), chemically synthesized and used to replace the native 5\u2019\u2010UTR region. Each synthetic fragment consisted of specific promoter followed by the 5\u2019\u2010UTR region and the first 61\u2009bp of the downstream arg2 gene and a unique StuI restriction endonuclease recognition sequence/site (R\u2010site) at the 3\u2019 end. For cloning purposes, all constructs were also flanked by a SwaI R\u2010site at the 5\u2019 end, allowing integration into the pArg2345\u2010V1\u2010BsaI expression construct as outlined in the Fig.\u2009S3. To design the nptII\u2010synRBS\u2010arg2 synthetic fragment, based on the PnptII\n of the neomycin phosphotransferase II resistance gene from Tn5 (Beck et\u00a0al., 1982), we used the same promoter sequence as originally used in the pArg2345\u2010V1\u2010BsaI expression construct. The only modification was the replacement of the 5'\u2010UTR region with the new, synthetic one and the introduction of the flanking restriction sites for the cloning purposes. The sequence of Pvan\n (Iniesta et\u00a0al., 2012) was used to design the Pvan\u2010synRBS\u2010arg2 fragment and only the first 100\u2009bp of the original Pvan\n promoter sequence was implemented to design the Pvan\u2010wo_vanR\u2010synRBS\u2010arg2 fragment with deleted repressor sequence in an attempt to make it function as a constitutive promoter system. The same approach was used in case of Ptet\n system (Chai et\u00a0al., 2012), to design Ptet\u2010synRBS\u2010arg2 and Ptet\u2010wo_tetR\u2010synRBS\u2010arg2 constructs. The first 63\u2009bp of the tet promoter sequence was used for the promoter version lacking the associated repressor gene. In case of the Ppm\n, originating from Pseudomonas putida, the improved version of the promoter system, generated by random mutagenesis approach (Bakke et\u00a0al., 2009), was used to design the Ppm\u2010synRBS\u2010arg2 sequence.

Furthermore, Mx. DK1622::pArg2345\u2010arg1 was also cultivated in M7/s4 medium supplemented with argyrin substrate amino acids (as described for the promoter screening experiment) and D/L\u2010serine without the addition of L\u2010Abu. Strains were inoculated from cryo stocks and grown on CTT agar plates supplemented with kanamycin 50\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121 (Mx. DK1622::pArg2345) or with kanamycin 50\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121 and zeocin 50\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121 (Mx. DK1622::pArg2345\u2010arg1) for several days until the plates were mostly overgrown with swarming cells. All of the cells were scraped from the plates to inoculate M7/s4 preculture medium (50\u2009ml medium in 300\u2009ml Erlenmeyer flask) and the seed cultures were cultivated at 30\u00b0C, 180\u2009rpm on an orbital shaker (Infors HT) for 48\u2009h. Five millilitre of the preculture was used to inoculate 50\u2009ml of the M7/s4 production medium in which the strain was grown under the same conditions for 6\u2009days. All cultures were supplemented with suitable antibiotics as mentioned above and production cultures were additionally supplemented with 4% Amberlite XAD\u201016 resin. All strains were initially cultivated in biological triplicates and technical triplicates of one clone were cultivated in the follow\u2010up experiments. The cultivations took 6\u20138\u2009days before harvesting by centrifugation at 8000\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min, and after the supernatant was removed the pelleted cells with Amberlite XAD\u201016 resin were extracted with 50\u2009ml of ethyl acetate twice. The extracts were filtered and dried in round bottom flasks on a rotary evaporator.
