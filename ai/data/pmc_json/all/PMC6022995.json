["Streptomyces is a diverse group of gram-positive microorganisms characterised by a complex developmental cycle. Streptomycetes produce a number of antibiotics and other bioactive compounds used in the clinic. Most screening campaigns looking for new bioactive molecules from actinomycetes have been performed empirically, e.g., without considering whether the bacteria are growing under the best developmental conditions for secondary metabolite production. These screening campaigns were extremely productive and discovered a number of new bioactive compounds during the so-called \u201cgolden age of antibiotics\u201d (until the 1980s). However, at present, there is a worrying bottleneck in drug discovery, and new experimental approaches are needed to improve the screening of natural actinomycetes. Streptomycetes are still the most important natural source of antibiotics and other bioactive compounds. They harbour many cryptic secondary metabolite pathways not expressed under classical laboratory cultures. Here, we review the new strategies that are being explored to overcome current challenges in drug discovery. In particular, we focus on those aimed at improving the differentiation of the antibiotic-producing mycelium stage in the laboratory.", "1. Introduction", "1.

In solid sporulating cultures, development starts with spore germination and the rapid development of compartmentalised hyphae into the medium (early substrate mycelium or MI) [3]. After that, programmed cell death (PCD) occurs (red cellular segments in Figure 1) which triggers the differentiation of the multinucleated (MII) antibiotic-producing hyphae (late substrate mycelium, early MII) [3,4]. Then, the mycelium starts to grow into the air forming the aerial mycelium (late MII). At the end of the cycle, there is a second round of PCD, and most of the remaining viable hyphae undergo a process of compartmentalisation that culminates in the formation of unigenomic spores [5].", "One of the most important characteristics of Streptomyces is its complex life cycle, which is closely related to secondary metabolite production [2] (outlined in Figure 1).
