The molecular mechanisms underlying the primary and secondary metabolic effects of rust spots on the leaves of Malus apple cultivars are poorly understood. Using HPLC, we found that the contents of flavonoid compounds, especially anthocyanin and catechin, were significantly increased in rust-infected symptomatic tissue (RIT). The expression levels of structural genes and MYB transcription factors related to flavonoid biosynthesis were one- to seven-fold higher in the RIT. Among these genes, CHS, DFR, ANS, FLS and MYB10 showed more than a 10-fold increase, suggesting that these genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in the RIT. Hormone concentration assays showed that the levels of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), jasmonate (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) were higher in the RIT and were consistent with the expression levels of McNCED, McACS, McLOX and McNPR1, respectively. Our study explored the complicated crosstalk of the signal transduction pathways of ABA, ETH, JA and SA; the primary metabolism of glucose, sucrose, fructose and sorbitol; and the secondary metabolism of flavonoids involved in the rust resistance of Malus crabapple leaves.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Gymnosporangium yamadai Miyabe, which is known as Cedar-apple rust, causes serious diseases and significant economic losses to apple cultivars (Lee et al., 2016). As the disease progresses, infected leaves exhibit expanding leaf spot lesions, which lead to complete leaf collapse (Sekiyama et al., 2017). The resistance responses of plants under stress include a series of complex morphological, physiological and molecular process changes, such as osmotic adjustments, hormone regulation and resistant component formation (Vorwerk et al., 2004; de Torres Zabala et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2014; Tauzin and Giardina, 2014). Flavonoids are the most important plant pigments, and they are involved in UV filtration and symbiotic nitrogen fixation and can also act as chemical messengers, physiological regulators, and inhibitors against organisms that cause plant diseases, e.g., Fusarium oxysporum (Zhu et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014, 2017). Anthocyanins are an important subgroup of flavonoids and have been shown to act as a \u2018sunscreen\u2019 and protect cells from high-light damage by absorbing blue-green and ultraviolet light in photosynthetic tissues, thereby protecting the tissues from photoinhibition or high stress. This protective effect has been shown to occur in red juvenile leaves, autumn leaves, and broad-leaf evergreen leaves that turn red during winter (Jaakola, 2013; Zhu et al., 2013; Oglesby et al., 2016). Flavonols and proanthocyanidins have been suggested to play a role in suppressing the growth of E. coli bacteria and greatly reducing the ability of these bacteria to initiate an infection (Ge et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2016; Shang et al., 2017). In tissues, these substances may act as antioxidants and significantly contribute to the scavenging of free radicals produced via metabolic processes in plants, whereas at the organ surface, visible coloring phenotypes may be displayed because of the accumulation of flavonoids during exposure to pathogen infection or environmental stress. Visible coloring caused by flavonoids could represent a potential indicator of stress in plants for use in early diagnosis and prevention strategies; however, the coloring pattern of different species of plants is diverse and the underlying mechanisms are complex (Mierziak et al., 2014; Peixoto et al., 2016).", "Gymnosporangium yamadai Miyabe, which is known as Cedar-apple rust, causes serious diseases and significant economic losses to apple cultivars (Lee et al., 2016).

This network in plants regulates the accumulation of flavonoid components, such as flavone, flavonol, flavanols, procyanidins and anthocyanins. When confronted with abiotic stress, the flavonoid composition in plant tissues and organs changes in response to possible cell damage, which induces changes in the coloring of visible parts (Cant\u00edn et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2014). For example, plants often produce pigments around wounds, pathogen infection sites, insect piercing and feeding sites, and physical injuries, with various color responses observed among different plant varieties and even in different tissues (Petre et al., 2012; Dubovskiy et al., 2013; Fogelman et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016).

Carbohydrates are important components in the adjustment process, and many studies have shown that when plants experience drought, low temperature, high temperature and certain biological stresses, their tissues will accumulate substantial levels of fructose and sorbitol to maintain cell turgor (Couee et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2016). In addition, the accumulation of carbohydrates in stressed plants may be associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, and previous reports have demonstrated that high C/N promotes the accumulation of flavanols and anthocyanins in plants via the upregulated expression of structure genes and MYB10, MYB4 and MYB7 (Wan et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2017). We suggest that carbohydrates, which are a component of osmotic regulation during pathogen infection, may contribute to the accumulation of flavonoids as a defense against infection and disease expansion because of their antioxidant properties. The plant hormones ABA, ETH, JA and SA have multiple effects on secondary metabolism, including the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (Das et al., 2012; Di et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017). For example, the study on grape berries demonstrated that ETH induced via the upregulated expression of the ACS gene regulated the accumulation of flavanols and anthocyanins by upregulating MYB transcription activities (Zhai et al., 2017). Recent study indicated that the accumulation of JA was stimulated by nematode infection together with LOX upregulation, which resulted in the accumulation of other second metabolites including flavonoids (Concha et al., 2013). ABA application in stressed plants have been shown to regulate many secondary metabolism pathways; thus, ABA may play an important role in regulating the expression of upstream genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis network (Cant\u00edn et al., 2007). SA is induced during biotic interactions and interact with JA and ETH-induced pathways, and play key roles in plant defense following pathogen attack (Robert-Seilaniantz et al., 2011; Di et al., 2017).

However, in the ever-green-leaf cultivar \u2018Flame,\u2019 yellow spots with unclear edges appeared because of obvious flavone and flavonol accumulation in the infected tissues. Therefore, the accumulation of flavonoids in two cultivars displayed obviously different coloration patterns when their leaves were infected by the rust pathogen, and even the uninfected and infected tissues of each cultivar presented differences in flavonoid metabolism.

Plants can initiate the whole network or parts of the network for defense, and different patterns of activation are observed when plants encounter biotic and environmental stress (Zhu et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014). Fogelman et al. (2015) reported that in the wound periderms of potato, the expression level of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and regulators was downregulated, which resulted in a color change in the wounded periderm. The results of our flavonoid composition analysis indicated that different resistance patterns to rust disease occurred via pigment accumulation during the expansion of rust spots, In this stage, \u2018Royalty\u2019 may adopt strategies related to the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and \u2018Flame\u2019 may adopt strategies related to flavonol and flavanol accumulation to resist the expansion of rust disease. In the infected leaves of \u2018Royalty,\u2019 the transcription level of the genes in the flavonoid pathway exhibited an initial activation followed by a late increase, which increased the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, and in the infected leaves of \u2018Flame,\u2019 the transcription level displayed a linear upward trend for flavonol and flavanol biosynthesis. MYBs such as McMYB10, McMYB4 and McMYB7 showed a positive regulation effect, and whereas McMYB16 displayed a negative effect, thereby activating different key genes in the same biosynthesis pathway of the infected leaves of the two cultivars.
