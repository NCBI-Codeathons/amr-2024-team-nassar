["Abstract", "", "", "Secondary metabolites (SMs) are biologically active small molecules, many of which are medically valuable. Fungal genomes contain vast numbers of SM biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with unknown products, suggesting that huge numbers of valuable SMs remain to be discovered. It is challenging, however, to identify SM BGCs, among the millions present in fungi, that produce useful compounds. One solution is resistance gene-guided genome mining, which takes advantage of the fact that some BGCs contain a gene encoding a resistant version of the protein targeted by the compound produced by the BGC. The bioinformatic signature of such BGCs is that they contain an allele of an essential gene with no SM biosynthetic function, and there is a second allele elsewhere in the genome. We have developed a computer-assisted approach to resistance gene-guided genome mining that allows users to query large databases for BGCs that putatively make compounds that have targets of therapeutic interest. Working with the MycoCosm genome database, we have applied this approach to look for SM BGCs that target the proteasome \u03b26 subunit, the target of the proteasome inhibitor fellutamide B, or HMG-CoA reductase, the target of cholesterol reducing therapeutics such as lovastatin. Our approach proved effective, finding known fellutamide and lovastatin BGCs as well as fellutamide- and lovastatin-related BGCs with variations in the SM genes that suggest they may produce structural variants of fellutamides and lovastatin. Gratifyingly, we also found BGCs that are not closely related to lovastatin BGCs but putatively produce novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", "Secondary metabolites (SMs) are biologically active small molecules, many of which are medically valuable.

Many fungal SMs are currently used in medicine, and they include antibiotics such as penicillin, antifungals such as the echinocandins, cholesterol-lowering agents such as lovastatin, and immune-modifying agents such as cyclosporine (reviewed in Bok et al., 2006; Demain, 2014; Keller et\u00a0al., 2005; Martin, 1998; Palaez, 2005). Almost universally, the genes that encode particular SM biosynthetic pathways are clustered together in the genome, forming biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Galagan et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2004). Secondary metabolite BGCs contain one or more core biosynthetic genes responsible for synthesizing the backbone of the SM as well as other genes that encode products that modify the backbone structure, influence production of the SM, or confer resistance to the SM. Generally, the genes within each BGC are coordinately regulated, in many cases being controlled by a transcription factor (TF) in the cluster (Brakhage, 2013; Keller et al., 2005; Keller, 2019; Macheleidt et al., 2016).", "Fungi produce a plethora of biologically active small molecules, called secondary metabolites (SMs).

In step 1, we create a database of comma separated values (CSV) files containing the genomic coordinates of all the core SM biosynthetic genes (DMATs, PKSs, NRPSs, and terpene synthases/cyclases) in MycoCosm. A useful feature of MycoCosm is that one can choose to focus on a particular class or phylum, but for all cases described in this manuscript, we created files for all the sequenced fungi in MycoCosm. To generate these core biosynthetic gene CSV files, one can use a variety of search options such as a BLAST search, a keyword search, or a EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG terms) search as defined by MycoCosm. To generate our NRPS file we used KOG term 1178 to generate a CSV file of all of the \u201cnon-ribosomal peptide synthetase/alpha-aminoadipate reductase and related enzymes\u201d on MycoCosm (27\u00a0807 genes).

The KOG1202 search gave the most complete file, yielding 27\u00a0249 genes. We have used it for all our analyses involving PKS genes in this paper and, henceforth, will refer to it as our PKS file.

It requires the user to download all the genomes being studied and is built to be used with unannotated genome sequences.

Another, that the authors point out, is that the current procedure for identifying core genes is imperfect. For example, there were no FunARTS hits for four notable resistance genes including HMGCR and the important antifungal target \u03b2-1,3-D-glucan synthase because they were not identified as core genes by the Hidden Markov Model employed in FunARTS.

The fact that we have found closely related clusters among members of phylogenetically distant organisms strongly suggests the clusters have been transferred horizontally. If the fellutamide clusters were exclusively inherited vertically, one would expect that they would fall into phylogenetically related phyla and be common in those phyla. Within the Eurotiomycetes, there appears to be both horizontal and vertical gene transfer. We found fellutamide clusters in 33 Aspergillus genomes and in T. paradoxa CBS 103.73 v1.0, which is phylogenetically distant, suggesting that T. paradoxa CBS 103.73 v1.0 acquired a fellutamide BGC through a horizontal gene transfer event. All of the Aspergillus genomes with fellutamide-family clusters, however, are members of species that are in sections Aeni and Nidulantes of subgenus Nidulantes (Chen et al., 2016). No other Aspergillus species had fellutamide clusters, and this strongly suggests that the fellutamide cluster was vertically inherited from a common ancestor of modern-day Aeni and Nidulantes section Aspergilli.
