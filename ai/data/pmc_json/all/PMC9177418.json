["Microorganisms contribute to the biology and physiology of eukaryotic hosts and affect other organisms through natural products. Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus (XP) living in mutualistic symbiosis with entomopathogenic nematodes generate natural products to mediate bacteria\u2013nematode\u2013insect interactions. However, a lack of systematic analysis of the XP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has limited the understanding of how natural products affect interactions between the organisms. Here we combine pangenome and sequence similarity networks to analyse BGCs from 45 XP strains that cover all sequenced strains in our collection and represent almost all XP taxonomy. The identified 1,000 BGCs belong to 176 families. The most conserved families are denoted by 11 BGC classes. We homologously (over)express the ubiquitous and unique BGCs and identify compounds featuring unusual architectures. The bioactivity evaluation demonstrates that the prevalent compounds are eukaryotic proteasome inhibitors, virulence factors against insects, metallophores and insect immunosuppressants. These findings explain the functional basis of bacterial natural products in this tripartite relationship.", "", "Entomopathogenic nematodes carrying Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria prey on insect larvae in the soil.

The BGC features six genes (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 4). leuABCD are involved in l-leucine biosynthesis. leuO is positioned next to leuA and encodes a global transcription factor involved in regulating natural-product biosynthesis43 and other physiological traits44. iocS encodes an enzyme belonging to the ANL (acyl-CoA synthetases, NRPS adenylation domains and luciferase enzymes) superfamily. Such a gene architecture is reminiscent of the biosynthesis of cystargolides45, during which 3-isopropylmalate as an intermediate in the leucine pathway is the precursor for one-step lactonization to afford 3-isopropyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanecarboxylic acid (IOC, 1) with a \u03b2-lactone moiety (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Natural products featuring a \u03b2-lactone moiety, such as omuralide, belactosins and cystargolides, have been proven to suppress the proteolytic activity of the core particle46,51.

Next, we attempted to re-examine the toxicity of pxb BGC products during the insect infection process by comparing it with that of aerobactin, an identified virulence-related siderophore in X. szentirmaii60. Because the X. szentirmaii PBAD\npxbF mutant synthesizes 2\u20137 only upon the induction of l-arabinose, none of the compounds can be produced by the mutant inside insects due to the absence of the l-arabinose inducer. Hence, a non-induced promoter exchange mutant is equal to a BGC knockout strain. We then injected X. szentirmaii wild-type strain, which produces 2\u20137 and toxic aerobactin encoded by the iuc BGC60, as well as the non-induced X. szentirmaii PBAD\niucA and non-induced X. szentirmaii PBAD\npxbF mutants into G. mellonella larvae (Fig. 4i). The wild-type strain killed insects 3.4\u2009h faster than the non-induced PBAD\npxbF mutant. Furthermore, the pxb BGC products exerted a greater impact on insect virulence than aerobactin in that the non-induced PBAD\niucA mutant killed insects 1.7\u2009h faster than the non-induced PBAD\npxbF mutant.", "Inspired by piscibactin being able to chelate gallium and ferric ions57, we set out to explore whether photoxenobactins are metallophores, because metallophores are essential for bacteria to acquire trace elements from environments and can have additional functions (for example, toxicity, signalling, protection and antibiotics)58. A fraction mainly containing pxb BGC products was incubated with different inorganic metal salts (for example, GaIII, FeIII, CuII, ZnII, MoVI and VV), and only piscibactin-GaIII/FeIII/CuII (10\u201312) and photoxenobactin D-GaIII/FeIII/CuII (13\u201315) were detected (Supplementary Fig. 16). An earlier report describes killing of Galleria mellonella upon injection of Escherichia coli carrying a pxb BGC from Photorhabdus asymbiotica. Ulbactin E and a compound with the sum formula C20H25O4N3S3, which was a putative desmethyl yersiniabactin, were found in the methanol extract of insect carcasses, suggesting both compounds as virulence factors against insects59. Indeed, C20H25O4N3S3 coincides with methyl ester piscibactin (9), a rearranged product of 6 that occurs in methanol, as observed herein (Supplementary Fig. 13).

Although GameXPeptides are one of the diagnostic chemotypes with high production titres in almost all XP15, their function has remained cryptic over the past decade. Our recent bioactivity screening for crude extracts produced by specifically overexpressed mutants19 indicated that GameXPeptides might be one of the bioactive contributors of wild-type strains inhibiting in vitro production of prostaglandin E2 without cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity. With the synthetic GameXPeptide A (16) in hand, we therefore pursued its possible suppression of insect immune responses. Insects rely on innate immunity consisting of cellular and humoral immune responses to overcome infections61. Cellular immune responses mediated by eicosanoids involve encapsulation that is performed by immune haemocytes along with morphological changes, melanization activated by phenoloxidase, nodulation and phagocytosis62. The cytoplasmic extension observed in the haemocytes of the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera exigua, as an immune response to the E. coli challenge, was remarkably inhibited by 16 (Fig. 5c) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5d), with an IC50 value of 17.2\u2009ng per larva (Supplementary Table 7). Although 16 exerted no suppression against the phenoloxidase activation (Fig. 5e), it remarkably decreased the number of nodules formed (Fig. 5f) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5g) with an IC50 value of 25.8\u2009ng per larva (Supplementary Table 8). These results suggest that 16 specifically suppresses insect haemocyte spreading and nodule formation upon insects being challenged by E. coli, and thereby defeats the insect cellular immune response. It is worth mentioning that the inhibitions of phenoloxidase activity and the proteolytic cascade leading to active phenoloxidase are accomplished by two known widespread compound classes, rhabduscin63 and rhabdopeptide/xenortide-like peptides7, respectively. Consequently, the functional characterization of ubiquitous GameXPeptides is a substantial advance toward deconstructing XP to suppress insect immune systems during symbiotic nematode invasion.Fig. 5BGCs, chemical structures and bioactivities of GameXPeptide A and lipocitides.a, Domain organization of GxpS. b, Chemical structure of GameXPeptide A (16). c, In vivo observation of haemocytes-spreading behaviour in different time intervals upon injection of 16\u201318 (1,000\u2009ng per larva) in S. exigua larvae.

The elevated NO level measured by the nitrate concentration in the haemolymph of S. exigua larvae caused by E. coli infection was suppressed by both compounds (Fig. 5j) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5k), with IC50 values of 2.37 and 0.42\u2009\u03bcg per larva, respectively (Supplementary Table 10).

In addition, 18 significantly suppressed phenoloxidase activation (Fig. 5e) and decreased the number of nodules formed (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Table 8).

Photorhabdus temperata subsp. thracensis DSM 15199 features seven BGC classes, whereas X. japonica DSM 16552 only has three classes (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The ioc/leu BGC responsible for IOC (1) biosynthesis was present across all XP genomes, but none of the NRPS GCFs universally exist in every XP species, though the NRPSs are the most abundant class. Indeed, the ioc/leu BGC is also widely distributed in other \u03b3-Proteobacteria, such as the free-living pathogens Vibrio cholerae and Y. pestis (Supplementary Table 3). Although this BGC has yet to be studied in other microorganisms and the degree of structural conservation of IOC (1) among \u03b3-Proteobacteria is unknown, it is conceivable that the conservation of structural genes leuA\u2013D for l-leucine biosynthesis and iocS for putative lactonization can serve as an indicator that IOC (1) is highly conserved among \u03b3-Proteobacteria inhibiting eukaryotic proteasomes.

In contrast to the precise target-oriented biosynthesis of the yersiniabactin BGC, it appears that the pxb BGC is more diversity-oriented, although the biosynthetic machinery remains cryptic. Yersiniabactin, with high affinities for ferric iron, contributes to the virulence of human pathogens like Y. pestis and E. coli72.
