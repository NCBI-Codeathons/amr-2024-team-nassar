Rosa roxburghii Tratt. has been reported to be a botanical source of antimicrobial compounds, which may represent a promising candidate for screening endophytic fungi with antimicrobial potential. In this study, 54 endophytes were isolated and molecularly identified from R. roxburghii. The preliminary screening using the plate confrontation method resulted in 15 different endophytic strains showing at least one strong inhibition or three or more moderate inhibition against the 12 tested strains. Further re-screening experiments based on the disc diffusion method demonstrated that Epicoccum latusicollum HGUP191049 and Setophoma terrestris HGUP190028 had excellent antagonistic activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test for extracellular metabolites finally indicated that HGUP191049 had lower MIC values and a broader antimicrobial spectrum, compared to HGUP190028. Genomic, non-target metabolomic, and comparative genomic studies were performed to understand the biosynthetic capacity of the screened-out endophytic fungus. Genome sequencing and annotation of HGUP191049 revealed a size of 33.24 megabase pairs (Mbp), with 24 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), where the putative antimicrobial compounds, oxyjavanicin, patulin and squalestatin S1 were encoded by three different BGCs, respectively. In addition, the non-targeted metabolic results demonstrated that the strain contained approximately 120 antimicrobial secondary metabolites and was structurally diverse. Finally, comparative genomics revealed differences in pathogenicity, virulence, and carbohydrate-active enzymes in the genome of Epicoccum spp. Moreover, the results of the comparative analyses presumed that Epicoccum is a promising source of antimicrobial terpenes, while oxyjavanicin and squalestatin S1 are antimicrobial compounds shared by the genus. In conclusion, R. roxburghii and the endophytic HGUP191049 isolated from it are promising sources of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.", "1 Introduction", "1 Introduction", "Endophytic fungi are generally recognized as a group of microorganisms that do not cause substantial damage to the host and live harmlessly in healthy plant tissues throughout a certain life cycle stage (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2018). The existence of fungi inside the tissues of healthy plants has been known as early as the late 19th century when endophytic fungi were first successfully isolated from darnel (Lolium temulentum) (Freeman, 1904; Kusari et\u00a0al., 2012). However, plant endophytic fungi had not attracted much attention as a new microbial resource until 1993. When an endophytic fungus, Ceriporiopsis andreanae (basionym Taxomyces andreanae), was isolated from Taxus brevifolia for the production of taxol, which initiated a surge in studies on endophytes (Stierle et al., 1993; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2022). Another excellent anticancer drug, vincristine is originally reported from Catharanthus roseus, endophytic Fusarium oxysporum isolated from this plant can also produce vinblastine and vincristine in appreciable amounts (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2013). The herb Artemisia annua L. is well known for its antimalarial properties and is the source of the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Madsen et\u00a0al., 2010). Extracts of both endophytic Penicillium and Talaromyces isolated from A. annua exhibited significant antimalarial activity (Alhadrami et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, endophytic fungi can produce the same natural products as their host plants. Importantly, microbial fermentation has several advantages over the use of plants for the production of bioactive substances, such as easy-to-operate, reducing the need for plants, and obtaining stronger active drug derivatives by varying the culture conditions (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2013).", "Endophytic fungi are generally recognized as a group of microorganisms that do not cause substantial damage to the host and live harmlessly in healthy plant tissues throughout a certain life cycle stage (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2018).

Of these compounds, squalestatin S1, oxyjavanicin, and patulin were reported to have antimicrobial activity (Nicolaou et\u00a0al., 1994; Paytubi et\u00a0al., 2017; Kato et\u00a0al., 2020). Genetic modification of BGCs and/or introduction of a particular mutation provides opportunities to obtain derivatives of the original metabolites (Ichikawa et\u00a0al., 2012). Genome mining of gene clusters encoding biosynthetic pathways of fungal secondary metabolites has become a critical approach for new compound discovery (Weber et\u00a0al., 2015). The sequencing and annotation of the Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 genome is the foundation for the identification of antimicrobial compound BGCs, the activation of silencing gene clusters, and the identification and regulation of biosynthetic pathways. In this study, non-targeted metabolic analyses further revealed the biosynthetic capacity and potential antimicrobial compounds of Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 by determining all detectable metabolites. Moreover, patulin, a compound encoded by gene cluster 16, has also been detected.", "The development of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, high-throughput technologies, and computational resources has significantly broadened the understanding of the key pathways affecting the synthesis of fungal secondary metabolites (Palazzotto and Weber, 2018). In this study, genomics, non-target metabolomics, and comparative genomics were performed further to investigate the biosynthetic capacity of Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049. Genes required for secondary metabolite synthesis are typically arranged in a multigene biosynthetic gene cluster (Yang et\u00a0al., 2019). With this high-quality genome sequence and annotation, we predicted a total of 24 BGCs, which may encode eight known compounds. Of these compounds, squalestatin S1, oxyjavanicin, and patulin were reported to have antimicrobial activity (Nicolaou et\u00a0al., 1994; Paytubi et\u00a0al., 2017; Kato et\u00a0al., 2020).

Epicoccum is a genus in which endophytic, saprophytic, and pathogenic modes of nutrition coexist, such as Ep. nigrum is a primary saprophyte involved in the retting of flax (Brown, 1984), an endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves of Lysidice rhodostegia (Wang et\u00a0al., 2010), even a pathogen that causes leaf spot disease on Lablab purpureus (Mahadevakumar et\u00a0al., 2014). So, Epicoccum species may reshape their lifestyles among endophytic, saprophytic, and pathogenic to adapt to changing environmental conditions (Kuo et\u00a0al., 2014). The fungus may secrete numerous proteins that facilitate colonization during interaction with the plant (Yin et\u00a0al., 2015). Nine high-level phenotypic terms are defined in PHI-base to compare the pathogen-host interactions between organisms across the tree of life (Urban et al., 2017). Using comparative genomic approaches, we show that PHI:5494, one of the \u201cincreased pathogenicity (hypervirulence)\u201d type genes, may be an important factor in the difference in pathogenicity between Epicoccum species. Moreover, endophytic HGUP191049 had six \u201closs of pathogenicity\u201d phenotypic genes different from the pathogenic T41, which may account for the lifestyle differences in Ep. latusicollum.", "Comparative genomics aims to use an ensemble of related genomes to improve the understanding of each genome in the set (Haubold & Wiehe, 2004).

Genes encoding biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites are usually located on chromosomes forming BGCs (Yao et\u00a0al., 2021). Results from comparative analyses show that Epicoccum is a promising source of terpenes. Terpenes exhibit antimicrobial activity owing to their highly lipophilic nature, which may interfere with the integrity and function of cell membranes (Sohrabi et\u00a0al., 2015). In addition, oxyjavanicin and squalestatin S1 reported as antimicrobial agents (Nicolaou et\u00a0al., 1994; Kato et\u00a0al., 2020), are putative secondary metabolites shared by Epicoccum spp. In this study, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential strain was screened out from the endophytic fungi of R. roxburghii and analyzed for biosynthetic capacity.", "The secondary metabolites of fungi constitute a rich source of natural products with antimicrobial activity.
