["Present address: Gilead Sciences, 333 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA.", "Bullfrog saxiphilin:STX complex defines a toxin \u201cmolecular sponge\u201d blueprint for STX recognition and toxin resistance.", "Dinoflagelates and cyanobacteria produce saxitoxin (STX), a lethal bis-guanidinium neurotoxin causing paralytic shellfish poisoning. A number of metazoans have soluble STX-binding proteins that may prevent STX intoxication. However, their STX molecular recognition mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we present structures of saxiphilin (Sxph), a bullfrog high-affinity STX-binding protein, alone and bound to STX. The structures reveal a novel high-affinity STX-binding site built from a \u201cproto-pocket\u201d on a transferrin scaffold that also bears thyroglobulin domain protease inhibitor repeats. Comparison of Sxph and voltage-gated sodium channel STX-binding sites reveals a convergent toxin recognition strategy comprising a largely rigid binding site where acidic side chains and a cation-\u03c0 interaction engage STX. These studies reveal molecular rules for STX recognition, outline how a toxin-binding site can be built on a na\u00efve scaffold, and open a path to developing protein sensors for environmental STX monitoring and new biologics for STX intoxication mitigation.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Saxitoxin (STX), a bis-guanidinium small molecule produced by brackish and freshwater cyanobacteria and oceanic dinoflagelates associated with red tides, is one of the most lethal neurotoxins, causes paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and is the only marine toxin that is declared a chemical weapon (1, 2). Its toxicity is thought to arise primarily from inhibition of select voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) isoforms (3), although STX may affect other channels (4, 5) and enzymes (6). PSP caused by STX represents a notable public health and commercial hazard that is an increasing problem due to climate change (7). Consequently, shellfish for human consumption are monitored globally for PSP toxins. Current STX detection methods use a cumbersome mouse viability assay (8). Thus, there is great interest in developing better analytical techniques for measuring STX and related cogeners in food sources (7\u20139).", "Saxitoxin (STX), a bis-guanidinium small molecule produced by brackish and freshwater cyanobacteria and oceanic dinoflagelates associated with red tides, is one of the most lethal neurotoxins, causes paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and is the only marine toxin that is declared a chemical weapon (1, 2).

Although the best understood toxin resistance strategies involve target protein mutations (10, 12, 13), frogs display unusual resistance to STX poisoning (14, 15) that is not believed to involve altered responses of frog NaVs to STX (16). Saxiphilin (Sxph), a 91-kDa transferrin homolog, is an STX-binding protein from American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) heart and plasma (16\u201320). This soluble, dual-function protein has a single high-affinity STX-binding site [Kd (dissociation constant), ~0.2 nM] that recognizes certain STX derivatives (16, 21, 22) and has two ~60 residue thyroglobulin type I (Thy1) repeats (18) that act as potent [Ki (inhibition constant), ~1 nM] cysteine protease inhibitors (23). Other soluble STX-binding proteins have been identified in pufferfish (24, 25), cockles (26), and crabs (27), and STX-binding activity has been reported in the plasma, hemolymph, and tissues from arthropods (19), amphibians (28), fish (19), and reptiles (19). Hence, it is thought that Sxph and analogous toxin-binding proteins constitute a second, less well-characterized toxin resistance mechanism involving toxin sequestration (10, 16, 19).", "Nature uses diverse strategies to counter toxin exposure that include target protein resistance mutations, toxin sequestration, and toxin removal (10, 11).

Contrary to expectations (20), the STX-binding site is not a remodeled version of the Fe3+-binding site but resides at a unique locale on the C1 domain. This high-affinity binding site undergoes minimal conformational changes upon binding the rigid STX scaffold. Remarkably, the general blueprint for STX recognition by Sxph using side chain carboxylates, a cation-\u03c0 interaction, and a largely rigid binding site is shared with NaVs (1, 13, 29, 44\u201347).
