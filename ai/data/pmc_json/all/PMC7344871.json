["Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for long-term infections and is particularly resistant to treatments when hiding inside the extracellular matrix or biofilms. Phage therapy might represent an alternative to antibiotic treatment, but up to 10% of clinical strains appear to resist multiple phages. We investigated the characteristics of P. aeruginosa clinical strains naturally resistant to phages and compared them to highly susceptible strains. The phage-resistant strains were defective in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, were nonmotile and displayed an important degree of autolysis, releasing phages and pyocins. Complete genome sequencing of three resistant strains showed the existence of a large accessory genome made of multiple insertion elements, genomic islands, pyocins and prophages, including two phages performing lateral transduction. Mutations were found in genes responsible for the synthesis of LPS and/or type IV pilus, the major receptors for most phages. CRISPR-Cas systems appeared to be absent or inactive in phage-resistant strains, confirming that they do not play a role in the resistance to lytic phages but control the insertion of exogenous sequences. We show that, despite their apparent weakness, the multiphage-resistant strains described in this study displayed selective advantages through the possession of various functions, including weapons to eliminate other strains of the same or closely related species.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterial species ubiquitous in the environment and associated with different types of infections in the hospital. Resistance to antibiotics is at the origin of the emergence of clones that are widely distributed worldwide and are responsible for nosocomial infections [1,2]. Interestingly, long-term infections in cystic fibrosis or burn patients are not systematically related to multidrug resistance but, rather, to the capacity of the strains to evolve and hide in biofilms [3,4]. The wide genetic diversity of the species is favored by the plasticity of the genome mediated by mobile genetic elements (MGE) including integrative conjugative elements (ICE), genomic islands (GI), and insertion sequences (IS) which are segments of DNA acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [5,6]. Prophages constitute another class of mobile elements. It has been estimated that, in addition to a highly conserved core genome, strains possess specific sequences that can account for 10 to 20% of their genome and therefore are considered as \u201caccessory\u201d [7,8,9,10]. The accessory genome is subject to rapid change in response to selective pressure [11] and plays an important role in antibiotic resistance [12,13]. Regions of Genome Plasticity (RGP) were defined by Mathee et al. as strain-specific regions made of at least four open reading frames (ORFs): firstly RGP01 to RGP62 [11], extended to RGP94 in additional studies (RGP63 to RGP80 [14], RGP81 to RGP89 [15] and RGP90 to RGP94 [16]). New RGPs are continuously discovered in newly sequenced genomes. A large number of RGPs are immediately adjacent to tRNA or tmRNA genes known to act as integration sites for plasmids, phages and genomic islands [5,7,15,17,18]. Prophages and ICE carrying antibiotic resistant genes, metabolic and virulence factors represent a significant part of the accessory genome in P. aeruginosa [13,19]. Some phages contribute to the pathogenicity of their host either by carrying virulence factors or by modifying chromosomal gene expression [20,21]. They also provide resistance to other phages through different mechanisms, including the role of moron genes [22,23].", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterial species ubiquitous in the environment and associated with different types of infections in the hospital.

Phages are exerting a strong pressure on their host, which may result in the selection of a variety of mutations, including deletions of large genomic regions allowing the bacteria to resist infection [25,26,27]. Bacteria have developed multiple ways to resist phages [28,29,30]; however, mutations in receptors are the most frequently observed events in laboratory-derived phage-resistant mutants [31]. Whereas temperate phages usually show a restricted host range and affinity for specific receptors, virulent phages of Gram-negative bacteria often require the presence of common structures, principally type IV pili (T4P), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or O-antigen, for binding to their host. The interactions between the phage tail fiber and the receptor are specific to a given strain. Nonspecific innate immunity is provided by restriction-modification (R-M) systems, toxin-antitoxins and abortive systems. The adaptive immune system constituted by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic (CRISPR) elements and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes is unique in that it stores a memory of invasive DNA in the form of short sequences called spacers [32]. In P. aeruginosa, about 30% of strains were shown to possess a type I-F CRISPR-Cas system, whereas 6% also possessed a type I-E system [33,34,35]. Some P. aeruginosa strains also carry a third CRISPR subtype (type I-C) [35].

By comparison to the resistance to antibiotics, such strains can be referred to as \u201cmultiphage-resistant or MPhR\u201d. Conversely, some strains isolated from similar environments showed a high susceptibility to phages, such as reference strain PAO1 [37,38] or strain PcyII-10 [27]. A multiphage infection of PAO1 in vitro led to the emergence of resistant variants with reduced fitness and deficiency in T4P and LPS expressions [38,39]. It is believed that the fitness cost of such resistant bacteria would be so high in a natural environment that they would not persist [40]. While a loss of receptors present on the appendages necessary for motility such as pili and flagella, outer membrane proteins or LPS will decrease virulence and the capacity to survive [41], mucoid variants or variants secreting higher levels of virulent factors will be more aggressive [38,42,43].

It was proposed that the presence of self-targeting spacers resulted in a loss of MGE-bearing protospacers [94].", "Immunity provided by prophages may not be the most important mechanism for multiphage resistance, as polylysogeny is frequent in P. aeruginosa, and most temperate phages show a narrow host range and rarely provide heteroimmunity [95,96]. However, some prophages encode a variety of functions that participate in the defense against viral attacks, as shown in P. aeruginosa for mu-like bacteriophages [23] and for Mycobacterium smegmatis [97]. By comparison with observations made with mu-like phage D3112, PfII40a, a related phage [80], may confer heteroimmunity through different mechanisms, such as the specific interaction between the c repressor and the cognate operator [98]. Pf1-like bacteriophages were found in all the strains. In strain LES (Liverpool Epidemic Strain), these phages are highly active and may have a role in the competitiveness of LES [18,99,100,101]. They contribute to bacterial short-term evolution and virulence [27].", "Immunity provided by prophages may not be the most important mechanism for multiphage resistance, as polylysogeny is frequent in P. aeruginosa, and most temperate phages show a narrow host range and rarely provide heteroimmunity [95,96].

They spontaneously release phages when grown to the plateau or on richly infected plates.

Annotation was done using MaGe at the Microbial Genome Annotation and Analysis platform (MicroScope) [114], RAST http://rast.nmpdr.org/ [115] and BASys https://www.basys.ca/ [116]. PHASTER http://phaster.ca [117], a better version of PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) [118], was used to identify the presence of phage sequences. The core and accessory genomes were identified using the Spine and AGEnt bioinformatics tools [119]. GIs were identified by IslandViewer [120]. Insertion sequences (IS) and transposons were detected using IS saga http://issaga.biotoul.fr/. In silico MLVA was performed using scripts available at https://github.com/i2bc/MLVA_finder. The MLST type was deduced from the sequence and established using the PUBMLST website http://pubmlst.org/ and the MLST plugin for BioNumerics 7.6.3 (Applied-Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). All clustering analyses were performed within BioNumerics 7.6.3. MLVA allele numbers expressed as a numerical code were clustered using the categorical coefficient and the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm, producing a dendrogram, as previously described [3]. Strains inside a MLVA cluster shared 12 alleles out of 14. Strains inside a MLST cluster shared 6 alleles out of 7 [1]. The CRISPR-Cas loci were identified using CRISPRCasFinder at http://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/ [82]. Whole genome alignments were performed with MAUVE in Geneious R9. MAUVE identifies conserved segments that appeared to be internally free from genome rearrangements [54]. Such regions are referred to as locally collinear blocks (LCBs).", "Phage genome sequencing was done using the I2BC MiSeq Illumina sequencing platform.

Conclusions", "Phage therapy has been used with success to treat infections by multidrug resistant bacteria and may be more widely applied in the future [121]. Long-term infections in CF and burn patients often involve strains that are susceptible to antibiotics in vitro but form biofilms and cannot be eradicated, therefore requiring alternative therapeutic approaches [122]. Unfortunately, some of these strains resist most of the available phages, and this calls for the optimization of known bacteriophages, the continuous search for new viruses [123] and a better understanding of the basis for resistance. A resistance to phages is generally not considered to be a problem, because it is expected to strongly affect the bacterial fitness, leading to a rapid outgrowth by susceptible bacteria. We showed here that, despite an accumulation of factors that should decrease their chances of survival in the environment, resistant strains also presented clear advantages that allowed them to establish long-term infections. A combination of treatment by phages and antibiotics will be necessary to eradicate such strains.", "Phage therapy has been used with success to treat infections by multidrug resistant bacteria and may be more widely applied in the future [121].
