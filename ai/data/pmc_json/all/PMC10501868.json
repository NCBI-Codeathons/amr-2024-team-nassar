["Depsides and depsidones have attracted attention for biosynthetic studies due to their broad biological activities and structural diversity. Previous structure\u2012activity relationships indicated that triple halogenated depsidones display the best anti-pathogenic activity. However, the gene cluster and the tailoring steps responsible for halogenated depsidone nornidulin (3) remain enigmatic. In this study, we disclosed the complete biosynthetic pathway of the halogenated depsidone through in\u00a0vivo gene disruption, heterologous expression and in\u00a0vitro biochemical experiments. We demonstrated an unusual depside skeleton biosynthesis process mediated by both highly-reducing polyketide synthase and non-reducing polyketide synthase, which is distinct from the common depside skeleton biosynthesis. This skeleton was subsequently modified by two in-cluster enzymes DepG and DepF for the ether bond formation and decarboxylation, respectively. In addition, the decarboxylase DepF exhibited substrate promiscuity for different scaffold substrates. Finally, and interestingly, we discovered a halogenase encoded remotely from the biosynthetic gene cluster, which catalyzes triple-halogenation to produce the active end product nornidulin (3). These discoveries provide new insights for further understanding the biosynthesis of depsidones and their derivatives.", "Graphical abstract", "A new and concise biosynthetic pathway of nornidulin (3) was elucidated. The depside skeleton 2 is synthesized by a collaborating hrPKS and nrPKS pair, followed by etherification, decarboxylation and halogenation.Image 1", "Image 1", "Key words", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Depsidones and depsides (DEPs) are the classic natural products widely produced by fungi, lichens, and plants1, 2, 3. To date, more than 100 DEPs have been reported and exhibited extensively varying bioactivities such as anti-microbial, anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-virus, and enzyme inhibitor activities1,4, 5, 6, 7. DEPs consist of two 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid rings linked to each other by both ether and ester bonds. They are usually highly halogenated in fungi, which is one means by which DEPs chemical diversity is enriched. Previously structure\u2012activity relationships (SARs) showed that the anti-infective activities of the highly halogenated depsidones (nornidulin (3) and emeguisin A (10)) are much stronger than the depside precursors (agonodepside A (1) and unguidepside A (2))8 (Fig.\u00a01).

It was not until 2018 that Andrew M. Piggott and co-workers7 conducted a precursor-directed biosynthesis of depsidones. These studies were inspired by their hypothesis that DEPs biosynthesis employs a single polyketide synthase (PKS) that carries out the assembly of the acyclic core scaffold and converges the two aromatic rings to yield a depside. Recently, three interesting biosynthesis cases for depside skeleton assembly have been elucidated in fungi (Scheme 1, Routes A\u2012C)10, 11, 12. Notably, all of them need only one non-reducing polyketide synthase (nrPKS). Unusually, in routes A and B, the depside bond formation is proved to be catalyzed by the starter-unit acyltransferase (SAT) domain (Scheme 1, Routes A\u2012B)10,12. However, it is still unclear how unguidepside A (2) converts to nornidulin (3), and whether the multiple halogenated in DEPs is catalyzed by one or multiple enzymes. Identifying novel tailoring enzymes from nature is vital for generating novel bioactive compounds via metabolic engineering to modify the biosynthetic pathways for drug development15. Thus, further characterization of tailoring enzymes during DEPs assembly would boost our understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of this vital natural product family.

AntiSMASH analyses16 showed that the genome of SCSIO SX7S7 encodes at least 49 secondary metabolite (SM) BGCs, including 6 highly reducing polyketide synthases (hrPKS), 4 nrPKS, and 2 nrPKS and hrPKS hybrid BGCs (Supporting Information Table S1). Bioinformatically, the nrPKS of hybrid BGC in scaffold 11 showed 51% identical to Preu6 which was responsible for lecanoric acid (23) (Fig.\u00a01, Scheme 1, Route B)12.

Using the optimal reaction conditions, we determined the kinetic constants for DepF. The Km and kcat values for DepF conversion of 5 to 22 were found to be 23.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L and 4298.5/min respectively, and 10.3\u00a0\u03bcmol/L and 184.8/min for the conversion of 2 to 2a (Fig.\u00a04B).

Brominated DEPs were further confirmed by LC\u2012MS analysis (Supporting Information Fig.\u00a0S11). These data indicated that A3428 could employ either MgCl2 or KBr to afford assorted DEPs differing in their halogenation patterns. Collectively, we confirmed that A3428 as a flavin-dependent halogenase could finalize the installation of different halogen atoms during DEPs biosynthesis with broad substrate scope and represent an important advance that will likely enable enhanced access to new DEPs as potential new compounds or drug leads.Figure\u00a05In\u00a0vitro analysis of the flavin-dependent halogenase A3428.

SCSIO SX7S7. Based on the CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption system and heterologous expression experiments, we discovered that both hrPKS DepD and nrPKS DepH are indispensable to forming the precursor unguidepside A (2), which is distinct from previous depside formation. In addition, a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene disruption system and in\u00a0vitro enzyme assays played essential roles in our elucidation of key tailoring steps involved in nornidulin (3) biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a02D). The functions of three key tailoring enzymes were determined. The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase DepG converts the bicyclic depsides to tricyclic depsidones. The amidohydrolase superfamily protein DepF decarboxylates depsidone substrates, and finally, an uncommon flavin-dependent and remotely encoded halogenase A3428 catalyzes the multiple halogenations of depsides and depsidones. Coordinated with these efforts, we have also identified five new depside intermediates from an engineered \u0394depG mutant, which exhibited moderate anti-pathogenic activities, indicating the potential of these molecules act as promising anti-infective drug lead compounds. Collectively, the discovery of the late-stage tailoring enzymes including DepF, DepG, and A3428, exhibit broad substrate promiscuity, which suggests their potential as genetic tools to expand DEP structural diversity. This study expands the foundation for future biosynthetic studies and bioengineering efforts to vastly enrich depsidone and depside structure libraries for initiatives in drug discovery and SM enzymology.", "Overall, the BGC encoding the DEPs was identified and characterized from our previously reported fungus Aspergillus sp.
