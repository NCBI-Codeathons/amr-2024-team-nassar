Our analysis showed distinct clustering of our sequences from all other environmentally derived ARGs for all three resistance mechanisms, i.e. dihydrofolate reductase (drfE) genes (Fig.\u00a06a), macrolide transporter ATP-binding permease proteins (Fig.\u00a06b), and major facilitator superfamily transporter sequences (rosA) (Fig.\u00a06c). Together, these results provide strong evidence that ARG homologues found in these remote and uncontaminated Antarctic soils represent legacy genes that were acquired, or evolved, in the distant past that over time formed part of the essential gene pools and have undergone niche-specific selective pressure. We argue that the low similarity to modern ARG variants could reflect either parallel evolutionary processes or the outward transport of historical ARGs as templates for subsequent evolution in more temperate environments.

This is the first detailed metagenomic study of antibiotic resistance genes in remote, pristine soils that are na\u00efve to anthropogenic antibiotic use. We have found 177 naturally occurring, historical genes conferring resistance to natural antibiotics. Our theory that most antibiotic resistance genes found here originate primarily from antibiotic-producing species was supported by the presence of antibiotic biosynthesis genes in many phyla encoding resistance and is further highlighted by the complete absence of mobile genetic elements (transposons, integrons and recombinases) flanking all putative ARGs found here. Antibiotic resistance appears to be transferred vertically over generations, with limited to no horizontal movement of ARGs between species. Thus, community members with antibiotic resistance may proliferate at the expense of susceptible counterparts [66]. This evidence supports the concept [65] that phylogeny, rather than HGT, drives differences in soil resistome content in the environment. This is entirely consistent with our finding that ARG abundance is negatively correlated with inferred species richness, indicating that communities with a high proportion of resistance elements exclude susceptible species, subsequently reducing soil diversity. Future challenges include understanding how both direct and indirect human-induced modulations influence the composition of these distinct soil communities, likely resulting in alterations to soil resistome properties.", "Many studies have explored the distribution of antibiotic resistance in natural environments; however the spectrum of resistance determinants in remote pristine soil communities had not yet been elucidated.
