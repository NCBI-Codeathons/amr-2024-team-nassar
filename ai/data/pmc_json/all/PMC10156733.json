["Oxidized cysteine residues are highly reactive and can form functional covalent conjugates, of which the allosteric redox switch formed by the lysine-cysteine NOS bridge is an example. Here, we report a noncanonical FAD-dependent enzyme Orf1 that adds a glycine-derived N-formimidoyl group to glycinothricin to form the antibiotic BD-12. X-ray crystallography was used to investigate this complex enzymatic process, which showed Orf1 has two substrate-binding sites that sit 13.5\u2009\u00c5 apart unlike canonical FAD-dependent oxidoreductases. One site could accommodate glycine and the other glycinothricin or glycylthricin. Moreover, an intermediate-enzyme adduct with a NOS-covalent linkage was observed in the later site, where it acts as a two-scissile-bond linkage facilitating nucleophilic addition and cofactor-free decarboxylation. The chain length of nucleophilic acceptors vies with bond cleavage sites at either N\u2013O or O\u2013S accounting for N-formimidoylation or N-iminoacetylation.

The N-formimidoyl modification is peculiarly intriguing as a barrage of reactions apparently goes with the territory starting with free glycine oxidation and ending on a bulky recipient with a unique N-formimidoyl substitution. To explore this fascinating issue, recombinant Orf1 expressed in E. coli displays yellow tetrameric proteins in the solution while eluting out of gel filtration chromatography (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, b). The yellow color indicates each polypeptide chain harbors a flavin prosthetic group as opposed to the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is a copper I dependent enzyme39. This yellow cofactor was determined to be flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) by subjecting the supernatant of denatured proteins to LC-MS analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c). Biochemical assays were performed in parallel, wherein reaction mixtures containing glycine and a chemically synthesized glycylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 4) instead of 1 were quenched in due course and subjected to LC analysis. When compared with the control (addition with denatured Orf1), a new peak that emerged on the LC trace matched with the synthetic standard in the same retention time, mass unit and fragmentation pattern, suggesting that Orf1 is a flavin-dependent enzyme capable of N-formimidoylating the terminal glycyl sidechain of glycylthricin to 5 in the presence of glycine. To confirm that the N-formimidoyl moiety is derived from an intact molecule of glycine, we performed Orf1-mediated reactions with the addition of glycine, (15N)-glycine, (1\u221213C)-glycine, (2\u221213C)-glycine, (2\u221213C \u221215N)-glycine, or (1,2\u221213C2\u221215N)-glycine alongside 4. LC-MS spectra clearly demonstrate that the N-formimidoyl group is derived from one intact molecule of glycine by an increment of 1 or 2\u2009Da respectively from (15N)- or (2\u221213C \u221215N)-glycine but no change from (1\u221213C)-glycine (Fig.\u00a02a, b). In the EIC (selected at m/z 459.2) trace a small peak emerged other than 5 (Fig.\u00a02a), indicating an N-iminoacetyl-glycylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 6) as shown by gaining 44\u2009Da of a carboxyl group. The 6 was further confirmed given an increment of 3\u2009Da in the presence of (1,2\u221213C2\u221215N)-glycine, where the moiety of 5 in the spectra suggested it is a daughter ionic fragment of 6 (Fig.\u00a02c). The enzymatic reactions in the presence of ST-F (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 7) alongside glycine or isotopically labeled glycine suggested that the product is N-iminoacetyl-ST-F (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 8) (Fig.\u00a02d, e).

The N-formimidoyl modification is peculiarly intriguing as a barrage of reactions apparently goes with the territory starting with free glycine oxidation and ending on a bulky recipient with a unique N-formimidoyl substitution. To explore this fascinating issue, recombinant Orf1 expressed in E. coli displays yellow tetrameric proteins in the solution while eluting out of gel filtration chromatography (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, b). The yellow color indicates each polypeptide chain harbors a flavin prosthetic group as opposed to the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is a copper I dependent enzyme39. This yellow cofactor was determined to be flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) by subjecting the supernatant of denatured proteins to LC-MS analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c). Biochemical assays were performed in parallel, wherein reaction mixtures containing glycine and a chemically synthesized glycylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 4) instead of 1 were quenched in due course and subjected to LC analysis. When compared with the control (addition with denatured Orf1), a new peak that emerged on the LC trace matched with the synthetic standard in the same retention time, mass unit and fragmentation pattern, suggesting that Orf1 is a flavin-dependent enzyme capable of N-formimidoylating the terminal glycyl sidechain of glycylthricin to 5 in the presence of glycine.

Our instinct tells us that the enzyme should be similar to a typical FAD-dependent monooxygenase, where the oxidized imino acid intermediate should undergo a nucleophilic attack of FAD-associated peroxide, thus resulting in an oxidative decarboxylation consequence.

Biochemical assays confirmed that the both residues and the NOS bridge are essential for the reaction to proceed, as neither one led to the end product (Fig.\u00a02a (iii, iv), d (iv, viii)). In contrast, both C281A and E426Q mutants still exhibited similar glycine oxidation activity, and the R342A lost the glycine oxidation ability but held the same ST-F binding affinity as the wild type (Supplementary Table\u00a03). In terms of conformations, the mutants showed no difference from the wild type except for the sidechain of R368 in the R342A mutant (Fig.\u00a03e, k). Residue R342 turned out to be critical because the sidechain of R368 was misplaced by intruding into the glycine binding site as manifested in the crystal structure of R342A (Fig.\u00a03e). Next, we performed coupled assays to detect the end product to see if it could be formed by complementary pairs C281S/R342A or ThiO/R342A (Fig.\u00a02d (vi, vii)). No product was found, suggesting that (1) glycine imine (the product of ThiO) is not the intermediate for R342A (with intact C281); (2) the first-reaction-phase product formed by C281S is water-labile and unable to transfer undamagedly from C281S to R342A. Given that 4 is in close proximity to the C281-S\u2013O\u2013N-glycine imine adduct (see below), the reactions, such as addition, decarboxylation, and dehydration, are likely to take place in sequence towards the formation of N-formimidoyl-glycylthricin. We also observed that 90% of the enzyme activity was lost when reactions were conducted in a DTT-containing (100\u2009mM) reaction solution, likely because glycine oxidation cannot proceed and/or C281 is fully reduced (underscoring the essentiality of the post-translational modification) (Supplementary Table\u00a03). The residues nearby the C281-adduct include T298, E312, E313, F316 and E426 (Fig.\u00a03c), of which F316, E312 and E313 may cooperatively allow nucleophilic addition and cofactor-free decarboxylation reactions to proceed in sequence. Our reasoning is that F316 stabilizes the planar imine glycine adduct through the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction. The importance of this residue was ascertained by mutational experiments, whereby F316A brings on 6 as the major product (Fig.\u00a02a (vi)). Overlaying two complexes (the C281-adduct and the glycylthricin-containing structures) reveals that the glycylthricin ligand is positioned by residues E312 and E313 in place, making the terminal amine group of glycylthricin in close proximity to the \u03b1-carbon of the oximinoacetate adduct by 3.1\u2009\u00c5 with a Burgi-Dunitz angle of 99.7\u00b0 an approach trajectory (Fig.\u00a04d, e). The nucleophilicity of the terminal amine may be enhanced after deprotonation by the main chain carbonyl group of N299 (2.7\u2009\u00c5). The attack of the amine group from the re face onto the F316-stabilized C281-adduct should reconfigure the planar (sp2) trans imine to a tetrahedral (sp3, S-configuration) geminal diamine species, whereby the \u03c0-\u03c0 stabilization no longer holds. The charged carboxyl group is neutralized after the entropy-driven decarboxylation reaction ensuing in response to the repulsion force incited between the charged and hydrophobic groups. The left electron lone pair could flow into the \u03c3-antibonding orbital of the nitrogen atom of the anti-periplanar N\u2013O\u2013S bridge in a way akin to an E2-like elimination reaction, which differs to the canonical PLP or thiamine-dependent (both cofactors serving as an electron sink) decarboxylation reactions. E312 another key residue collaborates with F316 to facilitate the decarboxylative reaction by introducing a repulsive electrostatic force. The fact is that the residue experiences a substrate-induced conformational change bringing the terminal carboxylate group in a short distance (3.3\u2009\u00c5) to the carboxylate group of the oximinoacetate moiety (Fig.\u00a04f; Supplementary Fig.\u00a013) evidenced by mutational experiments whereby compound 6 becomes the major product in the presence of E312A (Fig.\u00a02a (v)). As a result, E312 undergoes a substrate-induced conformational change, in which upon addition the induced decarboxylation should facilitate \u03b2-elimination. On the other hand, superposition of the F316A-ST-F and C281-adduct complex displays that the long side chain of ST-F is subject to a geographic effect (Fig.\u00a04g), resulting in flipping of the amide group away from E312 to accommodate the entire aliphatic sidechain. This posture is somewhat unexpected as the \u03b5-amine of the \u03b2-lysine is a bit extended away from the \u03b1-carbon of the oximinoacetate adduct likely due to the absence of the phenyl ring (F316A). E312 not only recognizes the streptolidine base but also ushers the \u03b2-lysine to crawl into the binding site in a compact manner. In this context, E312A is able to catalyze the formation of 5 and 6 but no more 8, as opposed to F316A, which catalyzes the formation of 8, the dominant product (Fig.\u00a02a (v), d (ix, x)).", "To probe the importance of C281, we mutated it to alanine or serine and E426 to Q426 (a residue related to NOS-formation). Biochemical assays confirmed that the both residues and the NOS bridge are essential for the reaction to proceed, as neither one led to the end product (Fig.\u00a02a (iii, iv), d (iv, viii)). In contrast, both C281A and E426Q mutants still exhibited similar glycine oxidation activity, and the R342A lost the glycine oxidation ability but held the same ST-F binding affinity as the wild type (Supplementary Table\u00a03). In terms of conformations, the mutants showed no difference from the wild type except for the sidechain of R368 in the R342A mutant (Fig.\u00a03e, k). Residue R342 turned out to be critical because the sidechain of R368 was misplaced by intruding into the glycine binding site as manifested in the crystal structure of R342A (Fig.\u00a03e).

The second center is 13.5\u2009\u00c5 away from the first one, where residue C281 plays an indispensable role.

The sulfenic group is capable of reacting with an oxygenated glycine imine species passed down from the first reaction center via a subtle one-way tunnel to form the NOS-covalent adduct. This enzyme-bound adduct then reacts with glycinothricin or glycylthricin following a barrage of chemical reactions, including nucleophilic addition, cofactor-free decarboxylation, \u03b2-elimination and dehydration, to bring on BD-12 (N-formimidoyl glycylthricin).
