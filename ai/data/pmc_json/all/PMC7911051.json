["These authors have contributed equally to this work.", "Bacillus cereus is a ubiquitous soil bacterium responsible for two types of food-associated gastrointestinal diseases. While the emetic type, a food intoxication, manifests in nausea and vomiting, food infections with enteropathogenic strains cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. Causative toxins are the cyclic dodecadepsipeptide cereulide, and the proteinaceous enterotoxins hemolysin BL (Hbl), nonhemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) and cytotoxin K (CytK), respectively. This review covers the current knowledge on distribution and genetic organization of the toxin genes, as well as mechanisms of enterotoxin gene regulation and toxin secretion. In this context, the exceptionally high variability of toxin production between single strains is highlighted. In addition, the mode of action of the pore-forming enterotoxins and their effect on target cells is described in detail. The main focus of this review are the two tripartite enterotoxin complexes Hbl and Nhe, but the latest findings on cereulide and CytK are also presented, as well as methods for toxin detection, and the contribution of further putative virulence factors to the diarrheal disease.", "Key Contribution", "This review summarizes 30 years of work on the food poisoning toxins of B. cereus with special focus on the latest findings regarding genetic distribution, organization, evolution and regulation, secretion, detection and mode of action of the tripartite enterotoxins Hbl and Nhe.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Bacillus cereus is estimated to be responsible for 1.4%\u201312% of all food poisoning outbreaks worldwide [1]. In the European Union, bacterial toxins (Clostridium, Staphylococcus and B. cereus) accounted for 17.7% (2016) and 15.9% (2017) of all registered food- and water-borne outbreaks, which ranked them second behind Salmonella [2,3]. With 98 registered outbreaks in the EU in 2018, B. cereus toxins ranked in fifth place behind Salmonella, Campylobacter, the norovirus and Staphylococcus toxins. Among these was also one large food poisoning outbreak with more than 100 affected persons. Furthermore, six fatal cases were attributed to bacterial toxins (Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perfringens and B. cereus) [4].", "Bacillus cereus is estimated to be responsible for 1.4%\u201312% of all food poisoning outbreaks worldwide [1].

The emetic kind of illness is mainly characterized by nausea and emesis, which appear as soon as half an hour after consumption of the contaminated food and are clinically indistinguishable from intoxications with Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins [5]. In this classical food intoxication, the emetic toxin cereulide is pre-formed during vegetative growth of B. cereus in foodstuffs and the consumption of the bacteria is not necessary [6]. Indeed, there are several reports of outbreaks where only the cereulide toxin was detected in the food, but no bacteria could be isolated [7]. Nevertheless, it is generally thought that at least 103\u2013105\nB. cereus per g food are needed to produce cereulide in disease-provoking concentrations [5,6,7,8,9]. Cereulide is a cyclic dodecadepsipeptide with a molecular weight of 1.2 kDa. The basic repeated amino acid sequence [D-O-Leu D-Ala L-O-Val D-Val]3 is extremely stable towards heat, acid or digestive enzymes and, thus, the toxin can hardly be removed or inactivated [10,11,12]. Usually, the emetic form of disease is self-limiting and symptoms disappear after 6\u201324 h. Nevertheless, some severe and fatal outbreaks mostly related to liver failure are reported [10,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the pathogen and its production of highly resistant spores, B. cereus is frequently found in various kinds of food [24,25,26]. Historically, starchy foodstuffs such as rice or pasta are connected to food intoxications with emetic B. cereus, but more recently evidence is growing that emetic B. cereus are much more volatile than once thought. The comprehensive analysis of a total of 3654 food samples obtained from suspected food-borne illnesses with a preliminary report of vomiting, collected over a period of seven years, revealed that emetic B. cereus strains were detected in a broad diversity of foods, including vegetables, fruit products, sauces, soups, and salads as well as milk and meat products [7].", "Basically, B. cereus is responsible for two types of gastrointestinal diseases.

This form of disease manifests mainly in diarrhea and abdominal cramps, similar to food poisoning by Clostridium perfringens type A [5]. Symptoms occur after approximately 8\u201316 h. This incubation time is typical for toxico-infections, in which the toxins are produced by viable bacteria inside the human intestine [5,28,29]. Unlike cereulide, enterotoxins pre-formed in foods most likely do not contribute to the disease, as they are considered sensitive towards heat, acids or proteases. Thus, vegetative B. cereus and, especially, spores must be consumed. The infective dose is estimated between 105\u2013108 cfu/g [11,30] or 104\u2013109 cfu/g [9,29] vegetative cells or spores. The course of disease is mainly mild and\u2014after approximately 12\u201324 h\u2014self-limiting. Fatal outbreaks are only very rarely reported [31]. A food infection with enteropathogenic B. cereus can be seen as a multifactorial process, as a number of individual steps have to be considered before the onset of the disease, including prevalence and survival of B. cereus in different foodstuffs, survival of the stomach passage, germination of spores, active movement towards and adhesion to the intestinal epithelium, enterotoxin production under intestinal conditions, as well as the influence of consumed foods and the intestinal microbiota on these processes. We recently summarized these steps in a separate review [27]. Nevertheless, production and action of the enterotoxins are of the upmost relevance for the course of the diarrheal disease. Three main, pore-forming protein enterotoxins are known, which are the tripartite hemolysin BL (Hbl) [32] and non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) [33], as well as the single protein cytotoxin K (CytK) [31].

Consequently, it was debated whether the B. thuringiensis-associated biopesticides represent a risk for public health.

Additionally, more and more species such as B. wiedmannii, B. bingmayongensis, B. gaemokensis, B. manliponensis, and others are described [99,100,101,102,103]. Generally, they exhibit high genetic similarities and, thus, it has been suggested that they be considered as one species [5,104,105] or to completely change the taxonomic nomenclature of the B. cereus group [106].

NRPSs are huge multienzyme intracellular machineries, which are often genetically organized into gene clusters [156]. Apart from the structural synthetase genes, the corresponding genetic loci often contain genes involved in the activation of the NRPS as well as putative ABC transporters, which are thought to be involved in peptide export and may confer self-resistance [157]. In addition, NRPS genetic loci may contain or be flanked by accessory genes encoding enzymes responsible for monomer modifications [158] or type II thioesterases ensuring correct peptide assembly [159].

This ensures an orchestrated transcription of the respective genes, which show a tightly regulated transcription peak in late exponential phase [163,164]. Additional promotors have been found in the ces locus, but their exact role in ces transcription and regulation is still elusive [162].

CesH overexpression led to a cereulide-negative phenotype and transcriptional analysis of the CesH overexpression mutant resulted in strongly down-regulated cesA mRNA levels, indicating that CesH is involved in the timing of Ces-NRPS expression and cereulide assembly. Thus, it could be assumed that it functions as closing signal [165]. This hypothesis is fostered by the transcriptional kinetic of cesH showing highest cesH expression in stationary growth, whereas the other genes of the ces locus are transcribed in earlier growth phases [166].

Thus, further studies will be necessary to decipher the exact role and mechanism of CesH in cereulide biosynthesis.", "Previous work demonstrated that several key transcription factors of the chromosome play a pivotal role in the onset and steep increase of the transcription of the polycistronic cesPTABCD genes. Knockout as well as in vitro promotor binding studies [163,164] showed that the ces genes are not under control of PlcR, a pleiotropic regulator known to play a central role in enteropathogenic B. cereus [168,169] (see also Section 4.1.2). By contrast, the transcriptional regulator CodY, which acts as intracellular sensor of the energetic cell status and senses branched-chain amino acids [170], plays a key role in cereulide synthesis and tightly links toxin production to cell metabolism [37,163].

For instance, there is no strict co-linearity between ces transcription and actual cereulide toxin production [163,166]. Thus, posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms must contribute to the complex network of directing and controlling cereulide biosynthesis. Generally, NRPSs are produced as apo-carrier proteins and 4\u2032-phosphopanthetheinyl transferases (PPTases) must activate the NRPS modules by catalyzing the transfer of a coenzyme A-derived 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine moiety to the peptide carrier protein (PCP) domains of the NRPS in order to convert them into their holo-form [171]. The ces gene locus encodes a PPTase, designated CesP [154], but unexpectedly a cesP knockout mutant was reported to still be able to produce cereulide [165], although functionality of CesP has been proven previously [148]. Only after disruption of an additional, chromosomally encoded PPTase (designated ppt) was a toxin-negative phenotype observed, indicating that this PPTase can function as a redundant CesP-PPTase in cereulide biosynthesis [165]. Thus, in cereulide biosynthesis there is not only chromosomal-plasmid crosstalk on a transcriptional level, but also on a posttranslational level, highlighting once more the complexity of the regulatory circuits governing cereulide production. The recently discovered novel and essential role of the ABC transporter CesCD in cereulide biosynthesis, which goes beyond its canonical export function, adds another level of complexity to the posttranslational regulatory circuits in cereulide formation [161].

A comprehensive study showed that temperature is a cardinal parameter for cereulide production, which exerts control on posttranscriptional level [173]. Notably, maximum growth rate and maximum cereulide production were found to be decoupled, indicating that solely the number of bacteria or growth rates are no suitable parameters to predict the risk of cereulide production. Furthermore, the study of Kranzler et al. [173] revealed not only that the total amount of cereulide produced was highly temperature-dependent, but temperature also significantly impacted the formation of the recently identified cereulide isoforms. The production of isocereulide A, which is about 10-fold more cytotoxic than cereulide, was specifically supported at low temperatures (12 and 15 \u00b0C), whilst the production of the non-toxic isocereulide B was supported by ambient temperatures [173]. The latter must be taken into consideration in terms of food safety and predictive microbiology. Apart from temperature, other food industrial relevant extrinsic parameters, such as oxygen, pH or the food matrix, could also have a significant impact. However, further study will be necessary to fully understand the impact of specific extrinsic factors (and their interplay) on cereulide and isocereulide production in complex systems such as foods. Generally, there are indications that a neutral pH, high content of starch, carbohydrates, vitamins and trace elements support cereulide production, while low oxygen levels and high NaCl concentrations have a rather negative impact [7]. A detailed overview of the current knowledge of food industrial relevant external parameters is provided in a recent review by Rouzeau-Szynalski et al. [146]. There are also some indications that certain food additives, such as polyphosphates, could affect cereulide production in a specific manner by a hitherto unknown mechanism [152].

Usually symptoms decline after 24 h, but more severe intoxications are increasingly reported [7,14,18,23]. Due to its high ionophoric activity, cereulide can lead to rhabdomyolysis, liver damage and serious multiorgan failures.

In addition, a SIDA-UPLC-MS/MS method for multiparametric quantitation of cereulide and isocereulides A-G in foods was established [193] to include the most prominent isocereulides [153] in cereulide diagnostics. Application of the latter assay in the investigation of two food-borne outbreaks linked to cereulide revealed that isocereulides were indeed present in considerable amounts in the contaminated food remnants, suggesting that isocereulides may play a yet to be explored role in the severity of food-borne intoxications.", "The set of tools for research on emetic B. cereus is complemented by bioassays to investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity of the cereulide toxin and isocereulides using immortalized cell lines, such as Hep-2 or Hep-G2 cells, or, less frequently, CaCo-2 or HeLA cells [8,51,153,179,194,195].

These are the more common Hbl L2, L1, B (and B\u2019) from the hblCDAB operon and the rarer variants Hbl L2a, L1a and Ba from the hblCDA operon, each set of proteins with distinct properties. While the hblCDAB operon is highly conserved among different strains (sequence identities of 97%\u201399%), the hblCDA operon shows 75%\u201382% identity towards hblCDAB [91,211,213,214]. Our own studies also suggested high conservation of the nhe operon among different B. cereus strains (93%\u201399% similarity); however, these were all enteropathogenic, ces-strains from phylogenetic clades I and II [91]. An earlier study showed a novel Nhe variant in three B. cytotoxicus strains with only 80% protein sequence identity compared to known Nhe proteins [215]. In a study where 81 B. cereus s. l. strains were compared, it was shown that the upstream regions of nheABC were more conserved than the downstream regions [216]. Moreover, NheA protein sequences were sorted into four groups, according to their identities ranging from 100% to 78%. NheB protein sequences were most conserved, ranging from 100% to 87% identity in three groups. The least conserved component was NheC with 100% to 73% identity assigned to three groups of strains. As observed before, B. cytotoxicus strain NVH391-98 showed least conservation [216]. Earlier observations suggested that variations appear especially in sequence and length of the intergenic regions between nheB and nheC [5].", "In any case, total genome sequencing of selected enteropathogenic and apathogenic strains revealed the presence of two nhe operons in moderately toxic strain 14294-3 (M6) and low toxic MHI 226, isolated from ice cream and a milk product, respectively. Moreover, two hbl operons were detected in 14294-3 (M6), moderately toxic strain 6/27/S isolated from human feces, high toxic strain RIVM BC 126 from human feces, and low toxic strain RIVM BC 934 isolated from salad [54,91].

Thus, it is speculated that the nhe and hbl genes arose from duplication of a single ancestor gene and that the latest duplication was the generation of nheB and nheC [5]. B\u00f6hm et al. investigated the evolution of chromosomally encoded enterotoxins. Phylogenetic analyses of 142 sequenced B. cereus s. l. strains revealed evidence for horizontal gene transfer, duplication, and frequent deletion of hbl. The duplicated hbl variant hbla was found in 22% of all genomes. Earlier studies found that the hblCDAB operon is part of an approximately 17.7-kb, 11 gene fragment, which has probably been acquired by transposal insertion [202,218]. For this, further evidence could not be found [54]. In contrast to hbl, duplication or deletion of nhe was hardly observed (0.02%). Stable horizontal transfer of the operon also seems to be rare; it is almost exclusively transmitted vertically [54]. Due to its altered structure, some studies speculated about an additional function of Nhe requiring interaction with further, so far unknown proteins [219], which is supported by the strict vertical evolution, the missing horizontal gene transfer, and the rare and instable duplication of the nhe genes. Loss or horizontal transfer of nhe has even been associated with a negative impact on the survival of the bacteria. Furthermore, horizontal transfer of cytK and plcR was observed, as well as frequent deletion of cytK. Altogether, the authors concluded that the evolution of the enterotoxins inside the B. cereus group is extremely variable, for so far unknown reasons [54]. Widespread lateral gene transfer within the B. cereus group and the great importance of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of the enterotoxins have been suggested earlier, when 47 food-borne isolates were compared using MLST [220]. The authors also found a broad distribution of nhe and hbl, while cytK was limited to some phylogenetic clusters, and probably lost in distinct lineages. It was further concluded that gene loss is not linked to a particular species, and that the hbl, nhe, cytK (and entFM) genes were already present in a common ancestor of lineage I. Moreover, three toxin gene patterns showed a widespread coinheritance: hbl and nhe; hbl, nhe and entFM; and nhe and entFM [220]. Earlier, several studies already showed that horizontal gene transfer within B. cereus s. l. is generally possible, involving plasmids or further transposable elements [218,221,222,223,224]. Evidence has been found that massive gene exchange between plasmids and the chromosome, not restricted to distinct regions, occurred during evolution of the B. cereus group [212]. However, no ces genes have been found in the chromosome so far, and plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of the emetic toxin, anthrax and insecticidal toxins is already known [54]. Rasigade et al. investigated 10 complete B. cereus s. l. genomes in search of genes under positive evolutionary selection and concluded that \u201cadaptation to animal hosts, whether as pathogens, saprophytes or symbionts, is the major driving force in the evolution of the B. cereus group\u201d [225].", "Sequence identities have not only been found between the three components of each enterotoxin, but also between the two toxins, with Hbl L2 and NheA sharing 23% sequence identity, Hbl L1 and NheB 40%, and Hbl B and NheC 25% [217].

Next to the PlcR-boxes (see Figure 4), binding sites for further transcriptional regulatory proteins such as CodY, ResD, Fnr, CcpA and SinR have been identified in the promoter regions of the hbl and nhe operons, which presumably control enterotoxin expression in a concerted action [169,210,230,233,235,236]. Many of the virulence factors secreted by B. cereus including Hbl and Nhe are under the control of the 34 kDa pleiotropic transcriptional regulator PlcR, which activates their gene transcription at the onset of the stationary growth phase [169,201,202,237,238]. Nutrient depletion leads to repression of plcR transcription itself via the sporulation regulator Spo0A-P [239]. Furthermore, the expression of plcR is positively autoregulated, but is also influenced by the YvfTU two-component system, whose encoding genes lie in proximity to plcR [238,240]. PlcR is part of a quorum-sensing system requiring also the 48 amino acid signaling peptide PapR, which is encoded 70 bp downstream of plcR and exported, processed and re-imported as heptapeptide PapR7 into the cell via the oligopeptide permease OppABCDF [168,241,242,243]. Evidence has been found that the secreted neutral protease B (NprB) is required for extracellular PapR processing [244]. At high cell densities, PapR is accumulated inside the cell and functions as autoinducer for PlcR. Especially the C-terminal regions of the two partners seem to be important for their interaction [244]. The PlcR-PapR complex can then bind the PlcR box, a specific target site in the promoter region with a conserved, palindromic sequence (TATGNANNNNTNCATA), which activates gene transcription [169,201,239,242]. Crystallization revealed an asymmetric, dimeric structure of PlcR complexed with PapR, including an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and a C-terminal 11 helix domain interacting with the autoinducer. It was also suggested that this interaction causes further oligomerization of the PlcR dimers establishing a right-handed spiral interacting with the DNA [168]. Crystal structures of the apo-form of PlcR and the ternary complex with PapR and the PlcR box showed major conformational changes followed by binding of the helix-turn-helix domains in the major groove of the two half sites of the PlcR-box, revealing the mechanism of PapR-PlcR transcriptional activation [245]. Nonetheless, the PlcR-PapR system is also subject to strain-specific variations. Slamti et al. found different types of mutations in the plcR gene responsible for hemolysis- and lecithinase-negative phenotypes [246]. In B. anthracis, the PlcR regulon is silenced due to a nonsense mutation in plcR, which can be restored by the expression of a functional PlcR-PapR fusion protein [247,248]. PlcR activation due to PapR has also been shown to be strain-specific, involving especially the first amino acids of the peptide. Four classes of PlcR-PapR pairs were distinguished leading to four distinct pherotypes (based on pheromone-receptor association) among the B. cereus group [249]. Variability in enterotoxin transcription is further induced by the presence of two transcriptional start sites with two PlcR boxes upstream of the nhe operon [201,209]. Interestingly, newer studies have found a second quorum-sensing-system, consisting of PlcR-paralog PlcRa and the signaling peptide PapRa7, which is involved in oxidative stress response and cysteine metabolism. PapR variants were also able to activate PlcRa, which showed a connection between the PlcR and PlcRa regulons for the first time [250,251]. Recent studies focus on the inactivation of the PlcR-PapR quorum sensing system and, thus, the inhibition of virulence factor production due to synthetic PapR7 derivatives. Furthermore, it was found that especially proline and glutamic acid residues of PapR play an important role in PlcR regulon activation [252,253].", "The expression of the enterotoxin genes is highly complex and probably strain-specifically affected by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, oxygen tension, and nutrient (carbohydrate, nitrogen) availability, as well as by intrinsic factors such as the growth or the general energetic status of the cell [163,169,228,229,230,231,232,233,234].

Furthermore, the expression of plcR is positively autoregulated, but is also influenced by the YvfTU two-component system, whose encoding genes lie in proximity to plcR [238,240]. PlcR is part of a quorum-sensing system requiring also the 48 amino acid signaling peptide PapR, which is encoded 70 bp downstream of plcR and exported, processed and re-imported as heptapeptide PapR7 into the cell via the oligopeptide permease OppABCDF [168,241,242,243]. Evidence has been found that the secreted neutral protease B (NprB) is required for extracellular PapR processing [244]. At high cell densities, PapR is accumulated inside the cell and functions as autoinducer for PlcR. Especially the C-terminal regions of the two partners seem to be important for their interaction [244]. The PlcR-PapR complex can then bind the PlcR box, a specific target site in the promoter region with a conserved, palindromic sequence (TATGNANNNNTNCATA), which activates gene transcription [169,201,239,242]. Crystallization revealed an asymmetric, dimeric structure of PlcR complexed with PapR, including an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and a C-terminal 11 helix domain interacting with the autoinducer. It was also suggested that this interaction causes further oligomerization of the PlcR dimers establishing a right-handed spiral interacting with the DNA [168]. Crystal structures of the apo-form of PlcR and the ternary complex with PapR and the PlcR box showed major conformational changes followed by binding of the helix-turn-helix domains in the major groove of the two half sites of the PlcR-box, revealing the mechanism of PapR-PlcR transcriptional activation [245]. Nonetheless, the PlcR-PapR system is also subject to strain-specific variations. Slamti et al. found different types of mutations in the plcR gene responsible for hemolysis- and lecithinase-negative phenotypes [246]. In B. anthracis, the PlcR regulon is silenced due to a nonsense mutation in plcR, which can be restored by the expression of a functional PlcR-PapR fusion protein [247,248]. PlcR activation due to PapR has also been shown to be strain-specific, involving especially the first amino acids of the peptide. Four classes of PlcR-PapR pairs were distinguished leading to four distinct pherotypes (based on pheromone-receptor association) among the B. cereus group [249]. Variability in enterotoxin transcription is further induced by the presence of two transcriptional start sites with two PlcR boxes upstream of the nhe operon [201,209]. Interestingly, newer studies have found a second quorum-sensing-system, consisting of PlcR-paralog PlcRa and the signaling peptide PapRa7, which is involved in oxidative stress response and cysteine metabolism. PapR variants were also able to activate PlcRa, which showed a connection between the PlcR and PlcRa regulons for the first time [250,251]. Recent studies focus on the inactivation of the PlcR-PapR quorum sensing system and, thus, the inhibition of virulence factor production due to synthetic PapR7 derivatives. Furthermore, it was found that especially proline and glutamic acid residues of PapR play an important role in PlcR regulon activation [252,253].", "The expression of the enterotoxin genes is highly complex and probably strain-specifically affected by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, oxygen tension, and nutrient (carbohydrate, nitrogen) availability, as well as by intrinsic factors such as the growth or the general energetic status of the cell [163,169,228,229,230,231,232,233,234]. Next to the PlcR-boxes (see Figure 4), binding sites for further transcriptional regulatory proteins such as CodY, ResD, Fnr, CcpA and SinR have been identified in the promoter regions of the hbl and nhe operons, which presumably control enterotoxin expression in a concerted action [169,210,230,233,235,236].

Generally, this conserved transcriptional repressor senses nutrient availability and the energy status of the cell in low GC Gram-positive bacteria by binding GTP or branched-chain amino acids. Under nutrient starvation, genes of the CodY regulon involved in motility, chemotaxis, catabolism, and virulence are derepressed in complex ways, directly or indirectly [170,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264]. First studies with codY deletion mutants in B. cereus pointed to strong effects of the regulator on the PlcR-PapR quorum sensing system and assigned CodY a key role in pathogenicity, toxin production and adaptation to nutrient starvation [163,254]. On the one hand, CodY influences enterotoxin gene expression directly via binding to specific target sites in their promoter regions. Upstream of the nhe and hbl operons, long 5\u2032 untranslated regions were detected, in which one (hbl) and even two (nhe) CodY binding site were identified [210]. Furthermore, the length of these regions also influences promoter activities. While PlcR binding sites are conserved inside the B. cereus group, higher variability has been found among the CodY recognition sites. This leads to diverging affinity of the regulator to its target promoter regions and thus can be one explanation for the high strain-specific variability in enterotoxin production [210]. On the other hand, CodY exerts influence on PlcR by regulating the re-import of the signaling peptide PapR.

The two-component system ResDE was shown to control fermentative growth and enterotoxin expression under low oxidoreduction potential anaerobic conditions [229]. ResD is the response regulator and ResE the corresponding sensor kinase. ResD directly binds to the promoter regions of hbl and nhe, as well as resDE, fnr, and plcR [235]. It has also been shown that phosphorylation increases ResD interaction with resDE and fnr promoters, and that ResD and Fnr bind their target DNA in a concerted action. It was further suggested that ResD acts as anti-activator, and ResD-P as an activator of Fnr [235]. Fnr is a redox regulator necessary for fermentative growth under low oxidoreduction potential, as shown in an fnr deletion strain of B. cereus. Furthermore, expression of the hbl and nhe operons was significantly decreased in the mutant strain [234].

An Fnr monomer binds one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, which is, though, not required for DNA binding or formation of the complex [268]. Another intriguing fact is that Fnr positively regulates Escherichia coli ClyA (see Section 4.1.3) [269].

On the one hand, expression of hblB might be independent from the hblCDA operon due to its putative own promoter [204,206]. Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses already revealed two-fold upregulation of hblB in hyperflagellated swarm cells [277]. Furthermore, expression of hblB was found to be 126-fold down-regulated in the presence of mucin, while nheB and hblA were 100-fold and 110-fold up-regulated, respectively [278]. This observation confirmed a separate, so far unknown regulatory mechanism. Moreover, Clair et al. showed that Hbl and Nhe secretion is influenced by the OhrRA system, which is involved in response to redox changes. It was suggested that OhrA affects toxin secretion mainly post-transcriptionally and that OhrR might even be a transcriptional repressor for hblCDAB and nheAB [279]. A deletion mutant of transcriptional regulator RpoN (sigma 54) was impaired in NheA production [280]. Especially the unusually long 5\u2032 non translated regions of the hbl and nhe operons might harbor additional regulatory mechanisms. Intergenic regions encoding small regulatory peptides or proteins are increasingly found in prokaryotes [281]. Upstream of the hbl operon, a potential ORF encoding a so far unknown protein has been identified [210].

This observation confirmed a separate, so far unknown regulatory mechanism. Moreover, Clair et al. showed that Hbl and Nhe secretion is influenced by the OhrRA system, which is involved in response to redox changes.

Besides temperature, oxygen tension, nutrient availability, growth phase etc. (see above), the host epithelium is of particular interest. Very recently, we identified massive transcriptional changes in B. cereus after contact with mucin, including genes encoding enterotoxins (Hbl, Nhe) and further putative virulence factors. The number of secreted enterotoxins was also increased in various B. cereus strains, depending on mucin concentration [278]. Previously, we showed that the secretome of CaCo-2 cells influences entero-toxin gene expression and toxin production [92]. Growing for only two hours in cell culture medium pre-incubated with CaCo-2 cells mimicking intestinal conditions, enterotoxin gene expression of different B. cereus strains was activated and total protein secretion was enhanced. Similarly, germination of spores from eight out of 11 enterotoxic B. cereus strains was triggered by differentiated CaCo-2 cells in an earlier study. The germinant, which still needs to be identified, is secreted by the cells, stable towards heat and proteolysis, and most likely bound or degraded by the spores [282]. Our own studies proved that the factor triggering enterotoxin production under simulated intestinal conditions also originates from the CaCo-2 cells, is used up by the bacteria, and affects high as well as low toxic B. cereus strains [92].

The amino acid sequences of all Nhe and Hbl components contain N-terminal signal peptides for secretion, indicating toxin secretion via the Sec translocation pathway. Modification of this signal sequence in Hbl B led to loss of secretion and thus, to intracellular accumulation of the protein. It was additionally shown that sodium azide, an inhibitor of SecA, reduced secretion of the enterotoxins and enhanced their intracellular accumulation [283]. The Sec translocation machinery consists of SecYEG (pore), SecDF and the ATPase SecA. The number of enterotoxins in the secretome was clearly reduced in a \u0394secDF mutant. Further enzymes such as chaperones or peptidases are also involved in the secretion process [284,285]. On the other hand, evidence has been found for an involvement of flagella in the export of several virulence factors. The flagellar export apparatus, which resembles the type III secretion system in Gram-negative bacteria, can also be used for secretion of non-flagellar proteins [286]. Motility and virulence are connected in B. cereus via flagella, as flagellin expression and motility were decreased in a plcR mutant [237,287].

Furthermore, hblC transcription was impaired in the flhA mutant [291]. The correlation between swarming and hemolysin BL secretion in 42 B. cereus group isolates confirmed this connection [289].

The mechanism of pore formation is significantly different from other known toxins. First, linear oligomers of different sizes are built, then they assemble as pairs, which are able to directly close the pore complex ring, which makes pore formation extremely fast and efficient [313,319,320].

Thus, the current model is that the three components bind to the target cell surface sequentially in the required binding order for pore formation B-L1-L2 [204,301]. Hbl B alone shows neither cytotoxic activity nor pore formation on target cells [204,301] or artificial lipid bilayers [324]. On the other hand, it has been determined that the Hbl components form complexes in solution prior to cell binding, and that Hbl B, recombinant, as well as native in B. cereus culture supernatants, is mainly present in those complexes. Recombinant Hbl B binds to L1 with a KD value of 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22127 M, and Hbl L2 to L1 with a KD value of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 M. Binding of Hbl L2 to B was observed only in a certain constellation and is comparably weak, with a KD value of 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 M [308]. Furthermore, Hbl B alone was able to form up to 600 kDa multimeric complexes. Those complexes, which still showed pore-forming activity, also comprised Hbl L1 and L2 [324]. Another interesting fact is that heat treatment led to a decrease of pore-forming and cytotoxic activity of Hbl at approximately 60 \u00b0C, and a subsequent increase at higher temperatures. The latter is caused by releasing Hbl B monomers from the tight complexation observed earlier, thus enhancing Hbl B binding to the target cell surface [324]. These initially contradictory findings, of only Hbl B binding to the cell surface, and of its tight complexation, can nevertheless be equally appropriate. Similar to the above described ClyA mechanism, homo-(Hbl B) as well as hetero-oligomers (Hbl B-L1 and L1-L2) would be present in solution, letting the final assembly of the pore at the cell surface take place immediately. Rapid Hbl pore formation has been shown [227,301]. However, not only do the binding order and pre-formed complexes play a role in Hbl pore formation, but also to a large extent the concentration ratio of the three components. Most rapid pore formation was detected with ratios L2:L1:B = 1:1:10 and 10:1:10, meaning that surplus of Hbl B enhances, and surplus of Hbl L1 hinders the velocity of pore formation, while the amount of Hbl L2 seems not to be crucial [301]. It has further been proven that binding of Hbl B to the cell surface is the most essential step for pore formation and cytotoxic activity. Most interestingly, this binding step is enhanced in the presence of Hbl L1 [301], similarly to the presence of certain Hbl B-specific monoclonal antibodies, which has been described as antibody-dependent enhancement [308,325]. Again, these findings attribute a major role in Hbl pore formation to the pre-formed B-L1 complexes, which seem to be as necessary as sufficient amounts of free Hbl B. Recently, new insights into the properties of the Hbl pores were gained. Experiments on planar lipid bilayers demonstrated that the Hbl pores have a rather small single channel conductance of around 200 pS and a probable channel diameter of at least 1 nm [324]. This correlates with earlier observations from osmotic protection experiments using carbohydrates, in which the channel diameter was estimated at 1.2 nm [300]. Moreover, the Hbl pores seem to be highly instable and of a limited lifetime, as well as slightly cation selective [324].", "What became obvious is that all three components are necessary for biological (hemolytic or cytotoxic) activity, and that a defined concentration ratio is required.

Generally, these made faster progress compared to Hbl, as no second enterotoxin complex disturbed the tests, and natural [326,327,328] as well as constructed [217] mutants of the single Nhe components existed. When Nhe was first discovered in the 1990s, no hemolysis on sheep blood agar could be detected, thus it was mistakenly described as \u201cnon-hemolytic\u201d. However, Nhe shows hemolytic activity against erythrocytes depending on the species used. It is furthermore cytotoxic towards different epithelial cells, as shown by loss of ATP and LDH [217]. This study initially described Nhe as a pore forming toxin producing large conductance channels, which leads to osmotic swelling and, finally, lysis of the epithelial cells. All three Nhe components are necessary for maximum biological activity in vitro, which also requires a specific concentration ratio (NheA:B:C = 10:10:1) [209]. In a more recent study, varying ratios were detected in 12 B. cereus isolates, of which some showed a slightly higher (3:1) or a slightly lower (1:2) NheA:B ratio, which did, however, not influence the toxic activity [329]. A specific binding order of the three components is also necessary for pore formation [209]. In the study of Lindb\u00e4ck et al., only NheB was able to directly bind to the surface of the target cell, and binding was abolished by excess of NheC. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that NheB as well as NheC can bind independently to the target cell surface and that NheC presence is mandatory in the first, and NheA in the final step of pore formation [328]. However, NheB and C form highly affine and stable complexes in solution (KD value of 4.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 M [330]), which impedes the detection of NheC in the supernatant of B. cereus cultures via specific antibodies. This might be the reason why NheC has initially not been detected as part of the Nhe toxin complex [33,207,306], and why it is generally not found in the B. cereus culture secretome or only in very low concentrations [53,226,248]. The approximately 620 kDa NheB-C complexes consist of at least one NheC molecule and up to 15 NheB molecules [330]. Furthermore, the Nhe components seem to be additionally processed in the extracellular space, after separation from the signal peptide for secretion. The shorter forms lack up to 12 additional N-terminal amino acids while remaining their cytotoxic activity [33,306,331]. A defined ratio of NheB and C in the complexes (NheB:C = 10:1), as well as a sufficient amount of free NheB, is essential for effective cell binding and the cytotoxic activity of Nhe [327]. Moreover, in an appropriate concentration ratio, the NheB-C complexes themselves are capable of forming stable transmembrane channels with a diameter of approximately 2 nm, and thus increase membrane permeability of the target cells even before formation of the whole pore [330]. To complete the pore, NheA, which is not able to interact with NheB or C in solution, binds to cell-bound NheB. For this, an NheB:C ratio of 10:1 is also mandatory. Artificial addition of NheC resulting in a ratio of NheB:C = 1:1 led to reduced cell binding of NheB [327] as well as to reduced amounts of NheA at the cell surface [329]. Evidence has been found that the N-terminus of NheA is important for attaching to cell-bound NheB-C and that NheB is the main interaction partner for NheA [329]. Several studies proved that the pore forming procedure involves massive conformational changes of all protein components and that especially NheA is highly flexible [326,329,332], similarly to ClyA (see above). Osmotic protection and lipid bilayer experiments have also pointed to a comparable size of the ClyA and the Nhe full pores [217]. Another similarity is the permeabilization of the target cell membrane even before formation of the full pore [321,330]. A recent study showed that NheABC (ratio 10:10:1) forms large, stable pores with a conductance of approximately 18 nS on planar lipid bilayers. Increased amounts of NheC led to smaller and instable pores [309]. What all three (ClyA, Nhe and Hbl) pores seem to have in common is their selectiveness for cations [217,315,324]. Distinct features of the ClyA, Hbl and Nhe pores are comparatively summarized in Table 1.

To complete the pore, NheA, which is not able to interact with NheB or C in solution, binds to cell-bound NheB. For this, an NheB:C ratio of 10:1 is also mandatory. Artificial addition of NheC resulting in a ratio of NheB:C = 1:1 led to reduced cell binding of NheB [327] as well as to reduced amounts of NheA at the cell surface [329]. Evidence has been found that the N-terminus of NheA is important for attaching to cell-bound NheB-C and that NheB is the main interaction partner for NheA [329]. Several studies proved that the pore forming procedure involves massive conformational changes of all protein components and that especially NheA is highly flexible [326,329,332], similarly to ClyA (see above). Osmotic protection and lipid bilayer experiments have also pointed to a comparable size of the ClyA and the Nhe full pores [217]. Another similarity is the permeabilization of the target cell membrane even before formation of the full pore [321,330]. A recent study showed that NheABC (ratio 10:10:1) forms large, stable pores with a conductance of approximately 18 nS on planar lipid bilayers. Increased amounts of NheC led to smaller and instable pores [309]. What all three (ClyA, Nhe and Hbl) pores seem to have in common is their selectiveness for cations [217,315,324]. Distinct features of the ClyA, Hbl and Nhe pores are comparatively summarized in Table 1. Figure 5 illustrates similarities and differences in the mechanism of pore formation of Hbl and Nhe.", "To sum up, both enterotoxin complexes need all three components for full biological activity [204,209,301]. In a first step, the components of both toxins form complexes in solution. Hbl B-L1, Hbl L2-L1, and Hbl L2-B form complexes with decreasing affinities [308]. Moreover, Hbl B itself oligomerizes [324]. On the other hand, NheB and C binding is highly affine, while NheA is not able to interact with the other components in solution [329,330]. In both cases, sufficient amounts of free Hbl B and NheB, the binding components, are also required [301,324,327], but complex formation seems to be a great advantage for the efficiency of the formation of both pores. In a second step, the NheB-C complexes attach to the cell membrane and form small, permeable pro-pores [327,330]. In case of Hbl, only Hbl B binds to the cell surface, but binding is enhanced in the presence of L1 [301]. Free Hbl L1 can subsequently bind to B [204,301]. Excess of Hbl L1 as well as NheC can impair the pore forming process. The optimal concentration ratio for maximum pore formation is Hbl L2:L1:B = 1:1:10, and NheA:B:C = 10:10:1 [209,301,327]. The third step consists of attachment of Hbl L2 or NheA. Especially for Hbl L2, only small amounts are needed compared to the other components [301,324,329].

Moreover, the Nhe pores seem to be more stable and persistent on planar lipid bilayers than the Hbl pores (see Table 1). On the other hand, Hbl pore formation seems to be more rapid and efficient [227,301].

Nevertheless, the latter were responsible for significantly increased cytotoxicity after 24 h [227]. Thus, it can be concluded that Hbl pores are formed more quickly, but that Nhe pores, not least due to their size, cause more damage to the target cell membrane. Once again, this indicates a different mode of action of the two enterotoxin complexes. It has been speculated that Nhe is the more dominant enterotoxin, as it is more frequently present, cytotoxicity correlates well with the amount of NheB, and toxic activity was eliminated by deletion of nhe genes [5,53,217]. On the other hand, disruption of the hbl genes also resulted in decreased cytotoxicity in a different strain, and residual cytotoxic activity was observed after removal of Nhe from culture supernatants [205,227].

After that discovery, however, a further unique characteristic of the B. cereus group would be a toxin consisting not only of three, but of four individual, active protein components. As described in Section 4.1.1, the more common hblCDAB operon includes a fourth gene encoding Hbl B\u2019, which shows some sequence similarities, but also differences compared to Hbl B. It has been suggested that hblB is transcribed independently from hblCDA [206]. Consensually, total transcriptome analyses revealed that hblB was down-regulated in reference strain F837/76 in the presence of mucin, while hblA was up-regulated [278]. Moreover, the protein was found in the secretome of B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579 [206]. Our own, recent data bear evidence that the Hbl B\u2019 protein indeed plays a role in the complex formation and pore-forming activity of Hbl and it should thus be considered as the fourth component of the rather quadripartite Hbl enterotoxin complex. Furthermore, we detected it in culture supernatants of several enteropathogenic B. cereus strains, which increases its relevance (data unpublished).", "Since their discovery, it was believed that the above described three-protein-component enterotoxins are a unique feature of the B. cereus group [5]. Just recently, extensive in silico search revealed Hbl and Nhe orthologues, and tripartite toxins of the ClyA family, in Gram-negative bacteria such as Serratia marcescens, Erwinia mallotivora and Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, the tripartite \u03b1-pore forming toxin AhlABC of A. hydrophila was characterized in detail [336].

At this point, the question frequently arose whether specific target structures and receptors for Hbl and Nhe exist. Generally, pore forming toxins get to their target cell membrane in their soluble form by binding to proteinaceous receptors or by specifically interacting with different lipids [339]. The Cry toxins from B. thuringiensis, for instance, interact with insect-specific receptors such as cadherin-like proteins, aminopeptidase N, alkaline phosphatase or ATP binding transporters [340,341]. For S. aureus hemolysins, specific target proteins such as disintegrin are known, and C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) attaches to claudin [339]. The protective antigen (PA) from B. anthracis binds CMG2 (capillary morphogenesis gene 2 or ANTXR2) and TEM8 (tumor endothelial marker 8 or ANTXR1) receptors at the cell surface. Both are integrin-like proteins associated with proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as collagen and fibronectin [342]. On the other hand, Cyt toxins from B. thuringiensis recognize membrane lipids such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine or sphingomyelin [107,343]. Actinoporins for instance interact with sphingomyelin, perfringolysin O and listeriolysin O with cholesterol. Cholesterol is also listed as target structure for ClyA, Hbl and Nhe [339], however, this has only been experimentally proven for ClyA (see Table 1 and [316,321,334]). On the one hand, the broad range of target cells (see above), as well as the ability of NheB-C [330], NheABC [309] and Hbl [324] to form pores in artificial lipid bilayers, oppose the existence of specific (protein) receptors. On the other hand, Hbl and Nhe contribute differentially to total cytotoxicity of B. cereus supernatants. In a study from 2014, total cytotoxic activity of strain F4430/73 on HUVEC was dominated by Nhe (90%), while on A549 cells 75% of the cytotoxic effects could be attributed to Hbl. Further on, U937 cells proved to be nearly resistant towards Nhe [227]. These variations point to specific enterotoxin target structures. Specific receptors also best fit the proposed models for Hbl and Nhe pore formation and mode of action (Section 4.1.3).

Generally, a great variety of cellular reactions to pore-forming toxins exist. First, pore formation decreases the intracellular potassium concentration, which activates different signal pathways including the inflammasome complex (e.g., aerolysin, Vibrio cholerae cytolysin, Clostridium \u03b2-toxin or S. aureus toxins), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signal pathways or autophagy (e.g., S. marcescens ShlA or S. aureus \u03b1-hemolysin). Pore formation in the cell membrane can also induce calcium influx, which again activates different signal cascades [339,344]. It has further been reported that pore forming toxins alter gene expression in the target cells [345]. When cells are exposed to small toxin concentrations, or over a short period of time, mechanisms for membrane repair become effective, which mostly depend on calcium. Pores can be taken up via endocytosis and further be degraded or emitted. Alternatively, membrane vesicles including the toxins can be separated [339,345]. Liu et al. showed that Nhe is able to induce apoptosis in Vero cells. As mentioned above, the formation of the Nhe pore leads to calcium influx into the cells, oxidative stress, and thus to an activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) and p38 MAPK. The latter is additionally activated by Fas (tumor necrosis factor superfamily receptor). The kinases subsequently activate caspase-8 and caspase-3 for induction of apoptosis [346]. Recently, it has been shown that Hbl as well as Nhe is able to induce inflammasome-mediated mortality of macrophages [337,338]. Formation of the lytic pore at the macrophage cell membrane leads to potassium efflux, subsequent activation of the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome, secretion of interleukin-1\u03b2 and interleukin-18, and pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. The authors concluded that Hbl and Nhe operate synergistically to induce inflammation and that the detection of inflammasome-activating toxins in the cytosol is essential for recognizing a B. cereus infection [337,338].

Often neonates, elderly or immunosuppressed patients are affected [347,348], but infections of immunocompetent persons are also known [349]. These include local, especially post-operative skin and wound infections [347,349,350], septicemia [350,351,352,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360], meningitis [361,362,363,364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372], pneumonia (often by B. cereus strains exhibiting B. anthracis toxin genes) [373,374,375,376,377,378] and endocarditis [379,380,381,382,383,384,385,386,387,388]. Several studies focus on B. cereus-associated endophthalmitis, which occurs mainly following post-traumatic injuries and often leads to loss of vision or even of the eye in less than 48 h. Severe inflammation is caused by the concerted action of rapid bacterial replication, migration and toxin production [389]. Early studies found evidence for an involvement of Hbl, phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C and collagenase in B. cereus endophthalmitis [302,303]. By now, it is believed that the combination of multiple virulence factors and toxins leads to intraocular virulence [389]. Using deletion mutants, it was shown that the quorum sensing regulator PlcR (see also Section 4.1.2) contributes significantly to the disease, on the one hand by controlling toxin and virulence factor expression, but also by controlling expression of cell wall components and bacterial motility [287,390,391]. Motility and swarming behavior, as well as cell wall components such as flagella and pili or the S-layer are also a trigger for intraocular inflammation [392,393,394,395]. The disease results from the interplay of various bacterial and host factors [389,396,397], which makes clinical treatment difficult. Applying sublethal doses of carvacrol, for instance, enhanced nhe and hbl gene expression and toxin production, as well as stress-induced virulence against Caenorhabditis elegans and mice [398]. Further recent studies focus on genotyping, whole genome sequencing and, thus, on the identification of other putative B. cereus virulence factors involved in endophthalmitis [399,400,401].

Severe inflammation is caused by the concerted action of rapid bacterial replication, migration and toxin production [389]. Early studies found evidence for an involvement of Hbl, phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C and collagenase in B. cereus endophthalmitis [302,303]. By now, it is believed that the combination of multiple virulence factors and toxins leads to intraocular virulence [389]. Using deletion mutants, it was shown that the quorum sensing regulator PlcR (see also Section 4.1.2) contributes significantly to the disease, on the one hand by controlling toxin and virulence factor expression, but also by controlling expression of cell wall components and bacterial motility [287,390,391]. Motility and swarming behavior, as well as cell wall components such as flagella and pili or the S-layer are also a trigger for intraocular inflammation [392,393,394,395]. The disease results from the interplay of various bacterial and host factors [389,396,397], which makes clinical treatment difficult. Applying sublethal doses of carvacrol, for instance, enhanced nhe and hbl gene expression and toxin production, as well as stress-induced virulence against Caenorhabditis elegans and mice [398].
