["", "Natural products\nprovide a rich source of potential antimicrobials\nfor treating infectious diseases for which drug resistance has emerged.\nForemost among these diseases is tuberculosis. Assessment of the antimycobacterial\nactivity of nargenicin, a natural product that targets the replicative\nDNA polymerase of Staphylococcus aureus, revealed that it is a bactericidal genotoxin that induces a DNA\ndamage response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and inhibits growth by blocking the replicative\nDNA polymerase, DnaE1. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that binding\nof nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate\nsuch that nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and\nthe polymerase and occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide\nand templating base. Comparative analysis across three bacterial species\nsuggests that the activity of nargenicin is partly attributable to\nthe DNA binding affinity of the replicative polymerase. This work\nhas laid the foundation for target-led drug discovery efforts focused\non Mtb DnaE1.", "Claiming\nan estimated 1.5 million\nlives in 2020, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes\nof death globally from an infectious disease.1 The severe disruptions to health services wrought by the COVID-19\npandemic are predicted to worsen this grim toll by a further 1 million\nTB deaths per annum over the next four years.1 In the absence of a highly efficacious vaccine, prolonged chemotherapy\nwith combinations of anti-TB drugs forms the cornerstone of TB control.\nHowever, the increase of drug resistance through ongoing evolution\nand spread of drug-resistant strains of the etiologic agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),\nis undermining current efforts. This problem, exacerbated by additional\ntreatment delays caused by the pandemic, underscores the urgent need\nfor new TB drugs with distinct mechanisms of action for inclusion\nin shorter, safer, and more effective drug regimens. The TB drug discovery\nand development pipeline established in recent years has begun to\ndeliver new and repurposed drugs and combinations that have revolutionized\nthe treatment of drug-resistant TB2 and\ndemonstrated that treatment shortening is an achievable goal.3 However, maintaining this momentum requires replenishment\nof the pipeline with high-quality hit compounds that show mechanistic\nnovelty.4 This is a key objective of the\nTuberculosis Drug Accelerator (TBDA).5", "Of the vital cellular processes targeted by TB drugs in clinical\nuse, DNA replication stands out as relatively under-represented;6\u22128 this is despite the high vulnerability of some genes essential for\nDNA replication in Mtb,9 including those encoding DNA gyrase, the target of the fluoroquinolones,\nmoxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin, and the only DNA metabolic\nenzyme currently targeted for TB therapy. Fluoroquinolones inhibit\nDNA gyrase with bactericidal consequences for Mtb(10,11) and have been incorporated in second-line therapy\nfor multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB12 and\nin treatment-shortening regimens for drug-susceptible TB.3 The identification of novel scaffolds that target\nDNA gyrase remains an active area of investigation,13,14 while topoisomerase I is also being pursued as a new TB drug target.15 Recently, the replisome\u2014the macromolecular\nmachine that copies the bacterial chromosome\u2014has emerged as\nan attractive target for TB6,7 and antibacterial drug\ndiscovery, more generally.16 Key discoveries\ninvolving natural products have added impetus to exploring this target\nfurther: first, griselimycin, a cyclic depsipeptide discovered more\nthan 50 years ago, was shown to bind with high affinity and selectivity\nto the \u03b2-clamp (DnaN) at the site of interaction with DNA polymerase\nand other DNA metabolizing enzymes.17 During\nDNA replication, the \u03b2-clamp interacts with DnaE1, the replicative\nDNA polymerase termed variously as DnaE, DnaE1, or PolC in different\nbacteria, greatly enhancing the processivity of the polymerase. Griselimycin\ninterferes with the protein interaction between DnaE1 and the \u03b2-clamp,\naffecting the processivity of DNA replication.17 The mechanistic novelty of griselimycin led to the development\nof the analogue, cyclohexyl-griselimycin, which has improved potency\nand stability and demonstrated comparable efficacy to rifampicin when\nused in combination with first-line drugs in a mouse infection model.17 Second, studies in Staphylococcus\naureus identified the replicative DNA polymerase,\nDnaE, as the target of nargenicin A1 (referred to here as nargenicin),18 which belongs to a class of partially saturated\nalicyclic polyketides comprising an octalin ring (Figure 1A).19 Nargenicin is an ether-bridged macrolide antibiotic first isolated\nfrom various Nocardia species almost three decades\nago.20,21 It is a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial18 with activity against gram-positive bacteria,\nincluding methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Micrococcus luteus.22 The identification of narR/ngnU,21,23 a dnaE homologue immediately\nadjacent to the nargenicin biosynthetic gene cluster in the producer\norganism, Nocardia sp.
