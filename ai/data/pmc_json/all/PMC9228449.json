["These authors contributed equally to this work.", "Obesity is an important public health problem nowadays. Long-term obesity can trigger a series of chronic diseases and impair the learning and memory function of the brain. Current studies show that scientific exercise can effectively improve learning and memory capacity, which also can provide benefits for obese people. However, the underlying mechanisms for the improvement of cognitive capacity under the status of obesity still need to be further explored. In the present study, the obesity-induced cognition-declined model was established using 4-week-old mice continuously fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, and then the model mice were subjected to an 8-week swimming intervention and corresponding evaluation of relevant indicators, including cognitive capacity, inflammation, insulin signal pathway, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF), and apoptosis, for exploring potential regulatory mechanisms. Compared with the mice fed with regular diets, the obese mice revealed the impairment of cognitive capacity; in contrast, swimming intervention ameliorated the decline in cognitive capacity of obese mice by reducing inflammatory factors, inhibiting the JNK/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signal pathway, and activating the PGC-1\u03b1/BDNF signal pathway, thereby suppressing the apoptosis of neurons. Therefore, swimming may be an important interventional strategy to compensate for obesity-induced cognitive impairment.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Obesity, as a sub-health stage with the excessive accumulation of body fat, is mainly affected by genetics and lifestyles. Due to the long-term chronic inflammatory state and abnormal metabolism as the hotbed for metabolic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and nervous system diseases, obesity has become a public health problem that is a current research focus all over the world. Currently, nearly one-third of the world\u2019s population is overweight or obese [1]. According to the Epidemiological Survey in China from 2015\u20132019, the obesity rate in China reveals a significant increase, and children and adolescents have also become the hardest-hit areas for obesity [2]. Unhealthy diets such as high-fat and high-sugar diets may cause damage of brain tissues, thus resulting in the decline in cognitive and learning capacity [3]. Therefore, reducing high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and alleviating the impaired brain function have become an urgent problem to be solved.", "Obesity, as a sub-health stage with the excessive accumulation of body fat, is mainly affected by genetics and lifestyles.

Previous studies have demonstrated that obesity-induced impairment of cognitive and memory function can be suppressed and rescued after exercise [4], ketogenic diet [5], and surgical interventions due to body weight loss [6]. Therefore, the gain of body weight may be the culprit. However, adolescents are in the rapid growth and development stage, and surgical, drug, and dietary interventions may adversely affect the body. Exercise is an economical and green intervention strategy for health promotion, physical fitness, and obesity management. Considering the impact of different exercise methods on obesity, swimming intervention that is more suitable for obesity was selected in this study. In addition, previous studies on molecular mechanisms have shown that the decline in cognitive function may be correlated with insulin resistance, neurotrophic factor deficiency, apoptosis, and reduced synaptic plasticity in obesity models, as well as the long-term chronic inflammation at the status of obesity [7]. Insulin resistance in the hippocampus is an important factor that leads to the decline of cognitive function. Insulin resistance may also indirectly result in the adverse impact on synaptic plasticity by reducing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), eventually leading to the decline of cognitive and memory function [8]. Many studies using HFD-induced obesity mouse models have also documented the increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and reduced BDNF level in the hippocampus [9,10,11,12]. Therefore, reduced inflammation, increased insulin sensitivity, up-regulated BDNF, and suppressed apoptosis of neurons may be the critical molecular mechanisms for ameliorating obesity-induced cognitive decline during the process of body weight loss.", "There are many ways to intervene obesity, including exercise, diets, drugs, and surgery.

Conclusions", "5. Conclusions", "Adolescents require more nutrients and energy, but the consumption of long-term high-fat diets can also lead to body weight gain and impaired learning and memory capacity, which is highly correlated with neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, reduced neurotrophic factors, and increased neuronal apoptosis. Swimming intervention can reverse these abnormal changes to rescue the impaired learning and memory capacity in obese mice by reducing obesity, alleviating hippocampal neuroinflammation, activating insulin signaling, promoting the generation and secretion of neurotrophic factors, and suppressing hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in adolescent mice, with the involvement of the JNK/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt and PGC-1\u03b1/BDNF signal pathways (Figure 8).", "Adolescents require more nutrients and energy, but the consumption of long-term high-fat diets can also lead to body weight gain and impaired learning and memory capacity, which is highly correlated with neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, reduced neurotrophic factors, and increased neuronal apoptosis.
