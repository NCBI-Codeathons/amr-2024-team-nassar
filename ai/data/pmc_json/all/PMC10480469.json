["Camptothecin is an important anticancer alkaloid produced by particular plant species. No suitable synthetic route has been established for camptothecin production yet, imposing a stress on plant-based production systems. Endophytes associated with these camptothecin-producing plants have been reported to also produce camptothecin and other high-value phytochemicals. A previous study identified a fungal endophyte Alternaria burnsii NCIM 1409, isolated from Nothapodytes nimmoniana, to be a sustainable producer of camptothecin. Our study provides key insights on camptothecin biosynthesis in this recently discovered endophyte. The whole genome sequence of A. burnsii NCIM 1409 was assembled and screened for biosynthetic gene clusters. Comparative studies with related fungi supported the identification of candidate genes involved in camptothecin synthesis and also helped to understand some aspects of the endophyte\u2019s defense against the toxic effects of camptothecin. No evidence for horizontal gene transfer of the camptothecin biosynthetic genes from the host plant to the endophyte was detected suggesting an independent evolution of the camptothecin biosynthesis in this fungus.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Humans are dependent on plants for a wide variety of natural products.

Camptothecin-producing plant species are highlighted in green.", "Camptothecin binds to the DNA topoisomerase-I, stalls the replication process, and causes cell death. This pharmacological effect makes camptothecin a valuable anticancer molecule. Camptothecin acts only during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Since cancer cells spend a greater proportion of time in S-phase compared to non-cancerous cells, the probability of camptothecin binding to cancer cells is greater4. The various drugs derived from camptothecin like topotecan and irinotecan are included in the World Health Organization\u2019s model list of essential medicines5. The increasing demand for camptothecin has led to an irrational exploitation of the producing plant species, pushing them towards extinction6. Slow growth of these plants makes it difficult to achieve a balance of utilization and regeneration by planting activities. Highly variable amounts of camptothecin in different plants pose another issue that makes it difficult to standardize and produce plant-based extracts with consistent levels of active ingredient7. There is also a high degree of heterogeneity in the metabolites produced by the same plant species located in different geographical regions8. Moreover, chemical synthesis of products synthesized by plants is difficult and often not eco-friendly due to the use of toxic solvents and harsh reagents9. Complex chemical structures like quinolone rings, which are a part of the phytochemical molecules, are extremely difficult to synthesize artificially, making chemical synthesis of such high value phytochemicals unfeasible. Plant cell cultures could be harnessed for the production of these molecules. But such methods are not cost-effective and time consuming when compared to microbial production platforms10. The challenges associated with plant-based extraction, culturing and chemical synthesis routes, make microbial synthesis of phytochemicals a suitable method for achieving the goal of sustainable production of these high value products3, 11. Plants and their resident microbes called endophytes have established intriguing partnerships through co-evolution. Endophytes are microbes (bacteria or fungi) that reside within the tissues of a plant without harming the host plant7. Some of these endophytes are able to synthesize the specialized metabolites produced by the host plants. The endophytes may have gained this ability to produce metabolites from the host plant through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, evolutionary and environmental constraints placed on the endophyte for mutual co-existence along with the host, could also cause an independent evolution of the capacity to synthesize the host-produced metabolites12. Tolerance towards host-produced metabolites is necessary for the endophyte to ensure a mutual coexistence. This tolerance might be a prerequisite for the evolution of the corresponding biosynthesis pathway. For example, a tolerance for camptothecin might have evolved first in the endophyte which paved the way for a later evolution of the camptothecin biosynthesis pathway13.", "Camptothecin binds to the DNA topoisomerase-I, stalls the replication process, and causes cell death.

If it is the latter scenario, a sustainable microbial production route for the metabolite could be feasible12. Moreover, such a microbe must also be a sustainable producer of the metabolite under industrial conditions to become a suitable production host. Unfortunately, attenuation of the product is frequently observed in the endophyte during subsequent sub-culture cycles14, 15. A probable reason that has been proposed is the absence of inducing or silencing genes in the axenic cultures of the endophyte14.

Critical residues in DNA topoisomerase I sequences from two fungi\u2014A. burnsii NCIM 1409 producing camptothecin, and Xylaria sp. M71 producing 10-Hydroxy-camptothecin show no variation and are highly similar to each other as well as to other compared sequences of fungi that are not reported producers of camptothecin.", "Discussion", "Discussion", "The genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the novel fungal endophyte A. burnsii NCIM 1409 was carried out for the first time in this study.

Among such clusters, terpene biosynthesis gene clusters seem to play a major role in facilitating signal transfer between the host and endophyte during plant\u2013microbe interactions48. The 25 gene clusters identified in A. burnsii NCIM 1409 could provide potential clues to understand specialized metabolite synthesis in the endophyte. With camptothecin being a monoterpene indole alkaloid, the terpene clusters and the hybrid NRPS-like, indole cluster 11 (Table 2), could harbor potential genes involved in camptothecin biosynthesis. The novel endophyte in focus was isolated from N. nimmoniana. The camptothecin biosynthesis pathway in the host plant is complex, starting from the mevalonate (MVA) pathway or the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and the shikimate pathway. The MVA or the MEP pathway produce isoprenoid molecules that are modified further to produce secologanin. The shikimate pathway produces tryptophan that condenses with secologanin to produce \u2018strictosidine synthase\u2019 (STR)\u2014the parent molecule for a wide variety of MIAs. The steps of the pathway leading to camptothecin, after the Pictet Spengler reaction catalyzed by STR, have eluded researchers so far33, 49. Since the endophyte isolated from the host, retained its ability to produce camptothecin for over 12 sub-culture cycles independent of the host3, 11, it was expected that during its life cycle in the host tissues, some of the key genes encoding crucial enzymes in camptothecin synthesis might have been transferred from the host plant to the endophyte. This prompted the investigation to assess for the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer between the host and the fungus. If horizontal gene transfer would have been detected, then that could have revealed more genes involved in camptothecin synthesis in A. burnsii NCIM 1409. However, the present study does not reveal any evidence for HGT from the host to the endophyte. This observation is also corroborated by a few other studies that investigated HGT from host plants to endophytes producing similar specialized metabolites. Extremely low similarity was found between fungal sequences of taxol producing fungi isolated from the yew tree and taxane specific genes in the yew tree50. HGT was also found to be absent between the paclitaxel producing fungus Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62,431 isolated from the hazel plant (Corylus avellana)51. The researchers hypothesize that the taxol-producing genes in the endophyte possess a completely different evolutionary pattern. These reports and the inferences from the present study indicate the possibility for independent evolution of camptothecin biosynthesis in A. burnsii NCIM 1409. It also needs to be emphasized here that, while this work does not report any evidence for horizontal gene transfer, at the same time, it does not completely negate the possibility for such an HGT event. Based on the investigations for HGT, this study proposes a plausible possibility for an independent camptothecin biosynthesis machinery in the endophyte. Although the HGT hypothesis was not helpful in finding camptothecin candidate genes in the endophyte, comparative studies with other fungi revealed a number of candidate genes. The fungi included in the comparative analysis were classified into three bins\u2014\u2018camptothecin producers\u2019, \u2018camptothecin non-producers\u2019 and \u2018Related product producers\u2019 (fungi producing specialized metabolites like taxol and other specialized metabolites similar to camptothecin, but do not produce camptothecin itself) (Supplementary Table S4). This classification developed for the comparison was used as a basis to identify the candidate genes in the novel endophytes with respect to the other fungi. The endophyte genes that are not shared with the other (all the three classes) fungi can be considered to be specifically unique to itself. Camptothecin synthesis being a unique trait found in this endophyte, these unique genes could possibly hold the key for unraveling more aspects of camptothecin biosynthesis in the fungus and in fungi in general. Fungi could form a reservoir of camptothecin biosynthesis enzymes with properties desirable for biotechnological applications.

Gene duplications are major drivers of evolutionary innovations as they enable neo- and subfunctionalization37. Duplications lower the constraints on natural selection processes, and play a significant role in causing new functions to appear in organisms52. Since camptothecin production is a novel trait in the endophyte, such duplications could play an important role in camptothecin synthesis. While focusing on the novel endophyte as a source organism for camptothecin production, it would be important to understand the mechanism being used by the endophyte to protect itself against the toxic effects of camptothecin. This tolerance mechanism could be harnessed to enhance the camptothecin yield from the producing organism. It was reported that the DNA Topoisomerase I in plants possess certain mutations that make them self-resistant to the camptothecin molecule they produce45. There have not been many reports investigating the resistance mechanism in camptothecin-producing endophytes, except for one by Kusari and co-workers13. However, no specific resistance-endowing mutations were detected in another camptothecin-producing endophyte isolated from C. acuminata. It was proposed that the fungus could be using some other mechanism to protect itself from the deleterious effects of camptothecin13. Based on the DNA topoisomerase I analysis of the endophyte in this work, it is evident that, camptothecin resistance and camptothecin production in fungal endophytes need not have co-evolved like the co-evolution of camptothecin resistance and camptothecin production in camptothecin-producing plants, as proposed by45. This can be further explained by the observation that the camptothecin producing endophyte A. burnsii NCIM 1409 and non-camptothecin producing fungi, both have some of the camptothecin resistance conferring amino acid residues. These inferences agree with the conclusions put forth by Kusari and co-workers13, which convey that fungi that colonize a toxic metabolite producing plant like a camptothecin producing one, must possess innate resistance to overcome the toxicity, and invade the plant. Of the invaders some may prove to be camptothecin producers while, some may not, as seen in the isolation of several camptothecin producing and non-producing endophytes from different camptothecin producing plants like C. acuminata15 and N. nimmoniana11. Although previously studied and expected mutations in DNA topoisomerase I were not present in the fungal sequences, it remains possible that these fungi could have evolved completely different mutations to combat camptothecin as hinted by13. But it is interesting to note the fact that A. burnsii NCIM 1409 exhibits resistance to camptothecin in a dose dependent manner3. This reduces the chances of mutations appearing in the DNA topoisomerase I sequence to create a completely foolproof camptothecin resistant sequence, and this view is also buttressed by dose-dependent resistance to camptothecin exhibited by camptothecin-producing fungus Phomopsis sp. isolated from N. nimmoniana53. This could mean that A. burnsii NCIM 1409 could have developed entirely new ways of resisting camptothecin apart from variation in its DNA topoisomerase I sequence. Or rather than resisting camptothecin, we speculate that the fungus might tolerate camptothecin up to a particular level, after which the fate of camptothecin within the producer needs to be investigated further.", "Synteny analysis was crucial for the identification of gene duplications in the endophyte with respect to closely related Alternaria fungi.
