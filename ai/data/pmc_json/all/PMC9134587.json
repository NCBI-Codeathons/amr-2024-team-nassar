["Fungal specialized metabolites play an important role in the environment and have impacted human health and survival significantly. These specialized metabolites are often the end product of a series of sequential and collaborating biosynthetic enzymes that reside within different subcellular compartments. A wide variety of methods have been developed to understand fungal specialized metabolite biosynthesis in terms of the chemical conversions and the biosynthetic enzymes required, however there are far fewer studies elucidating the compartmentalization of the same enzymes. This review illustrates the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites where the localization of all, or some, of the biosynthetic enzymes have been determined and describes the methods used to identify the sub-cellular localization.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Specialized metabolites are small molecules found in plants, fungi, and bacteria, with a diverse array of molecular structures that vary considerably, even between closely related species. Specialized metabolites produced by fungi have specific ecological functions to aide in survival [1], and many have been adapted for medicinal or agricultural use [2] such as the antibiotic penicillin, the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid, the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, and the anti-fungal agent strobilurin (Fig.\u00a01). Many fungal specialized metabolites, however, have a detrimental effect on human health and the environment [3] including the mycotoxins aflatoxin, fumonisin, deoxynivalenol, and patulin (Fig.\u00a01).", "Specialized metabolites are small molecules found in plants, fungi, and bacteria, with a diverse array of molecular structures that vary considerably, even between closely related species.

In fungi, PKS enzymes can be further classified into non-reducing (NR) PKS, partially reducing (PR) PKS, and highly reducing (HR) PKS which vary according to the catalytic domains present, and the extent of reduction observed in the final polyketide product (Scheme 1A) [5, 6]. Terpenes are synthesized by terpene synthases (TS) (also known as terpene cyclases (TC)), from the head-to-tail condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) (Scheme 1B) [7]. Non-ribosomal peptides are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) that condense proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids to generate diverse peptides (Scheme 1C) [8].

The biosynthesis of aflatoxin requires over 25 genes which encode over 27 enzymatic activities. The BGC is regulated by the transcriptional regulator AflR and the transcriptional co-activator AflJ [23]. The first biosynthetic step is the synthesis of norsolorinic acid anthrone through the action of two fatty acid synthases (FAS; AflA and AflB) and a polyketide synthase (PKS; AflC), which form a protein complex (Scheme 2) [24, 25]. Norsolorinic acid anthrone is then oxidized into norsolorinic acid by HypC [26]. Further processing and modification of norsolorinic acid into aflatoxin is performed by a series of tailoring enzymes (Scheme 2). Modifications include: reduction by the NADPH-dependent ketoreductase (KR) AflD (also known as Nor-1) that converts norsolorinic acid to averantin [27]; oxidation by the alcohol dehydrogenase AflH that converts 5-hydroxy-averantin to 5\u2019oxoaverantin [28]; and cyclization by the novel cyclase (CYC) AflK which converts 5\u2019-oxoaverantin to averufin and subsequently versicolorin [28, 29]. In later steps, versicolorin A is converted to demethylsterigmatocystin by the NADPH-dependent reductase (Red) AflM (also known as Ver-1) [30] and sterigmatocystin is converted to O-methylsterigmatocystin by the methyltransferase (MT) AflP (also known as OmtA) [31].", "Aflatoxin is one of the most potent carcinogens known and is produced primarily by Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus flavus [22].

In Aspergillus fumigatus, biosynthesis of melanin requires at least six enzymes: the NRPKS Alb1 that synthesizes the polyketide YWA1 [39]; the chain shortening hydrolase (HYD) Ayg1 that converts YWA1 to 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) [40, 41]; the reductase (Red) Arp2 that reduces 1,3,6,8-THN to scytalone; the scytalone dehydratase (DH) Arp1; the copper oxidase (OX) Abr1; and laccase (Lac) Abr2 (Scheme 3A). Arp1 dehydrates scytalone to produce 1,3,8-THN, and Arp2 acts a second time reducing 1,3,8-THN to vermelone. Vermelone is then oxidized by the copper oxidase Abr1 to 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene and polymerized by the laccase Abr2 to melanin (Scheme 3A) [42, 43].", "The localization of the melanin biosynthetic enzymes from Aspergillus fumigatus were investigated using fluorescence tags and specific organelle stains [19]. The PKS Alb1 was localized to endosomes, rather than being diffused through the cytoplasm as predicted bioinformatically. Furthermore, the additional three enzymes, Ayg1, Arp1, and Arp2, involved in early steps of the biosynthesis were also observed in endosomes, also in contrast to bioinformatics predictions.

The dynamic nature of protein translocation and subsequent trafficking to the target organelle may explain the difficulties of accurate bioinformatic predictions of some biosynthetic enzymes. However, this strategy of localizing specific biosynthetic enzymes and intermediates to different organelles enables some control over confining toxic intermediates and explains how intermediates are transported to subsequent organelles. Ultimately, fusion of different organelles leads to larger organelles, known as toxisomes, that contain intricate enzyme complexes and accumulate the increasingly toxic intermediates, thereby protecting the cell from deleterious molecules [18, 132].", "Similar trafficking mechanisms have been observed or proposed in the biosynthesis of aflatoxin, melanin, patulin, penicillin, cephalosporin, and fumiquinazoline.
