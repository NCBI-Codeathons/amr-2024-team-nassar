["Graphical Abstract", "", "The biosynthetic machinery for the production of colibactin is encoded by 19 genes (clbA \u2013 S) within the pks pathogenicity island harboured by many E. coli of the B2-phylogroup. Colibactin is a potent genotoxic metabolite which causes DNA-damage and which has potential roles in microbial competition and fitness of pks+ bacteria. Colibactin has also been strongly implicated in the development of colorectal cancer. Given the genotoxicity of colibactin and the metabolic cost of its synthesis, the regulatory system governing the clb cluster is accordingly highly complex, and many of the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this review we summarise the current understanding of regulation of colibactin biosynthesis by internal molecular components and how these factors are modulated by signals from the external environment.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed and second deadliest form of cancer globally [1]. The incidence of CRC is increasing worldwide and is predicted to continue to do so into the future, particularly in economically-impoverished regions where access to screening programmes is limited [2]. Worryingly, there is a rising incidence rate of CRC in young adults, pointing to changes in risk factors during early life [1]. It is well established that there are both environmental (diet, lifestyle) and genetic factors which influence the risk of developing CRC [3]. Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are at an increased risk of developing CRC, known as colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CA-CRC) [4]. Low-fibre, ultra-processed Westernised diets are known to be linked with increased CRC risk, and the adoption of this diet is likely a factor in the increasing CRC cases being seen in some demographics [1]. Diet heavily influences the composition of the gut microbiome and the role of microbes in CRC causation has become a topic of considerable research, particularly as individuals with CRC often display dysbiosis and greater colonisation with potentially harmful bacteria [5\u20137].", "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed and second deadliest form of cancer globally [1].

Further, hypoxic conditions are a well-established characteristic of malignant tumours, known as tumour hypoxia, with such environments potentially favouring pks+ bacteria\u2009and optimal colibactin production [77]. Similarly, severe inflammation is associated with local oxygen depletion due to tissue necrosis and the neutrophil respiratory burst, with inflammation also being implicated in promotion of colorectal tumorigenesis by pks+ E. coli in murine models [12, 78]. Tissue hypoxia also commonly results from inflammation during bacterial infection [79, 80].

(a) The 19 genes of the clb operon (clbA \u2013 clbS) encode the biosynthetic machinery required for colibactin production. The clbR gene encodes the transcriptional regulator, ClbR, which activates both its own transcription and transcription of the clb genes. Level of clbR transcription is influenced by the amount of variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) in the clbR - clbB intergenic region, effecting the transcription of other clb genes and colibactin production. Colibactin is synthesised in the bacterial cytoplasm as an inactive pro-drug known as \u2018precolibactin\u2019 by the enzymatic \u2018assembly line\u2019 of polyketide synthases (PKSs), nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPs) and hybrid NRPS-PKS encoded by the clb genes. The E. coli high-temperature protein G (HtpG) is also required during biosynthesis. Following dimerization by ClbL, precolibactin is effluxed to the periplasm by the MATE transporter ClbM. The prodrug is then matured into active and genotoxic colibactin by cleavage of the N-myristoyl-d-asparagine sidechains by the periplasmic membrane-bound peptidase, ClbP. Should mature colibactin re-enter the bacterial cytoplasm, it is inactivated by the hydrolase ClbS. (b) The regulation of the colibactin biosynthetic operon is influenced by a multitude of external environmental factors. Growth phase, nutrient availability, and carbon source impact colibactin expression. Such changes in the external environment are detected by the BarA-UvrY two component system (TCS) which activates the csrB and csrC small regulatory RNAs which inhibit the carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) from repressing colibactin synthesis. The BarA-UvrY TCS also appears to enhance colibactin expression through recognition of a polymicrobial environment. High oxygen conditions repress colibactin synthesis through the anoxic redox control (Arc) TCS, consisting of the ArcA cytosolic transcription factor and the sensor kinase ArB. Inflammatory environments are advantageous to pks+ bacteria and enhance colibactin production, with clb gene expression significantly higher when inflammation is present. Conversely, the anti-inflammatory PPK-inhibitor mesalamine downregulates colibactin synthesis, through both PPK-dependent and PPK-independent mechanisms. Anoxic, carcinogenic, and inflamed tissues may therefore be optimal niches for maximal colibactin production. The bioavailability of polyamines, notably spermidine, appears important for colibactin production, with limited spermidine correlating to decreased colibactin synthesis. It is possible that spermidine may positively regulate clbR and clbQ genes. The metabolite d-Serine has also been shown to downregulate colibactin synthesis, as have short chain fatty acids (SCFA), whilst the antibiotic polymyxin B, and oligosaccharides such as inulin and galacto-oligosaccharides, appear to upregulate colibactin synthesis.

The prodrug is then matured into active and genotoxic colibactin by cleavage of the N-myristoyl-d-asparagine sidechains by the periplasmic membrane-bound peptidase, ClbP. Should mature colibactin re-enter the bacterial cytoplasm, it is inactivated by the hydrolase ClbS. (b) The regulation of the colibactin biosynthetic operon is influenced by a multitude of external environmental factors. Growth phase, nutrient availability, and carbon source impact colibactin expression. Such changes in the external environment are detected by the BarA-UvrY two component system (TCS) which activates the csrB and csrC small regulatory RNAs which inhibit the carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) from repressing colibactin synthesis. The BarA-UvrY TCS also appears to enhance colibactin expression through recognition of a polymicrobial environment. High oxygen conditions repress colibactin synthesis through the anoxic redox control (Arc) TCS, consisting of the ArcA cytosolic transcription factor and the sensor kinase ArB. Inflammatory environments are advantageous to pks+ bacteria and enhance colibactin production, with clb gene expression significantly higher when inflammation is present. Conversely, the anti-inflammatory PPK-inhibitor mesalamine downregulates colibactin synthesis, through both PPK-dependent and PPK-independent mechanisms. Anoxic, carcinogenic, and inflamed tissues may therefore be optimal niches for maximal colibactin production. The bioavailability of polyamines, notably spermidine, appears important for colibactin production, with limited spermidine correlating to decreased colibactin synthesis. It is possible that spermidine may positively regulate clbR and clbQ genes. The metabolite d-Serine has also been shown to downregulate colibactin synthesis, as have short chain fatty acids (SCFA), whilst the antibiotic polymyxin B, and oligosaccharides such as inulin and galacto-oligosaccharides, appear to upregulate colibactin synthesis.
