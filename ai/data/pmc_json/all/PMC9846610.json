However, the stalks of some varieties are prone to lodging under high density conditions. Much research has been done on the evaluation of maize lodging resistance. But there are few comprehensive reports on the determination of maize lodging resistance in situ without injury under field conditions. This study introduces a non-destructive in situ tester to determine the lodging resistance of the different maize varieties in the field. The force value can be obtained by pulling the stalk to different angles with this instrument, which is used to evaluate the lodging resistance of maize varieties. From 2018 to 2020, a total of 1,172 sample plants from 113 maize varieties were tested for the lodging resistance of plants. The statistical results show that the values of force on maize plants at 45\u00b0 inclination angles (F45) are appropriate to characterize maize lodging resistance in situ by nondestructive testing in the field. According to the F45 value, the maximum lodging resistance Fmax can be inferred. The formula is: Fmax =1.1354 F45 \u2013 0.3358. The evaluation results of lodging resistance of different varieties of this study are basically consistent with the test results of three-point bending method, moving wind tunnel and other methods. Therefore, the F45 value is the optimal index for nondestructive evaluation of maize stalk-lodging resistance under the field-planting conditions.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Maize is the most widespread global food and feed crop. Reasonable densing planting can make full use of natural resources and is the most effective way to achieve high-yield and high-efficiency maize cultivation (Li et\u00a0al., 2017). Increased maize planting density increases harvest ears and grain yield. However, when the planting density increases beyond a certain extent, lodging is prone to occur (Sun et al., 2021). Maize lodging is extremely harmful to production, not only affecting the stalk character of maize and greatly reducing yield and quality, but also bringing difficulties to field management and harvesting (Deng et\u00a0al., 2017; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2018; Sun and Wang, 2020). Therefore, the accurate evaluation of maize stalk lodging resistance has important practical significance for realizing high-yield and high-efficiency cultivation of maize.", "Maize is the most widespread global food and feed crop.

Therefore, the accurate evaluation of maize stalk lodging resistance has important practical significance for realizing high-yield and high-efficiency cultivation of maize.", "Maize lodging generally occurs after the jointing stage, and can be caused by storms, cultivation measures, diseases, insect pests, etc., and especially by strong wind, which causes the maize plants to tilt or fall to the ground after rain (Kamara et al., 2003; Sun and Wang, 2020). The lodging of maize plants can occur in three ways: (1) the bending strength of the stalk is not sufficient to resist the external wind pressure and the stalk is broken (the phenomenon of \u201cstem breaking\u201d); (2) the rigidity of the stalk may be sufficient to resist the external wind force, but the root system has insufficient grip to resist the external wind pressure (the phenomenon of \u201croot collapse\u201d); or (3) the root system has a strong grip and can resist the external wind pressure, and the stalk has poor rigidity and is sufficiently tough that it does not break under the external wind pressure (Robertson et al., 2017), but the inclination exceeds 45\u00b0 (the phenomenon of \u201cstem lodging\u201d). The lodging degree of maize plants can be divided into mild (tilting 0\u00b0\u201330\u00b0), moderate (tilting 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0), and severe (above 85\u00b0). Different degrees of lodging have different effects on maize yield. Generally, light lodging reduces yield by 10%\u201320%, moderate lodging reduces yield by 30%\u201345%, heavy lodging reduces yield by more than 50%, and even more severe lodging can result in a 100% reduction in yield (Huang and Zhang., 2007; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2011; Li, 2012). Much research has been done on the evaluation of maize lodging resistance. Laboratory methods of testing stem lodging resistance mainly include the crush test (Zuber and Grogan, 1961; Thompson, 1963), the peel penetration test (Peiffer et\u00a0al., 2013; Li et\u00a0al., 2014), and the bending test (Kokubo et\u00a0al., 1989; Ennos et al., 1993; Li et\u00a0al., 2003; Gou et\u00a0al., 2008; Hu et\u00a0al., 2013; Robertson et\u00a0al., 2014). In addition, if a correlation between various chemical or morphological factors of plants (e.g., stem diameter, stem lignin content, and stem bark thickness) and the lodging resistance of stems is established, it could be used to predict the lodging resistance of plants. However, these methods usually require a great deal of labor and time, and cannot directly determine the lodging resistance in situ of plants in the field. Sibale et\u00a0al. (1992) measured the puncture resistance of the rind using a modified electronic penetrometer to aid in the selection of plants with higher maize stalk strength. Zhang et\u00a0al. (2018) evaluated the crushing strength of stems by measuring the force required to break the stems using a hydraulic press. Wen et\u00a0al. (2019) used a mobile wind turbine to conduct an in situ assessment of the stalk lodging resistance of different maize varieties; this research has shown that a new cumulative lodging index (CLI) is more reliable than mechanical properties, failure wind speed (FWS), and wind speed reduction index (RI) when evaluating lodging resistance in terms of reliability and resolution. Cook et\u00a0al. (2019) invented a maize lodging resistance tester called Darling that breaks the maize stalk by giving it a thrust at a fixed height to obtain the maximum lodging resistance and bending moment, which can evaluate the lodging resistance of maize stalks in the field. Darling is a device capable of inducing a natural destruction and, as such, the device was destructive in assessing maize lodging resistance. Although methods of measuring maize stem strength are becoming convenient and efficient, they are all performed under controlled conditions and can cause some damage to the plant. There are few comprehensive reports on the determination of maize lodging resistance in situ without damage under field conditions. When testing the lodging resistance of maize plants from jointing stage to mature stages, it is best to use a non-destructive method and the same population (sample); this can not only objectively evaluate the differences of lodging resistance among different genotypes, but effectively reduce the workload and error caused by different populations (samples).
