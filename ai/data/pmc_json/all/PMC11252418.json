["The function of proteins depends on their correct structure and proper dynamics. Understanding the dynamics of target proteins facilitates drug design and development. However, dynamic information is often hidden in the spatial structure of proteins. It is important but difficult to identify the specific residues that play a decisive role in protein dynamics. Here, we report that a critical glycine residue (Gly463) dominates the motion of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) and the sensitivity of the enzyme to antibiotics. Obafluorin (OB), a natural antibiotic, is a novel covalent inhibitor of ThrRS. The binding of OB induces a large conformational change in ThrRS. Through five crystal structures, biochemical and biophysical analyses, and computational simulations, we found that Gly463 plays an important role in the dynamics of ThrRS. Mutating this flexible residue into more rigid residues did not damage the enzyme\u2019s three-dimensional structure but significantly improved the thermal stability of the enzyme and suppressed its ability to change conformation. These mutations cause resistance of ThrRS to antibiotics that are conformationally selective, such as OB and borrelidin. This work not only elucidates the molecular mechanism of the self-resistance of OB-producing Pseudomonas fluorescens but also emphasizes the importance of backbone kinetics for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-targeting drug development.", "Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a critical glycine residue dominates the motion of threonyl-tRNA synthetase and the sensitivity of the enzyme to conformation selective inhibitors.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are key enzymes for protein translation in all cells, catalyzing the formation of an ester bond between a specific amino acid and the 3\u2019-end adenosine of its conjugate tRNA1,2.

We utilized TSA to preliminarily estimate the binding affinities of EcThrRS_G463S and EcThrRS_L489M to OB. The results showed that 36j and OB increased the Tm of EcThrRS_L489M by 22.7\u2009\u00b0C and 22.6\u2009\u00b0C, respectively (Fig.\u00a02a), suggesting that OB strongly binds to EcThrRS_L489M, similar to 36j. In contrast, 36j increased the Tm of EcThrRS_G463S by 22.1\u2009\u00b0C while OB increased the Tm of EcThrRS_G463S by only 13.3\u2009\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a02a), suggesting that the binding affinity between OB and EcThrRS_G463S is much weaker than that between 36j and EcThrRS_G463S. These results suggest that the G463S mutation weakens the binding affinity of ThrRS for OB, while the L489M mutation does not. Next, we studied the inhibitory activity of OB against EcThrRS_G463S and EcThrRS_L489M in an ATP hydrolysis assay. OB had a strong inhibitory effect on EcThrRS_L489M, with an IC50 value of 215\u2009nM (Fig.\u00a02b). Therefore, the mutation of Leu489 to a methionine does not confer resistance of EcThrRS to OB.

The frequency curve of EcThrRS_G463A had only one peak at a DR-A of approximately 14\u2009\u00c5, which was close to and slightly larger than that of EcThrRS_G463S (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). This finding suggests that the pocket of EcThrRS_G463A cannot be extended so that its DR-A reaches 17\u2009\u00c5 and can be effectively suppressed by OB.", "To further decipher the difference in conformational space between WT and mutant ThrRSs, we performed free energy landscape (FEL) analysis and obtained representative structures with the most stable conformations from the simulation ensembles. EcThrRS_WT shows a different profile of FEL from either G463S or G463A. Compared to the free energy landscapes of EcThrRS_G463S and EcThrRS_G463A, the energy basin of EcThrRS_WT covers a much larger range of radii of gyration (Rg), indicating that these conformations obtained along the trajectory experienced larger conformational changes (Fig.\u00a05b-d). By comparing the conformation of residues 419-467 in the FEL nadir structure of the three proteins, we found that EcThrRS_WT had the most extended conformation, followed by G463A, and the narrowest was G463S (Fig.\u00a05e). Furthermore, by comparing the FEL nadir conformation in the computational simulation and the real crystal structures, we found that the FEL nadir conformation of EcThrRS_WT was closer to the open state crystal structure, while the FEL nadir conformations of EcThrRS_G463S and EcThrRS_G463A were more similar to the apo state crystal structures (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). These analyses suggest that the G463S and G463A mutations affect the conformational space of the ThrRS structure and cannot expose the active site for OB entry and reaction with Tyr462.", "To further decipher the difference in conformational space between WT and mutant ThrRSs, we performed free energy landscape (FEL) analysis and obtained representative structures with the most stable conformations from the simulation ensembles.

As we predicted, the Tyr462 residue was not covalently modified by OB (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015a) and the conformation of this structure was the same as that of EcThrRS_G463S (Fig.\u00a05f). Most interestingly, there are some large but discontinuous electron densities near the ATP binding site as well as the zinc ion in this structure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015a). These electron densities can barely accommodate the OB structure (Fig.\u00a06a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a015b). We suspected that this is caused by unstable binding of OB in the ThrRS active pocket. In this case, one of the phenol hydroxyl groups forms a coordination bond with the zinc ion (Fig.\u00a06b), and the nitrophenyl group inserts into the ATP binding site between Phe379 and Arg520 (Fig.\u00a06c). This may be an intermediate state of OB binding in ThrRS. The conformation of the wild-type ThrRS can be further opened and the nitrobenzene portion of OB can instead bind to the tRNA binding site between Tyr313 and Arg363, thus bringing the lactone ring close to Tyr462 and reacting with it to form a new covalent bond (Fig.\u00a06d, and Supplementary Movie\u00a02). In contrast, the conformation of EcThrRS_G463A cannot be further opened, and in this binding mode, OB can be competed out by ATP (Supplementary Movie\u00a03). Consistent with this assumption, when EcThrRS_G463A was cocrystallized in the presence of both OB and ATP, only ATP was resolved in the pocket (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016, Supplementary Table\u00a05).
