["Plant genomes remain highly fragmented and are often characterized by hundreds to thousands of assembly gaps. Here, we report chromosome-level reference and phased genome assembly of Ophiorrhiza pumila, a camptothecin-producing medicinal plant, through an ordered multi-scaffolding and experimental validation approach. With 21 assembly gaps and a contig N50 of 18.49\u2009Mb, Ophiorrhiza genome is one of the most complete plant genomes assembled to date. We also report 273 nitrogen-containing metabolites, including diverse monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs). A comparative genomics approach identifies strictosidine biogenesis as the origin of MIA evolution. The emergence of strictosidine biosynthesis-catalyzing enzymes precede downstream enzymes\u2019 evolution post \u03b3 whole-genome triplication, which occurred approximately 110 Mya in O. pumila, and before the whole-genome duplication in Camptotheca acuminata identified here. Combining comparative genome analysis, multi-omics analysis, and metabolic gene-cluster analysis, we propose a working model for MIA evolution, and a pangenome for MIA biosynthesis, which will help in establishing a sustainable supply\u00a0of camptothecin.", "Ophiorrhiza pumila is a medicinal plant that can produce the anti-cancer monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) camptothecin.

Among the 30 essential anticancer drugs categorized by the World Health Organization in 2015, several molecules, including topotecan, irinotecan, vincristine, and vinorelbine, are extracted from plants or derived from plant monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), such as camptothecin and catharanthine2,3. MIAs are natural products derived from (S)-strictosidine, with a monoterpene moiety derived from secologanin, an iridoid class of monoterpenes, and the indole moiety from tryptamine, a decarboxylation product of the amino acid tryptophan (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). The monoterpenoid moiety of strictosidine then undergoes extensive modifications catalyzed by various enzymes to form diverse MIAs, which represent over 2500 known metabolites2.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as Bionano optical maps and Hi-C library sequencing provide valuable orthogonal evidence to validate and improve reference genomes, and to derive chromosome-level genome assemblies20,21. Despite this progress, nearly all plant genomes remain highly fragmented, with hundreds to thousands of remaining\u00a0assembly gaps (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). In this study, we used a stepwise integration and assembly validation approach using four complementary NGS technologies to derive O. pumila de novo genome assembly: PacBio single-molecule reads (~122\u00d7), Illumina paired-end reads (~96\u00d7), Bionano optical mapping (~250\u00d7), and Hi-C library sequencing (~90\u00d7; Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Data\u00a01).

Furthermore, the chromosome sizes estimated through FISH analysis supported the Ophiorrhiza genome assembly (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07 and Supplementary Table\u00a01). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis of coffee genome misassembly through FISH analysis in Coffea arabica, an allotetraploid genome resulting from hybridization between C. canephora and Coffea eugenioides. FISH analysis using probes designed for the two segments on chromosome 2 of the coffee genome that were in apparent synteny with two chromosomes of the Ophiorrhiza genome produced signals on two different chromosomes instead of on the same chromosome. The FISH analysis suggested a possible misassembly in the coffee genome (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013).

Synteny analysis between the Ophiorrhiza and C. canephora genomes showed a potential karyotype rearrangement, with chromosomes 2 and 9 of Ophiorrhiza showing syntenic relationships with chromosome 2 of the coffee genome (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a010e). The chromosome 2 segment of the coffee genome with a syntenic relationship with chromosome 9 of the Ophiorrhiza genome showed associations with chromosome 13 and chromosome 16 of V. vinifera (Fig.\u00a03a). Given that the genome of Ophiorrhiza is near-complete with only 21 assembly gaps, whereas the coffee genome is only 80% complete and has 7250 assembly gaps, the observed syntenic and potential karyotype rearrangement could very well be a possible misassembly of the coffee genome (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012).

It increases the confidence in molecular formula determination for identified metabolite features by eliminating false positives, while considering elemental compositions7,40,41. To expand the known chemodiversity of O. pumila, particularly nitrogen-containing specialized metabolites, we used a complete 15N-based stable isotope labeling and metabolome analysis approach as previously reported for complete 13C-based metabolome labeling for O. pumila and 11 other plant species\u00a0(Supplementary Fig.\u00a021)7,40. Complete 15N labeling of the Ophiorrhiza metabolome and previously acquired 13C-labeled metabolome annotation datasets allowed us to chemically assign 273 nitrogen-containing metabolites, mostly annotated as indole alkaloids (IAs), MIAs, and carboline moieties containing metabolites (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary Fig.\u00a021, and Supplementary Data\u00a013 and 14). The Ophiorrhiza metabolome showed distinct and diverse nitrogen-containing metabolites, including MIAs, when compared with previously analyzed plant metabolomes (Fig.\u00a04)40. The MIA biosynthetic pathways are well conserved across producing plant species and are derived from strictosidine (or strictosidinic acid, in the case of C. acuminata)42. Along with derivatives of strictosidine, camptothecin, and known intermediates of the camptothecin biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), MIAs such as eburnamonine, nothapodytine, vincamenine, and D-glucopyranosyl vincosamide have also been identified in Ophiorrhiza. Specialized metabolite classes, including MIAs, IAs, and anthraquinones, accumulated in a tissue-specific manner, with the highest levels in the root and hairy root, and low levels in the leaf tissues (Supplementary Figs.\u00a022 and 23, and Supplementary Data\u00a015). Several of the assigned MIAs were also reported previously in C. roseus, G. sempervirens, and C. acuminata7. Consistent with MIA accumulation, gene expression analysis showed tissue-specific expression of secoiridoid biosynthesis-related genes, with high expression in the root and hairy root, and low expression in the leaf and cell suspension culture of O. pumila (Supplementary Figs.\u00a01, 24 and 26, and Supplementary Data\u00a016\u201318). Expression analysis showed that homologs of genes associated with secoiridoid and MIA biosynthesis were highly coexpressed, and were considered strong candidate MIA biosynthesis genes in O. pumila. Secoiridoid biosynthesis genes were highly coexpressed with homologs of MIA biosynthesis-associated\u00a0enzymes, including 10-hydroxycamptothecin O-methyltransferase, O-acetylstemmadenine oxidase (ASO/PAS), polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase (PNAE), perakine reductase (PR), rankinidine/humantenine-11-hydroxylase 3 (RH11H), sarpagan bridge enzyme (SBE), strictosidine beta-D-glucosidase (SGD), tabersonine-19-hydroxy-O-acetyltransferase (T19AT), tabersonine 3-oxygenase, and tetrahydroalstonine synthase (THAS; Supplementary Figs.\u00a025\u201327). Integration of metabolome and transcriptome profiling for multiple tissues of Ophiorrhiza identified strong candidate MIA biosynthesis genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a027 and Supplementary Data\u00a019). The expression of genes associated with secoiridoids and MIA biosynthesis showed a strong correlation with MIA accumulation, indicating that the Ophiorrhiza\u00a0root and hairy roots are the sites of active biosynthesis (Supplementary Figs.\u00a023, 26 and 27, and Supplementary Data\u00a019).Fig. 4Ophiorrhiza pumila metabolome, assigned using 13C and 15N stable isotope labeling, compared with metabo-space of 11 plant species.Circuit A shows plant species used to compare metabolome space with that of O. pumila, and circuit B shows the connections between metabolite features, and are based on metabolite network relationships defined by a correlation coefficient >0.85.

Complete 15N labeling of the Ophiorrhiza metabolome and previously acquired 13C-labeled metabolome annotation datasets allowed us to chemically assign 273 nitrogen-containing metabolites, mostly annotated as indole alkaloids (IAs), MIAs, and carboline moieties containing metabolites (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary Fig.\u00a021, and Supplementary Data\u00a013 and 14). The Ophiorrhiza metabolome showed distinct and diverse nitrogen-containing metabolites, including MIAs, when compared with previously analyzed plant metabolomes (Fig.\u00a04)40. The MIA biosynthetic pathways are well conserved across producing plant species and are derived from strictosidine (or strictosidinic acid, in the case of C. acuminata)42.

Several of the assigned MIAs were also reported previously in C. roseus, G. sempervirens, and C. acuminata7.

Expression analysis showed that homologs of genes associated with secoiridoid and MIA biosynthesis were highly coexpressed, and were considered strong candidate MIA biosynthesis genes in O. pumila. Secoiridoid biosynthesis genes were highly coexpressed with homologs of MIA biosynthesis-associated\u00a0enzymes, including 10-hydroxycamptothecin O-methyltransferase, O-acetylstemmadenine oxidase (ASO/PAS), polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase (PNAE), perakine reductase (PR), rankinidine/humantenine-11-hydroxylase 3 (RH11H), sarpagan bridge enzyme (SBE), strictosidine beta-D-glucosidase (SGD), tabersonine-19-hydroxy-O-acetyltransferase (T19AT), tabersonine 3-oxygenase, and tetrahydroalstonine synthase (THAS; Supplementary Figs.\u00a025\u201327).

The gene cluster C1693 exhibited conserved synteny for functionally characterized genes encoding 10-HGO, ASO/PAS, and THAS3 in C. roseus, while an adjacent gene cluster, C1684, showed conserved synteny for the functionally characterized G10H in O. pumila and C. roseus (Supplementary Fig.\u00a046).

One of the key gene clusters identified in the Ophiorrhiza genome was C1541, which included functionally characterized TDC (Opuchr05_g0008370-1.1) and STR (Opuchr05_g0008300-1.1 and Opuchr05_g0008180-1.1) together with enzymes annotated as amino acid transporters, cytochrome P450 71A3, NAC domain-containing protein, and multi-antimicrobial extrusion (MATE) protein (Fig.\u00a06f). Previously, C. roseus and G. sempervirens genome analysis have also reported the presence of a STR-TDC-MATE gene cluster6. Synteny analysis showed conserved synteny between the C. roseus and G. sempervirens genomes at C1541, which included both functionally characterized STR, TDC, and MATE proteins. The coffee genome, which shares significant collinearity and sequence similarity with the Ophiorrhiza genome, also showed conserved gene cluster collinearity with C1541 (Fig.\u00a06f, and Supplementary Figs.\u00a012 and 15). However, the relatively conserved functional STR orthogenes present across strictosidine-derived MIA-producing plants at gene cluster C1541 were lost in the coffee genome, while other features of the gene cluster, including TDC coding enzymes, were retained (Fig.\u00a06f). Comparative genome analysis between Ophiorrhiza and coffee showed high sequence similarity and gene localization along chromosomes, yet loss of functional STR within the coffee genome at the gene cluster may have limited the opportunity to direct evolution toward MIA biosynthesis, which also explains the higher median Ks for enzymes associated with MIA biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a041).

The expanded chemodiversity, upon serving as a positive selection force, activates the evolutionary machinery, including the emergence of novel specialized enzymes through gene expansion/neofunctionalization, thus beginning the process of refining the imperfect secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways53. Among Gentianales, the emergence of STR for the synthesis of strictosidine was an important innovation to promote the evolution of MIA biosynthesis, which occurred after the whole-genome triplication of core eudicot genomes (Fig.\u00a06e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a041). While STR-like enzyme homologs were identified and assigned across plant species from different lineages (Supplementary Fig.\u00a029a), functional STRs (OG0015245) were specifically identified in the strictosidine-derived-MIA-producing plants (Fig.\u00a06a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a029b). C. roseus and G. sempervirens\u00a0genome, which diverged ~68\u2009Mya from Ophiorrhiza, consisted of a single copy of the STR gene, while the Ophiorrhiza genome contained two STR orthogenes, resulting from tandem duplication. One of the exceptions to the otherwise highly restricted MIA biosynthesis in Gentianales is camptothecin, which was first identified in C. acuminata of Cornales. Similar to the other plant genomes analyzed in this study, C. acuminata lost the functional STR enzyme and did not synthesize strictosidine. Instead, C. acuminata synthesizes strictosidinic acid for the biosynthesis of MIAs, including camptothecin42. For C. acuminata, the emergence of a bifunctional SLS (OG0013616) was important for the biosynthesis of strictosidinic acid, which incidentally also showed the fastest rate of substitution among all MIA-producing plants (Fig.\u00a06e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a041)43. With the WGD peak for C. acuminata detected at peak Ks of 0.469 and median Ks of 0.75 for SLS (OG0013616), our results suggest an earlier emergence of key metabolite intermediates prior to the WGD in C. acuminata, which then served as a catalyst that allowed post-WGD expansion and evolution of MIA biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a041). Synteny analysis between the coffee and Ophiorrhiza genomes showed significant genome collinearity, yet one of the key enzymes lost in the coffee genome included functional STR orthogene families.

Comprehensive metabolite profiling of several species from the Coffea genus, including wild coffee species, could not detect strictosidine, suggesting the possibility that STR has been lost across different species from the Coffea genus54. Our study proposes that the retention of STR after the whole-genome triplication event in core eudicots was the critical event that allowed selected plant species to evolve MIAs and expand their chemodiversity (Fig.\u00a06d\u2013f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a041). C. acuminata, the exception, instead uses a promiscuous enzyme for the synthesis of strictosidinic acid, which offered similar opportunities for the evolution of MIA biosynthesis.

Since the number of functionally characterized metabolic gene clusters is still limited in plants, key features such as the extent of coexpression and the degree to which gene localization corresponds to participation within the same pathways are not yet clear. Wisecaver et al., noting that the physical proximity of genes associated with metabolic pathways is statistically significant in Arabidopsis, suggested gene coexpression as a key feature for identifying enzymes associated with known specialized metabolic pathways irrespective of the location of their genes in the genomes49. Several studies in the past have also reported the selective nature of coexpression of genes in a predicted metabolic gene cluster39,55\u201357. In the Ophiorrhiza genome, we also observed a lack of coexpression trends among member genes of a given gene cluster. The scattered nature of metabolic gene clusters seems to be prevalent across plant genomes, as observed in the case of MIA gene clusters, as well as previously reported secondary metabolic gene clusters in other plant species55,58. With the complexities associated with the regulation of\u00a0gene-expression in plants, it is only rational to suggest\u00a0that physical proximity may not be sufficient to facilitate coexpression among genes within a gene cluster57. On the other hand, gene clusters represent discrete genome segments that serve as the hotspots for retaining and evolving specialized metabolite biosynthesis. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis is one of the best-known specialized metabolic pathways, with enzymes forming gene clusters within the opium poppy genome. Nevertheless, the nature of gene clustering was reported to be heterogeneous, with the thebaine and noscapine pathways being highly clustered, and the morphine and sanguinarine pathways being scattered56. These results suggest the possibility of the active evolution of genome architecture through a combination of natural and artificial selection for specialized metabolite biosynthesis centered at\u00a0gene clusters. The gene clusters, therefore, could be regarded as blocks of secondary metabolite modules whose novel combinations could produce new chemotypes, which may offer unique phenotypes for positive selection. In the process of evolution, plants could lose some members of these modules or the entire module itself, and thus also lose the ability to further evolve or refine a particular phenotype. On the other hand, plant species that could retain the specific module could continue to iterate a particular phenotype to more perfectly adapt to the ecological challenges presented over time. As key mechanisms of evolution and speciation, genome restructuring and dynamics acting on gene clusters seems to provide an opportunity to evolve diverge chemotypes across plant species. In this study, we identified the C1541 gene cluster precisely playing this role in strictosidine-derived MIA-producing plants. This implies selection pressure favoring the clusters of genes involved in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites and could be a way to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of common metabolite classes going forward. One possible explanation for the positive selection of gene clusters is the reduced rate of recombination between genes involved in local adaptation55,59.
