As the direct interface with the environment, we hypothesize that the ADT microbiota possess biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for antibiotics and other specialized metabolites to compete with both endogenous and exogenous microbes. From 1,214 bacterial genomes, representing 136 genera and 387 species that colonize the ADT, we identified 3,895 BGCs. To determine the distribution of BGCs and bacteria in different ADT sites, we aligned 1,424 metagenomes, from nine different ADT sites, onto the predicted BGCs. We show that alpha diversity varies across the ADT and that each site is associated with distinct bacterial communities and BGCs. We identify specific BGC families enriched in the buccal mucosa, external naris, gingiva, and tongue dorsum despite these sites harboring closely related bacteria. We reveal BGC enrichment patterns indicative of the ecology at each site. For instance, aryl polyene and resorcinol BGCs are enriched in the gingiva and tongue, which are colonized by many anaerobes. In addition, we find that streptococci colonizing the tongue and cheek possess different ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide BGCs. Finally, we highlight bacterial genera with BGCs but are underexplored for specialized metabolism and demonstrate the bioactivity of Actinomyces against other bacteria, including human pathogens. Together, our results demonstrate that specialized metabolism in the ADT is extensive and that by exploring these microbiomes further, we will better understand the ecology and biogeography of this system and identify new bioactive natural products.", "IMPORTANCE Bacteria produce specialized metabolites to compete with other microbes. Though the biological activities of many specialized metabolites have been determined, our understanding of their ecology is limited, particularly within the human microbiome. As the aerodigestive tract (ADT) faces the external environment, bacteria colonizing this tract must compete both among themselves and with invading microbes, including human pathogens. We analyzed the genomes of ADT bacteria to identify biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for specialized metabolites. We found that the majority of ADT BGCs are uncharacterized and the metabolites they encode are unknown. We mapped the distribution of BGCs across the ADT and determined that each site is associated with its own distinct bacterial community and BGCs. By further characterizing these BGCs, we will inform our understanding of ecology and biogeography across the ADT, and we may uncover new specialized metabolites, including antibiotics.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "From the skin to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, microbes colonize nearly every surface of the human body. The composition of these microbial communities varies across geographic scales, which can be as minute as different surfaces of the same tooth (1). This biogeography is controlled by abiotic factors, such as oxygen levels, pH, and salivary flow in the oral cavity (2, 3), and by biotic factors, which include competitive microbial interactions (4). Members of the endogenous microbiota engage in competition among themselves as well as with pathogens and other invading microbes (5). Together, these competitive interactions directly affect the population dynamics and spatial patterning of the microbiota across the human body.", "From the skin to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, microbes colonize nearly every surface of the human body.

The complex competitive interactions that occur between microbes include exploitation or interference competition. In exploitation competition, one organism indirectly inhibits the growth of its competitors by preventing them from accessing resources, including nutrients and physical space. In interference competition, one organism produces toxic effectors that directly harm or inhibit its competitors. Microbes use specialized metabolites for both exploiting and interfering with the microbes they compete with for resources. For example, siderophores bind and sequester iron and other metals in exploitation, while antibiotics disrupt physiological processes in target cells as part of interference. It is important to note that these modes of competition are not mutually exclusive. Within the GI tracts of humans and other animals, colonization resistance against pathogens mediated by the endemic microbiota involves exploitation through niche occlusion (8) and interference, including type VI secretion systems (9) and production of metabolites (10).", "Bacteria have evolved numerous systems to mediate competition, which include contact-dependent mechanisms, such as type VI secretion systems, and contact-independent mechanisms through the production of specialized metabolites (also called \u201csecondary metabolites\u201d and \u201cnatural products\u201d) (6, 7).

These BGCs encode proteins necessary for biosynthesis, regulation, export, and self-resistance to specialized metabolites. Further, by characterizing the protein domains contained within synthetases and identifying the other biosynthetic enzymes encoded by a given BGC, one may classify the type of specialized metabolite it encodes (11). In some classes, in particular with nonribosomal peptide and type I polyketide BGCs, the core chemical structure encoded may be inferred by understanding the logic of assembly line enzymology (12). Bioinformatic approaches have been developed that enable the identification of putative BGCs from genomic and metagenomic sequences, leading to the identification of specialized metabolites in a genome-first manner. For example, the lactocillin BGC was first identified in metagenomic assemblies produced by the Human Microbiome Project before the antibiotic was purified from Lactobacillus gasseri cultures (13). The wexrubicin BGC was identified in GI tract metagenomes, amplified from Blautia wexlerae, and heterologously expressed to yield an anthracycline antibiotic (14). Further, by following the biosynthetic logic for nonribosomal peptides, total chemical synthesis was used to produce the antibiotic humimycins encoded by Rhodococcus species genomes (15). Together, these and other examples have led to a newfound appreciation of the biosynthetic potential of animal microbiomes for the identification of new bioactive natural products (16\u201320).", "In bacteria and other microbes, the genes responsible for production of specialized metabolites are organized in genomic loci called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).

Though the GI tract contains most of the microbial biomass of the human body and possesses a diverse bacterial community (23, 24), it does not directly receive input from the external environment. Instead, for exogenous microbes to reach the GI tract, they must first pass through the aerodigestive tract (ADT) (25). The ADT is a continuous multiorgan system that comprises the upper respiratory and digestive tracts, including the nasal and oral cavities (26). In contrast to the GI tract, the ADT directly faces the external environment. Therefore, in addition to competing among themselves, members of the ADT microbiota compete with exogenous microbes from the external environment, including human pathogens, and act as a barrier against colonization of the lower digestive and respiratory tracts by invaders (27, 28). Though many ADT sites possess a microbiota less diverse than that of the GI tract (23, 29, 30), bacterial genera found in the ADT, including Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species, are known producers of specialized metabolites. For instance, bacteria that colonize the nasal cavity have previously been reported to produce the specialized metabolites dehydroxynocardamine (31), lugdunin (32), and nukacin IVK45 (33). Similarly, there is extensive literature on bacteriocin-mediated competition between oral bacteria, particularly within the context of dental caries (34, 35). These examples demonstrate the potential of the ADT microbiota to produce specialized metabolites, but our understanding of the natural ecology of these metabolites remains limited. By surveying BGCs from the ADT microbiota, we will better understand the capability of these bacteria to produce specialized metabolites, determine which genera to target for natural product discovery efforts, and inform our understanding of mechanisms underlying the biogeography of the upper digestive and respiratory tracts.", "Previous efforts to characterize the specialized metabolite biosynthetic potential of human microbiomes have focused primarily on the GI tract (21, 22).

Of the 3,601 BGCs detected in at least one metagenome, 185 BGCs (Fig. S4A) were enriched in the buccal mucosa, 373 BGCs were enriched in the tongue dorsum (Fig. S4B), 169 BGCs were enriched in the external naris (Fig. S4C), and 613 BGCs were enriched in the gingiva (Fig. S4D).

All Actinomyces isolates tested strongly inhibited the growth of R. corynebacterioides (phylum Actinobacteria), which is an opportunistic human pathogen (94), and two-thirds of the isolates strongly inhibited M. luteus (phylum Actinobacteria), a generalist that can colonize the ADT and skin (95) (Fig.\u00a08A).

We observed no antifungal activity from any of the Actinomyces isolates (Fig.\u00a08A). In a subsequent experiment, we selected a subset of these and other Actinomyces isolates and tested their bioactivity when cultured under anaerobic conditions, which are more representative of the in situ environment for these bacteria. In this experiment, we included three pairs of Actinomyces that were isolated from the same volunteer for biological replication (Fig.\u00a08B). After 1 week in anaerobic chambers, we assessed the ability of Actinomyces to inhibit the growth of three Gram-negative bacteria and three Gram-positive bacteria (Fig.\u00a08C) when cocultured aerobically. Consistent with the previous results, we observed full inhibition of M. luteus and R. corynebacterioides by all Actinomyces isolates (Fig.\u00a08B).

We found that p3-SID4074 and p3-SID4076, which were isolated from the same volunteer, reproducibly possessed different biological activities against A. baumannii and E. coli, suggesting that these two isolates are different strains.

In total, we tested 18 Actinomyces isolates from 16 different donors against a panel of nine Gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa [two isolates], and Serratia marcescens), 7 Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Rhodococcus corynebacterioides, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis), and 6 fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida sp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhizopus oryzae, and Trichosporon asahii) (Fig.\u00a08A). All Actinomyces isolates tested strongly inhibited the growth of R. corynebacterioides (phylum Actinobacteria), which is an opportunistic human pathogen (94), and two-thirds of the isolates strongly inhibited M. luteus (phylum Actinobacteria), a generalist that can colonize the ADT and skin (95) (Fig.\u00a08A). For comparison, 43% and 63% of Streptomyces isolated from soil inhibited R. corynebacterioides and M. luteus, respectively, under similar assay conditions (17). We observed no antifungal activity from any of the Actinomyces isolates (Fig.\u00a08A). In a subsequent experiment, we selected a subset of these and other Actinomyces isolates and tested their bioactivity when cultured under anaerobic conditions, which are more representative of the in situ environment for these bacteria. In this experiment, we included three pairs of Actinomyces that were isolated from the same volunteer for biological replication (Fig.\u00a08B). After 1 week in anaerobic chambers, we assessed the ability of Actinomyces to inhibit the growth of three Gram-negative bacteria and three Gram-positive bacteria (Fig.\u00a08C) when cocultured aerobically. Consistent with the previous results, we observed full inhibition of M. luteus and R. corynebacterioides by all Actinomyces isolates (Fig.\u00a08B). Further, we found that 6/8 (75%) of the Actinomyces isolates fully inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa (phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria) and two isolates (25%), designated p3-SID4076 and p3-SID4123, inhibited all three Gram-negative bacteria (Fig.\u00a08D), including the ESKAPE pathogens A. baumannii (phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria) and P. aeruginosa.

Bacteria that colonize this system must compete with invaders and other members of the microbiota. We find that human ADT microbiomes possess extensive potential for the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites and other bioactive natural products and demonstrate bioactivity from Actinomyces, a bacterial genus that has been underexplored for specialized metabolism. The vast majority of the BGCs from these bacteria remain uncharacterized, but given examples of specialized metabolites mediating competitive interactions in the nasal cavity through siderophore (31) and antibiotic (32) activities, it is likely that these BGCs encode metabolites that affect interactions between members of the ADT microbiota. These interactions may contribute to population dynamics and spatial patterning of the microbiota across the ADT. Indeed, we demonstrate that ADT sites cluster together based on both BGC and bacterial community composition and are each enriched with a distinct set of BGCs, despite often being colonized by closely related bacteria. Together, these results provide evidence for biogeography of specialized metabolism within the human ADT. Further, while our analyses identified broad-scale biogeographical signatures, submicron biogeography in the ADT is critical for understanding how BGCs shape interactions and biogeography within the ADT (1, 112). A limitation of our present study is that detection by metagenomic sequencing does not indicate that the corresponding BGC is expressed. The nasal cavity is the only ADT site with available metatranscriptomic data from the iHMP (41) and has been used previously to detect expression of the dehydroxynocardamine BGC (31). However, expression of a given BGC also does not confirm that the cognate specialized metabolites are produced in situ. Therefore, future studies that combine complementary approaches, including genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, bacteria interaction assays, and novel analytical chemistry techniques, such as in situ mass spectrometry (113), will enable the discovery of new specialized metabolites, inform our understanding of ecology and biogeography of the ADT, and provide insight into the role these metabolites play in situ (31, 32, 39, 85, 101, 114, 115).", "The ADT is the main threshold that microbes pass to enter the human body.

Therefore, future studies that combine complementary approaches, including genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, bacteria interaction assays, and novel analytical chemistry techniques, such as in situ mass spectrometry (113), will enable the discovery of new specialized metabolites, inform our understanding of ecology and biogeography of the ADT, and provide insight into the role these metabolites play in situ (31, 32, 39, 85, 101, 114, 115).", "The ADT is the main threshold that microbes pass to enter the human body. Bacteria that colonize this system must compete with invaders and other members of the microbiota. We find that human ADT microbiomes possess extensive potential for the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites and other bioactive natural products and demonstrate bioactivity from Actinomyces, a bacterial genus that has been underexplored for specialized metabolism. The vast majority of the BGCs from these bacteria remain uncharacterized, but given examples of specialized metabolites mediating competitive interactions in the nasal cavity through siderophore (31) and antibiotic (32) activities, it is likely that these BGCs encode metabolites that affect interactions between members of the ADT microbiota. These interactions may contribute to population dynamics and spatial patterning of the microbiota across the ADT. Indeed, we demonstrate that ADT sites cluster together based on both BGC and bacterial community composition and are each enriched with a distinct set of BGCs, despite often being colonized by closely related bacteria. Together, these results provide evidence for biogeography of specialized metabolism within the human ADT. Further, while our analyses identified broad-scale biogeographical signatures, submicron biogeography in the ADT is critical for understanding how BGCs shape interactions and biogeography within the ADT (1, 112). A limitation of our present study is that detection by metagenomic sequencing does not indicate that the corresponding BGC is expressed. The nasal cavity is the only ADT site with available metatranscriptomic data from the iHMP (41) and has been used previously to detect expression of the dehydroxynocardamine BGC (31).
