["2. Results", "2.1. Anti-Clostridial Activity of EMA and EMC In Vitro", "Based on the previous results of repeated experiments, we choose X. budapestensis DSM16342 (EMA) and X. szentirmaii DSM 16338, (EMC) which had been identified in our laboratory, [34] and seem to be the most promising strains as antimicrobial producers we have ever come across so far. This statement also stands for their anti-Clostridial potential. For the exact description and history of these strains, see Ref. [35]. We retested the in vitro efficiency [36,37,38] in overlay bioassays and the pepsin resistance of the active ingredient that we previously published [39], (Figure 1a,b).", "Both native and autoclaved CFCM samples of EMA and EMC bacterial strains were bioassayed both in liquid, and agar diffusion tests as described previously [36,37,38,39]. The anticoccidial activities of native and pepsin-treated CFCM samples were compared similarly as described previously [39]. All previous data on antimicrobial activity against each of the tested substances on different clinical isolates of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus [35,36,37,38,39], Ref. [42] was repeatedly confirmed, indicating the antimicrobial activity These data were especially important as confirming all previous findings published in [38]. The experiment also confirmed the thermostability and the pepsin durability of the CFCM of EMA, and EMC [40], since autoclaving of these CFCMs did not affect the antimicrobial activity against any of the tested organisms.", "2.2. In Vitro Bioassays: Cytopathogenic Effects of Cell-Free Condition Media (CFCM) of 3 EPB Species on LMH Chicken Cell Monolayer", "Two experiments were performed on this subject, (see Section 4). In both experiments, permanent, confluent monolayer culture samples (developed in different Falcon flasks) were used as target organisms, and different dilutions of different CFCMs were tested.", "(As described in the Materials and Methods, confluent monolayers of LMH cells were parallelly developed in 18 Falcon flasks (for the first experiment), and 36 flasks (for the second experiment). The culture media were Medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin G (200 IU/mL), and streptomycin (200 \u00b5g/mL). The incubation time was 72 h in both cases, in the controlled atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C and around 85\u201390% humidity in 25 cm (2) flasks with filtered caps. After the layer formed, the liquid growth media was removed from all but 3 flasks (in the first experiment) and in 2 \u00d7 2 flasks (in the second experiment). Those few (3 \u00d7 1 and 1 \u00d7 2) flasks were referred to as \u201cunchanged\u201d control flasks. As for other flasks, 3 \u00d7 1 (in the first experiment) and 1 \u00d7 2 (in the second experiment) were refilled e fresh culture media (referred to as M199 + 15% FKS control flasks) while the rest of the flasks were refilled 100 v/v% of different CFCMs (EMA, EMC, TT01 yellow and TT01 red, in the first experiment, and different dilutions of EMA and EMC CFCMs in the second experiments. As for the replicates, in the first experiment we worked with triplicates, and in the second experiment with duplicates).", "2.2.1. Experiment-1", "The aim was to compare the cytopathogenic effects of 4 different undiluted CFCMs obtained from cultures of EMA, EMC, and TT01 yellow, and TT01 red colony color variants, respectively, (see Section 4). It was found that each CFCM exerted destructive effects on the cell layer. The initial lesions on the LMH monolayer were followed by more serious ones consisting of clumps attached to the monolayer, (Score 3).", "The results (data given as empiric score values, (see Section 4) of the Experiment are presented in Table 1.", "We interpret these results as experimental proof of the presence of strong cytotoxic molecules in each of the 4 CFCMs. The four CFCMs differed in their cytotoxicity, the order of toxicity was: EMA > EMC > T0T1. Considering that the CFCMs filtrates contain not only AMPs but toxin protein molecules as well, we should know whether the experienced cytotoxicity was (a) a side effect(s) of the NR-AMP(s), or/and the toxin(s), and our results could not answer this question. Another question that remained open is whether the absence of any sign of in vivo toxicity was due to the denaturation of the toxic (protein-like) ingredients of the denatured CFCMs. We saw the antimicrobial activity of the CFCMs did not disappear after being autoclaved. There are the following experimental conclusions that can be drawn: (1) These experiments should be repeated with the peptide-rich fraction [38] and/or separated single NR-AMP molecules like (first of all) the fabclavines [43,44,45,46].", "2.2.2. Experiment-2", "The aim was to compare the cytopathogenic effects of serial dilutions of the CFCM filtrates of EMA, and EMC cultures, considering that both EMA and EMC CFCMs showed much stronger antimicrobial activity than the two TT01 CFCMs. The stock solutions, (and serial dilutions of them) used in this experiment were: EMA 60%, and EMC 80%, respectively. Confluent monolayer from LMH cells was developed again in Medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin G (200 IU/mL), and streptomycin (200 \u00b5g/mL) for 72 h in a controlled atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C and around 85\u201390% humidity in 25 cm2 Falcon flasks with filtered caps (see also in Materials, and Methods). The same score system [47] (Amin, 2012, see Table S1) was used for evaluating the results. The results of Experiment 2 are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3, and the data and statistics are given in Supplementary Material (Tables S2 and S3).", "The experimental conclusion is that the cytotoxic effect of the CFCM of the EMA was not only severe but unambiguously dose-dependent throughout the experiments. The histological pictures of replicates seemed practically uniform.", "The differences between the values represented by the 1st (orange) columns and the rest of them proved significant at (0.001 < p < 0.005 level) at each consecutive measurement. The replicate histological pictures seemed practically uniform, and below 12 v/v% the cytotoxic effect of the CFCM of the EMC was rather moderate, and not dose-dependent.", "We interpret these results as experimental proof that the in vivo application either of EMA NR_AMP peptides or the EMC NR_AMP peptides did cause fatal or even detectable cytopathogenic in sensitive tissues (like liver cells) in a dose-dependent manner. The degree of destruction was serious and irreversible above 3.2 v/v% (1:25 dilution) EMA-CFCM and above 2.4 v/v% EMC. The experimental conclusion is that in each of both cases, there was a threshold concentration below which no cytotoxic destruction is observable. Consequently, if an antimicrobial compound with cytotoxic side effects (like an NR-AMP) had been orally administered in a higher dose, which is needed for its antimicrobial efficacy in the gut, but then reached its critical cytotoxic threshold concentration neither in the blood nor in any sensitives tissue (because one or another reason), then in vivo toxicity would not be detected.", "2.3. Results of the In Vivo Xenofood-Feeding Experiment", "2.3.1. Gastrointestinal Activity of XENOFOOD", "To examine whether the gastrointestinal potential of the XENOFOOD was considerable we counted Clostridium CFUs in the lower ileum (see Figure 4) of XENOFOOD-fed and untreated animals.", "Using ANOVA statistical analysis, we compared the average of the lower ileal Clostridium CFUs (see Figure 2) of the XENOFOOD-fed animals (48.1) with those of the controls (149.9). Although we found that despite the 3X difference, only a slightly significant could be demonstrated, probably due to the large standard deviation in the control values (Table 2). and the very low infestation rate in the animals chosen for the experiment during the 42-day long experiment. In other terms, only very few animals had been infected with Clostridium.", "We found that despite the 3X difference, only a slightly significant difference could be demonstrated, probably due to the large standard deviation in the control values (Table 3), and because of the very low infestation rate in the animals chosen for the experiment.", "The data show that the average weights of the spleens were smaller, while the average measurements of the sizes of the bursas were larger in the XENOFOOD-fed group, and the differences were significant. The same can be stated about the Clostridium colony-forming units, (CFUs): there were fewer in the XENOFOOD-fed group (on average). The XENOFOOD exerted unambiguously detectable gastrointestinal antimicrobial activity. But the original infestation of the population from which the experimental animals were selected rate was very low. These results allow concluding that XENOFOOD feeding was harmless. We suppose that the bursa-dependent humoral immune system must have neutralized the cytotoxic peptide-like molecules (including the GI-active NR-APMPs) of the XENOFOOD in the blood, protecting the sensitive tissues and organs in such a way.", "2.3.2. Growth Rate, Feed Consumption, Feed Conversion, and the Post-Mortal Data", "During the 42-day-long experiment, no animal was lost. We did not detect any significant differences either in the feed intake, body weight gain, and fed conversion ratio (FCR) between the control and XENOFOOD-fed groups (Table 4).", "As for the organ weight, they followed the allometric rules, according to which the regular and systematic patterns of growth such as the mass or size of any organ or part of a body can be expressed about the total mass or size of the entire organism according to the allometric equation: Y = bx\u03b1, where Y = mass of the organ, x = mass of the organism, \u03b1 = growth coefficient of the organ, and b = a constant (only bursa- and spleen data are given). This fact itself excludes any organ-development abnormality of the treated (XENOFOOD-fed) animals. But the larger bursa weight and the smaller spleen weights, as well as larger bursa/spleen ratios in the XENOFOOD-fed groups may indicate indirectly an intensified humoral immune activity, leading to the neutralization of the cytotoxic AMP-components in the blood (Table 4).", "Summarizing the results of the in vivo feeding experiment, their interpretation is as follows: we wanted to learn two things: (1) whether the per os administered XENOFOOD (1) has a preventive potential against Clostridium infection; (2) can be considered as a harmless or as a risky food supplement. The experimental conclusions are, that (1) XENOFOOD must have a preventive potential but the experiment should be repeated with experimentally infested birds, where infection inoculum is strong and standardized. (2) The XENOFOOD proved a harmless food supplement, and despite the in vitro cytotoxicity of its CFCM ingredients, did not cause any detectable adverse effect in the animals of the XENOFOOD-fed (T) groups of the birds."]
