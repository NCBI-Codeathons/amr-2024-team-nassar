["Results and Discussion", "Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis of ThnA", "The genomic analysis of Nocardia sp. CS682 [21] showed that the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for the synthesis of 1-(\u03b1-L-(2-O-methyl)-6-deoxymannopyranosyloxy)-3,6,8-trimethoxynaphthalene consisted of PKS (ThnA) and three O-methyltransferases (ThnM1, ThnM2, and ThnM3) (Fig. 2). ThnA was putatively annotated for the production of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphtalene (THN) from malonyl-CoA. The thnA gene encodes a protein consisting of 374 amino acids (AA), and the gen\u00e9s overall G+C content is 56%. According to BLAST searches, thnA shows significant similarity with other type III PKS genes in the database. The amino acid sequence alignment of ThnA, as illustrated in Fig. 3, exhibited the existence of four extensively conserved residues, namely Cys138, Phe188, His270, and Asn303, which are present in other known PKSs. From the structure and functional studies of chalcone synthase and other PKSs, Cys138 serves as a nucleophile that starts the reaction and makes the enzyme-bound polyketide intermediate [7, 27, 28]. Phe188 provides a hydrophobic environment that promotes the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA [29], ionic interaction of His270 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the thiolate anion of Cys168 [30], and Asn303 is responsible for catalyzing the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA [1, 30]. Additionally, it has been previously demonstrated that Tyr224 assists in substrate specificity, and its aromatic ring is considered essential for ThnA to recognize malonyl-CoA as a starter unit, much like the two other aromatic amino acids, Trp and Phe [29]. The amino acid alignment and conserved domains in ThnA suggest that it could serve as a THNS. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the protein sequences of ThnA and their closest homologs (Fig. S2). Phylogenetic tree analysis of ThnA revealed that it had the closest relationships with functionally characterized PKS.", "Heterologous Expression of thnA", "In this study, S. lividan TK24 was utilized as a host for heterologous expression. The construction of pIBR25-thnA involved cloning the DNA fragment containing thnA into pIBR25, which was subsequently transformed into S. lividan TK24 via protoplast transformation using a standard protocol [25]. Confirmation of successful transfer of the plasmid into the heterologous host was achieved through plasmid isolation and restriction digestions (data not shown). S. lividan and S. lividan pIBR25-thnA were cultivated in R2YE liquid medium for a duration of 5 days at a temperature of 28\u00b0C. To extract the cultures, a double volume of ethyl acetate was employed, and the resulting organic supernatant fraction was subsequently concentrated using a rotary evaporator. After concentration, the sample was dissolved in a suitable volume of methanol for subsequent HPLC analysis at a UV wavelength of 330 nm by Thermo HPLC series 1100 with a Thermo-C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm). The HPLC mobile phase was composed of solvent A (water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid [TFA]) and solvent B (acetonitrile) and followed a linear gradient (10% acetonitrile at 0 min, 10 to 90% B for 1\u201325 min, 90 to 50% B for 25\u221228 min, and from 50 to 10% B for 28\u221230 min), at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC profile showed a distinct peak at a retention time of (tR) 15.7 min from S. lividan pIBR25-thnA, but no peak was observed from wild-type or S. lividan pIBR25 (Fig. 4A). The identity of THN and flaviolin (an auto-oxidized product of THN) was further supported by LC-ESI/MS analysis ([M+H]+ ion at m/z = 193.0489 found, calcd for C10H9O4 193.0495, and [M+H]+ ion at m/z = 207.0284 found, calcd for C10H7O5 207.0288) (Figs. 4B and 4C).", "RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR Analysis", "For transcriptional analysis of thnA, S. lividan TK24 and S. lividan pIBR25-thnA were cultured in 50 ml of HT medium. Samples were taken on the third day, and mRNA was isolated using a standard protocol. Gene-specific primers were used, and rpoB, the housekeeping gene in S. lividan, was used as a control. The RT-PCR results showed the band of thnA (158 bp) in S. lividan pIBR25-thnA, which did not exist in the wild-type strain, i.e., S. lividan TK24, whereas the housekeeping rpoB showed a band (181 bp) in both strains (Fig. 5). The amplified sequenced was further confirmed through sequencing after ligation into the pGEM\u00ae-T Easy vector."]
