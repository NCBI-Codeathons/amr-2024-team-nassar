Two ions with m/z\u2009=\u20091069.12 and m/z\u2009=\u20091083.16 were detected (Fig.\u00a01c). AntiSMASH analysis of the S. iranensis genome suggested that these two compounds could be azalomycin F3a and F4a [21, 28]. The azalomycin F complex is formed by a group of macrolactones, which were first isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. azalomyceticus. Azalomycin F consists of a 34-membered macrolactone ring and a guanidine-containing side chain (Fig. 2a,\u00a0[29]) and is active against fungi as well as Gram-positive bacteria [30, 31]. A comparison of the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02) and the genes coding for tailoring enzymes (Supplementary Table\u00a03) of the published azalomycin F biosynthetic gene cluster with the gene cluster found in S. iranensis supports the assumption that the two found ions indeed correspond to the azalomycin F complex. To substantiate this finding, azalomycin F-deficient mutants of S. iranensis were generated (Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). In the \u2206azl4\u2206azl5 mutant strain, the azalomycin F biosynthesis genes azl4 and azl5 were deleted. Azl4 catalyzes the activation of 4-guanidinobutyric acid by addition of coenzyme A to the molecule. Azl5 consecutively loads 4-guanidinobutyryl-CoA onto the azalomycin F PKS [32]. In the second mutant strain \u2206azlH, the azlH gene, which encodes a part of the PKS [30, 32], was deleted. Neither of the mutants \u2206azl4\u2206azl5 and \u2206azlH produced detectable amounts of azalomycin F and both failed to decolorize C. reinhardtii (Fig.\u00a02b). MALDI-IMS showed that azalomycin F was exclusively present inside the bacterial colony in monoculture of S. iranensis, while it was released in co-culture of the bacterium with C. reinhardtii (Fig.\u00a01c). We conclude that azalomycin F is the sole algicidal agent that is present under our culturing conditions and that S. iranensis produces and releases it in the presence of C. reinhardtii.Fig. 2Structure of azalomycin F and its production by S. iranensis.a Azalomycin F complex consists of azalomycins F3a and F4a. b MS analysis in positive mode of S. iranensis wild type (WT), S. iranensis mutants \u2206azl4\u2206azl5 and \u2206azlH.

This was not due to lack of release of azalomycin F because MALDI-IMS showed that azalomycin F was still released by S. iranensis in the presence of C. reinhardtii in the dark (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). To provide evidence for a light-dependent algicidal activity of azalomycin F, C. reinhardtii cells were stained with SYTOX Blue after treatment with the algicide under light and in the dark. SYTOX Blue is a non-permeating dye that exhibits fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids. Therefore, blue fluorescence is only detectable when cell membranes are leaky in damaged or dead cells. A positive SYTOX Blue signal was only detected when C. reinhardtii was treated with azalomycin F under illumination (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). Azalomycin F-treated cells cultured in the dark maintained their red autofluorescence, indicating that C. reinhardtii was not killed by azalomycin F in the dark. To analyze whether the effect of azalomycin F in light is connected to photosynthesis, we investigated the C. reinhardtii mutants cc4147 FuD7 (psbA deletion) and cc4385 (psbD deletion) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). psbA and psbD code for the D1 and D2 reaction center proteins of photosystem II, respectively [33, 34]. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a06, azalomycin F also had a lethal effect on both mutant strains indicating that photosynthesis is not required for its lethal activity. To investigate the spectrum of algae affected by azalomycin F, we expanded our studies to microalgae belonging to different classes. Both Euglena gracilis and Haematococcus pluvialis were susceptible to azalomycin F as indicated by decolorization, a positive SYTOX blue signal and rounding up of the cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). Thus, a wide range of microalgae are susceptible to azalomycin F.", "Association of Aspergillus nidulans and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii increased algal survival in presence of azalomycin F", "We observed C. reinhardtii cells that still appeared green and alive in a tripartite interaction with A. nidulans and S. iranensis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). These data imply that presence of A. nidulans reduces the algicidal activity of S. iranensis. We therefore analyzed whether A. nidulans protects C. reinhardtii against purified azalomycin F, since the fungus proved to be more resistant to azalomycin F than the alga (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). For this purpose, we co-cultivated A. nidulans with C. reinhardtii and allowed the alga to swim into the mycelia before azalomycin F was added to the co-culture. Viability of C. reinhardtii was measured by chlorophyll autofluorescence (Fig.\u00a03a). As shown in Fig.\u00a03b, C. reinhardtii cells that were allowed to migrate into fungal mycelia were less affected by azalomycin F compared with C. reinhardtii cells that were not given the time to do so. Increasing initial fungal spore inocula were applied prior to addition of C. reinhardtii, azalomycin F treatment and autofluorescence measurement (Fig.\u00a03c). A higher number of spores should lead to a higher fungal biomass and increased fungal biomass correlated with better protection, as demonstrated by titrating out the effect of azalomycin F in the presence of 104 spores and above (Fig.\u00a03c). In order to estimate the specificity of this protection, we tested further fungal species. Supplementary Fig.\u00a010 shows that S. cerevisiae attracts and protects C. reinhardtii from azalomycin F as well. A tight association, as seen with A. nidulans, was not observed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011). Sordaria macrospora, an important fungus to study sexual development [35], however, failed to protect C. reinhardtii, although the fungus attracted the alga and formed associations comparable to A. nidulans (Supplementary Figs.\u00a010, 11). Our data thus suggest that the protection is associated with self-resistance, since only fungi that are resistant against azalomycin F (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09) protect C. reinhardtii.Fig. 3Co-cultivation of C. reinhardtii and A. nidulans protects the alga from azalomycin F.a Microscopy pictures of C. reinhardtii co-cultivated with or without A. nidulans and treated with or without azalomycin F.

Recently, the binding of azalomycin F5a to membrane components of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was proposed as a determinant of its antibacterial activity [26, 36]. Consequently, we reasoned that the addition of lipids to the culture medium could neutralize the algicidal activity of azalomycin F. As shown in Fig.\u00a04a\u2013d, cardiolipin (CL), 16:0-i15:0 phosphatidylcholin (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and a commercially available extract of polar lipids of S. cerevisiae (YE) all significantly lowered the detrimental effect of azalomycin F on C. reinhardtii. Since 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG) and the sphingolipid d18:1/18:0 C18 glucosyl(\u03b2)ceramide (GC) did not affect the activity of azalomycin F (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012), these findings indicate that there is binding specificity toward distinct polar lipids.Fig. 4Influence of lipids on the algicidal activity of azalomycin F measured by C. reinhardtii autofluorescence.Algal cells were treated with 0, 10, and 15\u2009\u00b5g/mL azalomycin F and various concentrations of polar lipids. a CL, cardiolipin; b PC, phosphatidylcholin; c PI, phosphatidylinositol; d YE, extract of polar lipids of S. cerevisiae; e AE, extract of polar lipids of A. nidulans. *P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01; ***P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001; ns not significant; data were obtained from at least three biological replicates, error bars represent SDs.", "Fig. 4Influence of lipids on the algicidal activity of azalomycin F measured by C. reinhardtii autofluorescence.Algal cells were treated with 0, 10, and 15\u2009\u00b5g/mL azalomycin F and various concentrations of polar lipids. a CL, cardiolipin; b PC, phosphatidylcholin; c PI, phosphatidylinositol; d YE, extract of polar lipids of S. cerevisiae; e AE, extract of polar lipids of A. nidulans. *P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01; ***P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001; ns not significant; data were obtained from at least three biological replicates, error bars represent SDs.", "Influence of lipids on the algicidal activity of azalomycin F measured by C. reinhardtii autofluorescence.", "Algal cells were treated with 0, 10, and 15\u2009\u00b5g/mL azalomycin F and various concentrations of polar lipids. a CL, cardiolipin; b PC, phosphatidylcholin; c PI, phosphatidylinositol; d YE, extract of polar lipids of S. cerevisiae; e AE, extract of polar lipids of A. nidulans. *P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01; ***P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001; ns not significant; data were obtained from at least three biological replicates, error bars represent SDs.", "Based on these findings, we hypothesized that a polar lipid extract of A. nidulans should also neutralize the effect of azalomycin F on C. reinhardtii. Indeed, addition of A. nidulans polar lipids to the culture of C. reinhardtii prevented the algae from decolorization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a04e). Addition of 384\u2009\u00b5g/mL of the polar lipid extract of A. nidulans (AE) to C. reinhardtii treated with azalomycin F restored the autofluorescence to the level of untreated controls. Thus, binding of azalomycin F to membrane polar lipids is required for its antibacterial activity [26, 36] as well as for its antifungal [37] and algicidal activity, as shown here.", "Aspergillus nidulans attracts and fosters the growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", "We were able to show that an algal\u2013fungal association protects C. reinhardtii from azalomycin F.

Figure\u00a05b shows that significantly (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) more C. reinhardtii cells swam into a glass capillary loaded with supernatant of an A. nidulans culture than into a capillary filled with fresh medium (Fig.\u00a05b). PBS served as a negative control showing unspecific swimming without an obvious chemotactic cue. Also supernatants of the other fungi tested, i.e., S. cerevisiae and S. macrospora, attracted the C. reinhardtii cells, indicating that C. reinhardtii actively swims toward the fungi.Fig. 5Association of A. nidulans with C. reinhardtii.a Microscopy picture showing C. reinhardtii cells (green) in mycelium of A. nidulans.

When co-cultured with A. nidulans, C. reinhardtii exhibited a more than two-fold increased growth rate (\u00b5max\u2009=\u20092.5) and higher overall cell density compared with the monoculture (Fig.\u00a05c). In contrast, A. nidulans produced a lower biomass in co-culture, compared with the monoculture at the end of the experiment (Fig.\u00a05d). In the light of our data showing protection of the alga by fungal polar lipids, it was conceivable that more lipids were formed as an adaptive response and at the same time, energy would be redirected to lipid metabolism of the fungus explaining lower growth of A. nidulans in co-culture with C. reinhardtii. Therefore, we measured the expression of polar lipid biosynthesis genes of A. nidulans in presence of C. reinhardtii by qRT-PCR. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a013, overexpression of polar lipid biosynthesis genes was not observed in presence of C. reinhardtii excluding both possibilities. Taken together, our findings suggest a chemotactically driven attraction of the alga to the fungus, which ultimately provides benefit to the alga by protecting against toxins."]
