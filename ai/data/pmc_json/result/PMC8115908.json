["Results", "The gene expansion table (Table S2) lists 612 species of 80 genera within the \nActinobacteria\n with data that provides an extensive analysis at the phylum level, which is the starting point for detailed phylogenomic studies. Gene expansions were identified in separate datasets at the genus and species levels, along with details of the numbers of genes in each functional category per species and the mean numbers of genes in each functional category per genus expanded within the genomes. These data can be used subsequently in phylogenomic analyses to identify targets for metabolic engineering and gene function studies. Identification of expanded gene families may also facilitate the recognition of novel natural product BGCs, for which gene expansion events of primary metabolic genes have been classified to be associated within BGCs as biosynthetic enzymes or through provision of additional copies of antibiotic targets that may subsequently function as resistance mechanisms [6, 11, 20\u201324].", "This database has found utility for studying primary metabolic gene expansions in \nStreptomyces\n. It enabled a detailed in silico analysis of the duplication event leading to the two pyruvate kinases in the genus of \nStreptomyces\n, subsequently enabling the functional characterization of the two isoenzymes to reveal how they contribute to metabolic robustness [15]. ActDES may also be useful for investigating the distribution of primary metabolic genes across the phylum to link phenotype to genotype and phylogenetic position. An initial RpoB phylogeny has been reconstructed previously using this database [15], which provided a robust universal phylogeny for comparison of individual protein trees [25].", "To demonstrate the utility of ActDES, the glucose permease/glucokinase system of the \nActinobacteria\n was investigated. The role of nutrient-sensing in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis is well known [26], with the enzyme glucokinase (Glk) playing a central role in carbon-catabolite repression (CCR) in \nStreptomyces\n [27]. In most bacteria, CCR is mediated by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), yet in Streptomyces, glucose uptake is mediated by the major-facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, glucose permease (GlcP), and there is evidence for direct interaction between Glk and GlcP, which may mediate CCR [28]. Understanding the nature and distribution of these enzymes will play a key role in developing industrial fermentations with glucose as major carbon source. Investigating the distribution of the glucose permease/glucokinase system across the phylum shows that GlcP and Glk have been the subject of gene expansion events in some members of the \nStreptomycetales\n, most notably the \nStreptomyces\n, with a patchy distribution of the Glk/GlcP system across the remainder of the phylum (Table S2; genus tab). However, where the Glk/GlcP system is found, the number of expansion events observed is greater for Glk than for GlcP (Fig. 2a, b). The phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2a, b) clearly show two clades for Glk and GlcP within the \nStreptomycetales\n (interactive trees are available via Microreact [29]: Glk \u2013 https://microreact.org/project/w_KDfn1xA/5a178533, and GlcP \u2013 https://microreact.org/project/VBUdiQ5_k/045c95e1). However, these clades differ in the number of sequences, with the Glk clades being equal in number, suggesting that a duplication event has occurred within the \nStreptomycetales\n (Fig. 2b). The is consistent throughout the order, with the patterns largely the same as observed for \nStreptomyces coelicolor\n. This species has two ROK-family ATP-dependent glucokinases, SCO2126 (glkA) and SCO6260, that share around 50\u200a% amino acid sequence identity, and each is found in one of the distinct clades (permease-associated kinases and orphan kinases (Fig. 2b). Whilst SCO2126 is a GlcP-associated kinase, the gene encoding SCO6260 is located in an operon including genes encoding a putative carbohydrate ABC-transporter system, which has been reported elsewhere [30]. SCO6260 appears to be the only glucokinase in the database that is associated with an ABC-transporter. This may suggest that expansion of the Glk gene family in \nStreptomycetales\n might have occurred to extend the number of CCR-mediating kinases in the genome, adding increased regulatory complexity to carbohydrate metabolism in this group of organisms that use CCR as a major regulator of specialized metabolism.", "Fig. 2.(a) Actinobacterial-wide phylogenetic tree of glucose permeases (GlcP) and (b) actinobacterial-wide phylogenetic tree of glucokinases (Glk).

Scale bar indicates branch lengths equivalent to one substitution per site.", "The two clades for GlcP within the \nStreptomycetales\n differ in size, suggesting either gene duplication followed by gene loss or an expansion through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has occurred. A detailed examination of these clades by species (Table S2; species tab) shows the presence of both scenarios. There are duplicated enzymes located within the same clade (as observed in \nS. coelicolor\n; group I) or additional copies of the permease that are located in a phylogenetically distinct clade, which lacks congruence with the RpoB tree [15], and remarkably consists entirely of sequences from the genus \nStreptomyces\n (group II; Fig. 2a). This suggests that they may have been acquired via HGT. The expansive nature of the duplicated Glk enzymes compared to GlcP may be due to the role played in CCR by the GlkA enzymes [27], and the different transcriptional activities under glycolytic and gluconeogenic conditions [31], yet quite how these different Glk enzymes interact with the permease(s) under various conditions requires further experimental investigation to understand their exact physiological role, and how this may be translated into industrial strain improvement processes."]
