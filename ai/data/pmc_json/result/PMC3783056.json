["Results", "Establishment of highly camptothecin-resistant colon cancer cells", "In this study, we established the SNRA23F, SNRA311E, SNRD16F and SNRD38F sublines, which were highly camptothecin-resistant cell lines (Fig. 1A). These cells exhibited markedly retarded growth compared with that of parental DLD-1 and DLDSNR6 cells (Fig. 1B). Observations of the cells stained with 4\u2032-6-diamidino-phenylindole under a fluorescence microscope revealed no signs of apoptotic cell death in the resistant cell lines (data not shown). The newly established sublines grew in the presence of 30 \u03bcM of camptothecin. In addition, these cells were resistant to the indolocarbazole derivative, J-107088 (Fig. 2).", "Three missense mutations of the Top1 gene in resistant cell lines", "We previously identified a Top1 missense mutation in DLDSNR6 cells at codon 365, which resulted in the amino acid alteration of glycine (GGC) to serine (AGC) (7). In addition, the parental DLD-1 cells had a heterozygous Top1 missense mutation resulting in a Met675Ile alteration (12,13). The highly camptothecin-resistant cells (SNRA23F, SNRA311E, SNRD16F and SNRD38F) harbored a Top1 missense mutation at codon 717, which resulted in a glycine (GGA) to arginine (AGA) substitution. Furthermore, the SNRD16F and SNRD38F cell lines carried a codon 421 mutation that resulted in the substitution from glutamine (CAA) to arginine (CGA) (Fig. 3).", "Top1 protein expression and enzymatic function in resistant cell lines", "There were slightly lower levels of Top1 protein expression in highly camptothecin-resistant cell lines compared with those of the parental DLD-1 and DLDSNR6 cells, whereas the levels of Top2 protein expression were increased in these sublines (Fig. 4A). The DNA relaxation assay revealed that Top1 activity was markedly reduced to approximately one-eighth in highly camptothecin-resistant cell lines compared with that in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 4B).", "Expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters", "The levels of mRNA expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCB1 [multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)] and ABCG2 [breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)] were significantly increased in camptothecin-resistant cell lines, including DLDSNR6. However, the levels of mRNA expression of ABCC2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2) were reduced in SNRA23F and SNRA311E cells (Table I).", "Cell cycle analysis of J-107088-treated cells", "The flow cytometry analysis of untreated cells revealed that the S-phase fraction was not reduced in highly camptothecin-resistant cells (Fig. 5) compared with parental cells (~24% in DLD-1 cells, ~30% in DLDSNR6 cells, data not shown). When cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM of J-107088 for 48 h, accumulation was observed in the late S-G2/M phase in SNRA23F and SNRA311E cells, while the cell cycle distribution was not clearly affected in SNRD16F and SNRD38F cells (Fig. 5). Treatment with camptothecin at the higher concentration of 10 \u03bcM caused marginal changes in the cell cycle distribution in highly camptothecin-resistant cells (data not shown). The addition of the MDR1 inhibitor, verapamil, to 5 \u03bcM of J-107088 did not evidently affect the cell cycle distribution. When cells were coincubated with the BCRP inhibitor, Ko143, and 5 \u03bcM of J-107088 for 48 h, a marked accumulation in late S to G2/M phase was observed in all highly camptothecin-resistant cells, while the G0/1 population was still observed in SNRD16F and SNRD38F cells (Fig. 5)."]
