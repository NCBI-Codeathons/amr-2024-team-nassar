["2. Results", "2.1. Sequencing of Streptomyces Cacaoi CA-170360 Genome and Identification of Cacaoidin BGC", "S. cacaoi CA-170360 genome sequence was obtained with a combination of de novo PacBio and Illumina approaches, yielding two contigs of 5,971,081 bp and 2,704,105 bp.", "The genome sequence was analyzed with antiSMASH [6], BAGEL4 [22] and PRISM [23], but none of these tools could predict the BGC responsible for cacaoidin biosynthesis, suggesting that the discovery of novel bioactive NPs using genome mining is still a challenge [10].", "The C-terminal sequence of cacaoidin (Thr-Ala-Ser-Trp-Gly-Cys) was used as the query in a tBLASTn using the whole genome sequence. A 162 bp Open Reading Frame (ORF) was found to encode this sequence and helped to elucidate the final structure of the peptide [12]. Cacaoidin structural gene caoA encodes a 23-amino acid C-terminal core peptide (SSAPCTIYASVSASISATASWGC) following a predicted 30-amino acid N-terminal leader peptide (MGEVVEMVAGFDTYADVEELNQIAVGEAPE). Neither the leader nor the core peptide sequences showed high sequence similarity with any other lanthipeptide or linaridin (Figure S1).", "Considering the structure of cacaoidin [12] (Figure 1), we identified a putative 30 Kb BGC (cao cluster) containing 27 ORFs whose proposed functions were assigned after BLAST analysis and HHpred secondary structure prediction (Figure 2, Table 1 and Table S2). Interestingly, no homologous genes of known dehydratases or cyclases commonly found in the four classes described for lanthipeptides nor in the class of linaridins could be identified in this region. Moreover, the similarity with the recently described lexapeptide BGC (lxm) [20] contributed as well to assigning some of the functions of the cao ORFs.", "The cao BGC encodes a putative cypemycin decarboxylase CypD homologue (CaoD) containing a conserved phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) synthetase/decarboxylase domain [17,24]. CaoD shares a 54.8% similarity with LxmD from the lexapeptide BGC, which is involved in the decarboxylation of C-terminal Cys residue during the formation of the AviMeCys moiety [20], a fact that supports the same role for CaoD.", "The formation of lanthionine rings is accomplished by different dehydratases and cyclases depending on the lanthipeptide class [15], but no homologues were found in the cao cluster. In the lexapeptide biosynthesis, a three-component lanthionine synthetase formed by the standalone monofunctional proteins LxmK, LxmX and LxmY is responsible for the Ser/Thr dehydration and cyclization to form Dha and Dhb, respectively, and the installation of the lanthionine ring [20]. These proteins present a certain degree of homology with some proteins encoded in the cao cluster: LxmK shows a 49.6% similarity with Cao9, LxmX has a 40.5% similarity with Cao14 and LxmY shows a 44.9% similarity with Cao7. Interestingly, LxmY and Cao7 contain a HopA1 conserved domain (PFAM17914) that has been described in the HopA1 effector protein from Pseudomonas syringae [25].", "According to these data, Cao7-9-14 would also work as a three-component lanthionine synthetase: the putative kinase Cao9 would phosphorylate Ser/Thr residues on the CaoA precursor peptide, Cao14 would remove the phosphate groups and generate dehydro-amino acids, and Cao7 would catalyze a Michael-type addition of the Cys5 thiol group to the \u03b2-carbon of Dha1, generating the lanthionine bridge, and likely the addition of previously decarboxylated-Cys23 by CaoD to Dhb18, forming AviMeCys.", "The N-terminal Ala dimethylation of cypemycin, the prototypical member of linaridins [18], is carried out by the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase CypM [14,19] and shows homology with the methyltransferase LxmM that catalyzes the lexapeptide N-terminal dimethylation [20]. The cao cluster encodes Cao4, a putative O-methyltransferase containing the conserved Methyltransf_2 domain. However, despite the low homology found between Cao4 and LxmM (26.9% similarity), both proteins share the AdoMet_MTases superfamily domain, characteristic of the SAM-dependent methyltransferases. No other CypM or LxmM homologues have been found in the genome of strain CA-170360. Cao4 shows very low homology with two types of LanS O-methyltransferases described in class I lanthipeptide clusters from actinobacteria: LanSA [26] and LanSB [27]. Thus, its role in the N,N-methylation remains unclear and is currently under study.", "d-Amino acids provide a wide variety of properties to lanthipeptides [28] and are introduced by modifying the genetically encoded l-Ser and l-Thr into Dha and Dhb, which are subjected to a diastereoselective hydrogenation to finally incorporate d-Ala and d-Abu, respectively [15,27]. This reaction is carried out by dehydrogenases generically called LanJ [15], which are divided into zinc-dependent dehydrogenases (LanJA), which can only hydrogenate Dha, and flavin-dependent dehydrogenases (LanJB) able to reduce both Dha and Dhb [29,30]. Xu et al. [20] reported LxmJ as the first example of the LanJC class in lanthipeptides. LxmJ is a novel F420H2-dependent reductase that catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of Dha28 to d-Ala28 in the mature lexapeptide. Within the cao BGC, Cao12 shows a 58,6% similarity with LxmJ, and both proteins contain a F420H2-dependent oxidoreductase (MSMEG_4879 family) conserved domain. This suggests that Cao12 could be also involved in the incorporation of d-amino acids (four d-Ala and one d-Abu) in the cacaoidin structure. It has been demonstrated that LxmJ is unable to reduce Dhb when a S28T point mutation is introduced in LxmA. However, as it was shown for BsjJB in bicereucin biosynthesis [30], the reduction may be dependent of the position and/or sequence, so the incorporation of d-Abu in cacaoidin could also be performed by Cao12.", "The disaccharide moiety \u03b2-6-deoxygulopyranosyl-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-rhamnopyranoside of cacaoidin has not been previously reported [12]. Three of the four proteins required for the synthesis of \u03b1-l-rhamnose (rmlA, rmlB and rmlD) (Figure S2) are encoded in the cao cluster. Nevertheless, a BLAST search of RmlC against CA-170360 whole genome sequence also shows the presence of a rmlC gene and additional rmlA, rmlB and rmlD homologous genes outside the cacaoidin cluster. Indeed, it has been reported that the rml genes do not have to be necessarily clustered [31]. Bleomycin, tallysomycin and zorbamycin incorporate NDP-l-gulose or NDP-6-deoxy-l-gulose to their structures, and their biosynthesis was used as reference to look for the presence of similar proteins being encoded in our genome (Figure S3) [32]. Despite no homologues being found in the cacaoidin BGC, we identified some protein homologues in the genome. However, as none of them were clustered, no conclusions could be made for the \u03b2-l-6-deoxy-gulose biosynthesis.", "As one of the unusual structural features of cacaoidin, the disaccharide is O-linked to the aromatic ring of the tyrosine residue [12]. While serine, threonine or hydroxyproline O-glycosylation have been reported in many natural glycopeptides [33], the O-glycosylation of tyrosine in a natural product has been only reported in the mannopeptimycins, in a reaction catalyzed by the mannosyltransferases MppH and MppI [34]. The cao cluster lacks MppH/I homologues, but contains three glycosyltransferases (GTs) (Cao8, Cao16 and Cao24). Cao8 and Cao16 belong to the family GT-2 and show 42% identity (54% similarity) and 43% identity (52% similarity), respectively, with an UDP-Glc:alpha-d-GlcNAc-diphosphoundecaprenol beta-1,3-glucosyltransferase WfgD, which catalyzes the addition of Glc, the second sugar moiety of the O152-antigen repeating unit, to GlcNAc-pyrophosphate-undecaprenol [35]. In contrast, Cao24 belongs to the family GT-4 that has a GT4_GtfA-like domain and a conserved RfaB domain, involved in the cell wall and membrane biosynthesis [36].", "Despite the presence of three GTs in the cacaoidin BGC, only two sugar moieties in the form of disaccharide are detected in the structure. The three GTs could work in a cooperative manner to achieve effective glycosylation, as it has already been proposed [37,38,39]. Based on the \u201cinverting\u201d or \u201cretaining\u201d behavior of the glycosyltransferases, we propose that both Cao8 and Cao16, belonging to the \u201cinverting\u201d GT-2 family, might work cooperatively to attach the \u03b1-l-rhamnose unit, while Cao24, belonging to the \u201cretaining\u201d GT-4 family, would incorporate the \u03b2-l-6-deoxygulose unit [12].", "In addition to cacaoidin, only two glycosylated RiPPs produced by bacteria have been described: the group of glycocins, whose sugar moieties are linked to Cys, Ser or Thr residues by S-glycosyltransferases [40], and the class III lanthipeptide NAI-112, which carries a 6-deoxyhexose moiety N-linked to a tryptophan residue by the AplG GT [41]. However, low homologies were found between these enzymes and the GTs present in the cacaoidin cluster. Further studies will clarify the role of each GT in cacaoidin biosynthesis.", "Processing of leader peptide is another key step in the post-translational modification of RiPPs [15,42,43,44,45,46]. In the cacaoidin cluster, Cao15 encodes a putative Zn-dependent peptidase belonging to the M16 peptidase family that may be involved in the leader peptide processing. Peptidases LxmP1 and LxmP2 from lexapeptide BGC also belong to the M16 peptidase family and share 25.4% and 30.4% similarity with Cao15, respectively. LxmP1 has an inactive M16 peptidase domain and LxmP2 an active domain. It has been suggested that LxmP1 and LxmP2 may form a heterodimer to remove the leader peptide from LxmA [20]. Since Cao15 harbors both the active and the inactive M16 peptidase domains, we propose Cao15 as the cacaoidin leader peptidase.", "Furthermore, three ABC transporters were found in the cao pathway (Cao11, Cao18 and Cao19) that might be responsible for the export and self-resistance of cacaoidin, as it has been proposed in other lanthipeptides [47,48].", "Gene expression in the cacaoidin cluster seems to be under the control of five different transcriptional regulators: one LuxR (CaoR1), two HTH-type XRE (CaoR2 and CaoR3), one TetR (CaoR4) and one SARP (CaoR5). XRE and TetR have been described as transcriptional repressors [49,50] while LuxR and SARP have been designated as transcriptional activators [51,52]. Further studies will clarify their role in the production of the antibiotic.", "The remaining five genes identified in the cao cluster (cao17, cao21, cao23, cao25 and cao26) do not have any defined functions. Cao23 belongs to the SRPBCC (START/RHO_alpha_C/PITP/Bet_v1/CoxG/CalC) superfamily of proteins [53,54]. This superfamily contains aromatase/cyclase (ARO/CYC) domains, such as those described for tetracenomycin [55] and Smu.440 [56]. However, we cannot still propose a function for Cao23.", "The HHpred analysis of each ORF was also used for the detection of RiPP precursor peptide Recognition Elements (RREs) [57]. These RRE are structurally similar PqqD-related conserved precursor peptide-binding domains present in the majority of known prokaryotic RiPP modifying enzymes and are usually responsible for the leader peptide recognition [57,58,59]. However, no RREs were found, suggesting the possibility of alternative leader peptide recognition domains that are unrelated to the already known RREs [57]. As homology detection algorithms become more accurate and more sequences become available, additional RREs will be found.", "2.2. Cloning and Heterologous Expression of Cacaoidin BGC", "The strain S. cacaoi CA-170360 is reluctant to genetic manipulation, limiting the obtention of knockdown mutants to confirm the involvement of the cao gene cluster in the biosynthesis of cacaoidin. To confirm that the genes included in the cao cluster were sufficient for biosynthesis of the antibiotic, we cloned and heterologously expressed the cacaoidin BGC in the genetically amenable host Streptomyces albus J1074 [60].", "We followed the CATCH method [61] to clone a 40 Kb region containing the cao BGC into the pCAP01 vector [62], yielding pCAO. pCAO was introduced into NEB-10-beta E. coli ET12567 cells via electroporation. A triparental conjugation [63] was carried out between E. coli ET12567/pCAO, E. coli ET12567/pUB307 and S. albus J1074 spores [60]. The transconjugants were genetically verified via PCR amplification of the genes cao4, cao8 and cao15 using specific primers described in Table S1. Five positive transconjugants, alongside the negative control (S. albus J1074/pCAP01) and the wild-type strain CA-170360, were grown in R2YE, MPG, FR23, YEME and KM4 for 14 days at 28 \u00b0C to confirm the production of the targeted antibiotic. After acetone extraction of the cultures, organic solvent was evaporated, and the aqueous extracts containing 20% DMSO were analyzed via LC-HRESIMS(+)-TOF and MS/MS.", "The analysis of the extracts from pCAO transconjugants confirmed the presence of peaks at 3.35 min, coincident with the retention time of elution of cacaoidin in the wild-type strain and purified cacaoidin standards, only in R2YE medium. The perfect correlation between the UV spectrum, exact mass, isotopic distribution and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of cacaoidin standards and the components isolated from S. albus J1074/pCAO, undoubtedly demonstrated that they correspond to cacaoidin (Figure 3 and Figure 4). We quantified the yield of cacaoidin production in both the heterologous and the wild-type strains. S. albus J1074 has been largely used as heterologous host to produce a broad range of compound classes with improved yields [64]. However, the cacaoidin production yield of 0.14 mg/L in the heterologous strain grown in R2YE was reduced approximately 4-fold with respect to the 0.57 mg/L obtained in the wild-type strain CA-170360 in the same medium and fermentation format (10 mL). These results clearly confirm that the cao BGC cloned in pCAO contains all the genes required to ensure the biosynthesis of cacaoidin, although the production yield is dependent on the strain used.", "2.3. Additional Lanthidin Clusters in Public Databases", "To study if more lanthidin-encoding clusters can be found within actinomycetes, a BLAST search against the NCBI whole genome shotgun sequences database was performed, and sequences with a high degree of homology to cacaoidin BGC were only found in five Streptomyces strains, namely Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi NRRL B-1220 (MUBL01000486), Streptomyces sp. NRRL F-5053 (JOHT01000009), Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-1868 (JOGD01000003), Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi NBRC 12748 (BJMM01000002.1) and Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi OABC16 (VSKT010000024) (Figure 5, Table S3).", "An alignment of the precursor peptide of the cacaoidin in all homologous clusters showed that no variations in the protein sequence were found. No other cacaoidin-derived peptides or pathways were found in the databases, indicating that the cacaoidin BGC is very conserved. A phylogenetic tree generated using the neighbor-joining method and corrected with the Tamura 3-parameter algorithm [65,66] showed the close relatedness of strain Streptomyces cacaoi CA-170360 with the other five strains that contain the cao cluster, which was highly supported by the bootstrap values and contained two sequences of the type species of S.cacaoi subsp cacaoi NRRL B-1220 and NBRC 12748, as well as the strain of the same subspecies, OABC16 (Figure S4). Moreover, when the 16S rDNA sequences of the unclassified strains Streptomyces sp. NRRL F-5053 and Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-1868 were analyzed in EzBiocloud, a 100% sequence similarity was confirmed with Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi NRRL B-1220, indicating that the cacaoidin BGC is so far limited to this specific clade of highly related strains associated to the subspecies S. cacaoi subsp. cacaoi, with no identifiable orthologs in other Streptomyces species. We extended the study to other members of the subspecies S.cacaoi subsp. asoensis that are clustered in a very distant phylogenetic branch from S.cacaoi subsp. cacaoi (Figure S4). We could confirm that none of the three whole genome sequences available in NCBI from strains of S. cacaoi subsp. asoensis contained any region with homology with the cao cluster, supporting that the cao BGC is a characteristic trait of the subspecies S. cacaoi subsp cacaoi. Several genome comparative studies have found other species-specific BGCs in some species of Streptomyces, reflecting that chemical novelty can be found at the species level and that the analysis of the genomes of closely related strains constitutes a promising approach for the identification of novel BGCs [67,68]. The occurrence of these species-specific BGCs may suggest that they were acquired recently via horizontal gene transfer as it has been shown for other pathways [69].", "Nevertheless, the analysis of below-threshold scores of CaoA BLAST results, together with the search of HopA1 domain-containing proteins similar to Cao7, allowed us to find some additional pathways that could encode new lanthidins (Figure 6). The alignment of the hypothetical precursor peptides shows the presence of some conserved residues that possibly could be involved in the leader peptide recognition by biosynthetic enzymes (Figure 7). In addition, the analysis of the ORFs present in all these clusters shows that all of them share a HopA1 domain-containing protein, a F420H2-dependent oxidoreductase, a CypD-related protein, a Zn-dependent or S9 peptidase and a putative phosphotransferase (Figure 6). Most of these clusters also contain an O-methyltransferase. These preliminary data suggest the existence of a minimal set of genes required to ensure the core structural features of a lanthidin and a broader distribution of potential BGCs encoding new lanthidins. These putative lanthidin BGCs are mainly present in Streptomyces strains, but also in two Actinoplanes species and another undefined member of the class Actinobacteria. To date, only the class V lanthipeptides cacaoidin and lexapeptide BGCs have been described. Additional members of the proposed new RiPP family will need to be isolated to confirm this hypothesis and whether class V lanthipeptides are only present in Actinobacteria (Figure 7)."]
