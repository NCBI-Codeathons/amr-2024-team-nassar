The gcd genes of P. aeruginosa PA14 (PA14_34970) and P. putida KT2440 (PP_1444) were cloned and expressed in E.\u00a0coli. Both proteins, each made up of 803 amino acid residues, are PQQ\u2010dependent and require divalent ions such as calcium ions as an enhancing co\u2010factor. The initial 138 to 140 amino acids at the N\u2010terminus form a membrane anchor with five transmembrane helices, while the remaining part of the protein, including the catalytic site, flanks the periplasmic space. The final construct of the Gcds used for protein expression contained C\u2010 and N\u2010terminal His\u2010tag sequences and excluded the first 8 native amino acids, since the construct with the full native sequence showed retarded growth and a low protein expression. The membrane proteins were purified for the enzyme assay using affinity and size permeation chromatography (Fig.\u00a0S1).", "If the Gcds can interact with phenazines, they should be able to reduce these mediators by transferring electrons from the glucose oxidation through the PQQ co\u2010factor to the phenazines (Fig.\u00a01). An enzyme assay was performed with the purified proteins using PCA and PYO as prospective electron acceptors. The standard electron acceptors of an established dehydrogenase enzyme assay (Jahn et\u00a0al., 2020), phenazine methanosulfate (PMS) and dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), were used as control reaction to verify activity of the enzyme. When either PCA or PYO was used as electron acceptor in this reaction, the Gcd of P. aeruginosa PA14 was able to catalyse the transfer of electrons from glucose to these phenazines, which resulted in their measurable reduction (Fig.\u00a02A and B). A control in which water was used to replace either the substrate or the enzyme did not show any phenazine reduction. We also performed the same assay with Gcd obtained from P. putida KT2440, a prospective organism for limited\u2010oxygen BES processes (Askitosari et\u00a0al., 2019). Comparison of the Gcds of P. aeruginosa PA14 and P. putida KT2440 showed 81.64% and 78.93% sequence identities in their nucleotide and amino acid sequences respectively. The enzyme assay with the Gcd of P. putida KT2440 equally showed reduction of PCA and PYO utilizing electrons from glucose oxidation (Fig.\u00a02C and D). No reduction of the phenazines was observed for both enzymes when PQQ or calcium ions were excluded from the reaction (results not shown). The reduction rate of PYO was about 60 times faster than that of PCA for both Gcds (Fig.\u00a02). The experiments clearly confirmed the membrane\u2010bound glucose dehydrogenases of P. aeruginosa and P. putida as potential phenazine reducing enzymes.", "Fig. 2Phenazine reduction by periplasmic membrane\u2010bound PQQ\u2010dependent glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) of P. aeruginosa PA14 (PA14 Gcd) and P. putida KT2440 (KT2440 Gcd).A. increase in concentration of reduced phenazine\u20101\u2010carboxylic acid (PCA) and (B) decrease in concentration of oxidized pyocyanin (PYO) by the interaction with PA14 Gcd; (C) increase in concentration of reduced PCA and (D) decrease in concentration of oxidized PYO by the interaction with KT2440 Gcd.

To ascertain the proportion of electrons generated from the periplasmic glucose oxidation pathway versus downstream cytoplasmic pathways, a BES was set up using three Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strains: a wild\u2010type strain (KT2440 wt), a glucose dehydrogenase deletion mutant (KT2440 \u0394gcd), in which the native Gcd was removed, and an overexpression strain, which was supplied with a plasmid for expressing the glucose dehydrogenase of P. aeruginosa PA14 (KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013PA14gcd). The Gcd of PA14 was used for the overexpression because PA14 is a natural producer of phenazines and had an overall better performance in the enzyme assay (Fig.\u00a02). The wild\u2010type and overexpression strains are able to metabolize glucose using the periplasmic as well as the cytoplasmic pathways, while the Gcd mutant strain can only use the cytoplasmic pathway.

The KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013PA14 gcd strain attained the highest maximum current density (25.9 \u00b5A cm\u20102) in the PCA\u2010BES, which was a 55% and 63% increase compared to the KT2440 wt and the KT2440 \u0394gcd respectively (Fig.\u00a03A). Similarly, in the PYO\u2010BES, KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013PA14 gcd had a peak current density of 12.2 \u00b5A cm\u20102, while the KT2440 wt and KT2440 \u0394gcd showed a maximum of 8.5 \u00b5A cm\u20102 (~\u00a070% of former) and 4.9 \u00b5A cm\u20102 (~\u00a040% of former) respectively (Fig.\u00a03B). Thus, the current density increase for the overexpression strain was somewhat lower in the PCA\u2010BES, which supports our earlier finding that the PYO enzymatic reduction was faster and more efficient than that with PCA (Fig.\u00a02). The decrease in current density observed in all the BES after the peak current was reached, was primarily due to a slower substrate conversion rate (Table\u00a01) under sustained passive aeration, but also for PYO because of degradation of this phenazine over time. PCA with a half\u2010life of more than 10\u00a0days appeared more stable than PYO, which half\u2010life was about one day (Fig.\u00a04).", "Specific glucose consumption and maximum biomass yield of P. putida KT2440 strains in BES using PCA or PYO as electron mediators.", "Strain PCA\u2010 BES PYO\u2010 BES.", "Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW gGlc\u20101) Coulombic efficiency (%) Specific glucose consumption (g l\u20101\u00a0h\u20101)a Maximum biomass yield (gDCW\u00a0gGlc\u20101).", "KT2440 wt 4.06 0.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.76 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd 5.02 0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 0.81 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013\nPA14 gcd 8.84 0.139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 1.27 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 0.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02.", "KT2440 \u0394gcd\u2013", "PA14 gcd", "Specific glucose consumption was calculated for the first 2\u00a0days of the BES experiment.", "Fig. 4Metabolic and growth (OD600) profile and the stability of phenazines as electron mediator in the BES over a period of 10\u00a0days using P. putida KT2440.

The specific glucose consumption was highest for the first two days of active aeration, with rates being the lowest for the Gcd mutant and highest for the overexpression strain (Table\u00a01). The initial higher glucose conversion rate especially for the overexpression but also the wild\u2010type strains in both PCA\u2010 and PYO\u2010BES could be linked to the utilization of the periplasmic pathway for glucose oxidation. This was confirmed by the presence of gluconate and 2\u2010ketogluconic acids in the supernatant (Fig\u00a04). The amount of gluconate and 2\u2010ketogluconic acids were expectedly low (about 0.2\u00a0g\u00a0l\u20101) in the wild type (Fig.\u00a04A and B), since the rate of gluconate uptake in P. putida KT2440 is well matched to glucose oxidation with a negligible amount going all the way to 2\u2010ketogluconate (Nikel et\u00a0al., 2015). The initial difference in the current density (after turning down the aeration) for both phenazines between the wild type and the mutant confirmed a contribution of the periplasmic pathway (Fig.\u00a04C and D). It seems like phenazines can only access electrons and enable current production with a delay in the absence of Gcd. Meanwhile, the products of the periplasmic pathway were found accumulated in a high amount in the overexpression strain (Fig.\u00a04E and F). In the PCA\u2010BES, almost 95% of the glucose converted by the overexpression strain was found as gluconate and 2\u2010ketogluconic acid after 2\u00a0days, showing that the sugar oxidation pathway was greatly accelerated by the overexpression; however, sugar acid uptake into the cytosol could not match their production. The effect was similar for this strain in the PYO\u2010BES, although only 42% of the glucose was found as intermediate products of direct glucose oxidation. The correlation between the metabolic flux increase of the overexpression strain in the glucose oxidation pathway and the increased electron discharge with this strain to the BES anode strongly suggests that the direct glucose oxidation pathway indeed is an important interaction point for phenazines to mediate electrons to the anode. However, if electrons are discharged at this point, no energetic gain for the cell is possible, since the electrons will be diverted away from the electron transport chain, which drives ATP\u2010production. To quantitatively compare the efficiency of the electron discharge via phenazines, the coulombic efficiency was calculated for the three strains. It gives the fraction of the electrons from glucose oxidation, which was mediated to the anode for current generation via the phenazines. For the PCA\u2010BES, this value is 4.1%, 5.0% and 8.8% for the wild\u2010type; Gcd mutant, and the overexpression strain, respectively, while it was expectedly lower in PYO\u2010BES with 0.8%, 0.8% and 1.3%, because the current was not sustained due to the instability of PYO. A higher columbic efficiency of the overexpression strain is in agreement to the high current density obtained for this strain in comparison with the other strains and to the less complete oxidation of the glucose with accumulated intermediates (Fig.\u00a04E and F). It should be highlighted that a coulombic efficiency of almost 9% is the highest ever observed for phenazine\u2010based electron discharge with Pseudomonas (Askitosari et\u00a0al., 2019).", "Assessing the transfer capacity of phenazines across the cell membrane into the cytosol", "The finding that the Gcd mutant could still generate current using the phenazines, even though it is not able to utilize the periplasmic direct glucose oxidation pathway, made it likely that phenazines also have access to electrons released in cytoplasmic metabolic pathways. Therefore, we developed two molecular biosensors to ascertain if phenazines, after initial release when synthesized or when externally added to the cell, could (re\u2010)enter the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a05). The first biosensor was made to track PCA and was based on the two reaction steps that modify PCA to PYO catalysed by the two enzymes PhzM, a methyltransferase, and PhzS, a monoxygenase (Mavrodi et\u00a0al., 2001). The genes encoding PhzM and PhzS were expressed via a plasmid in KT2440 and a PA14 mutant strain, lacking the PCA biosynthetic genes (P. aeruginosa PA14 \u0394phz1,2) (Schmitz and Rosenbaum, 2020). Since neither organism can produce phenazines, but now house the cytosolic enzymes PhzM and PhzS, it is expected that externally added PCA would be transformed to PYO, only if PCA has access to the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a05A). Both biosensors (PA14 \u0394phz1,2\u2010MS and KT2440\u2010MS) converted externally added PCA (40\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u20101) to about 8\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u20101 PYO after 3\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a06A). Less than 2\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u20101 PYO was detected in an in\u00a0vitro PCA reduction assay using just the supernatant of the biosensor culture, which had been induced but was never supplied with PCA.

PYO has been shown to activate the constitutively expressed transcription factor SoxR by a reversible one\u2010electron oxidation of its [2Fe\u20102S] cluster (Dietrich et\u00a0al., 2006; Sheplock et\u00a0al., 2013; Tschirhart et\u00a0al., 2017). This activation in P. aeruginosa induces the expression of proteins including the MexGHI\u2010OpmD efflux pump operon, which likely is involved in phenazine export (Palma et\u00a0al., 2005). We constructed the promoter of this operon (pMexG) from PA14, which preceded a gfp reporter gene in a plasmid and transformed it to PA14 \u0394phz1,2 and KT2440 to generate biosensors (PA14 \u0394phz1,2\u2010pMexG Gfp and KT2440\u2010pMexG Gfp) in which the respective native SoxR can serve as a redox\u2010sensing regulator for gfp expression (Fig.\u00a05B).", "Biosensors induced with PYO showed more Gfp fluorescence as compared to the un\u2010induced or those induced with PCA (Fig.\u00a06B). Un\u2010induced biosensors, however, showed some fluorescence (Figs\u00a06B and 7), which might be a result of superoxide ions generated during aerobic growth, which are able to activate SoxR although such oxidation is less effective in P. aeruginosa (Fujikawa et\u00a0al., 2012). Inability of PCA to yield significant fluorescence compared to the un\u2010induced biosensor could be a result of its low redox potential, since SoxR is only activated by phenazines of high redox potential (Sheplock et\u00a0al.,\n2013; Sakhtah et\u00a0al., 2016). Although SoxR in P. aeruginosa and P. putida have a similar DNA binding domain (Park et\u00a0al., 2006; Sheplock et\u00a0al., 2013), the PYO\u2010induced KT2440 biosensor shows a comparatively lower fluorescence in respect to its PA14 counterpart. This may be due to the fact that KT2440 SoxR was unable to completely activate the pMexG promoter, since the respective operon is not part of its native target regulon (Park et\u00a0al., 2006).", "Fig. 7Microscopy images of the parent and biosensor strains for evaluating phenazine cytoplasmic access.
