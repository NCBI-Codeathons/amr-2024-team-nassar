["RESULTS", "Strain development with a crude extract containing fumonisins", "Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae is highly suited as a host for heterologous gene expression and for monitoring the toxicity of various substances on agar media or in liquid culture on microtiter plates. Yet, S. cerevisiae is highly resistant to many compounds, including FB1. To save costly pure FB1 during our initial characterization and strain improvement, we used a crude extract containing fumonisins, which was prepared from maize cultures inoculated with various Fusarium strains (see Materials and Methods), with an FB1 content of 3,180 mg/L as determined by LC-MS/MS. Based on this concentration value, the \u201cwild-type\u201d laboratory strain YPH500 (see Table 1 for relevant genotype and reference) tolerated more than 1,000 \u00b5M on rich medium (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose, YPD) (Fig. 1A and C) and more than 300 \u00b5M on synthetic complete (SC) medium (Fig. 1B and D). As it has been reported that the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter YOR1 (Yeast Oligomycin Resistance) is involved in fumonisin resistance (27), we generated and tested strains that combined yor1 with mutations of other ABC transporters that were implicated in mediating resistance to charged compounds (28). We generated all double mutants and the triple mutant with the genes SNQ2 (Sensitivity to 4-NitroQuinoline-N-oxide) and PDR12 (Pleiotropic Drug Resistance), and continued strain improvement with the triple mutant YRU74 (see Table 1 for strain genotypes). This strain had reduced FB1 resistance both on YPD and SC medium compared to wild-type on solid agar plates (Fig. 1A and B). We also tested growth in liquid media in microtiter plates, and here (Fig. 1C and D) resistance was lower.", "FIG 1Growth inhibition of yeast by a crude fumonisin-containing extract (\u201ccrude FB1\u201d) on solid and in liquid media.

It has been reported that such a mutant had 3\u20134\u00d7 reduced ceramide synthase activity and reduced resistance to FB1 (29). We have furthermore knocked out LCB3, encoding one of the two long-chain base-1-phosphate phosphatases (paralog YSR3), which are needed for the utilization of exogenous long-chain base phosphates present in rich medium. The cka2 lcb3 double mutant YRU94 initially segregated small and large colonies upon revival from \u221280\u00b0C stocks, so a stable respiration-competent clone was selected on YPG, which also formed stable red colonies on YPD, indicating an unimpaired respiration needed for accumulation of the red pigment in adenine-requiring ade2 mutants. Transformation markers (LEU2 and URA3) were removed from this strain, designated as YRU94*, using plasmid pOS4a (ADE2 GAL1-Cre), resulting in YRU94ML-A (ura\u2212 and leu\u2212 but still ADE+). After the loss of the pOS4a plasmid, the strain YRU94ML was obtained, which clearly exhibited an over fivefold increase in sensitivity toward FB1 as compared to the yor1 snq2 pdr12 parental strain (Fig. 1C).", "To further reduce FB1 resistance, we also disrupted VPS51 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting), a gene encoding a component of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein complex. Endosome-to-Golgi retrograde vesicular transport allows recycling of complex sphingolipids (30), which would otherwise be degraded using the default pathway in the vacuole. The reduced sensitivity of the strain with the additional vps51 mutation to FB1 is evident from Fig. 1C (strain grown in liquid YPD) and in the spotting experiment with purified FB1 (Fig. 2), where strain YTKT33 (yor1 snq2 pdr12 cka2 lcb3 vps51) is more sensitive than its precursor YRU94ML with wild-type VPS51 both in YPD liquid culture (Fig. 2C) and on YPD plates (Fig. 2A).", "FIG 2Sensitivity testing with pure FB1.

Compared to Fig. 1, in which only crude fumonisin extracts were used, it is evident in Fig. 2 that higher levels of the pure toxin are needed to achieve a similar degree of inhibition. One obvious explanation is that the crude extract contains other intermediates of FB1 synthesis, such as fumonisins B2 (FB2), B3 (FB3), and B4 (FB4), and possibly additionally other forms, such as non-toxic forms (e.g., N-acetylated fumonisin A), that might be hydrolyzed and reactivated by the yeast. Yet, no fumonisin A metabolites were detected by LC-MS/MS in the crude extract, and later results (see below) indicate that the response to FB2, FB3, and FB4 was similar to FB1 (see Fig. 4).", "The different behavior of the mutants in the two media is also of interest. While on SC medium, YRU94ML behaved similar to YTKT33 (Fig. 2B and D), on the rich medium, the latter strain was far more susceptible, indicating that components (sphingolipid metabolites not present in SC medium but presumably in the yeast extract in YPD) could reduce fumonisin toxicity in a VPS51-dependent manner.", "Dose-response of strain YTKT33 to B-type fumonisins in liquid synthetic medium", "To determine the inhibition characteristics of different B-type fumonisins [which differ in the hydroxylation pattern; for review, see reference (31)], we obtained high-purity FB1, FB2, FB3, and FB4 and tested their potency to inhibit the growth of yeast strain YTKT33 in liquid SC medium in microtiter plates. The inhibition of strain YTKT33 upon exposure to fumonisins B2, B3, and B4 was similar to the inhibition by FB1 (see Fig. 3).", "FIG 3Growth inhibition of YTKT33 in microtiter plates in SC medium by B-type fumonisins FB1-FB4.

The relative composition of the different compounds in the extract can be variable depending on the Fusarium strain and harvesting time, but due to the similar dose-response, the toxicity reflects the sum of all B-type fumonisins. The inhibitory concentrations for YTKT33 obtained in liquid SC culture (in microtiter plates with limited aeration in still cultures) were clearly higher than the inhibitory concentrations observed for the empty vector transformant in spottings carried out on solid synthetic complete media lacking uracil (SC-URA, see Fig. 4).", "FIG 4Growth of YTKT33-derived strains on URA-dropout SC agar media containing increasing concentrations of FB1 carrying either the empty expression vector pYes2-PTEF1 (negative control) or expressing one of the following genes: FUM18 (ceramide synthase from the F. verticillioides fumonisin cluster, positive control), FumD (Sphingopyxis fumonisin carboxylesterase FumD), FumD_noL (FumD lacking the N-terminal secretion signal), and AspAmOx (Aspergillus amine oxidase).

Three dilutions of the transformed YTKT33 strain were spotted for each culture (OD600 = 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001).", "Heterologous expression of fumonisin detoxification genes", "Strain YTKT33 is growing slower than the YPH500 precursor strain. Alterations in sphingolipids have been reported to negatively affect heat shock resistance (32). However, YTKT33 is robust and easily transformable with the standard lithium transformation protocol, which includes a heat shock treatment. We utilized the strain as a host to express candidate fumonisin resistance genes. The empty vector pYes2-PTEF1 was used in a previous study to express candidate ceramide synthases from a fumonisin-producing F. verticillioides strains behind the constitutive TEF1 promoter (33). In the aforementioned study, evidence was provided that the FvFUM18 gene, located in the fumonisin biosynthetic cluster, codes for an insensitive ceramide synthase providing fumonisin self-resistance (33). The empty vector and the FUM18 expression vector were used as negative and positive controls in our study. As evident from Fig. 4, the lowest tested fully inhibitory concentration is clearly below 5 \u00b5M FB1, at approx. 2.5 \u00b5M FB1, which is about 10-fold lower than the IC50 in liquid SC medium in microtiter plates. Plasmid-based expression of FUM18 in YTKT33 results in an approximately fourfold increase in resistance, up to 10 \u00b5M FB1.", "In addition, we expressed two enzymes altering the chemical structures of fumonisin B1, leading to its detoxification. First, we expressed the Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida MTA144 fumD gene (34), which encodes a periplasmic secreted carboxylesterase that removes the tricarballylic acid side chains of fumonisins and leads to the less toxic metabolite HFB1 (34). We have constructed two different fumD expression vectors, with and without the N-terminal secretion signal. While complete fumD expression also leads to a low increase in resistance phenotype, the strain lacking the signal peptide (fumD_noL) exhibits high-level FB1 resistance (see Fig. 4). Previously, another detoxification gene from Aspergillus, encoding a flavine-dependent amine oxidase, had been described (35, 36). This enzyme converts the amino group of fumonisins into a keto group. We have custom-synthesized the amine oxidase gene with an identical sequence as previously reported (35) and cloned it behind the TEF1 promoter. The expression of this gene (without the 6xHis epitope tag in Fig. 4) also led to increased fumonisin B1 resistance, although at a lower level than YTKT33 expressing fumD_noL. In summary, these results show that the engineered yeast strain is a useful tool to validate candidate genes.", "The strain YTKT33 was also used in other applications, for instance, in the classical agar diffusion assay. When seeded into the top agar, application of a crude fungal extract containing FB1 applied to the plate (on a paper disc) produced a clear inhibition zone. As shown in Fig. 5, application of a detoxification enzyme (the commercial product FUMzyme) (37) next to the toxin-containing disc resulted in a diminished and deformed halo as the enzyme diffused into the inhibition zone and inactivated the toxin.", "FIG 5One hundred microliters of YTKT33 (OD600 = 0.3) was embedded in SC top agar after equilibration at 48\u00b0C and left at room temperature to solidify on SC media (bottom agar).
