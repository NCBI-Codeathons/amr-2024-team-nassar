["RESULTS", "Streptomyces lunaelactis produces ferroverdins and bagremycins.", "Strains of Streptomyces lunaelactis, including type strain MM109T, were previously isolated from cave moonmilk deposits (25\u201327). Strain MM109T produces a green pigment whose presence was attributed to the biosynthesis of ferroverdin A (25), a homotrimer of p-vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate (p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA) complexed with one ferrous ion (18, 19). To assess the metabolomic response of S. lunaelactis, including the conditions under which ferroverdin A is produced, strain MM109T was grown under different culture conditions. For this assessment, disc diffusion assays were performed in the presence of a range of different metals.", "The results revealed that only the addition of the ferric iron salt FeCl3 (as well as the addition of ferrous iron FeSO4; data not shown) triggered production of the green pigmented ferroverdin A by S. lunaelactis MM109T (Fig.\u00a02A). Production of ferroverdin A (structure 1 in Fig.\u00a01; see also Fig.\u00a02C) was triggered at a FeCl3 concentration as low as 0.01\u2009mM (Fig.\u00a02B). Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis of extracts of strain MM109T identified an ion peak of m/z 876.11 [M-], corresponding to ferroverdin B (structure 2 in Fig.\u00a01), and a distinct ion peak of m/z 904.11 [M-] corresponding to ferroverdin C (structure 3 in Fig.\u00a01). Ferroverdin B and ferroverdin C heterotrimers differ from ferroverdin A in only one of the three ligands used to complex ferrous iron, namely, hydroxy-p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA for ferroverdin B and carboxy-p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA for ferroverdin C (Fig.\u00a01).", "FIG\u00a02Production of ferroverdins by S. lunaelactis MM109T.

Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) performed on 15 independently isolated S. lunaelactis strains grouped them into different clusters (Fig.\u00a04A), and one representative of each cluster was investigated for the production of bagremycins and ferroverdins. The crude extracts of the selected eight different representative strains (MM25, MM31, MM37, MM40, MM83, MM91, MM109, and MM113) were analyzed by HPLC, which revealed that all strains except strain MM91 were able to produce at least one bagremycin and one ferroverdin (Fig.\u00a04B).

A total of 37 BGCs were identified, specifically, 36 BGCs on the linear chromosome and 1 additional BGC on linear plasmid pSLUN1 (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). BGC 12 (from S. lunaelactis 21350 [SLUN_21350] to SLUN_21430 [28]) exhibits strong gene synteny with the bagremycin BGC from Streptomyces sp. T\u00fc 4128 (30, 31), with high similarity between the predicted gene products (coverage, 99%; average identity, 86.2%; average similarity, 91.9%) (Fig.\u00a05A) (Table\u00a01). Surprisingly, BGC 12 displayed similarly strong gene synteny and high similarity between its gene products and those seen with the fev cluster (GenBank accession no. AB689797) of the ferroverdin producer Streptomyces sp. WK-5344 (coverage, 99%; average identity, 85.8%; average similarity, 91.3%) (Fig.\u00a05A) (Table\u00a01). The levels of identity between the proposed fev cluster of Streptomyces sp. WK-5344 and the bag cluster of Streptomyces sp. T\u00fc 4128 were even greater, with (on average) 96% amino acid (aa) identity and 97.4% similarity (Fig.\u00a05A) (Table\u00a01). The exceptionally high levels of average amino acid identity suggest that biosynthesis of bagremycins and biosynthesis of ferroverdins might be mediated by the same BGC. This conjecture was further supported by the results of comparative analysis of the BGCs involved in the production of other amino/nitroso-aromatic metabolites, i.e., the nsp gene cluster for biosynthesis of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzamide in Streptomyces murayamaensis (32) and the gri gene cluster involved in grixazone production in Streptomyces griseus (33). The nsp and gri clusters share seven homologous genes with those identified in the bag/fev cluster (Fig.\u00a05A) (Table\u00a01), specifically, those encoding (i) the Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP)-family transcriptional activators (BagI, FevR, NspR, and GriR), (ii) the LuxR-family transcription regulators (BagY, FevT, NspT, and GriT), (iii) the 3,4-AHBA synthases (BagC, FevH, NspH, and GriH), (iv) the DhnA-type aldolase (BagB, FevI, NspI, and GriI), (v) the o-aminophenol oxidases (BagH, FevF, NspF, and GriF), (vi) the copper chaperones (BagZ, FevE, NspE, and GriE), and (vii) the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxygenases (BagK/G.

Introduction of plasmid pBDF028 into spores of MM109T allowed isolation of thiostreptone-resistant clones in which occurred a single recombination event corresponding to a 791-bp internal fragment of SLUN_21380 (fevR/bagI). The single-crossover event resulted in a duplication of fevR, with the first copy lacking the last 86\u2009nt, resulting in a truncated FevR protein, and the second copy lacking the promoter region and the first 116\u2009nt.

Strain \u03a9fevR displayed loss of the ferroverdin-associated green pigmentation under conditions of growth on iron-supplemented R2YE medium. HPLC analysis of the crude extracts of strain \u03a9fevR confirmed the absence of ferroverdins and bagremycins (Fig.\u00a06E). These data suggest that FevR/BagI is indeed the pathway-specific activator for the BGC, and this interpretation was further supported by the observation that introduction of an additional copy of fevR/bagI into S. lunaelactis MM109T resulted in increased production of both ferroverdins and bagremycins (Fig.\u00a06E). Finally, complementation of \u03a9fevR (strain MM109BD3; Table\u00a02) by the low-copy-number plasmid harboring an intact copy of fevR with its own promoter allowed restoration of production of both ferroverdin and bagremycin (not shown).", "Plasmids and strains used in this studya", "Plasmids and strains Description Source orreference(s).", "Plasmids.", "pJET1.2/blunt E. coli plasmid used for high-efficiency blunt-end cloning of PCR products (Ampr) Thermo Scientific.", "pBDF019 pJET1.2 derivative containing the slun21380 gene (fevR) and its upstream (217-bp) and downstream (360-bp) regions (Ampr) This study.", "pSET152 Integrative vector transmissible by conjugation from E. coli to Streptomyces spp. [lacZ\u03b1,\nori (pUC18), aac(3)IV (Aprar), oriT (RK2), attP (\u00d8C31), int (\u00d8C31)] 42.", "pBDF021 pSET152 derivative containing the insertion of pBDF019 cloned in EcoRI and XbaI sites (Aprar) This study.", "pBDF027 pJET1.2 derivative containing an internal fragment (791 bp amplified with fevR+118f_XbaI and fevR+909r_PstI primers) of the slun21380 (fevR) coding sequence (Ampr) This study.", "pSET151 Nonreplicating plasmid in Streptomyces spp. [lacZ\u03b1, oriT (RK2), xylE, tsr (Thior), bla (Ampr),\nori (pUC19)] 42, 43.", "pBDF028 pSET151 derivative containing the insertion of pBDF027 cloned in XbaI and PstI sites (Ampr, Thior) This study.", "pUZ8002 Nontransmissible plasmid supplying transfer functions for mobilization of oriT-containing vectors from E. coli to Streptomyces spp. (Kanr) 41.", "pAU3-45 pSET152 derivative with a thiostrepton resistance gene inserted into the blunted NheI restriction site [lacZ\u03b1, ori (pUC18), aac(3)IV (Aprar), oriT (RK2), attP (\u00d8C31), int (\u00d8C31),\ntsr (Thior)] 44.", "pBDF029 pBDF022 derivative containing the apramycin resistance cassette from pIJ773 cloned in PstI and HindIII sites (Thior, Ampr, Aprar) This study.", "pIJ773 pBluescript II SK(+)-based plasmid containing the apramycin resistance cassette [oriT (RK2) + aac(3)IV (Aprar)] flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) recombination sites 43.", "pBDF022 pHJL401 derivative containing the insert of pBDF019 cloned in EcoRI and XbaI sites (Thior, Ampr) This study.", "pHJL401 Intermediate-copy-number (\u223c10 copies) vector in Streptomyces spp. [lacZ\u03b1, ori (pUC19),\nori (SCP2), tsr (Thior), bla (Ampr)] 42.", ".", "Strains.", "E. coli DH5\u03b1 General cloning host Gibco-BRL.", "E. coli ET12567 Nonmethylating (dam, dcm, hsdS null mutants) host for transfer of plasmid DNA into Streptomyces spp., used together with pUZ8002 (Cmlr, Tetr) 45.", "Streptomyces lunaelactis MM109T Wild-type and reference strain of Streptomyces lunaelactis 25.", "Streptomyces lunaelactis MM91 Wild-type strain Streptomyces lunaelactis MM91 26.", "Streptomyces lunaelactis MM109BD1 (\u03a9fevR) MM109 derivative with pBDF028 inserted to disrupt gene slun21380 (fevR) (Thior) This study.", "Streptomyces lunaelactis MM109BD2 (fevR+) MM109T derivative with pBDF021 inserted to add an additional copy of slun21380 (fevR) controlled by its native promoter (Aprar) This study.", "Streptomyces lunaelactis MM109BD3 Complementation of strain MM109BD1 (\u03a9fevR) with pBDF029 (Thior, Aprar) This study.", "Ampr, ampicillin resistance; lacZ\u03b1, LacZ galactosidase alpha subunit coding sequence; ori (pUC18/pUC19), origin of replication of the pUC18/pUC19 plasmid (E. coli); aac(\n3)IV, apramycin resistance marker; Aprar, apramycin resistance; oriT (RK2), origin of conjugative transfer from plasmid RK2; attP (\u00d8C31), phage attachment site of the \u00d8C31 integrase [= int (\u00d8C31)]; xylE, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (reporter gene); tsr, thiostrepton resistance gene; Thior, thiostrepton resistance; bla, ampicillin resistance gene; dam, dcm, hsdS, genotype of methylase-deficient E. coli strain; Cmlr, chloramphenicol resistance; Tetr, tetracycline resistance.", "Iron is required for production of p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA but its presence not mandatory for bagremycin biosynthesis.", "If ferroverdins are detected only when iron is supplied in the cultivation media, a key issue that remains unaddressed is whether iron is required only for complexation of the p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA monomers (and/or the other monomers required for ferroverdin B and C) or whether iron is necessary for the synthesis of p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA, the monomer of ferroverdins. An HPLC chromatogram of extracts of S. lunaelactis MM109T grown on R2YE and R2YE supplied with 1\u2009mM FeCl3 revealed the presence of the p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA monomer only when strain MM109T was grown under conditions of high levels of iron (Fig.\u00a07A). HPLC fractionation and subsequent UPLC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of a molecular ion species that corresponded to p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA (m/z 268.06 [M-]) (Fig.\u00a07B and C). Instead, bagremycins were detected under both sets of conditions (Fig.\u00a0S2), suggesting that, in contrast to the results seen with p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA, iron overload is not mandatory for their biosynthesis. Thus, iron is not only required for complexation of the three p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA ligands with ferrous ion and for generation of ferroverdin A but is also necessary for their biosynthesis.", "FIG\u00a07Iron supply is mandatory for production of p-vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate.
