["2. Results and Discussion", "2.1. Assessment of Antibiotic Resistance", "The MIC for 9 antibiotics was performed for three strains, KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002, and the reference strain Alicyclobacillus fastidiosus DSM 17978. The antibiotics chosen were based on their diverse mechanisms of action belonging to different classes, such as aminoglycosides (kanamycin, streptomycin, gentamycin), macrolides (erythromycin), chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and clindamycin, which inhibit protein synthesis, as well as \u03b2-lactams (ampicillin) and glycopeptides (vancomycin), which inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan in Gram (+) bacteria. The assumption was made that the strains should be considered resistant if MICs were >256 \u03bcg/mL and sensitive if MICs were <8 \u03bcg/mL.", "The profiles of antibiotic resistance for examined strains of Alicyclobacillus spp. were very similar to each other. All four strains exhibited significant susceptibility to ampicillin, gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and vancomycin (all values < 1 \u03bcg/mL). However, all strains displayed high resistance (256 \u03bcg/mL) to erythromycin; even at the maximum applied concentration, no inhibition of the growth of the examined Alicyclobacillus strains was observed. The MIC values with the lowest concentration (\u03bcg/mL) of an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of a given strain of bacteria are presented in Table 1. These results suggest that Alicyclobacillus spp. strains are generally susceptible to a broad spectrum of antibiotics commonly used in clinical and laboratory settings.", "A highly important aspect of AR in the environment is that the ecosystem is a complex structure, and the usage of antibiotics in agriculture or horticulture may lead to the dissemination of AR genes. Using animal fertilizers or manure, with possible antibiotic-resistant intestinal bacteria, may result in the introduction of antibiotic resistance genes into the soil, which has the potential for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Similarly, using recirculated water for irrigation may lead to exposure of soil microorganisms to pharmaceuticals. Exposure of soil to macrolide antibiotics increases the relative abundance of numerous gene targets associated with resistance to macrolides and other antibiotics, as well as mobile genetic elements. This occurred at an exposure dose that was unrealistically high but did not occur at the lower, more realistic exposure dose [33]. Georgakakos et al., 2023 [34] suggested that erythromycin is more mobile in the environment when introduced with manure, which is likely the largest source of agriculturally sourced environmental antibiotics. And since it is particularly resistant to natural environmental degradation, it can increase the influence on the microbial communities within it.", "2.2. Genome Characteristics", "Strain KKP 3000 consists of a single chromosome with a length of 4,859,599 bp and a GC content of 52.95% (Table 2). The WGS of strains KKP 3001 and KKP 3002 consists of a chromosome and two plasmids. In greater detail, the chromosome length of KKP 3001 is 4,972,367 bp, and that of KKP 3002 is 4,977,437 bp. The GC content of the chromosomes is 53 and 52.92%, respectively. Strains KKP 3001 and KKP 3002 each carry two plasmids with a size of 30,081 and 11,548 bp, respectively. The chromosome and plasmid maps of the strains are presented in Figure 1.", "One CRISPR array was identified in each of the strains: KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002 (Table 2, Figure 1). Concerning transposable elements, 52 IS were identified in the genome of KKP 3000 and 14 in the genome of the two other strains (Table S1). Furthermore, 5 incomplete prophages were annotated for KKP 3000 and 7 for KKP 3001 and KKP 3002 (Table S2). AlienHunter was used to pinpoint regions containing mobile elements. To this end, 121, 97, and 98 regions were identified in the genome of KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002, respectively. Accordingly, 76 elements related to mobile element transfer, replication, and integration were identified by mobileOG in the genome of KKP 3000 and 92 in the chromosome of KKP 3001 and of KKP 3002 (Tables S3\u2013S5). Five strict hits (<70% identity) for transferable antibiotic resistance genes were found in the genome of the strains, as shown in Table S6. Specifically, all three strains code for qacG, FosBx1, VanT, and VanW, which may confer resistance to disinfectant agents and antiseptics, as well as glycopeptides and Fosfomycin (Table S6). QacG protein acts as a proton-dependent efflux, and FosBx1 is an Mn+ dependent fosfomycin thiol transferase. The VanT is a membrane-bound serine racemase that converts L-Ser to D-Ser, resulting in D-Ser being used for peptidoglycan synthesis. The VanW protein is possibly involved in antibiotic target alteration, but its mode of action is unknown. In all three analyzed strains downstream of the vanT gene, are three genes encoding alanine dehydrogenase, dipeptidase, and permease, which strongly resemble parts of van resistance operons found in other bacteria [35]. The CARD database confirmed the alanine dehydrogenase gene as a distant analog of VanH in the vanF cluster; the dipeptidase gene found downstream vanT gene in analyzed strains does not show any resemblance to known vanX genes that encode dipeptidase in vancomycin resistance operons. Additionally, the permease gene mentioned above does not show any resemblance to any known van genes. The region encoding part of the putative van operon is limited by IS21 upstream and by IS110 downstream and is not functional. Downstream IS110, there are two genes, a sensor histidine kinase and an OmpR superfamily response regulator transcription factor, which functionally resemble vanS and vanR genes, respectively. At the protein sequence level, the response regulator shows significant similarity to VanR and the kinase to VanS in various clusters. The same two genes were identified in direct proximity to the putative vanW gene. It is possible the described genes were parts of the functional van operon, which was transferred and disrupted by transposition events. Evidence for the acquisition of these genes through HGT were provided by AlienHunter. Of note, the same HGT region contains the gene fosBx1. According to CARD, this gene is chromosomally encoded in Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., while mobile fosfomycin resistance genes have been identified in the genomes of clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae, including members of the Escherichia and Salmonella species [36]. Furthermore, genes coding for ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase A (RsmA) that could confer resistance to erythromycin were identified in the genome of the three strains (KFAPOJEI_01910, PKEAFELD_04479, PLKKBLCC_04475), that were not correlated with mobile or transposable elements. To further investigate the origins of these genes, an unrooted tree of homologous proteins was constructed. As shown in Figure 2, proteins encoded by Alicyclobacillus spp. are clustered together possibly indicating that genes are intrinsic and not acquired through HGT, or that they were acquired through a common ancestor in the past. Gene rsmA is homologous to ermC encoded by Bacillus spp. The Erm family of adenine-N(6) methyltransferases confer resistance to macrolide\u2013lincosamide\u2013streptogramin B antibiotics via alteration of their target, as they are responsible for the demethylation of the adenine residue at position 2085 in 23S rRNA interfering with the antibiotic binding [37].", "2.3. Functional Annotation", "The annotated proteins of the three strains were categorized into 19 COGs. As shown in Table 3, the most represented COG in all three strains is amino acid metabolism and transport (class E), followed by transcription (class K) and carbohydrate metabolism and transport (class G).", "Accordingly, annotated proteins were categorized into KEGG functional categories and pathways (Figure 3). The most represented category in all three strains is carbohydrate metabolism, followed by amino acid metabolism and genetic information processing. No significant differences in the distribution of proteins into these categories were noted for the three novel strains.", "The genome of the strains was searched for genes involved in spore formation, germination, flagellar assembly, and chemotaxis using annotation algorithms and KEGG modules. The annotated genes are comprehensibly presented in Table 4. In greater detail, 27 genes involved in various processes of sporulation and germination were annotated in the genome of the Alicyclobacillus KKP 3000 and KKP 3001 strains. Of note, KKP 3002 does not code for germination protease gpr (Table 4). Furthermore, 41 genes related to flagellar assembly were identified. However, as illustrated by KEGG Mapper (Figure 4), the strains do not code for proteins involved in the formation of the H and T ring, while also missing some important regulatory proteins. On the other hand, the strains code for a full module for bacterial chemotaxis. In this context, flagellar production and swarming behavior were previously recorded for A. acidoterrestris and was dependent on pH conditions. Of note, these phenotypes were abolished in low pH, and cells were organized into biofilms to maximize survival [38]. For bacteria, an important adaptive element is the ability to be motile. According to Shemesh et al. [37] bacteria in heterogeneous environments can develop antibiotic resistance faster than bacteria living in homogeneous environments. Since the Alicyclobacillus spp. is a species highly correlated with food, it is presumed that motility can facilitate spreading onto surfaces to make nutrients more accessible. Thus, future studies will focus on the investigation of flagellar production and biofilm formation capacity to decipher the ability of the three strains to withstand unfavorable environmental conditions.", "2.4. Vdc Operons", "All analyzed Alicyclobacillus strains, KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002 have the ability to produce guaiacol [11]. To this end, proteins associated with the guaiacol production from vanillin were annotated in the chromosomes of the three strains (Table S7). The metabolic pathway for the production of guaiacol from vanillin involves two consecutive enzymatic reactions; the transformation of vanillin to vanillic acid performed by vanillin dehydrogenase, and of vanillic acid to guaiacol by vanillic acid decarboxylase [39]. Local blastp was performed to determine the presence of the genes involved in these enzymatic reactions. All three strains possess the gene coding for benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in the first step of the transformation (44% sequence identity and 66% positive substitutions). Accordingly, the strains code for phenolic acid decarboxylase, which is involved in the last step of guaiacol production, with higher sequence identity (78%), and 91% positive substitutions (Table S7). The nucleotide sequences of known A. acidoterrestris vdc clusters [11] were compared to genomic sequences of strains, KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002. A. acidoterrestris is linked to off-odor production in fruit juices, mainly attributed to guaiacol production in the beverage matrix [39]. The complete vdc operon consists of three structural genes, vdcB, vdcC, and vdcD, encoding subunits of non-oxidative vanillic acid decarboxylase Vdc, and a regulator gene vdcR, which is located upstream of the structural genes and orientated in the opposite direction [40]. The four regions in each of their genomes related to guaiacol production were found. However, three of them are incomplete or rearranged, probably due to transpositional events. The location and composition of vdc regions in all novel strains are similar, especially between KKP 3001 and KKP 3002. To obtain a more complete picture of the vdc regions of Alicyclobacillus, we also searched for similar regions in complete genome sequences known as guaiacol producers, A. acidoterrestris DSM 3922 and A. dauci DSM 28700, as well as non-guaiacol producing A. fastidiosus DSM 17978 and A. acidocaldarius DSM 446. Both guaiacol-producing species carry one complete vdc operon in their genomes. We have not found sequences of significant similarity to the vdc region in the A. acidocaldarius DSM446 genome. A. fastidiosus DSM 17978 carries three vdc-related regions, although one of them is incomplete, and two others are arranged in a different order than in guaiacol-producing species, which probably is the cause for this strain of A. fastidiosus not producing guaiacol. The arrangement of vdc-related regions in all analyzed species is shown in Figure 5.", "As mentioned above, all novel species share significant similarities regarding locations and composition of vdc regions in their genomes. This similarity is particularly evident between KKP 3001 and KKP 3002. Sequence comparison of VdcB, VdcC, VdcD, and VdcR proteins show a higher level of similarity between respective Vdc proteins of particular regions of KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002 than intragenomically, which suggests that divergence of those strains may have occurred later than the duplication of the vdc genes. Phylograms based on Vdc proteins sequence alignment are shown in Figure 6.", "2.5. ANI, and Phylogenomic Analysis", "ANI (Average Nucleotide Identity) analysis between members of the Alicyclobacillus spp. and the three novel strains showed that strains KKP 3000, KKP 3001, and KKP 3002 share very high genome similarity (>99%). However, the three strains do not present high ANI with other known Alicyclobacillus species. Moreover, the phylogenomic analysis exhibited that the three strains cluster together in a distinct phylogenetic clade, that is closely related to A. fastidiosus (Figure 7). The ANI between the three novel strains and members of the A. fastiodiosus species was recorded to be 88%, lower than the species cut-off (>96%) (Figure 7). Furthermore, a comparative genetic analysis between the three strains and the type strain A. fastidiosus DSM 17978 with BRIG showed distinct genomic differences (Figure 8). Indeed, several regions in the genome of strain DSM 17978 show very low sequence identity (<50%) to the genomic regions of the three novel strains. Based on these findings, further phylogenomic analysis will be pursued to elucidate the taxonomy of the three novel strains."]
