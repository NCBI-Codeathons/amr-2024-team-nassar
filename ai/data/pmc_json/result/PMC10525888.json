["3. Results", "3.1. Results on Anti-Leishmanial Potential", "Anti-leishmanial activities of the cell-free conditioned media (CFCM) of three species of the entomopathogenic\u2013nematode\u2013symbiont bacterium genus Xenorhabdus, X. budapestensis sp. nov (Lengyel) DSM16342 (T); X. szentirmaii sp. nov. (Lengyel) DSM16338 (T) and; X. innexii sp. nov., (Lengyel) DSM16336 (T), termed EMA, EMC, and EMK, respectively, were determined and compared with antibacterial and antifungal potential. Each of the three (EMA, EMC, and EMK) examined CFCM showed significant anti-leishmanial activities, but EMA and EMC exerted stronger anti-microbial potential in general than EMK. Data are summarized in Table 1.", "Each of the three CFCMs strongly antagonized each of the tested clinical isolates of Gram-positive (methicillin-sensitive (MSSA), and -resistant (MRSA) St. aureus) and Gram-negative (F. novicida, E. coli, S. typhimurium, as well as P. aeruginosa) bacteria and a clinical isolate of C. albicans (Table 1).", "As for the molecular sizes of the active natural fractions of the CFCM, interestingly, the anti-microbial activity against all microbes was retained in different size fractions of EMA (below 3 kDa) and EMC (above 3 kDa), indicating differences in the sizes of the active compounds in the different CFCMs. Autoclaved CFCM samples of EMA and EMC were as active as the native ones. As for EMK, only native CFCM samples were tested. The results demonstrated the thermostability of the active components in CFCM of EMA and EMC since autoclaving these samples did not affect the anti-microbial activity against any of the organisms. Interestingly, the anti-microbial activity of EMC, but not EMC, was susceptible to proteinase K (OK) inactivation. This suggests that the active compound (s) in EMC are proteinaceous, whereas in EMK, they are not. None of the CFCMs were toxic to J774 macrophages under the conditions in our study.", "3.2. Antimicrobial Potential of EPB CFCM on the Prokaryotic and the Eukaryotic Partner of the H. meleagridis/E. coli Monoxenic Culture", "Each CFCM was tested on H. meleagridis cells, which (as discovered by [26]) can in vitro be cultured as monoxenic culture with E. coli DH5\u03b1 cells, only. Consequently, the anti-Gram-negative bacterial activities were also determined.", "Antibacterial Potential of EPB CFCM on the Prokararyotic Partner", "To see if the NR-AMP molecules were produced by strong AMP-producing EPB species, the anti-histomonal potential CFCMs from four different cultures were compared.", "The Photorhabdus data are presented in Figure 1 (effects on Histomonas) and Table 2 (effects on Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1) cells. The results indicated that there is no difference between the anti-microbial/anti-histomonal potential of the colony color variants, as both exerted equally strong effects on both partners of the monoxenic culture. In the cultures supplemented with either the red or the yellow colony color variants of TT01, CFCM, the cell propagation ceased, and the Histomonas cells\u2014earlier or later\u2014died.", "From Figure 1 and Table 2, we concluded that the tested CFCM of each of the two colony-color variants of the EPB P. luminescence exerted cytotoxic activity not only on the prokaryotic (E. coli DH5\u03b1) but also on the eukaryotic H. meleagridis Turkey/Austria/2922-C6/0 pathogen as well. Although thie experimental was set up was scheduled for trying to distinguish between the reasons for the death of the CFCM-treated Histomonas cells: whether they died by direct anti-protozoal effects of the EPB-released (\u201dCFCM-born\u201d) AMPs, or by the indirect consequences of the death of their mutualistic prokaryote partner E. coli DH5@ cells, these experimental results does not allow to take this kind of distintion.", "The growth curve of the monoxenic culture from the non-supplemented (that is, only FKS-containing M199) control media (green) could be characterized as performing a perfect log phase after a moderate growth period. It starts at 24 h and reaches a peak between 48 and 72 h, after which it declines. The growth curve of the monoxenic culture grown in the \u201ccompletely supplemented\u201d M199 control media (blue) can be characterized by a log phase that starts right after the start of incubation (at 0 h), reaches a peak at 48 h, and then rapidly declines. Each of the exogenous EPB CFCM resulted in reduced Histomonas cells. The CFCM of the red variant acted immediately, while the yellow variants acted after 24 h. Even in the latter case, the size \u201cgrowth peak\u201d at 24 h was less than half of the 4 h value of the respective control cultures. As expected, the CFCM of each colony color variant almost totally killed all the cells of the EMA and monoxenic accompanying prokaryotic species E. coli DH5 alpha (Table 2).", "3.3. Anti-Microbial Activities of the hfq(del) Mutants EMA and EMC", "We have constructed hfq-del regulatory mutants similar to those of [79] (Bode et al., 2019) from both EMA and EMC strains. The relevant publication is in preparation and the method that we elaborated as a modified version of the original one is given in Appendix A. We then bioassayed the anti-microbial activities of the respective CFCMs on several targets. We intend to apply the recently discovered and ingenious method called easyPACId [k1] to identify antiprotozoal compounds in the future, similar to the work by the Turkish team of Prof. Selcuk Hazir and his associates at Menderes University in Ankara, Turkey [83]. This technique has been discovered and elaborated by Edna Bode and her associates in Frankfurt, Germany [79]. Briefly, \u2206hfq mutants of two studied EPB bacterial species X. budapestensis and X. szentirmaii were constructed, and then, the CFCMs of the wt and hfq mutants were used to test different pathogen organisms. However, before obtaining that, we intend to forecast the limitations of the potential use of this approach. To learn how this influences the reproducibility of the method, we tested the anti-microbial potential of the hfq mutant of both EMA and EMC species, and the data are presented in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5.", "These data indicate that the extremely strong anti-Gram-positive potential of the EMA strain is likely, but probably not exclusively, under the control of the hfq-govern genetic regulation [76]. The anti-Gram-positive antibacterial potential of EMC is stronger than the anti-Gram-negative potential but, in comparison to that of the EMA, is weaker. Note that the EMC-resistant Gram-positive species are not the same as those resistant to the antimicrobials present in the CFCM of the hfq-del regulatory mutant of EMA. To see how the intraspecific variability modifies the picture, we compared the resistance/sensitivity patterns of different geographical isolations of the unambiguously EMA-sensitive Gram-positive bacterium species Paeibacillus larvae [96]. The P. larvae is a rapidly spreading deadly pathogen organism for honey bee larvae, so it is a significant pest of agricultural significance.", "These data indicate that although the P. larvae species are uniformly and unambiguously sensitive to the anti-microbial(s) present in the CFCM of the EMA wild-type strain, there is a significant intraspecific variability concerning partly the resistance//sensitivity issue to EMC-produced antimicrobials, partly resistance/sensitivity issue to the antibiotic potential of EMA hfq-del regulatory mutants. These data are of key importance when drawing our conclusion concerning the usefulness and the limitation of the potential use of the easyPACId [79] approach in our future research. These data also confirm that the extremely strong anti-Gram-positive potential of the EMA strain likely, but probably not exclusively, is under the control of the hfq-govern genetic regulation [76]. As for the anti-histomonal studies, we sum them up in the following way.", "In Figure 2, one can see the difference between the colonies of the wild type and the hfq-(the regulatory mutant of the X. szentirmaii DSM 16338 (EMC)). The spectacular physical difference is presented in the wild-type, left A, and the mutant, right B."]
