["2. Results", "2.1. Sphinganine-Analog Producing Fungal Species Are More Resistant to Fumonisin B1 Than Non-Producers", "To investigate whether the production of fumonisins or the related AAL toxin is associated with increased toxin resistance, we compared the growth of various fungal strains (see Table 1) in the presence of FB1. First, we compared the growth of a well-studied F. verticillioides strain (FGSC 7600), which had been previously utilized for elucidation of the FUM cluster and for determination of the first genome sequence [32], with the growth of the likewise relevant fumonisin-nonproducer F. graminearum (strain PH-1, [33]) at different temperatures and different levels of fumonisins added to minimal medium. Since very high concentrations were needed for full inhibition, a crude concentrated extract containing fumonisins B1, B2, and B3 was used as previously described [34], which contained 3.18 g/L FB1. Without added toxin at 20 \u00b0C, F. graminearum (red pigmented, on the right half of the plates shown in Figure 1) grew more vigorously and covered a larger portion of the medium than F. verticillioides. At 30 \u00b0C, F. verticillioides grew better, and after two weeks, both strains covered about half of the plate. When increasing amounts of fumonisin were added to the medium, F. graminearum was increasingly inhibited, while F. verticillioides continued to grow. At the highest concentration tested (176 \u00b5M FB1), growth of F. graminearum was completely inhibited, while F. verticillioides showed only marginally reduced radial growth after 7 days at 30 \u00b0C (Figure 1). We conclude that the fumonisin-producing F. verticillioides has clearly higher resistance to fumonisin than F. graminearum.", "Next, we compared various Alternaria strains (Figure 2A) producing or not producing sphinganine-analog toxins. The A. alternata f.sp. lycopersici strain AS27-12 is a well-known producer of AAL toxin and related derivatives [35]. Its resistance level was compared to two A. alternata isolates from our local university collection (Austrian Center for Biological Resources (https://acbr-database.boku.ac.at/, accessed on 21 May 2024)). The strain MA 304 was originally isolated from apple in the USA, whereas MA 308 caused leaf spot in Solanum tuberosum. Both strains do not produce AAL toxin. Already, at the low concentration of 10 \u00b5M (about 7.2 mg/L), the growth of both nonproducing strains was strongly reduced to about 20% of the diameter, while the AAL-producing strain had 78% of its diameter on the no-toxin control. At 50 \u00b5M FB1, the AAL strain had an about 50% reduced diameter, while the two nonproducer strains were almost completely inhibited.", "We also tested (Figure 2B) whether an Aspergillus niger wild-type strain, for which fumonisin production had been demonstrated (ATCC 11414, [36], see Table S1 therein), is more resistant than a wild-type A. nidulans strain (FGSC A4, [37]). F. verticillioides was added on top of the plates as a control (Figure 2B). At 10 \u00b5M FB1, the A. nidulans strains were already fully inhibited, while A. niger was only slightly inhibited (compared to no toxin 86% diameter at 10 \u00b5M and 66% at 50 \u00b5M). Seemingly, a mechanism of protection exists in sphinganine-analog toxin producers. We set out to test whether target insensitivity is involved.", "2.2. Generation and Characterization of a fum17-18 Deletion Strain in a fum1 Background", "To be able to study the effects of added toxin undisturbed by endogenously synthesized fumonisin, we generated a fum17-fum18 double mutant in the background of a fum1::hygB mutant. The previously described fum1 mutant strain GfA2364, which is derived from the wild-type strain FGSC 7600 [20,38] by insertion of the hygB resistance gene into the FUM1 PKS, was transformed with a construct that allows for simultaneous deletion of both genes using a nptII (G418) resistance cassette (see Section 4). Two transformants, designated KTFD1 and KTFD4, were obtained and used in the fumonisin resistance tests: their growth was compared to the growth of the parental fum1 mutant strain GfA2364. As evident from Figure 3\u2014even on the highest concentration tested\u2014both, the wild-type and the knockout strains were still able to grow. For unknown reasons, stronger and earlier pigmentation occurred in the wild type. We conclude that the cluster-encoded ceramide synthase genes FUM17 and FUM18 are not necessary for high-level resistance to fumonisin B1.", "2.3. Testing Fumonisin Resistance of Ceramide Synthase Genes by Heterologous Expression in Yeast", "The finding that the FUM17 and FUM18 genes are not necessary for self-resistance against FB1 indicates possible redundancy. F. verticillioides has three additional predicted ceramide synthase genes, CER1, CER2, and CER3 [31], encoded outside the FUM cluster. We have recently reported the construction of a fumonisin-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain [34]. We transformed this strain with the plasmids described by Janevska et al. [31] for the expression of the F. verticillioides ceramide synthase cDNAs behind the constitutive TEF1 promoter. As controls, the yeast ceramide synthases LAG1 (\u201clongevity assurance gene\u201d, [39]) and its paralog (\u201clongevity assurance cognate\u201d) LAC1 [40] were also overexpressed. Yeast transformants were spotted onto SC-URA plates supplemented with increasing amounts of FB1. Overexpression of LAC1, but not of LAG1, conferred low-level resistance at concentrations that were inhibitory for the empty vector controls. At higher concentrations, the yeast genes did not confer resistance, in contrast to F. verticillioides FUM18, CER1, CER2, and CER3.", "As shown in Figure 4, the yeast host (containing functional endogenous LAG1 and LAC1 genes) transformed with the empty vector was already sensitive to 2.5 \u00b5M FB1. Overexpression of LAC1 but not LAG1 in the 2 \u00b5 multicopy plasmid behind the strong TEF1 promoter conferred a low level of increased resistance. On the other hand, high-level resistance (highest concentration tested 150 \u00b5M) was conferred by the expression of FUM18 but not FUM17, and equally well by all three F. verticillioides ceramide synthases, CER1, CER2, and CER3."]
