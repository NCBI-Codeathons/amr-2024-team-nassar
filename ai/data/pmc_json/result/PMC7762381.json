["3. Results", "3.1. Genome Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis of CGB10", "A bacterial species named CGB10 was isolated from sugarcane leaves in the farm (23.16, 113.36) at South China Agricultural University and subjected to whole-genome sequencing (For details: NCBI accession number: CP054468). The CGB10 genome was assembled into three circular sequences, including two larger chromosomes (tig00001: 4.37 Mb; and tig00002: 3.99 Mb), and a plasmid (tig00003: 165.66 Kb) (Table S1). A total of 7259 protein-coding genes were predicted (Table S2), 98% of which could be annotated by at least one of the following databases: COG, KEGG, GO, Refseq, Pfam, and TIGRFAMs (Table S3). These functional annotations and predictions of other genomic features such as non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequences), as well as genomic islands, are available in Dataset S1. Functional annotations with the COG database or KEGG database are illustrated in Figures S1 and S2.", "We compared the CGB10 genome to 21 available genome sequences (in the order of Burkholderiales [27]; Dataset S2) for a better phylogenetic classification. In total, we identified 28,583 genes that were present in at least one of the 22 analyzed genomes, among which 763 single-copy core genes were shared by all the genomes (Figure S3; Dataset S2). We then reconstructed the phylogeny of the 22 bacterial species based on these 763 single-copy core genes, and the results showed that CGB10 was closest to B. gladioli, and together they clustered with B. glumae (Figure 1A). We further confirmed the taxonomic status of CGB10 by calculating the average nucleotide identity (ANI) [28] based on the whole genome of the CGB10 strain in comparison with another six B. gladioli strains, including established rice pathogen BSR3 [24], strains isolated from healthy plants and displaying antifungal activity [29,30,31], and strains isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient [32], as well as a B. glume strain BGR1 [24], which is also known as a rice pathogen (information of selected strains was detailed in Table 1). The identity between CGB10 and the six selected B. gladioli strains was all higher than 98%, yet the identity between CGB10 and the B. glumae strain BGR1 was 88.12%. This result confirmed that CGB10 was identified as a new B. gladioli strain.", "3.2. Antifungal Activity of CGB10 under In Vitro Culture Condition", "Burkholderia strains include pathogens of animals, humans, and/or plants, but also members displaying beneficial properties, including antifungal activities [27]. We next tested the antifungal activity of the newly identified B. gladioli strain CGB10 against several well-known fungal pathogens to crops or fruits, including Magnaporthe oryzae (causes rice blast), Peronophthora litchii (litchi downy blight), Colletotrichum siamense (litchi pepper spot disease), Colletotrichum higginsianum (cauliflower anthracnose), Fusarium oxysporum f. sp (Panama disease of banana). CGB10 exhibited strong inhibitory activity on filamentous growth of these tested fungal pathogens, under in vitro culture conditions (Figure 2A).", "We were particularly interested to see whether CGB10 was able to inhibit the filamentous/mycelial growth of the sugarcane smut fungus S. scitamineum, given that dikaryotic hyphae formation and growth after sexual mating is critical for S. scitamineum pathogenicity. We mixed an equal number of wild-type MAT-1 (+) and MAT-2 (\u2212) S. scitamineum sporidia, and allowed them to form filaments, as showed in the untreated control (Figure 2B). In contrast, the mixed sporidial colony remained smooth as typical haploid, yeast-cell colony (Figure 2B), indicating that mating/filamentation was suppressed by CGB10. Alternatively, we subcultured the filamentous colony (wild-type MAT-1 and MAT-2 sporidial mixed and grown for 3 days) to a fresh medium, with or without the antagonistic CGB10 colonies. Interestingly hyphal growth of such subcultured colonies was also suppressed by CGB10 (Figure 2B). To differentiate whether CGB10\u2032s inhibitory effect was on S. scitamineum sexual mating or filamentation, we used a dual-color imaging system developed by Yan [16] for visualization of dikaryon formation in the presence or absence of CGB10. When MAT-1 (eGFP) and MAT-2 (dsRed) fused with each other through sexual mating, the dikaryotic hyphae appeared orange or light orange under control (untreated) conditions (Figure S4). In contrast, increased haploid sporidia were observed in the presence of CGB10, indicating suppression of sexual mating. Occasionally, we observed sporidia of opposite mating types (of different fluorescent signals) fused to form hyphae, but such hyphae showed limited growth (Figure S4). We concluded that B. gladioli CGB10 strongly suppresses sexual mating and filamentation in S. scitamineum.", "Next, we tested the activity of CGB10 on promycelial growth of S. scitamineum, during teliospore germination. Teliospore germinates and promycelium formation was normal on the blank (without pre-treatment) or negative (pre-treated with E. coli) control (Figure 2C). In contrast, pre-treatment with CGB10 significantly suppressed promycelium formation, resulting in smooth-edged colonies derived from teliospores (Figure 2C). Microscopic observation further confirmed that the production of promycelium was completely suppressed by CGB10 (Figure 2D).", "Overall, we isolated and identified a new B. gladioli strain CGB10 from sugarcane leaves, which displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against filamentous growth of pathogenic fungi. Particularly, CGB10 could effectively suppress dikaryotic hyphae formation in S. scitamineum after sexual mating, and promycelium formation during teliospore germination, both of which are important for sugarcane smut disease.", "3.3. Antifungal Activity of CGB10 under Field Conditions", "As CGB10 displayed a strong inhibitory effect on S. scitamineum filamentous growth after sexual mating, a critical step for its infection and pathogenesis, we considered its potential application as a biocontrol agent (BCA) in sugarcane smut. Because it was isolated from sugarcane leaves, we assumed that it may not be pathogenic/virulent to sugarcane. We next tested its antifungal activity under field conditions. More than 2000 sugarcanes from approximately 500 clumps were planted in an established disease garden of 3600 m2, divided into six randomized plots, three of which were with CGB10 treatment. Treatment with CGB10 did not affect the growth of sugarcane, which was expected, as it was originally isolated from sugarcane leaves. Smut disease usually occurred in multiple trunks from a single clump in the untreated control plots, while only 1\u20132 out of a clump in the CGB10-treated plots (Figure 3). The rate of occurrence of smut disease in CGB10-treated plots was 5.01% (diseased/total = 113/2253) and reduced by 52.46% in comparison to untreated (control) plots (10.54%; 238/2256). In the control plots, the disease canes grew short and slim, and the whips appeared from the trunks at a very early stage (Figure 3). In contrast, the canes growing in the CGB10-treated plots formed the whips at a high position, indicating a delay in symptom development upon CGB10 treatment (Figure 3). Overall, we concluded that CGB10 could effectively suppress sugarcane smut disease under field conditions.", "3.4. Toxoflavin is the Major Filamentation-Suppressing Compound Produced by CGB10", "Next, we explored the mechanism(s) underlying the antifungal activity in CGB10, from a genomic point of view. It has been reported that B. gladioli strains produce secondary metabolites that inhibit fungal growth [8]. Therefore, we initially searched for potential gene clusters involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites in the CGB10 genome by using antiSAMASH (v. 5.0, https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org). Five secondary metabolic gene clusters were predicted, including Lasalocid (t1pks), Xenoamicins, Bacteriocin, Sulfazecin, and capsular polysaccharide (Table 2). Unfortunately, our LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) analysis did not detect these compounds from crude extracts of CGB10 cultured on PDA medium, suggesting that CGB10 either does not produce and/or secrete such compounds under these conditions.", "It has been reported that B. gladioli can secrete gladiolin [33] or toxoflavin [34] as ab effective anti-microbial compound. Therefore, we set out to screen the CGB10 genome for the gene clusters involved in the synthesis of these two compounds. For gladiolin synthesis, we used gbnD1-D6, gbnF-H, and gbnI-J/gbnR-S gene clusters as reported in B. gladioli BCC0238 strain [33,35] (Table 1) as baits. It turned out that no such gbn gene cluster is present in the CGB10 strain. On the other hand, we identified the toxoflavin biosynthesis and transporter gene clusters in the genome of CGB10, and also in all the selected B. gladioli and B. glumae strains, with Tox A-J and Tox R from B. gladioli BSR3 strain as baits (Table 1).", "We were particularly interested in the toxoflavin gene cluster, as the CGB10 colony displayed yellow pigment (Figure 2A,B) as an indicator of toxoflavin production, and toxoflavin is known to be highly toxic to plants, fungi, animals, and microorganisms [36,37], which may contribute to CGB10\u2032s anti-fungal-filamentous-growth activity. We further compared the toxoflavin gene cluster of CGB10 with two other reported toxoflavin-producing Burkholderia strains: B. glumae BGR1 and B. gladioli BSR3 [24,37]. In B. glumae BGR1, ToxA-E genes responsible for toxiflavin biosynthesis were under ToxR regulation, while ToxF-I genes responsible for toxiflavin transport/immunity were under ToxJ regulation. BGR1 Tox cluster genes are all located in chromosome 1 (tig1) [37]. B. gladioli BSR3 possesses a similar Tox cluster except that ToxJ is located on a different chromosome (tig2) [24]. CGB10\u2032s Tox cluster is similar to BSR3, with ToxA-I on tig1, but having two ToxJ homologs (NPGAP_26430 and NPGAP_34680) on tig2 (Figure 4A, Table 3).", "By LC-MS analysis we detected toxoflavin in crude extracts from CGB10 grown on PDA medium (Figure S5), confirming that CGB10 was able to produce (and secrete) toxoflavin. We also applied toxoflavin solution (Sigma-aldrich, K4394-5MG) to in vitro cultured S. scitamineum MAT-1 and MAT-2 mixed (1:1, v/v) colonies, and found a distance-dependent suppression effect on S. scitamineum filamentous growth, by either CGB10 crude extracts or toxoflavin (Figure 4B). Similarly, CGB10 crude extracts or pure toxoflavin displayed an inhibitory effect on S. scitamineum mating/filamentation (Figure S4). Overall, we proposed that toxoflavin contributes to CGB10-based suppression on mating/filamentous growth of S. scitamineum.", "3.5. Identification of Quorum-Sensing Genes in CGB10", "We noticed that B. gladioli strain KACC11889 and ATCC 10,248 were reported as not producing toxoflavin, although they possess a complete Tox gene cluster (Table 1). It has been reported that the loss of toxoflavin production in the KACC11889 strain is due to the lack of quorum-sensing (QS) system Tof I-M-R, which functions as an on/off switch for toxoflavin biosynthesis via regulation of ToxJ regulator [24,38,39]. We also searched for the Tof I-M-R cluster in the selected B. glidioli and B. glumae strains. We found that Tof I-M-R genes were absent in KACC11889 and ATCC 10,248 strains that are not producing toxoflavin, but present in all the other analyzed strains (Table 1). Although it was not reported whether toxoflavin is produced by strains NGJ1 and UCD-UG_CHAPALOTE, we inferred that they may also be capable of producing toxoflavin as they possess both the Tox gene cluster and Tof I-M-R (as a functional switch). We further compared the Tof I-M-R of CGB10 to two toxoflavin-producing Burkholderia strains, BSR3 and BGR1. Interestingly, we found that BSR3 contains two sets of predicted Tof I-M-R genes, located on Chromosome 2 and Plasmid 1 respectively, while BGR1 contains a set of Tof I-M-R located on chromesome2 (Table 3). CGB10 contains only one set of Tof I-M-R gene, located on tig2 (Figure 4C). Even though both CGB10 and BSR3 belong to B. gladioli strains, the copy number of their QS system is different, which adds more complexity to Burkholderia strains\u2019 quorum sensing, regulation of toxoflavin production, and/or virulence (if any).", "3.6. Analysis of CGB10 Pathogenicity", "B. gladioli include many strains reported as pathogens of plants [40] or humans [41], but recent reports show that some B. gladioli strains are non-pathogenic or symbiotic too [42,43]. We then analyzed the CGB10 genome for potential virulence/pathogenicity factors of the following categories. First, secretory proteins, that are known as important enzymes in the life cycle of microorganisms, some of which are also important virulence factors of pathogens [42,43,44,45]. About 739 out of a total of 7259 annotated proteins of the CGB10 genome were predicted to be secreted proteins (Dataset S3), by using SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/, Hidden Markov Model). The secretion system is a channel for bacteria to secrete some proteins in order to survive, reproduce, spread, or adapt to their living environment [46,47,48]. The secretion systems in CGB10 were also predicted, including 2 T1SS, 1 T2SS, 11 T3SS, 1 T4SS, and 13 T6SS (Dataset S3). Among them, the T3SS and T6SS are known to be related to the virulence of gram-negative bacteria [48]. Correspondingly, there were 813 predicted T3SS effectors from the CGB10 genome (Dataset S3). By using the PHI database (Pathogen Host Interactions Database, v. 3.6, http://www.phi-base.org/), we obtained a total of 331 annotated proteins, 249 of which may be related to virulence based on their mutation phenotype of reduced virulence or loss of pathogenicity (Dataset S3). By BLAST in the VFPB (Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria) database (v. Tue May 5 10:06:01 2015, http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/main.htm), a total of 494 virulence factors were predicted. Finally, 171 carbohydrate-active enzymes, which potentially act as bacterial virulence factors, were annotated using the CAZy database (version: 20141020, http://www.cazy.org/). These CAZy annotated proteins were further divided into six categories, namely, AA (Auxiliary Activities), CBM (Carbohydrate-Binding Module), CE (Carbohydrate Esterase), GH (Glycoside Hydrolase), GT (GlycosylTransferase), and PL (Polysaccharide Lyase), based on the activity module(s) they possess (Dataset S3). Overall, we identified potential virulence factors from the B. gladioli CGB10 genome by bioinformatic analyses and predicted secreted proteins or enzymes, secretion systems, and corresponding effectors, orthologs to known virulence factors too. Therefore, laboratory tests for CGB10 virulence towards plant hosts are certainly required prior to its use as a biocontrol agent.", "We then tested the enzyme activity for Pel (pectate lyase), Peh (polygalacturonase), Cel (cellulose), and Prt (protease), which are common bacterial virulence factors in the CGB10 strain. CGB10 did not display any enzymatic activity in these aspects, as no clear zones were evident at the margin of inoculation sites (Figure 5A). E. coli and Dickeya zeae MS2 [49] were used as negative and positive controls respectively. Furthermore, we inoculated CGB10 on potato slides or on onion epidermis, to see if any disease lesion could be caused. Our results showed that CGB10 is not pathogenic to these two tested plant hosts as no damage was evident nor disease lesions formed after inoculation with CGB10 (Figure 5B). However, CGB10 was found to inhibit the germination in rice seeds (Figure 5C).", "In general, we found that CGB10 did not display the same pathogenicity on onion or potato slices as reported in several other Burkholderia species [50], but was indeed able to suppress rice seed germination, which is similar to the rice pathogen B. glumae [40]. Therefore, any intention to use CGB10 as a biocontrol agent against rice fungal disease would need extra caution. Furthermore, pathogenicity assessment for CGB10 towards animal or human cells is required, to avoid potential bacteria-mediated adverse human health effects caused by CGB10."]
