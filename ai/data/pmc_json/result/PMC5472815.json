There is only one known example of this species, with no nucleotide sequences reported. Amplification and sequencing of 16S, recA, and gyrB genes indicated that these sequences were closely related to those of Burkholderia species (data not shown) (13). To characterize this isolate, we obtained a complete genome sequence using PacBio technology. The sequence assembled into four contigs, with a total size of 7.84 MB. The sequences of six multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci from the genome were compared to those of characterized Burkholderia species. P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 clustered most closely with Burkholderia ubonensis within the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Fig. 1), which confirms its misclassification.", "FIG 1Phylogeny of P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 within the genus Burkholderia.

Both genomes were organized similarly in three chromosomes, each encoding rRNA, and were largely syntenic. The B. ubonensis MSMB1471 and P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 genomes shared an average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 94.7%, which falls below the proposed species-level cutoff value of 95% (14).

The complete PKS cluster for malleilactone production (17) and the NRPS cluster for ornibactin biosynthesis (18) were found, and the NRPS part of the ectoine-arylpolyene-NRPS cluster is similar to the sulfazecin biosynthesis cluster in Pseudomonas acidophila (19), with the exception that the SulM equivalent in P. mesoacidophila has no epimerization domain. Therefore, this group of genes is likely to be responsible for isosulfazecin biosynthesis. The complete four-gene cluster required for biosynthesis of the antifungal pyrrolnitrin (20) is present, although we could not detect production of this metabolite in either culture broth or partially purified cell extracts with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

The culture filtrate of P. mesoacidophila potentiated the lytic activity of cefuroxime against E. coli and caused bulge formation (Fig. 3), as expected if bulgecin were present (2, 28). E. coli JM109 cells exposed to a sublethal concentration of cefuroxime grew as long cell chains, consistent with this compound's selective inhibition of PBP3 and prevention of proper septation (29), whereas cells exposed to the same concentration of cefuroxime in P. mesoacidophila culture broth developed bulges at the sites of septation (2, 28).", "FIG 3Cefuroxime potentiation and bulge-forming activity.
