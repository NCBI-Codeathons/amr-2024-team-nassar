["2. Results", "2.1. Expression and Purification of GTs", "OleD [41], DesVII [51], SpnP [52,53] and Srm29 [54] are macrolide GTs. Hence, these GTs were selected as the candidate biocatalysts for glycosylation of midecamycin. The genes encoding the four GTs were thus induced to express in Escherichia coli for preparative production of biocatalysts, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that an intense band with the expected size of 45.7 kDa was present in the supernatant of the recombinant strain harboring OleD gene. On the contrary, no corresponding band was detected in the control supernatant, suggesting OleD was successfully expressed in E. coli as a soluble product. The soluble OleD protein was subsequently purified to near homogeneity, reaching 107.96 mg/mL (Figure 2A). Likewise, the other three genes desVII, spnP and srm29 were demonstrated to be expressed as soluble forms in E. coli (Figure S1). The concentration of the purified DesVII, SpnP and Srm29 was 40.32, 50.83 and 46.67 mg/mL, respectively. These recombinant GTs were then used as the biocatalysts to glucosylate midecamycin.", "2.2. Glucosylation of Midecamycin", "Each of these purified OleD, DesVII, SpnP and Srm29 was used as the biocatalyst to react with UDP-Glc and midecamycin, respectively. Results indicated that four GTs could glucosylate midecamycin to form new products (Figure 2B). Of the four GTs, OleD exhibited the most favorable glucosylating activity towards midecamycin. OleD could glucosylate midecamycin to yield two products 1a and 1b (Figure 2B). Conversely, the other three GTs could glucosylate midecamycin to form trace products (Figure 2B). Hence, the purified OleD was used as the biocatalyst for further glycodiversification of midecamycin.", "The newly formed peaks 1a and 1b displayed similar UV spectra with that of midecamycin (Figure 2C), suggesting the two products containing similar skeleton structure with that of midecamycin. The newly formed 1a and 1b exhibited [M + H]+ ion peaks with m/z values of 976.5081 (Figure 2D) and 976.5082 (Figure 2E), respectively, which revealed both were monoglucosylated products of midecamycin with m/z value of 814.4577 (Figure 2F). The compound 1a was collected and then analyzed by NMR measurement. 1H and 13C-NMR data assigned 1a as midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glucopyranoside (Table 1, Figures S2\u2013S6), suggesting OleD preferred to attack 2\u2032-OH in mycaminosyl moiety of midecamycin. In addition, OleD was able to glucosylate 2\u2032-OH of oleandomycin [25,26,27,28,38,39,40]. These facts collectively indicated that 2\u2032-OH might be the preferred site of glycosylation for macrolides. In an attempt to collect 1b for structural identification, this compound was found to be unstable and could be easily converted to 1a. It was speculated that there was an isomerization between 1a and 1b, which resulted from the allylic rearrangement caused by two conjugated double bonds in midecamycin. The isomerization of the diene alcohol system in macrolides had been observed previously [55,56]. The instability of 1b, together with its trace amount in the reaction mixture, made it was difficult to purify 1b. Hence, the exact structure of 1b had not been assigned.", "The effect of pH and temperature on OleD-catalyzed glucosylation towards midecamycin was illustrated in Figure S7. OleD exhibited a wide pH tolerance ranging from pH 4.0 to pH 12.0. When pH was between 9 and 10, the highest OleD activity was observable. Likewise, OleD had a wide range of temperature tolerance. It kept activity from 0 to 70 \u00b0C and got the highest activity at 50 \u00b0C. When the temperature was 70 \u00b0C, the residual activity of OleD was more than 25%. Hence, the optimal pH 9.0 and optimal temperature 50 \u00b0C were determined as the reaction conditions in the following assays unless otherwise specified. The kinetic parameters were determined under the optimal reaction conditions and summarized in Table 2.", "2.3. OleD-Mediated Glycodiversificaion of Midecamycin", "The glycodiversification capacity of OleD towards midecamycin was explored with the aim to enzymatically synthesize an array of midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides. Each of the compounds summarized in Figure S8 was used as the sugar donor to react with midecamycin under the action of OleD (Figure 3). OleD was reactive with five donors, including UDP-Glc, UDP-Xyl, UDP-Gal, UDP-Rha and UDP-GlcNAc, but stringently repellent to UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), GDP-mannose (GDP-Man) and other donors in Figure S8. Like UDP-Glc, UDP-Xyl reacted with midecamycin to form two products 1c and 1d displaying similar UV spectra with that of midecamycin (Figure 3A,E). Mass analyses of the two peaks showed m/z ions of 946.4995 and 946.4982, respectively, suggesting 1c and 1d were monoxylosylated products of midecamycin (Figure 3C,D). Further NMR analysis assigned 1c as midecamycin 2\u2032-O-xylopyranoside (Table 1, Figures S9\u2013S13). The midecamycin xyloside 1d was also unstable, and might be an allylic isomer of 1c (Figure 3A). Moreover, the yield of 1d was very low. Therefore, we did not identify the structure of 1d.", "The other three donors, UDP-Gal, UDP-Rha and UDP-GlcNAc, could react with midecamycin to yield one product, respectively (Figure 3A). HRESIMS demonstrated their monoglycosylated products of midecamycin (Figure S14). According to the catalytic behavior of OleD towards midecamycin, these glycosylated midecamycin derivatives 1e, 1f and 1g could reasonably deduced to midecamycin 2\u2032-O-galactopyranoside (1e), midecamycin 2\u2032-O-rhamnoside (1f) and midecamycin 2\u2032-O-acetylglucosamine (1g) (Figure 3). However, more evidences are still needed to determine the exact structure of these monoglycosides. Hence, OleD was demonstrated to glycodiversify midecamycin, attaching five sugar moieties including glucosyl, xylosyl, galactosyl, rhamnosyl and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at 2\u2032-OH, respectively (Figure 3A). OleD displayed distinct catalytic efficiencies towards these donors (Figure 3B). The conversion of UDP-Glc was the highest, approaching to 91.3%. OleD had low catalytic efficiency for other four donors. The conversion of UDP-Xyl was only 27%, while those of UDP-Gal, UDP-Rha and UDP-GlcNAc were lower, giving 3.96%, 7.62%, 4.56%, respectively (Figure 3B). It was difficult to collect enough amounts of glycosylated products 1c, 1e, 1f and 1g for activity evaluation due to the low conversions. Hence, protein engineering of OleD based on homology modeling was performed with the aim to improve its catalytic efficiency towards UDP-Xyl, UDP-Gal, UDP-Rha or UDP-GlcNAc.", "GlcNAc and 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose are derivatives of glucose. Moreover, the complex of UGT72B1 (a GT displaying similar structure with that of OleD) and UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (U2F) could provide a reference for homology modeling of OleD with UDP-GlcNAc [57]. Hence, we put the emphasis on the enhancement of the conversion of OleD towards UDP-GlcNAc.", "2.4. Protein Engineering of OleD to Enhance Its Catalytic Efficiencies", "The complex of OleD with U2F was obtained through the alignment and superposition with wild type OleD (PDB ID: 2IYF) and UGT72B1 (PDB ID: 2VCE). Next, the fluoride ion at C-2 of glucose moiety in U2F was replaced with N-acetyl group to yield a complex of OleD with UDP-GlcNAc. As observed from the modelled complex structure of OleD with UDP-GlcNAc, the residue Gln331 in OleD formed hydrogen bond with the O3 of GlcNAc, suggesting the critical interaction of a sugar donor with OleD (Figure S15). Gln331 was a component of the strictly conserved signature Glu/Asp-Gln (E/D-Q) and no mutations were therefore performed on this residue [41,57,58]. We focused on amino acids less than 5\u00c5 away from Gln331, such as Gln327, Val329, Asp330 and Phe332, which might affect the binding of Gln331 to glycosyl donors (Figure S15). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of these four residues was thus performed. Four alanine mutants of OleD, namely Q327A, V329A, D330A and F332A, were yielded and their catalytic activities towards UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Xyl, UDP-Gal, UDP-Rha and UDP-Glc were measured. Q327A variant displayed an improved activity towards UDP-GlcNAc. Conversely, the catalytic activity of the mutant D330A towards the five donors was lost completely. Hence, the residue Q327 was selected for further saturation mutagenesis (Figure S16).", "Saturation mutation on Q327 was performed and 19 recombinant OleD mutants were thus induced to express in E. coli (Figure S17). Each of these crude mutants was used as the biocatalyst to incubate with midecamycin and UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Xyl or UDP-Glc, respectively. As illustrated in Figure S18C, the UDP-GlcNAc conversions of 16 mutants increased while the other three mutants, Q327D, Q327E and Q327P, decreased. The most notable increase in UDP-GlcNAc conversion occurred in Q327F mutant. The UDP-GlcNAc conversion of Q327F reached 30.7%, eight times higher than that of the wild OleD (3.6%).", "The UDP-Xyl conversion of these variants was also measured (Figure S18B). The conversion of 12 variants towards UDP-Xyl increased, while the other seven obtained a decreased conversion towards UDP-Xyl. The conversion of Q327D and Q327P towards UDP-Xyl decreased significantly. Specifically, the conversion of Q327D declined below 5% while the catalytic activity of Q327P was lost completely. Of 12 mutants with increased activity, Q327I obtained the highest conversion of 46.5% towards UDP-Xyl (Figure S18B), 33% more than that of wild OleD (34.9%).", "In addition, the conversion of these variants towards UDP-Glc was also determined (Figure S18A). Of these 19 variants, the conversion of Q327D towards UDP-Glc decreased to 50%, while the catalytic efficiency of Q327P towards UDP-Glc was lost completely. The other 17 mutations at Q327 residue led to an insignificant variation of OleD activity towards UDP-Glc (Figure S18A). Cumulatively, Q327 residue was a favorable site to improve the conversions towards UDP-GlcNAc. The saturation mutations at Q327, however, did not improve the conversion significantly towards UDP-Xyl and UDP-Glc. Thus, the measurement of more residues is required so as to obtain favorable variants with improved conversions towards UDP-Xyl and UDP-Glc. Considering that saturation mutation of Q327 could only significantly increase the conversion towards UDP-GlcNAc, the effects of saturation mutation of Q327 on the conversions towards UDP-Gal and UDP-Rha were thus not tested.", "In order to further verify these results, five Q327 mutants ranking first to fifth in UDP-GlcNAc conversion were purified (Figure 4A). The concentrations of these purified enzymes were 62.03 (Q327F), 82.52 (Q327H), 99.57 (Q327M), 67.26 (Q327R) and 89.91 mg/mL (Q327W), respectively, and were used as biocatalysts to react with midecamycin and UDP-GlcNAc (Figure 4B). The conversions of these mutants towards UDP-GlcNAc increased significantly. The highest conversion occurred on Q327F variant, reaching 34.13 \u00b1 1.55% (Figure 4).", "The wild type OleD and its variants Q327I and Q327F were used as the biocatalysts for scale preparation of midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glucopyranoside, midecamycin 2\u2032-O-xylopyranoside, and midecamycin 2\u2032-O-acetylglucosamine, respectively. These enzymatically synthesized midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides were then used to test their water solubility and biological activities.", "2.5. Water Solubility of Midecamycin 2\u2032-O-Glucopyranoside", "Glycosylation modifications usually increase the water solubility of compounds. This notion was further confirmed by the fact that the water solubility of midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glucopyranoside was greater than that of midecamycin. The water solubility of the enzymatically synthesized midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glucopyranoside was 8.62 mg/mL, 11 times higher than that of midecamycin (0.74 mg/mL).", "2.6. Antimicrobial Activities of Midecamycin 2\u2032-O-Glycosides", "As shown in Table 3, the MIC values of midecamycin against Bacillus intestinalis strain T30, B.\nsubtilis strain 168, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.5, 1, 1 and 0.25 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, suggesting midecamycin exhibited potent antibacterial activities. Three midecamycin 2\u2032-O-glycosides, however, displayed no antibacterial activities against the tested microorganisms listed in Table 3, even if the maximum concentration of these glycosides reached 64 \u03bcg/mL. The midecamycin inactivation caused by glycosylation might be due to the configuration change of midecamycin, which in turn prevented the binding of midecamycin to its target [41]. More evidences are required to analyze the exact mechanism underlying the resistance to midecamycin by glycosylation."]
