["Results", "Influence of different oxygen availabilities on nitrogen metabolism", "Varying filling volumes in shake flasks are associated with different oxygen availabilities for cells. In case of B. subtilis, altered patterns in nitrogen consumption were expected due to assimilatory and dissimilatory pathways. More precisely, low filling volumes result in highest oxygen availability (Heyman et al. 2019; Schiefelbein et al. 2013) and hence aerobic growth is predominant. In this sense, ammonium should be identified as preferred nitrogen source for biomass assimilation, when both ammonium and nitrate are present. High filling volumes result in low oxygen availability (Heyman et al. 2019; Schiefelbein et al. 2013) and nitrate consumption increases due to anaerobic nitrate respiration. To validate these theses, B. subtilis JABs24 was cultivated in 10%, 50% and 100% relative filling volume (Rv). Figure\u00a01 displays the corresponding CDW and the concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium during the time course of cultivation. CDWmax was reached after 44\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h and 36\u00a0h with 5.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.66\u00a0g/L, 5.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\u00a0g/L and 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0g/L at increasing cultivation volumes. Additional glucose measurements excluded carbon limitation (data not shown). Nitrate concentrations were relatively constant at 10% and 50% Rv, with a slight decrease detectable in the last-mentioned. On the contrary, nitrate limitation occurred in 100% Rv after 36\u00a0h. Hence, growth was limited by nitrate depletion. As expected, the ammonium concentration decreased during cultivation with 10% Rv. At 50% Rv, ammonium initially decreased slightly before a relatively constant concentration could be measured. A continuous increase in ammonium was detected in the cultivation using 100% Rv of the flask capacity. Nitrite, the intermediate of nitrate respiration, was not detected in cultivations using 10% Rv. Nitrite peaked to values of 4.11\u2009\u00b1\u20091.17 mmol/L and 4.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 mmol/L after 20\u00a0h of cultivation in both 50% and 100% Rv, respectively. Those nitrite concentrations particularly affect a prolonged lag phase of cultivation of anaerobically growing B. subtilis cultures, while the values of maximum specific growth rates \u00b5max remain unchanged (Hoffmann et al. 2020). However, concentrations further declined until CDWmax. Hence, the time course of nitrogen sources indicated that higher filling volumes resulted in a converged nitrogen consumption pattern. More precisely, nitrate respiration was preferred with increasing Rv and hence lower oxygen availabilities can be assumed.", "Fig. 1Cell dry weight (CDW) (g/L) and concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium (all [mmol/L]) of strain B. subtilis JABs24 cultivated in a mineral salt medium employing 40\u00a0g/L glucose, 0.1\u00a0mol/L NH4+ and 0.1\u00a0mol/L NO3\u2212 in baffled shake flasks with three different relative filling volumes of 10%, 50% and 100% representing different oxygen availabilities", "Fig. 1Cell dry weight (CDW) (g/L) and concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium (all [mmol/L]) of strain B. subtilis JABs24 cultivated in a mineral salt medium employing 40\u00a0g/L glucose, 0.1\u00a0mol/L NH4+ and 0.1\u00a0mol/L NO3\u2212 in baffled shake flasks with three different relative filling volumes of 10%, 50% and 100% representing different oxygen availabilities", "Cell dry weight (CDW) (g/L) and concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium (all [mmol/L]) of strain B. subtilis JABs24 cultivated in a mineral salt medium employing 40\u00a0g/L glucose, 0.1\u00a0mol/L NH4+ and 0.1\u00a0mol/L NO3\u2212 in baffled shake flasks with three different relative filling volumes of 10%, 50% and 100% representing different oxygen availabilities", "Suitability of the promoters PnarG and PnasD for gene expression under anaerobic conditions", "The nitrogen patterns of the preliminary cultivations have indicated that different oxygen availabilities are present in cultivations with 10%, 50% and 100% Rv.

Altogether, a marginal tendency to higher mean MU with increasing Rv was noticed. In general, PsrfA expression dropped from ~\u2009300 MU to ~\u2009125 MU after 8\u00a0h of cultivation. Another slight increase in expression was followed by a subsequent decline to 70\u2013100 MU at CDWmax. For both PnarG and PnasD expressions, MU increased with increasing Rv. At 10% Rv, LacZ activity was not detectable for transcriptional fusion with PnarG and expression did not surpass 10 MU for PnasD. At 50% Rv, both expression levels of PnarG and PnasD increased to a maximum after 12\u00a0h of cultivation with ~\u200940 MU and ~\u2009270 MU, respectively, with an ensuing decrease to ~\u200915 MU and ~\u2009140 MU until CDWmax. Highest expression levels were monitored at 100% Rv. For PnarG, expression increased to ~\u2009180 MU after 12\u00a0h of cultivation before a decline to ~\u200980 MU was detectable. In contrast to that, maximum expression of PnasD was ~\u200910-fold higher and reached\u2009~\u20092000 MU after 20\u00a0h of cultivation. Noticeably, comparable to PnarG expression, a reduction of MU values to ~\u2009800 MU could be observed at CDWmax. In this context, as already described by Hoffmann et al. (2020), a strong PnasD activity is detectable, although the overflow metabolite acetate increases with higher glucose amounts in anaerobic cultivations. In summary, while PsrfA expression was relatively constant amongst the different Rv tested, both PnarG and PnasD expressions were induced at higher Rv and hence lower oxygen availabilities. More specifically, PnasD revealed the overall highest expression values.", "To apply PnarG and PnasD promoter systems for bioprocesses, more information about B. subtilis physiology is important. In brief, B. subtilis harbors two nitrate reductases with the genes nasBC and narGHI encoding for the assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reductase, respectively. The transcription of the latter one, narGHI, is thereby repressed in the presence of oxygen (Hoffmann et al. 1995; Nakano et al. 1996). On the contrary, nasDE encodes for both assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrite reductase and transcription is hence also feasible aerobically (Nakano et al. 1998). To demonstrate that the PnasD expression is dependent on the presence of ammonium or nitrate, respectively, B. subtilis MG5 was cultivated in media containing either NH4+ or NO3\u2212 in 10% Rv. As expected, mean MU for PnasD expression was below 10 MU in the medium containing only NH4+, whereas much higher MU values (continuously\u2009~\u2009200 MU) were detected in NO3\u2212 supplemented medium (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In addition, in media supplemented with either 0.005 or 0.01\u00a0mol/L NH4+, a time-delayed expression of PnasD was monitored (Additional file 1: Fig. S1) which was triggered by depletion of NH4+ (data not shown). Hence, it can be concluded that PnasD is a strong, anaerobically inducible promoter, but the effect of anaerobic induction is dependent on the availability of NH4+ during aerobic growth.", "Investigation of strains B. subtilis MG12 and MG14 carrying promoter exchanges PsrfA::PnarG and PsrfA::PnasD", "Growth behavior and surfactin synthesis", "The promoter exchange strains MG12 (PsrfAA::PnarG; amyE::[PnarG-lacZ, spcR]) and MG14 (PsrfA::PnasD; amyE::[PnasD-lacZ, spcR]) were cultivated in shake flasks with 10%, 50% and 100% Rv. An overview of CDW and surfactin concentrations of these strains, as well as the reference strain JABs24, are displayed in Fig.\u00a03a and b. In 10% Rv, strains MG12 and MG14 reached CDWmax after 24\u00a0h and 20\u00a0h with 3.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u00a0g/L and 4.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u00a0g/L, respectively. CDW remained constant until the end of cultivation. CDWmax for strain JABs24 was reached after 44\u00a0h with 5.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.66\u00a0g/L. In 50% Rv, all strains reached CDWmax after 44 to 48\u00a0h with 5.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\u00a0g/L, 5.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u00a0g/L and 5.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30\u00a0g/L for strains JABs24, MG12 and MG14, respectively. In contrast, CDWmax was much lower in cultivations with 100% Rv and did not surpass 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0g/L, 1.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u00a0g/L and 0.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u00a0g/L for strains JABs24, MG12 and MG14 after 36\u00a0h, 32\u00a0h and 44\u00a0h, respectively, before the concentration of biomass dropped. In addition, cell agglutination was visible with progressive cultivation causing difficulties in OD600 measurements. However, strong induction of PnasD activity was detected, suggesting that cell agglutination does not counteract nasD expression.", "Fig. 3Time course of cell dry weight (CDW) [g/L] (a) and surfactin concentration [mg/L] (b) of strains B. subtilis JABs24 (reference), MG12 (PnarG-lacZ; amyE::[PnarG-lacZ, spcR]) and MG14 (PsrfA::PnasD; amyE::[PnasD-lacZ, spcR]) cultivated in a mineral salt medium with 40\u00a0g/L glucose, 0.1\u00a0mol/L NH4+ and 0.1\u00a0mol/L NO3\u2212 employing three different relative filling volumes of 10%, 50 and 100% representing different oxygen availabilities", "Fig. 3Time course of cell dry weight (CDW) [g/L] (a) and surfactin concentration [mg/L] (b) of strains B. subtilis JABs24 (reference), MG12 (PnarG-lacZ; amyE::[PnarG-lacZ, spcR]) and MG14 (PsrfA::PnasD; amyE::[PnasD-lacZ, spcR]) cultivated in a mineral salt medium with 40\u00a0g/L glucose, 0.1\u00a0mol/L NH4+ and 0.1\u00a0mol/L NO3\u2212 employing three different relative filling volumes of 10%, 50 and 100% representing different oxygen availabilities", "Time course of cell dry weight (CDW) [g/L] (a) and surfactin concentration [mg/L] (b) of strains B. subtilis JABs24 (reference), MG12 (PnarG-lacZ; amyE::[PnarG-lacZ, spcR]) and MG14 (PsrfA::PnasD; amyE::[PnasD-lacZ, spcR]) cultivated in a mineral salt medium with 40\u00a0g/L glucose, 0.1\u00a0mol/L NH4+ and 0.1\u00a0mol/L NO3\u2212 employing three different relative filling volumes of 10%, 50 and 100% representing different oxygen availabilities", "As expected, strains MG12 and MG14 did not synthesize surfactin at 10% Rv (Fig.\u00a03b).

Using 100% Rv, however, lowest growth rates were monitored for strain MG14. A trend amongst the strains for the YX/S was not identified.

However, the previous shake flask cultivations have demonstrated that reference strain JABs24 reached highest surfactin titer at a 50% Rv, and even at 100% Rv both YP/X and q were promising. In the latter condition, B. subtilis MG14 with PsrfA::PnasD even surpassed the surfactin titers, YP/X and q of the reference strain. Consequently, the next step aimed at transferring these results to bioreactor scale.", "Reference process and preliminary pO2 strategies", "CDW, surfactin and pO2 levels of different processes employing B. subtilis JABs24 or MG1 are given in Fig. S4. A conventional batch process with foam centrifuge employing 20\u00a0g/kg glucose was performed as control with an initial agitation and aeration rate of 300\u00a0rpm and 2.0\u00a0L/min and a pO2 set-point of 20% (Additional file 1: Fig. S4a). CDWmax was reached after 24\u00a0h with 77.51\u00a0g prior to glucose depletion. Simultaneously, surfactinmax was reached with 57.43\u00a0g. Nitrate was almost constant throughout cultivation, while ammonium was reduced by ~\u200950%. In addition, slight persistent foaming occurred which was accompanied by an increase in the pressure due to blocked exhaust air filters. In a subsequent fed-batch approach, the aeration rate was stopped after 21\u00a0h of cultivation and switched to N2 based ventilation (Additional file 1: Fig. S4b). At this time point, the pO2 was already at 20% for ~\u20095\u00a0h. When the process air was stopped, the pO2 dropped to 0% within seconds. However, also the CDW dropped from 50.27\u00a0g to 3.67\u00a0g within 4.5\u00a0h. Surfactin reached 29.48\u00a0g prior to the change in pO2 and was reduced slightly when CDW dropped. However, cells restored the growth and after 41.5\u00a0h of cultivation, a biomass of 24.1\u00a0g was obtained with a slight increase in surfactin to 32\u00a0g. In a next approach, the pO2 was decreased stepwise to ideally avoid the observed drop of CDW by cell adaptation (Fig. S4c). Each pO2 level of 20%, 10%, 5% and 0% was kept for 3\u00a0h before aeration was switched to N2. In this approach, the CDW as well as surfactin still dropped, but to a much lower extent, from 80.74\u00a0g to 61.75\u00a0g, and 39.84\u00a0g to 34.80\u00a0g, respectively. Both CDW and surfactin increased afterwards and reached maximum values of 73.26\u00a0g and 41.91\u00a0g.", "Comparison of strains B. subtilis KM1016 and MG14 with 1.2\u00a0L/min aeration rate employing a self-regulated HNO3 feed", "Due to the observed drops in CDW and the concomitant stagnating surfactin production, another approach was tested employing a constant aeration and agitation rate throughout the cultivation. This should result in a decline of available oxygen per cell and hence an adaptation of cells to microaerobic conditions. First, a fed-batch cultivation was performed with a constant aeration rate of 2\u00a0L/min employing the reporter strain MG1 to monitor PnarG expression, which is exclusively activated anaerobically. Cells grew without drop and reached a CDWmax of 196\u00a0g after 40\u00a0h. Surfactin values increased constantly during growth to a maximum of 104\u00a0g (Fig. S4d). Miller units revealed that only a small portion of cells adapted to anaerobic conditions. During Miller Assay, the yellow color as indicator to stop the reaction was visible in less than 3\u00a0min, but calculation revealed 5 MU, as the high OD600 of 30 is included in the calculation. Hence, it can be assumed that a high expression level of the promoter is present, but most cells did not grow by nitrate respiration. A cultivation with 1.2\u00a0L/min and strain MG1, which actually represents the lowest aeration rate that could be set with the given technical equipment, resulted in Miller units up to 35 for PnarG and was hence used as process to compare B. subtilis KM1016 and MG14 with PsrfA::PnasD. Figure\u00a04 exemplarily illustrates the CDW, glucose, surfactin, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium values of a cultivation with B. subtilis KM1016 (Fig.\u00a04a) and B. subtilis MG14 (Fig.\u00a04b). In addition, OD600 in correlation to Miller units and pO2 are given in Fig.\u00a04c and d for strains KM1016 and MG14, respectively. Comparable CDWmax values were reached for strain KM1016 and MG14 after 46\u00a0h with 140\u00a0g and 147\u00a0g, respectively, whereas the growth was terminated by glucose depletion. In contrast, different surfactinmax were reached at CDWmax with 81\u00a0g for KM1016 and 35\u00a0g for MG14. Strain KM1016 consumed a total of 5.6\u00a0mol nitrate until CDWmax. Nitrate addition by HNO3 was higher than consumption, resulting in a nitrate accumulation to 2.7\u00a0mol in the medium. Strain MG14 showed a similar behavior but consumed less nitrate. At CDWmax, total nitrate consumption was 4.5\u00a0mol and another 4.2\u00a0mol were detectable in the medium.", "Fig. 4Exemplary cultivation results of fed-batch bioreactor cultivations employing strains B. subtilis KM1016 (PsrfA-lacZ) (a, c) and B. subtilis MG14 (PsrfA::PnasD; amyE::[PnasD-lacZ, spcR]) (b,\u00a0d).

Nitrite concentrations increased until 22\u00a0h in both cultivations. After a subsequent decrease until ~\u200930\u00a0h, nitrite again increased steadily and reached values of ~\u20090.21\u00a0mol at CDWmax. The pO2 declined faster in the cultivation of strain MG14 which correlated to higher growth rates (Fig.\u00a04d). For strain KM1016, a pO2 of ~\u200914% was reached after ~\u200915\u00a0h, and mean pO2 of ~\u20091.8% was measured after 25\u00a0h of cultivation (Fig.\u00a04c). On the contrary, the pO2 of strain MG14 fell to ~\u20092% after 7\u00a0h of cultivation, and a mean pO2 of ~\u20091.2% was reached after ~\u200915\u00a0h of cultivation. For both strains, the pO2 increased drastically when cell growth was terminated. In terms of foaming, the foam centrifuge was activated right from the beginning for strain KM1016 and after ~\u20096\u00a0h for strain MG14. With respect to the Miller units, PsrfA expression was detectable as soon as cells grew after a short lag-phase. A maximum of 250 MU was determined after 24\u00a0h of cultivation and values slightly decreased afterwards (Fig.\u00a04c). For PnasD, induction levels were below 5 MU until 6\u00a0h of cultivation. In accordance with the pO2, induction increased to 180 MU after 8\u00a0h when the pO2 was <\u20092%.

For fed-batch processes and for better comparison to the reference batch cultivation, results are displayed as \u201cafter batch glucose consumption\u201d calculations and \u201cend of process\u201d calculations. The fed-batch process employing the reference strain and 1.2\u00a0L/min reached only 82.14\u00a0g of surfactin, which resulted in a productivity q of 0.012\u00a0g/(g h). This value is similar to the 2\u00a0L/min fed-batch process with 0.013\u00a0g/(g h), where 104.57\u00a0g of surfactin were produced, but with biomass of 196.97\u00a0g. Comparing batch data, the reference batch process had a productivity q of 0.031\u00a0g/(g h). Here, the 2\u00a0L/min process was inferior with 0.022\u00a0g/(g h) and the 1.2\u00a0L/min process performed similar with 0.030\u00a0g/(g h). Comparing strains KM1016 and MG14, both processes reached comparable CDW of 147.52\u00a0g and 150.18\u00a0g, but the surfactin produced with strain MG14 with 31.56\u00a0g was ~\u20092.5-fold lower.
