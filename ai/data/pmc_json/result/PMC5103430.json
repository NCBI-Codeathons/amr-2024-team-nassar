["Results", "Deletion of 2,6-dideoxysugar biosynthesis genes", "The PM100117/18 gene cluster encodes most of the putative functions required to catalyze the biosynthesis of the three 2,6DOH moieties appended to the PM100117/18 macrolactone ring (Fig.\u00a01). From these activities, as deduced in silico (Additional file 1), biosynthesis of l-axenose, 2-deoxy-l-fucose and l-rhodinose can be envisaged to occur as depicted in Fig.\u00a02. Early biosynthesis steps of 6DOHs involves intermediacy of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP)-4-keto-6DOH, which is synthesized from a hexose-1-phospate, most possibly d-glucose, in two reaction steps catalyzed by a NDP-d-hexose synthase (GonGS) and a NDP-d-hexose-4,6-dehydratase (GonD2), respectively. To achieve, 2-deoxy-l-fucose and l-rhodinose, NDP-4-keto-6DOH could be converted into a NDP-4-keto-2,6DOH intermediate with an equatorial hydroxyl group at carbon C3, by the sequential activity of NDP-d-hexose-2,3-dehydratase (GonD1) and NDP-d-hexose-3-ketoreductase (GonR3), in accordance with the high resemblance of GonR3 to other 3-ketoreductases that render this configuration (Additional file 1). Similarly, l-axenose biosynthesis would involve a NDP-4-keto-2,6DOH intermediate with a hydroxyl group at carbon C3 in axial stereo configuration, however the corresponding NDP-d-hexose-3-ketoreductase is not present in the PM100117/18 gene cluster. Later steps towards PM100117/18 DOHs biosynthesis from this key 2,6DOH intermediate might involve four reaction types outlined in Fig.\u00a02, which include C-methylation at C3 (GonCM), 3-deoxygenation (GonD3), 5- or 3,5-epimerization (GonE) and 4-ketoreduction (GonR1/GonR2).Fig.\u00a02Proposed biosynthesis pathway of PM100117 and PM100118 2,6-DOH moieties. 3KR: ketoreductase", "Fig.\u00a02Proposed biosynthesis pathway of PM100117 and PM100118 2,6-DOH moieties. 3KR: ketoreductase", "Proposed biosynthesis pathway of PM100117 and PM100118 2,6-DOH moieties. 3KR: ketoreductase", "Herein, we sought to generate PM100117/18 structural analogues by manipulating the biosynthesis of their pendant 2,6DOHs. For that purpose we generated the mutant strains \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3, \u0394gonE, and \u0394gonR1, in which genes involved in late steps of 2,6DOH biosynthesis, gonCM, gonD3, gonE, and gonR1, respectively, were deleted. To detect the biosynthesis of PM100117/18 derivatives, whole-culture extracts from these strains were analyzed by UPLC (Fig.\u00a03) and HPLC/MS. UPLC chromatograms from strains \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3 and \u0394gonE showed suppression of PM100117 (1, UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.182\u00a0min, m/z 1601.9 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) and PM100118 (2, UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.536\u00a0min, m/z 1585.9 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) biosynthesis, and the appearance of several peaks corresponding to potential analogues (Fig.\u00a03a). Mass assessments by HPLC/MS suggested that the novel compounds detected in \u0394gonCM are compatible with PM100117/18 analogues in which the first sugar moiety, l-axenose, has been substituted for either 2-deoxy-l-fucose or l-rhodinose. This was confirmed by elucidating the chemical structure of products 3 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.035\u00a0min, m/z 1571.9 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 4 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.102\u00a0min, m/z 1555.9 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] by NMR, showing that both are PM100118 derivatives with an l-rhodinose unit in place of l-axenose as first sugar moiety (Fig.\u00a03b and Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S1). The presence of a hydroxyl group at C18 of the polyketide ring in 3 (absent in 4 and also in 1 and 2) suggests that compound 3 might be a shunt product of PM100117/18 biosynthesis after undergoing a hydroxylation reaction at this position. These results are consistent with the involvement of GonCM in l-axenose biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a02). Likewise, compound 5 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a04.941\u00a0min, m/z 1487.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+], produced by strain \u0394gonD3 (Fig.\u00a03a), was also purified and subjected to NMR analysis (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S2), confirming that, as expected from the hypothetical 2,6DOH biosynthetic pathways outlined in Fig.\u00a02, this product structurally derives from PM100117 by lacking the third sugar moiety, l-rhodinose. The estimated molecular mass for compounds 6 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.721\u00a0min, m/z 297 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 7 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.796\u00a0min, m/z 239 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] from strain \u0394gonE was strikingly low in comparison to that of the parental products, suggesting that these compounds might not be related to PM100117/18 biosynthesis. However, structure elucidation (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S3) revealed that 6 corresponds to the naphthoquinone chromophore, while 7 is the precursor of 6 to which a propionate side chain is incorporated (Fig.\u00a03b). Masses displayed by compounds 8 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.012\u00a0min, m/z 1457.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 9 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.098\u00a0min, m/z 1441.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+], fitted with PM100117 lacking both l-rhodinose as third sugar moiety and oxygenations at C16 and/or C17. Nonetheless, neither these structural features nor the configuration of the sugar moieties presumably present in 8 and 9 have been further confirmed because the low production level and high instability of these products, which made impossible the purification of quantities suitable for NMR analysis. On the other hand, mutant \u0394gonR1 produced PM100117/18 at similar levels to those observed in wild type S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A (Fig.\u00a03a), indicating that this gene is not essential for PM100117/18 2,6DOHs biosynthesis. It is important to note the presence in the PM100117/18 gene cluster of an additional putative NDP-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose reductase gene, gonR2 (Fig.\u00a01b). We set to determine whether this gene codes for the 4-ketoreductase activity presumably involved in the final biosynthesis step of the three PM100117/18 2,6DOHs (Fig.\u00a02). Nevertheless, after recurrent attempts, we fail to produce a gonR2 deletion mutant. As an alternative approach, gonR2 was cloned under the control of the ermE*p promoter to produce pCgonR2, which was introduced in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A. The metabolic profile of the resultant strain, OEgonR2, was then analyzed by UPLC, showing no differences with respect to wild type strain, GUA-pSETH, carrying the respective empty plasmid (Additional file 3: Fig. S2).Fig.\u00a03Production of PM100117 (1) and PM100118 (2) derivatives 3\u20139 in 2,6-DOH biosynthesis gene mutant strains. a UPLC analysis (254\u00a0nm) of metabolite production in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A wild-type and \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3, \u0394gonE and \u0394gonR1 deletion mutants.

NR: peak non-related to PM100117/18. b Chemical structure of various PM100117/18 analogues", "Deletion of glycosyltransferase genes", "The PM100117/18 biosynthesis gene cluster contains four ORFs (gonG1, gonG2, gonG3 and gonG4) coding for putative GT proteins [32], each of which might be involved in transfer of at least one DOH moiety to a defined position of PM100117/18. As additional route to produce PM100117/18 structural analogues, we pursued to manipulate 2,6DOH transfer to the PM100117/18 macrolactone aglycone by independently deleting these putative GT genes. Thus, we produced mutant strains \u0394gonG1, \u0394gonG2, \u0394gonG3 and \u0394gonG4. Metabolite production of these strains was examined as described above. It is known that loss of the naphthoquinone chromophore unit causes a shift in the PM100117/18 maximum absorption wavelength from 254 to 216\u00a0nm [32]. Thereby, since deletion of GT genes could lead to glycosylation pattern changes involving loss of this structural element, screening for novel derivatives entailed the analysis of chromatograms at both wavelengths. Deletion of gonG1 or gonG2 abolished PM100117/18 production (Fig.\u00a04a) and induced the accumulation of various potential analogues with a maximum absorption wavelength at 216\u00a0nm, hence lacking the naphthoquinone moiety (Fig.\u00a04b). HPLC/MS analysis showed that novel compounds produced by strain \u0394gonG1 possess masses corresponding to different variations of the PM100117/18 non-glycosylated aglycone, while masses of those produced by mutant strain \u0394gonG2 matched putative PM100117/18 analogues lacking the second 2,6DOH moiety. Structural elucidation by NMR (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S4 and S5) revealed that compound 10 (UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a03.808\u00a0min, m/z 957.6 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) from \u0394gonG1 indeed corresponded to the PM100117/18 aglycone, while 11 (UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a03.842\u00a0min, m/z 1102.4 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) and 12 (UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a03.905\u00a0min, m/z 1117.7 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) from strain \u0394gonG2 were PM100117/18 derivatives retaining only the first sugar moiety, l-axenose (Fig.\u00a04c). These results implicate the GTs GonG1 and GonG2 in transfer of the first and second 2,6DOH moiety, respectively, during PM100117/18 biosynthesis. UPLC and HPLC/MS analysis of \u0394gonG3 metabolite biosynthesis showed the production of derivative 5 (Fig.\u00a04b) as well as an additional compound, 13 (UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.143\u00a0min, m/z 1471.8 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+), with absorption (254\u00a0nm) and mass spectra compatible with a PM100118 derivative lacking the third sugar moiety. Confirmation of this structure by NMR analysis (Fig.\u00a04c; Additional file 2) endorsed the involvement of the GT GonG3 in transfer of the third 2,6DOH, l-rhodinose. Lastly, deletion of gonG4 did not show any effect either on PM100117/18 biosynthesis, which were produced at comparable levels to those observed in the wild type strain S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A, or on the accumulation of novel PM100117/18 derivatives (Fig.\u00a04a, b). The study of the possible role of this gene in PM100117/18 biosynthesis is addressed in section below.Fig.\u00a04Production of PM100117 (1) and PM100118 (2) biosynthesis intermediates 10\u201313 in glycosyltransferase gene mutant strains.

NR: peak non-related to PM100117/18. c Chemical structure of various PM100117/18 analogues", "We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the possible functional role of the putative GT GonG4. Firstly, a precise quantification of PM100117/18 production in strain \u0394gonG4 and wild type S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A confirmed that gonG4 deletion has no impact on the production level of these compounds, suggesting that putative GT GonG4 might not be involved in their biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a05a). To assess the potential of GonG4 to transfer 2,6DOHs to PM100117/18, we increased its presence in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A by over-expressing gonG4 using the integrative plasmid pSGonG4. Precise UPLC-based quantification of PM100117/18 production in the resultant strain, OEgonG4, did not show any change with respect to the wild type strain (Fig.\u00a05b; Additional file 3: Fig. S3a). Next, we reasoned that, under certain conditions, transfer of 2-deoxy-l-fucose and l-rhodinose as second 2,6DOH units to form PM100117 and PM100118, respectively, might involve two different GTs. However no potential derivative containing the second sugar moiety was detected when gonG4 was over-expressed in \u0394gonG2 (Additional file 3: Fig. S3b). On the other hand, a defensive function consisting of transferring of glucose units to antibiotic agents, which as a result become inactivated, has been proposed for several GTs [33\u201335]. Notwithstanding, the involvement of GonG4 in PM100117/18 inactivation by glycosylation has not been proven by experiments consisting of gonG4 over-expression and subsequent feeding with PM100118. Therefore, the role of gonG4 on PM100117/18, if any, remains elusive.Fig.\u00a05Analysis of GonG4 functional role on PM100117 and PM100118 biosynthesis. a Determination of PM100117/18 UPLC peak areas in strains S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A (white bars) and \u0394gonG4 (grey bars). b\nPeak area quantification of PM100117/18 in strains GUA-pSETH (white bars) and OEgonG4 (grey bars).
