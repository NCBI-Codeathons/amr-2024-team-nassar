["Results", "Functional analysis of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. cinnamoneus", "Having generated and analysed a draft genome sequence of the bicyclomycin producer S. cinnamoneus, we had identified as candidates to direct bicyclomycin biosynthesis the same genes as those identified by other groups studying this topic11\u201313. These genes constitute a cluster composed of a CDPS gene, five genes encoding 2-oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenases (2OG/Fe dioxygenases), one gene encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, and one gene encoding a transporter belonging to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) (Fig.\u00a01b). The cluster is flanked by genes with divergent functions that are not involved in bicyclomycin production, including genes with predicted roles in chitin degradation or the biosynthesis of an unrelated polyketide.", "To provide unambiguous evidence for the involvement of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and decipher the role of individual genes in bicyclomycin biosynthesis, we attempted recombinant gene expression by introducing the complete gene cluster into Streptomyces coelicolor (strain M1154) or Streptomyces lividans (strain TK24). For these experiments, a plasmid encoding the complete bcm gene cluster was generated (pJWe14; Fig.\u00a01b). The introduction of pJWe14 into M1154 or TK24 did not result in the heterologous production of bicyclomycin, even though for each strain, nine different culture media were tested (data not shown).", "We therefore decided to investigate the role of the bcm cluster directly in S. cinnamoneus. Accordingly, we tested ten culture media for bicyclomycin (1) production by S. cinnamoneus and observed that only growth in MP514 resulted in reliable amounts detected in culture supernatants by HPLC/ELSD (Fig.\u00a02b); the chemical standard (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Ref. sc-391755) was used for comparison (Fig.\u00a02a). In these culture conditions, bicyclomycin production began after two days and the amount increased over an eleven-day period (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1). Deletion of the whole bcm cluster from S. cinnamoneus (\u0394bcm::aphII mutant, Supplementary methods) abolished bicyclomycin production (Fig.\u00a02c). Furthermore, bicyclomycin production could be restored in the mutant S. cinnamoneus strain using the pJWe14 vector which carries the entire bcm cluster in its native configuration (Figs.\u00a02d,e).Figure 2Analysis of bicyclomycin production by S. cinnamoneus strains.

As chromosomal gene deletion is difficult and time-consuming in S. cinnamoneus, the pJWe14 vector appeared an excellent tool to study the bcm cluster. By PCR-targetting followed by excision of the resistance cassette used for gene replacement, we constructed in E. coli a set of pJWe14 derivatives, each of them with an in-frame deletion of one of the bcm biosynthetic gene, from bcmA to bcmG. To avoid as much as possible effect on downstream gene expression and to preserve translation signals and possible promoters, the first 30 nucleotides and the last 90 nucleotides of each gene were conserved in the in-frame deletion mutants. These derivatives were then introduced into the S. cinnamoneus \u0394bcm::aphII mutant. The culture supernatants of each \u0394bcm::aphII mutant harbouring modified bcm BGCs were analysed by HPLC/ELSD. Deletion of each of the six predicted biosynthetic genes bcmB-G resulted in the abolishment of bicyclomycin production. Furthermore, we constructed a vector expressing the bcmA gene alone under the control of its native promoter and showed that it rescued cIL (2) production. LC/MS analysis demonstrated that the accumulated metabolite has a retention time, m/z value and fragmentation pattern similar to an authentic standard of 2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2 and Supplementary Table\u00a0S1\n15,16). No other cyclodipeptide was detected in this experiment. Taken together, these data suggest that each of the seven genes from bcmA to bcmG is required for bicyclomycin biosynthesis. A representative chromatogram from this study is shown in Fig.\u00a02f, chromatograms corresponding to all deletion mutants are presented in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3.", "In vivo characterization of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic pathway", "HPLC chromatograms corresponding to the culture supernatants of S. cinnamoneus \u0394bcm::aphII harbouring an ectopic copy of the bcm BGC intact or with in-frame deletion of each of the genes encoding tailoring enzymes (bcmB, C, D, E, F, or G) were analysed. They showed the appearance of additional peaks in the case of chromatograms corresponding to the different mutants (e.g. Fig.\u00a02f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3). LC/MS/MS analyses of the same samples allowed the detection of several products whose fragmentation patterns indicate that they are related to the bicyclomycin scaffold (Supplementary Data Sheet\u00a01). These products could be intermediates in bicyclomycin biosynthesis, as previously detected by Bradley et al. for intermediates 2 and 310 or shunt products resulting from the promiscuous activity of some tailoring enzymes on substrate analogues that accumulate in the absence of proper metabolic flux. Some of these products were also detected in trace amounts by LC/MS analysis in the culture supernatants of S. cinnamoneus \u0394bcm::aphII harbouring an intact copy of the bcm BGC. We considered that only these products were intermediates in bicyclomycin biosynthesis (Table\u00a01).Table 1Bicyclomycin and major putative intermediates of its biosynthesis.

Intermediate 2 specifically accumulates in the bcmE-deleted mutant supernatant, suggesting the involvement of BcmE in the first modification of 2. We also detected and identified intermediate 3 thanks to its molecular weight and fragmentation pattern, consistent with previous reports (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1, Supplementary Data Sheet\u00a01)10. As 3 is observed specifically in the supernatant of the bcmF-deleted mutant, we could assign BcmF the role of dehydrogenation of the isoleucyl side chain of 3 to produce bicyclomycin (1). Comparison of the compounds detected in the different strain supernatants enabled us to identify two compounds of molecular weight 288 (products 4 and c2, Supplementary Data Sheet\u00a01), likely to be the penultimate precursor to bicyclomycin. They are both present in trace amounts in the presence of the whole cluster and in the bcmF-deleted strain, and in quantifiable amounts in terms of UV214 peak area in the bcmD-deleted strain. Similarly, product 5 of molecular weight 274, is the only product found in both the whole-cluster-harbouring strain and the bcmF-, bcmD- and bcmB-deleted strains. It specifically accumulates in the bcmB-deleted strain, suggesting that BcmB catalyses the reaction from 5 to 4 (or to c2, see the next section). A unique compound, product 6, whose molecular weight of 258 is compatible with the role of precursor to 5, is found in both the whole-cluster-harbouring strain and the bcmG-deleted strain. Product c4 (molecular weight of 256), which also accumulates in the bcmG-deleted strain was not considered a priori as an intermediate to bicyclomycin, as it contains a further dehydrogenation not compatible with 5 as the next intermediate. The last intermediate would be product 7 (molecular weight of 242), which accumulates in the bcmC-deleted strain and is also present in varying amounts in the whole-cluster-harbouring strain and the bcmG-, bcmD- and bcmB-deleted strains.", "All together, our in vivo results allowed to propose the sequence in which each Bcm enzyme is involved in the pathway of biosynthesis, consistent with the generation of a highly oxidized cyclic dipeptide. This sequence is in agreement with recently reported in vitro studies12. The candidate intermediates are listed in Table\u00a01 by ascending molecular weight values derived from LC/MS experiments (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1, Supplementary Data sheet\u00a01).", "The fragmentation pattern of MS2, MS3 and MS4 data (Supplementary Data Sheet\u00a01) also allowed making hypotheses on the reactions catalysed by Bcm enzymes, as explained in Supplementary information \u00a71.3. However, ambiguities remained for some of these reactions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4). These hypotheses are compatible with data reported previously12.", "In vitro characterization of the cIL tailoring pathway and stereochemical analysis of some intermediates", "In order to correlate the biosynthetic intermediates identified from in vivo analyses to the compounds previously identified in in vitro studies12, we characterized the activity of the tailoring enzymes BcmB, BcmC, BcmD, BcmE, BcmF and BcmG in vitro. An N-terminal histidine-tagged recombinant form of each protein was produced in E. coli and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. Single or multiple purified enzymes were reacted with cIL (2) or purified intermediates. The reaction mixtures and purified products were analysed by HPLC and ESI/MS, respectively (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0S5\u2013S8). The fragmentation patterns of the products obtained in vitro were compared to those of the products detected in vivo with mutant strains to check their concordance (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). The final assignments of product structures were determined by 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Figs.\u00a0S9\u2013S20). In addition to planar chemical structure elucidation, NMR analysis yielded information on the stereochemistry of compounds (Fig.\u00a03). The observation of NOEs between H\u03b1 protons in DKP ring indicated a syn orientation of amino acid side chains for products 2, 5, 6 and 7. The determination of the configuration of new stereogenic centres in products 5 and 4 also relied on a NOE- and J-based NMR strategy17\u201319. The stereochemical analysis was based on the Karplus-type dihedral angle dependence of homonuclear vicinal coupling constants (3JH,H) and heteronuclear coupling constants (3JC,H). In addition, two-bond carbon-proton coupling constants (2JC,H) provided useful conformational and configurational information in oxygen-substituted two-carbon fragments. The results are summarized in Table\u00a02 and detailed below.

MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the product of the BcmE-catalysed transformation of 2 did correspond to 7 (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1), which accumulated in supernatants of the \u0394bcmC strain. Finally, NMR analyses confirmed that BcmE catalyses the hydroxylation of cIL at the Ile C\u03b4 to form 7. Neither BcmF nor BcmB were able to transform cIL (data not shown).

To test the role of BcmH in bicyclomycin export in the producing organism, the bcmH gene was inactivated on the pJWe14 plasmid, yielding pMC16. As a precautionary measure against the loss of an indispensable self-resistance gene, another plasmid, pJWe21, carrying the bcmH gene under the control of its native promoter was also constructed. We then attempted the construction of two strains derived from the \u0394bcm mutant: one containing only pMC16, the other containing pJWe21 and pMC16. As these two strains were obtained, we then compared bicyclomycin production by both strains. Similar amounts of bicyclomycin were found in the culture supernatants of both strains (Fig.\u00a04). We also examined by HPLC cell-free extracts of both strains and no bicyclomycin was detected.

The results (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S21) show that while the bcm biosynthetic genes (bcmA-G) are transcribed, bcmH is not. These gene expression data are in agreement with the nonessential phenotype observed for the bcmH-deleted strain during bicyclomycin production."]
