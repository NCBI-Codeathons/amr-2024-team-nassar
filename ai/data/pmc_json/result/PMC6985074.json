["Results", "Genetic Manipulation of Nonomuraea coxensis, a Novel Putative Producer of a A40926-Like Molecule", "According to the 16S rRNA gene-based reconstruction of Nonomuraea phylogeny (Dalmastri et al., 2016), N. coxensis occupies a relatively distant position from N. gerenzanensis. Conversely, mining the partially sequenced genome of N. coxensis (ASM37988v1), we found a close homolog of the N. gerenzanensis regulatory gene dbv3 (locus A3G7_RS0138355 in the N. coxensis genome, coding for WP_020547054.1 with 86.6% predicted amino acid sequence identity with Dbv3, ESM Figure 1). Dbv3 is a unique LuxR-regulator controlling the expression of the A40926 BGC and it is not closely related to the better-characterized family of Tei16*-like regulators controlling teicoplanin biosynthesis, sharing only 32% of amino acid sequence identity with Tei16* (Yushchuk et al., 2019). This dbv3-like gene (we named it nocRI) was found on a short N. coxensis contig (NZ_KB904006) flanking a gene coding for a putative StrR-like transcriptional regulator apparently orthologous to dbv4 (locus A3G7_RS0138355, coding for WP_026215141.1 with 94.39% of amino acid sequence identity with Dbv4); dbv4 is the other known cluster-situated regulatory gene in the dbv BGC and we named the N. coxensis homolog nocRII (ESM Figure 2). AntiSMASH (Blin et al., 2019) analysis of N. coxensis genome revealed the presence of three short contigs (NZ_KB904006, NZ_KB903995, NZ_KB903969, ESM Figure 3) covering the majority of a dbv-like BGC, suggesting that N. coxensis might produce A40926 or a very similar GPA. Thus, we considered N. coxensis an interesting candidate for developing Nonomuraea-targeted genetic tools.", "Figure 1Comparison of GusA activity in recombinant strains of N. gerenzanensis\n(A) and N. coxensis\n(B), carrying the following promoter-probe vectors: 2, 2* \u2013 pTEGA (gusA under the control of ermEp); 3, 3* \u2013 pSAGA (gusA under the control of aac(3)IVp); 4, 4* \u2013 pHBP (gusA under the control of hrdBngp); 5, 5* \u2013 pRBP2 (gusA under the control of rpoBRngp); 6, 6* \u2013 pRBP1 (gusA under the control of rpoBngp); 7, 7* \u2013 pSBP (gusA under the control of ssbngp); 8, 8* \u2013 pRLP (gusA under the control of rpsLngp); 9, 9* \u2013 pGUSmoeE5script (gusA under the control of moeE5p); 10, 10* \u2013 pGT2p (gusA under the control of tei2p); 11, 11* \u2013 pGBP (gusA under the control of gyrBngp); 12, 12* \u2013 pGCymRP21 (gusA under the control of P21-cmt).

Transconjugants were obtained at a very low frequency (ca. 1 \u00d7 10\u22127) and only for the relatively small pSAGA-based promoter-probe vectors (approx. 6 kbp). Increasing the amount of donor and recipient cells, changing the time of overlay, and adjusting medium composition (including increasing or decreasing MgCl2 concentration) did not allow the transfer of the larger pGUS-based promoter-probe vectors (such as pGUSmoeE5script or pGCymRP21, both more than 9 kbp). Since, unlike N. gerenzanensis, N. coxensis sporulates abundantly when grown on ISP3 agar medium (ESM Figure 4), we tried to use spores for conjugal transfer. This resulted in transfer rates of approximately 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 when 106 spores were mixed with 107\nE. coli donor cells, regardless of plasmid size.", "Figure 4Time courses of N. gerenzanensis pSET152A+\n(A) and recombinant strains overexpressing dbv3\n(B), dbv4\n(C) and co-expressing both genes (D) cultivated in FM2 industrial medium in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.

Glucuronidase activity of the recombinant Nonomuraea strains was assessed qualitatively (on agar plates) and quantitatively (in cell lysates obtained from mycelium grown in liquid medium). Both of the N. coxensis and N. gerenzanensis wild type strains did not display any glucuronidase activity (Figure 1). The heterologous promoters tested were: aac(3)IVp (in pSAGA) \u2013 the apramycin acetyltransferase gene promoter, derived from pSET152A (Horbal et al., 2013); ermEp (in pTEGA, Yushchuk et al., 2020a) \u2013 the erythromycin resistance gene promoter from pTES (Herrmann et al., 2012); moeE5p (in pGUSmoeE5script) \u2013 the S. ghanaensis moenomycin biosynthesis gene moeE5 promoter (Makitrynskyy et al., 2013); tei2p (pGT2p, Yushchuk et al., 2020b) \u2013 the A. teichomyceticus teicoplanin resistance gene tei2 promoter; and P21, a synthetic promoter fused with the cumate inducible Pseudomonas putida F1 cmt operon operator (in pGCymRP21, Horbal et al., 2014a). In parallel, we tested the activity of six native promoters derived from N. gerenzanensis house-keeping genes: gyrBngp (in pGBP \u2013 the promoter of the DNA gyrase B subunit gene); hrdBngp (in pHBP \u2013 the promoter of the RNA polymerase \u03c3-factor RpoD gene); ssbngp (in pSBP \u2013 the promoter of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein); rpsLngp (in pRLP \u2013 the promoter of the SSU ribosomal protein S12p gene); rpoBRngp (in pRBP2 \u2013 the promoter of the rifamycin-resistant RNA polymerase subunit \u03b2 gene); and rpoBngp (in pRBP1 \u2013 the promoter of the rifamycin-sensitive RNA polymerase subunit \u03b2 gene). In contrast to the wild type strains, all of the recombinant derivatives grown on VM0.1 agar plates converted X-Gluc to its colored derivative 5,5\u2032-dibromo-4,4\u2032-dichloro-indigo, albeit to different extents (Figure 1). N. gerenzanensis pSAGA+ and N. coxensis pSAGA+, carrying aac(3)IVp, produced the most intensive color (Figures 1A,B), while the chromogenic conversion of X-Gluc in N. gerenzanensis pTEGA+ and N. coxensis pTEGA+, carrying the ermEp, was only slightly visible. In strains carrying the inducible pGCymRP21, GusA activity was induced by the addition of 50 \u03bcM of cumate, proving inducible gene expression (Figures 1A,B). However, in N. gerenzanensis pGCymRP21+, a basal level of GusA activity was detected even in the absence of cumate (Figure 1A). Contrary to this, no basal level of expression from P21-cmt was detected in N. coxensis pGCymRP21+ (Figure 1B).", "When the glucuronidase activity present in cell lysates obtained from liquid cultures grown for 120 h (late exponential/early stationary growth phase, see ESM Figure 5) was measured using a spectrophotometric assay, overall these quantitative results (normalized for the dry weight of the differently growing strains) correlated with those observed on agar plates: aac(3)IVp behaved as a strong promoter in both N. gerenzanensis and N. coxensis, surpassed only by cmt-P21p when induced by the addition of 50 \u03bcM cumate (Figures 2A,B). Also rpsLngp and hrdBngp proved to be strong promoters in both of the Nonomuraea spp. whereas the weakest was the ermEp (Figures 2A,B). Interestingly, the activity of rpoBngP was higher than that of rpoBRngp (Figures 1, 2), consistent with previously reported data about differences in transcription levels of the two alleles (Vigliotta et al., 2004).", "Figure 5Time courses of N. gerenzanensis pSET152A+\n(A) and recombinant strains, overexpressing dbv3\n(B), dbv4\n(C) and co-expressing both genes (D) cultivated in 2 l FM2 industrial medium in a 3 l fermenter.

Glucose consumption (filled rectangles), biomass accumulation (filled rhombi), pH (circles), O2 level (filled circles), and A40926 production were monitored every 24 h.", "Knowledge-Based Generation of A40926 Overproducing Strains", "Since aac(3)IVp was identified as the strongest constitutive promoter for Nonomuraea spp., we used it to overexpress dbv3 and dbv4 in N. gerenzanensis. Both genes were cloned into the integrative pSET152A vector (Horbal et al., 2013) yielding the recombinant vectors pSAD3 and pSAD4, respectively (Table 1). Benefiting from the neighboring positions of dbv3 and dbv4, we also cloned them together, generating pSAD3\u20134, where dbv4 was directly under the control of aac(3)IVp, but dbv3 remained under the control of its native promoter (Table 1). Additionally, the dbv3-like nocRI from N. coxensis was cloned into pSET152A, generating pSAR1, and transferred to N. gerenzanensis to determine if it could improve A40926 production, and to assess possible cross-talk between the regulators from the two different Nonomuraea spp. All the N. gerenzanensis recombinant strains were grown for 120 h in parallel with the control strain carrying the empty vector and A40926 production was measured (Figure 3). The production of A40926 in N. gerenzanensis carrying pSET152A reached almost 250 mg/l after 120 h of cultivation (Figure 3). The four recombinant strains overexpressing the cluster-situated regulatory genes produced more antibiotic than the control strain (Figure 3). A40926 production in N. gerenzanensis pSAD3+ and pSAR1+ was comparable (ca. 500 mg/l), proving that nocRI had a similar impact in N. gerenzanensis as dbv3. The recombinant strain carrying pSAD3\u20134 vector produced slightly more, around 550 mg/l, whereas the best producer in these conditions was the strain overexpressing dbv4, which produced more than 650 mg/l.", "Time Courses of A40926 Production in Nonomuraea gerenzanensis Recombinant Strains at Flask and at Bioreactor Scale", "Although further investigations will be devoted to the expression of the heterologous nocRI and nocRII in N. gerenzanensis, in our strain improvement work we then focused on N. gerenzanensis strains overexpressing native regulators. Consequently, N. gerenzanensis strains containing pSET152A, pSAD3, pSAD4, or pSAD3\u20134 were grown for 192 h in parallel with the control strain carrying the empty vector using the previously optimized industrial medium FM2 (Marcone et al., 2010a, 2014) at flask scale. Samples for the analysis of dry weight, pH, glucose consumption, and A40926 production were collected at regular 24 h intervals. All three recombinant strains expressing the regulatory genes from aac(3)IVp accumulated detectable amounts of A40926 earlier than the empty vector control (Figure 4). A40926 production reached its peak after 120 h of growth for N. gerenzanensis pSAD3+ (ca. 500 mg/l) (Figure 4B) and pSAD4+ (nearly 650 mg/l) (Figure 4C), whereas in pSAD3\u20134+ the maximum productivity (ca. 600 mg/l) was delayed to 144 h (Figure 4D). The control strain produced ca. 300 mg/l after 144\u2013168 h from inoculation (Figure 4A). Although glucose consumption was faster in the recombinant strains containing the cloned regulatory genes in comparison to the control, they accumulated less biomass than N. gerenzanensis pSET152A+ (Figure 4). Maximum biomass production was around 125 g/l (dry weight) in the overexpression strains versus the 175 g/l produced by the empty vector control strain. These data suggest that part of the consumed glucose was used by the strains carrying the regulatory genes under the control of the strong constitutive promoter aac(3)IVp to support antibiotic production at the detriment of biomass formation.", "When the cultivation of recombinant strains was scaled up in 3 l vessel-bioreactors containing 2 l working volume of FM2, all of the strains produced significantly more A40926 and grew better than in flask culture with the exception of N. gerenzanensis pSAD3+ (Figure 5). The control strain with the empty vector grew and produced the antibiotic faster than at the flask level (Figure 5A). Maximum biomass (300 g/l dry weight, more than the double of that achieved in flasks) and A40926 production (nearly 400 mg/l) were reached after 120 h from inoculation; glucose was completely consumed within 96 h versus the 120 h needed at flask level. The recombinant strain pSAD4+ grew more (maximum biomass production of 220 g/l after 144 h of growth) than in flask culture, although less than the control strain in the bioreactor. Glucose was consumed faster than in the control strain and glucose concentration tended to zero at 48 h of fermentation (Figure 5C), and antibiotic production reached a peak of 700 mg/l after 168 h. The best performance in terms of A40926 productivity in the bioreactor was shown by the pSAD3\u20134+ strain, which grew better (nearly 250 g/l dry weight biomass) than in flask culture and produced the maximum concentration of the antibiotic (800 mg/l) after 168 h of cultivation (Figure 5D). Conversely, the pSAD3+ strain showed a reduced biomass production in comparison to all of the other strains, with consumption of glucose markedly delayed and A40926 production starting very late (after 168 h of cultivation) and never exceeding 100 mg/l (Figure 5B). Microscopical observation of pSAD3+ strain showed that the mycelium was highly fragmented (data not shown), suggesting some kind of physiological stress resulting from dbv3 overexpression. Some fragmentation of the pSAD3+ strain (as well as of the pSAR1 strain carrying the dbv3-like nocRI from N. coxensis) was also observed in flask culture, in contrast to the other strains which produced dense mycelial pellets; the fragmentation was less pronounced, indicating that scaling up in the bioreactor dramatically enhanced this effect. Interestingly, in the best performer at the bioreactor scale \u2013 the pSAD3\u20134+ strain \u2013 dbv4 was expressed from the strong constitutive aac(3)IVp but dbv3 was left under its endogenous promoter, suggesting that the balance between the expression level of the two cluster-situated regulatory genes is important for optimal improvement of A40926 production."]
