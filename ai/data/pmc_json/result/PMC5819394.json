["Results", "Systematic Deletion of One or More of the Methyltransferase Genes genN, genD1, and genK Reveals Alternative Minor Pathways for Methylation.", "Commercial samples of gentamicin C complex obtained by fermentation contain variable amounts of minor gentamicin metabolites as impurities. Careful analysis has detected as many as 21 such minor products in a single sample (27). For 6 of these, the structure could be determined by MS and MSn methods, and structures could also be proposed for 13 others (27). In previous work it has been shown that levels of certain metabolites with altered methylation patterns are enhanced upon deletion of either genN (19, 28) or genK (20). We therefore set out systematically to alter the complement of known methyltransferase genes and to study the metabolites produced.", "First, the single mutants of genN and genD1, which were constructed in our previous studies (19, 20), were used to generate the series of mutants \u0394genD1\u0394genN, \u0394genD1\u0394genK, \u0394genN\u0394genK, and \u0394genD1\u0394genK\u0394genN. In these mutants, an internal fragment has been deleted in-frame, respectively, from genN, genD1, and genK. These mutants were confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting and then fermented (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A\u2013D). The extracts were analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-HRMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).", "The triple-mutant \u0394genD1\u0394genK\u0394genN produced small amounts of 2 (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S2A and S3A) (19), the upstream precursor of gentamicin A (3) (Figs. 1 and 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). NMR data confirmed the structure of 2 as a nonmethylated species as previously proposed (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A and Table S1). The intermediate 1 (Figs. 1 and 2A) was present as the major species, but no other gentamicin-related metabolite was present. The \u0394genD1\u0394genK mutant produced 1 and 3 (Figs. 1 and 2B), but no other methylated intermediates or other gentamicins. These results confirm that GenN is essential for the methylation on 3\u2032\u2032-N of 2. In extracts of the \u0394genN\u0394genK mutant, intermediates 1 and 2 were detected at levels similar to those in the triple mutant, but an additional compound with the same molecular mass as 3 was observed, singly methylated on 3\u2032\u2032-N (Figs. 1 and 2C). Given the known regiospecificity of GenD1 (19), the site of modification is proposed to be at C-4\u2032\u2032 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). This metabolite, named here gentamicin A-1 (6) (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S2C), has been described as a trace component of a wild-type fermentation (27). In the extract of the \u0394genD1\u0394genN mutant, 2 was detected at levels similar to those in the triple mutant along with two 6\u2032-C-methylated metabolites (Fig. 2D). One of these is formed as a result of the precocious action of GenK on 2 and is named here gentamicin A-2 (7) (Figs. 1 and 2D and SI Appendix, Figs. S2D and S3B and Table S1). It is assumed to have the same relative configuration at C-6\u2032 as 5 (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S2E) and has also been previously described as a trace component of a wild-type fermentation (26). The second metabolite A2e (8) (Figs. 1 and 2D and SI Appendix, Fig. S2F) is formed by the known precocious action of GenK on 1 (19, 24).", "Fig. 2.LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of gentamicin-related intermediates from mutant strains. Extracted ion chromatogram of intermediates in (A) \u0394genD1\u0394genK\u0394genN, (B) \u0394genD1\u0394genK, (C) \u0394genN\u0394genK, (D) \u0394genD1\u0394genN, (E) \u0394genK, (F) \u0394genD1, and (G) \u0394genN.", "LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of gentamicin-related intermediates from mutant strains.

The \u0394genK mutant produced 3 and 4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2G) as expected but only a trace of the metabolite we have assigned as 6 (Figs. 1 and 2E), confirming that GenD1 fails to compete successfully with GenN for methylation of 2. The \u0394genD1 mutant in contrast produced a relatively large amount of the known doubly methylated metabolite gentamicin Ae (9) (Figs. 1 and 2F and SI Appendix, Fig. S2H) (19, 27), again a consequence of the precocious action of GenK. We confirmed the structure of 9 by NMR (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C and Table S1). The \u0394genN mutant produced low levels of 2, but mainly produced 1, as well as the singly methylated species 6, 7, 8, and an intermediate with the same molecular mass and MS/MS fragmentation as 9, which we name here gentamicin X2-1 (10) (Figs. 1 and 2G and SI Appendix, Fig. S2I). This compound, which has also been described as a trace component of wild-type gentamicin fermentation (27), is most likely methylated at both C-4\u2033 and C-6\u2032 positions. Another compound with the same molecular mass and MS/MS fragmentation as 10 was also observed, named here X2-1-i, which may be an isomer of it (Fig. 2G and SI Appendix, Fig. S2I). These species with various methylation patterns suggest a metabolic network in the pathway, in which methylations at the three sites occur relatively independently of each other rather than in a strictly fixed order.", "Bioconversion in Vivo and in Vitro of Gentamicin Metabolites Confirms the Selectivity of Methylation by GenN, GenD1, and GenK.", "Established gentamicin intermediates 2, 3, and 4 as well as gentamicin metabolites with altered methylation patterns 6, 7, 9, and 10 were isolated from the mutants described above, as described in Materials and Methods (SI Appendix). We aimed to interrogate directly the ability of individual methyltransferases to use these compounds as substrates and verify which of the possible conversions in the methylation network actually occur. To do this, the gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster (GenBank accession no. KY971520) from grmB to genN was knocked out by deletion of a 40,524-bp fragment to generate the \u0394BN mutant, which was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S1E). Complementation of the \u0394BN mutant by using plasmid pWHU91 (SI Appendix, Table S2) containing genN and gmrA under the control of the PermE* promoter, respectively, generated \u0394BN::gmrA+genN (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B and Table S3). In parallel, \u0394BN::gmrA+genD1 and \u0394BN::gmrA+genK were constructed in the same way with pWHU92 and pWHU93 (SI Appendix, Figs. S5 C and D, and Table S3). The gene gmrA that confers gentamicin self-resistance was present to avoid toxicity of gentamicin metabolites in the host strain. The strain \u0394BN::gmrA was constructed as a negative control by using pWHU90 (SI Appendix, Table S2), which contains gmrA only, under the control of the constitutive PermE* promoter (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A).", "The results from LC-ESI-HRMS and MS/MS showed that feeding either 2, 3 (the normal substrate), 7, or 9 to \u0394BN::gmrA+genD1 led to detectable methylation, which is presumed to be at C-4\u2033 (Fig. 3A). Likewise, feeding 2, 3, or 4 (the normal substrate) to \u0394BN::gmrA+genK in each case led to detectable methylation (presumed to be at C-6\u2032) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, feeding of 6 to this strain did not produce 10. Meanwhile, feeding of 2 (the normal substrate) to \u0394BN::gmrA+genN generated 3, and feeding of 7 to this strain generated 9 (Fig. 3C). However, neither 6 nor 10 were methylated in this strain.", "Fig. 3.Production of gentamicin intermediates in feeding experiments.

It appeared therefore that the enzyme catalyzing the terminal 6\u2032-N-methylation step must be encoded by a gene outside the limits of the known cluster. Also, cell-free lysate of M. echinospora \u0394BN was shown to carry out this conversion in the presence of SAM, and the enzymatic activity proved stable to initial fractionation using selective ammonium sulfate precipitation. We therefore contemplated searching for the elusive terminal methyltransferase by two parallel routes, one by conventional enzyme purification from M. echinospora and the other by bioinformatic analysis of genome sequence followed by the cloning and testing of plausible candidates. In the end, the genome-assisted approach proved quicker.", "The whole-genome sequence of M. echinospora ATCC15835 was determined and assembled as described in Materials and Methods. To identify candidate genes for the methylation at 6\u2032-N of C1a and C2, we chose the protein sequences of two authentic aminoglycoside N-methyltransferases as probes. One of these was IstU, which is proposed to catalyze an analogous 6\u2032-N-methylation step during biosynthesis of istamycin in Streptomyces tenjimariensis (12, 16). Four candidate genes\u2014orf0086, orf1678, orf12159, and orf3626 (GenBank accession nos. MF036116, MF036117, MF036132, and MF036133) with 40, 36, 38, and 27% protein sequence identities, respectively, to IstU (SI Appendix, Table S4)\u2014were chosen, and each was inactivated in M. echinospora ATCC15835 through in-frame deletion. However, none of these mutants was found to abolish the methylation at 6\u2032-N.", "The second probe sequence chosen was GenN. In total, 19 candidate genes (GenBank accession nos. MF036118\u2013MF036131 and MF036134\u2013MF036138) were identified using the BLASTP program (28), with percentage sequence identities to GenN ranging from 26.67 to 40.35% (SI Appendix, Table S4). Each candidate gene was cloned into expression vector pET28a(+) in Escherichia coli, and cell extracts were assayed for their ability to catalyze SAM-dependent conversion of C2 into C1, monitored by LC-ESI-HRMS (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). The results showed that only the cell-free lysate of BL21(DE3)/pET28a(+)-genL(orf5365) transformed C2 to C1. No other candidate, including boiled BL21(DE3)/pET28a(+)-genL, catalyzed this conversion. The cell-free lysate of BL21(DE3)/pET28a(+)-genL also catalyzed the conversion of C1a to C2b significantly (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). These results strongly suggested that this enzyme, named GenL, is the elusive terminal methyltransferase catalyzing methylation on 6\u2032-N of C1a and C2. The genL (GenBank accession no. MF036122) is separated from the known gentamicin biosynthetic cluster by 2.54 Mbp.", "To confirm the function of genL, the gene was removed through in-frame deletion from the genome of M. echinospora ATCC15835. This mutant was verified through Southern blotting (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B) and then fermented, followed by LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of the extract. The results showed selective loss of the C1 and C2b components of the gentamicin C complex (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4C), confirming that genL is the unique and essential gene catalyzing 6\u2032-N-methylation on C2 and C1a in gentamicin biosynthesis. Complementation in trans with the wild-type genL gene (SI Appendix, Fig. S5E) substantially restored C1 production (60% of wild type) and gave C2b levels 240% of wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C).", "GenL Is Highly Specific for Terminal 6\u2032-N-Methylation of C1a and C2.", "Recombinant GenL was expressed as an N-terminally His6-tagged protein and purified from E. coli BLR cells as described in Materials and Methods. After affinity purification on a Co2+-NTA column and gel-filtration chromatography on Sephadex S200, GenL was essentially homogenous as judged by SDS/PAGE and eluted as a single peak of protein with an estimated Mr of 43,000, roughly consistent with its being a dimer in solution (calculated Mr of the subunit 29,000). This purified enzyme preparation was active in the conversion of both C2 to C1 and of C1a to C2b (Fig. 5 A and B), as monitored by HPLC-MS, but was inactive against C2a, the C-6\u2032 epimer of C2 (Fig. 5C).", "Fig. 5.In vitro methyltransfer activities of GenL.

The Michaelis\u2013Menten saturation curves of GenL-catalyzed methylations of C2 (D) and C1a (E) are also determined.", "In vitro methyltransfer activities of GenL.

The data were fitted to the integrated form of the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation. For C2, kcat was 0.043\u00b7s\u22121, and Km was 77.8 \u00b1 8 \u00b5M; while for C1a, kcat was 0.040\u00b7s\u22121, and Km was 346.8 \u00b1 86 \u00b5M (Fig. 5 D and E). The same assay was also used to screen several other pathway intermediates (C2a, G418, JI-20A, and JI-20B) (20), and other gentamicin-related aminoglycosides, including sisomicin, kanamycin A, kanamycin B, and tobramycin. All of these were found to be essentially inactive as substrates for GenL, except for a slow reaction with sisomicin."]
