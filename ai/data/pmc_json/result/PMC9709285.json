The largest number of endophytes was found in root tissues (20 isolates), followed by the stem (14 isolates), leaf (9 isolates), fruit (6 isolates), seed (4 isolates), and flower (one isolate). Of these isolates, 51 strains were identified at the species level, covering 28 confirmed species. The remaining genus-level isolates, including two unidentified species, may belong to new taxa.

In this study, the antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi was superior to the antifungal activity. The antimicrobial activity may be strain-specific owing to significant differences observed among strains of the same endophytic species, such as Alternaria tenuissima, Emmia latemarginata, and Neofusicoccum sp. Most endophytes exhibited broad-spectrum activities, whereas another small group did not display any antimicrobial activity, e.g., Macrophomina phaseolina and Paraphoma vinacea. Concretely, endophytes showed stronger antibacterial activity against Ba. Subtilis, and hardly any activity were observed against Py. oryzae. Although generally described as pathogens, some species as endophytic fungi also demonstrated potential antimicrobial activity, e.g., Al. tenuissima HGUP191067.
