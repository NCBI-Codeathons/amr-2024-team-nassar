["Results", "NapW and homW catalyzed reductive inactivation of NDM for self-resistance", "The oxidative reactions performed extracellularly by the secreted oxidase NapU occur at the late stage of the biosynthetic pathway, while, the chemical logic of formation of the inactivated intermediate 12 remains unclear. One functionally unassigned SDR encoded by napW in the BGC, NapW, attracts our attention, because the SDR family proteins could catalyze many different reactions including reduction of C=N bond18\u201320. To explore the function of NapW, we inactivated the napW gene by in-frame deletion and obtained the \u0394napW mutant Streptomyces lusitanus TG3022 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Compared with the metabolite profiles of the wild type (WT), the mutant still produced 1 but no other compounds (Fig.\u00a02a). This result suggested napW might not work in NDM biosynthesis or there should be other homologous gene to complete its function. Indeed, homW was found outside of the BGC by genome sequencing of NDM-producing bacteria, S. lusitanus NRRL 8034. HomW exhibits high sequence similarity (75% identity) with NapW and was speculated to play the same role as NapW. To verify the speculation, we knocked out homW gene in WT and TG3022 to acquire \u0394homW (TG3023) and \u0394napW&\u0394homW (TG3024) mutants, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). The fermentation result of \u0394homW is identical with that of \u0394napW and WT; however, the double knock-out mutant (\u0394napW&\u0394homW) eliminated the 1 production (Fig.\u00a02a). These in vivo genetic evidences suggested that napW and its orthologue gene homW could functionally compensate each other, both of them are required for NDM biosynthesis.Fig. 2Investigation of reductases NapW and homW in NDM biosynthesis.a Genetic characterization in vivo.

Given the fact that the proposed biosynthetic intermediate 10 or 11 (Fig.\u00a01c) is not available, we chose to employ 1 as the substrate to do the reduction assay (Fig.\u00a02c). In a previous work, we verified that secreted flavoprotein NapU catalyzed oxidative activation of inactive compound 2 to afford toxic product 1 extracellularly, as well as over-oxidative inactivation of 1 into 3 by controlling the concentration of 1 for self-protection17. Since 1 still exhibits the ability to diffuse into cells, we reasoned that NapW and homW should catalyze the inactivation of 1 to yield 2 for avoiding endogenous DNA alkylation. We firstly expressed two genes in Escherichia coli and purified the two proteins (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03); then carried out NapU-catalyzed reaction to acquire unstable 1, which is difficult to isolate by fermentation, and subsequently removed NapU by ultrafiltration (Fig.\u00a02c). When the purified recombinant NapW or homW was incubated with 1 in the presence of NADPH, the expected reduced compound 2 is effectively accumulated along with the disappearance of 1 (Fig.\u00a02b\u2013II, III). When the cofactor NADPH is replaced by NADH, the enzymatic efficiency was dramatically decreased (Fig.\u00a02b\u2013I). These results strongly demonstrate that NapW and homW functionally catalyze the reductive inactivation of the highly reactive iminium species, which implied that the two SDR proteins may participate in self-protection from endogenous DNA alkylation.", "To verify this assumption, we examined the relationship between these two genes and the self-resistance of the producer against NDM (1). Compared with the WT and single gene inactivation strain S. lusitanus TG3022 (\u0394napW) or TG3023 (\u0394homW), the double-deletion strain S. lusitanus TG3024 (\u0394napW&\u0394homW) exhibited obviously increased sensitivity to NDM (Fig.\u00a02d), suggesting both napW and homW as NDM resistant determinants. Therefore, the expression of napW or homW can protect S. lusitanus from cytotoxic effect when NDM is biosynthesized. We next used E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as test strain to estimate the resistance to NDM by overexpression of napW or homW in vivo. The survival ratio suggested that the recombinant strain is obviously resistant to NDM (Fig.\u00a02e). Collectively, these results unambiguously supported our proposal that the SDRs NapW and homW axiomatically endow cells resistance to NDM for self-protection.", "Structure-based enzymology of NapW-catalyzed reaction", "To probe the molecular basis of the NapW/homW-mediated self-protection, we purified the NapW protein and determined its X-ray crystal structure at 2.1\u2009\u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement method using the structure of human SDR family member one (PDB ID: 2QQ5) as searching model. The structure of NapW contains a typical Rossmann fold with seven \u03b2 sheets embraced by \u03b1 helices (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04), which is the key feature of SDR family proteins for binding cofactors21. We further obtained the structure of NapW\u00b7NADP+ binary complex by co-crystallizing NapW, NADP(H) and compound 1 or 2 (Fig.\u00a03a). Although the electron density of compound 1 or 2 was missing, the nicotinamide moiety of NADP+ shows conformational isomerism in the binary complex structure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). The binding of cofactor NADP+ enables loop 47\u201358 and loop 107\u2013119, which are too flexible to observe in apo-NapW structure, adopt stable conformation and are clearly observed. The surface of this complex reveals the adenine terminus of NADP+ is deeply buried inside NapW and the nicotinamide moiety which delivers hydrogen to substrate locates in a wide pocket on the surface (Fig.\u00a03a). We mutated several polar residues around the nicotinamide moiety to alanine and found only mutant D165A showed obviously decreased catalytic activity (Supplementary Figs.\u00a06, 7). The result indicated that Asp165 may participate in the catalytic process.Fig. 3Enzymology characterization of NapW-catalyzed reduction in NDM biosynthesis.a Crystal structure of NapW-NADP+ complex.

We found that Asp165 could form a hydrogen bond with the C-7 hydroxy of 1 to stabilize the substrate and facilitate the dehydration process. Therefore, the distance between O3 of 1 and carboxyl of Asp165 was analyzed in four times 50\u2009ns MD trajectories. The average distance was 3.91\u2009\u00c5, indicating the stable hydrogen bond existed indeed. To verify the function of residues Asp165, MD simulations were also performed for D165A mutant in NapW\u00b7NADPH\u00b71 (Fig.\u00a04a). In the D165A mutant system, substrate 1 escaped from the catalytic center due to the loss of traction from Asp165. To be precise, two key distances representing the critical reaction steps (proton transfer and hydride delivery) were selected to describe these conformational changes. The former was the distance between O3 of 1 and C\u03b2(CB) of Asp165, and the latter was that between C7 of 1 and C4N of NADPH. Compared to the two-dimensional distance scatter plot in WT, the distance distribution in the D165A mutant looked more incompact, suggesting that 1 kept away from the catalytic center in D165A mutant (Fig.\u00a04a). From these observations, we verified that Asp165 played a critical role in stabilizing the substrate in the catalytic site.Fig. 4The MD simulations and QM/MM calculations for NapW/NADPH-NDM model.a The two-dimensional scatter plot of distance C7-C4N and O3-CB.

As shown in Fig.\u00a03b, it was proposed that Asp165 could facilitate the transfer of proton from the carboxyl to the C-7 hydroxy, resulting in dehydration to form the electrophilic iminium species 1\u2032, and then the hydride delivery from NADPH to 1\u2032 could generate the product 2. To obtain the relative stable conformations for QM/MM calculations, two MD trajectories were extended to 150\u2009ns for sufficient sampling, and we chose the representative structure from the major cluster of the two trajectories as the initial structure to gain the reaction energy profile. Moreover, we found there was always water around O3 of 1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011). Therefore, the computational model, as shown in Fig.\u00a04b, consisted of NADPH, substrate 1, Asp165, a water molecule, and other residues within 5\u2009\u00c5 of NADPH and 1. In the first step of dehydration, Asp165 protonated the hydroxyl of NDM to produce a water molecule with the energy barrier of 13.2\u2009kcal/mol (Fig.\u00a04c, d). After that, NADPH provided a proton to the intermediate 1\u2032 from the same direction as that of losing hydroxyl of 1, generating the product 2 with the energy barrier of 22.2\u2009kcal/mol. As we can see, the second reaction step is rate-limiting in the overall catalytic process of NapW.", "To further explore the mechanism, NapW-catalyzed reaction was conducted in the presence of (S)-[4-2H] NADPH which is obtained by glucose dehydrogenase, BmGDH from Bacillus megaterium DSM 2894 with D-[1-2H] Glucose as the deuterium donor and NADP+ as cofactor22,23. 1\u2009Da increase at m/z of 2H-2 was detected in NapW/BmGDH cascade reaction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012), which indicated the deuterium was transferred to 1\u2032 (Fig.\u00a03b). Then, large-scale reactions were performed to isolate 2H-2 for elucidating the exact direction of deuterium incorporation at C-7 position. 1H\u20131H NOESY spectrum of 2 shows that the NOE signal (indicated by red dashed arrows) between 4\u2032-Ha and 7-Ha, distinguishing the positions of 7-Ha (2.91\u2009ppm) and Hb (2.80\u2009ppm) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). The 1H-NMR spectra of 2H-2 indicated the peak disappearance of 7-Hb when compared with that of compound 2 from end to end. Expectedly, the 2H NMR spectrum of 2H-2 shows an obvious peak at 2.80\u2009ppm (Fig.\u00a03c). In conclusion, the direction of hydride supplied by NADPH is identical to that of hydroxyl leaving, which illustrates the reductive reaction is an SN1 process, but not an SN2 reaction. This is in line with our computational results. Owing to the block of C-9\u2032 and C-4\u2032 groups, the hydride tends to attack 1\u2032 from the direction of a smaller steric hindrance (Fig.\u00a03b).", "SDRs-catalyzed inactivation of hemiaminal-bearing prodrug in SFM-A biosynthesis", "After confirming the self-resistant role of NapW/homW in NDM biosynthetic pathway, we wonder whether the similar reductive inactivation of hemiaminal warhead exists in other THIQ antibiotics producing bacteria. We have been pursuing the biosynthetic studies of SFM-A (4, Fig.\u00a01a)24\u201327; therefore, the sfm BGC and the genome of SFM-A producer, S. lavendulae NRRL 11002, were carefully analyzed to search for genes encoding NapW-like SDRs. Indeed, in addition to SfmO1 (56% identity with NapW) encoded by sfmO1 within sfm BGC, there are two another homologous proteins homO1a (62% identity) and homO1b (60% identity) encoded by genes outside the BGC. We then expressed and purified these three proteins from E. coli for biochemical assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). Following the proposed model of NDM (Fig.\u00a01c), we predicted that the propeptide iminium intermediate 16 (Fig.\u00a05a) should presumably be the true substrate of SfmO1 (or homO1a/homO1b). Once 15/16 is generated by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), this hemiaminal pharmacophore-containing intermediate will be immediately reduced into inactive compound 17 catalyzed by SfmO1 and homO1a/homO1b in case of its potent toxicity to host DNA (Fig.\u00a05a). Given the fact that SfmC-mediated enzymatic synthesis of 15 was established by Oikawa\u2019s group28, we thereby followed this method to perform the dual Pictet-Spengler reaction catalyzed by SfmC using 13 and 14 as substrates (Fig.\u00a05a). MS analysis showed the enzymatic product was indeed identical with 16 containing the iminium (Fig.\u00a05c, HR-MS/MS in Supplementary Fig.\u00a015). When the SDRs and NADPH were further added into this assay, we observed the generation of reductive product 17 (Fig.\u00a05b), which was further confirmed by HR-MS/MS (Fig.\u00a05d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a016). Though homO1b shows lower efficiency, SfmO1, and homO1a exhibit similar activity. To our surprise, NapW and homW also could effectively catalyze the same reaction (Fig.\u00a05b). These collective evidences not only support our proposed self-resistance model in NDM and SFM-A biosynthesis, but also suggest that this family of SDRs may exhibit broad substrate-tolerance.Fig. 5Biochemical investigation of SDRs-catalyzed pharmacophore reductive quenching in SFM biosynthesis.a Enzymatic reactions mediated by SfmC and SDRs. b LC-MS analysis of enzymatic reaction products. c ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of 16 generated by SfmC. d ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of 17 generated by SDRs.", "Fig. 5Biochemical investigation of SDRs-catalyzed pharmacophore reductive quenching in SFM biosynthesis.a Enzymatic reactions mediated by SfmC and SDRs. b LC-MS analysis of enzymatic reaction products. c ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of 16 generated by SfmC. d ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of 17 generated by SDRs.", "Biochemical investigation of SDRs-catalyzed pharmacophore reductive quenching in SFM biosynthesis.", "a Enzymatic reactions mediated by SfmC and SDRs. b LC-MS analysis of enzymatic reaction products. c ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of 16 generated by SfmC. d ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of 17 generated by SDRs.", "SDRs from antibiotic-producing microbes catalyzed the inactivation of other THIQ antibiotics", "Considering these SDRs show substrate promiscuity to reductively quench the common hemiaminal pharmacophore, we thereby tested more THIQ antibiotics including ET-743 (7), a clinically approved anticancer drug discovered from marine tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinate14,29. Surprisingly, each of the five SDRs originated from NDM or SFM-A producer could effectively catalyze the reductive inactivation of 7 to yield a warhead-blocked derivate 8 (Fig.\u00a06a), which were shown by HPLC analysis (Fig.\u00a06b) and confirmed by MS analysis (Fig.\u00a06c, d; HR-MS/MS in Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). Moreover, we tried to obtain LMM (9) by fermentation of S. candidus LL-AP19130. However, we isolated an analog, 16-dehydroxy-LMM (18, Fig.\u00a06e), which was characterized by NMR analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018 and Supplementary Table\u00a04). Using 18 as substrate, we found that NapW, homW, SfmO1, and homO1a exhibit catalytic activity but homO1b does not (Fig.\u00a06f). Large-scale enzymatic reactions were performed and the reductive product 19 was isolated, the structure of which was confirmed by NMR (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019 and Supplementary Table\u00a05) and demonstrated to lack a hydroxy group at C-17 (Fig.\u00a06e). Furthermore, a small quantity of 19 could be detected in fermentation broth of LMM-producing bacteria by HPLC-MS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a020), which strongly supported that its genome encoded one or more NapW-like proteins for self-resistance. These results demonstrated that the SDRs originated from THIQ antibiotic-producing microbes indeed exhibit recognition promiscuity toward diverse substrate harboring THIQ backbone with hemiaminal moiety.Fig. 6Biochemical assay of SDRs-catalyzed reduction using ET-743 and dOH-LMM as substrates.SDRs-catalyzed reactions using 7 (a) or 18 (e) as substrate.

Indeed, homologous genes of napW/homW and sfmO1/homO1a/homO1b are widely distributed in nature, especially microbiome genome. All 4771 sequences (above 34% sequence identity with NapW) were clustered by sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a021), which show that they were from different microorganisms including eukaryotic and human microbes with actinobacteria as major sources. Within the genome of S. lividans 1326, a non-THIQs producing actinobacteria, two SDR proteins bearing high homology with NapW: SlvW1 (74% identity) and SlvW2 (61% identity) were found. Besides, we randomly selected several proteins with different identities (75\u201334% identity) from different microorganisms, including SDR-Pb (Paenibacillus, Firmicutes), SDR-Cc (Chroococcales cyanobacterium, Cyanobacteria), SDR-Rm (Rhizobium mesoamericanum, Proteobacteria), SDR-Mb (Myxococcales bacterium, Proteobacteria), SDR-Li (Leptospira interrogans, Spirochaetes), SDR-Cs (Chlorella sorokiniana, Eukaryota), and SDR-Ss (Sporomusa silvacetica, Firmicutes) (Supplementary Table\u00a06), to obtain the recombinant proteins from E. coli BL21 (DE3) for enzymatic essays toward previously mentioned four THIQs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a022). HPLC analyses showed that most proteins can catalyze reductive reaction of THIQ compounds except that SDR-Li and SDR-Ss exhibited significantly lower activity for 1, 16, and 7 and no activity for 18 (Supplementary Figs.\u00a023\u201326). This result suggested the promiscuous substrate recognition of NapW-homologs may endow their hosts with potentially general resistance against THIQ antibiotics physiologically, even for the non-antibiotic-producing microbes."]
