["3. Results", "3.1. Production of Functional Buttermilk and Soymilk Using P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+)", "The present study aims at the development of functional drinks using P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) with improved flavor, nutritional, and health-promoting characteristics. During the course of fermentation, changes in the bacterial growth profile, pH, acidity (in terms of lactic acid), and L-alanine production were recorded in the fermented drinks. Significant variations (p < 0.005) in the titratable acidity, total carbohydrates, proteins, flavonoids, phenolics, and antioxidant activity were observed and compared with their controls. The sensory attributes of the LAB fermented drinks such as flavor, odor, mouthfeel, and after-taste were also compared with the unfermented drinks. Results obtained in the study authenticate the claim of LAB fermentation in improving the nutritional and functional attributes of the drinks.", "3.2. Analysis of Bacterial Growth during LAB Fermentation", "The growth profile of P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) in buttermilk and soymilk samples was analyzed at regular intervals up to 24 h of fermentation, and a growth curve was plotted between the incubation time and the observed cell density in terms of cfu/mL (Figure 1a). The LAB strain achieved its maximum growth (in terms of highest cfu/mL) after 10 h of incubation. Almost similar growth patterns were observed in both drinks during the entire fermentation process.", "A typical bacterial growth curve including lag, log, stationary, and decline phases was observed during fermentation. The strain experienced a luxurious growth as the cell biomass was enhanced drastically (from 104 to 108 cells) in comparison to the added inoculum, and the maximum growth was observed at 10 h of fermentation in both fermented drinks. After achieving maximum growth, the cell counts started declining subsequently due to the scarcity of the nutrients and enhanced production of secondary metabolites such as L-alanine and lactic acid.", "3.3. Variations in pH and Milk Consistency during the Course of Fermentation", "Fermented buttermilk and soymilk samples using the P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain showed a sharp drop in pH from 7 to 3 due to the accumulation of lactic acid (Figure 1c). The results of the present study showed that there was a fall in the pH and an increase in the acidity of the fermented drinks. This relationship between reduction in pH and increase in acidity is in accordance with the previous literature, where a drop in pH during LAB fermentation was associated with the accumulation of lactic acid [21,35]. In the case of soymilk, the formation of a soft gel was initiated due to curdling of the milk proteins after 6 h and the formation of a firm gel was noticed after 8\u201310 h of fermentation during which a major decline in pH was also observed. So, it indicates that the fermentation should be arrested between 6\u20137 h to stop further curdling of the soymilk that already has accumulated a significant amount of L-alanine. After fermentation, homogenization of the soymilk is recommended to obtain a smooth/creamy texture before storage at 4 \u00b0C. Buttermilk showed more pH variation and the final pH dropped from 6.8 to 3.0 during fermentation, whereas in the case of soymilk samples, the pH drop was recorded to be from 7 to 3.5.", "3.4. In-Situ L-Alanine Production during Fermentation of Buttermilk and Soymilk", "After LAB fermentation, the L-alanine content (with >97% enantiomeric purity) enhanced considerably in the buttermilk and soymilk preparations (as depicted in Figure 1b). L-alanine levels were enhanced 7-fold (from 6.75 \u00b1 0.26 to 41.5 \u00b1 0.5 g/L; 75 to 465 mM) in the buttermilk samples within 16 h of fermentation in comparison to the unfermented drink. Whereas, in the case of soymilk, L-alanine titers were increased 5-fold (from 8.25 \u00b1 0.18 to 38.5 \u00b1 0.39 g/L; 92 to 432 mM) within 10 h of fermentation in comparison to the unfermented drink. L-alanine titers started declining after 10 h of fermentation in the case of soymilk and after 16 h of fermentation in the case of buttermilk preparations. Thus, the authors strongly suggest restricting the period of soymilk fermentation up to 8 h and buttermilk fermentation up to 16 h, to further avoid settling of the milk solids or loss of nutrients. The recommended incubation periods are sufficient to impart a considerable level of sweetness (due to L-alanine) in the fermented drinks.", "3.5. Physico-Chemical and Quality Attributes of Buttermilk and Soymilk during Fermentation of Buttermilk and Soymilk", "Fermentation using P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) greatly influenced many physicochemical and quality attributes of the buttermilk and soymilk preparations. Fermented buttermilk and soymilk showed enhanced contents of antioxidants, flavonoids, and phenols in comparison to the unfermented drinks, whereas the total solids, carbohydrates, and protein contents were reduced considerably upon LAB fermentation as discussed below (Table 1 and Figure 2).", "3.5.1. Variation in Physicochemical Parameters during the Course of Fermentation", "Titratable acidity (TA) of the buttermilk and soymilk samples increased upon LAB fermentation due to the production of lactic acid. In the case of buttermilk, TA increased up to 0.87 \u00b1 0.04% in comparison to the unfermented drink, which showed only 0.21 \u00b1 0.02% TA, whereas the fermented soymilk showed a total acidity of 0.42 \u00b1 0.03% as compared to the unfermented one with a TA of 0.13 \u00b1 0.02% only. The total solid content of buttermilk and soymilk was also reduced substantially upon LAB fermentation. Buttermilk solid content decreased up to 1.8 \u00b1 0.20% in comparison to the unfermented control, which had a total solid content of 2.6 \u00b1 0.1%. In the case of soymilk, total solid content reduced considerably from 4.9 \u00b1 0.35 to 2.3 \u00b1 0.25%. Total solids were reduced after LAB fermentation possibly due to consumption, denaturation, and precipitation of the proteins triggered by lactic acid accumulation. Meanwhile, the moisture contents in the drinks increased after LAB fermentation. The moisture contents in the case of fermented buttermilk and soymilk increased from 95.6 \u00b1 0.5 to 98.3 \u00b1 0.31% and 93.4 \u00b1 0.26 to 97.6 \u00b1 0.40%, respectively. Previously, Sebastian, Barus, and Mulyono [21] also reported a reduction in the contents of total solids, crude protein, and an enhancement in the total moisture content upon fermentation of soymilk using Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. Thermophilus strains.", "3.5.2. Variation in Protein and Carbohydrate Contents", "The protein content of buttermilk was reduced from 3.06 \u00b1 0.19 mg/mL (unfermented) to 2.17 \u00b1 0.05 mg/mL (fermented). In the case of soymilk, protein content was 6.48 \u00b1 0.06 mg/mL before fermentation, which decreased up to 4.21 \u00b1 0.07 mg/mL after fermentation. The carbohydrate content of the buttermilk also was reduced from 3.5 \u00b1 0.15% to 2.6 \u00b1 0.35% upon fermentation, while in the case of soymilk, it was reduced from 9.18 \u00b1 0.04% to 7.43 \u00b1 0.03% after LAB fermentation. During the fermentation of buttermilk or soymilk using LAB strains, exopolysaccharides (EPS) are produced, which act as viscosifying agents. EPS also interact with the milk proteins and form matrices that increase the viscosity of the drinks. These interactions might be responsible for the reduced levels of total solids, carbohydrates, and proteins [21]. Probiotic Pediococcus acidilactici species are also capable of synthesizing a variety of EPS as described in the earlier reports [36,37,38].", "3.5.3. Variation in Total Phenolic Content", "Soymilk has been reported to be the abundant source of phenolics and LAB fermentation has already been reported to be a potent way of enhancing the total phenolic content [21,29]. In the present study, the TPC of the buttermilk and soymilk increased upon fermentation using P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+). It was observed that upon LAB fermentation, TPC content was enhanced 1.2-fold (from 5.98 \u00b1 0.16 to 6.25 \u00b1 0.04 mg GAE/mL) when compared with the unfermented buttermilk. In the case of soymilk, TPC was approximately 2-fold enhanced from 4.51 \u00b1 0.04 to 7.82 \u00b1 0.05 mg GAE/mL upon LAB fermentation. The literature also supports the findings that the LAB fermentation of soymilk may increase or decrease TPC in comparison to the unfermented drink, depending upon the choice of the LAB strain being used. Fakri, Lim, Musa, Hasan, Adam, and Ramasamy [29] reported that the fermentation of soymilk using Limosilactobacillus fermentum LAB 9 strain enhanced the TPC by 10%. In another study, where soybean was fermented using Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, TPC increased by 87% in comparison to the unfermented drink [39]. However, few LAB strains such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus casei, have been reported to reduce the TPC of soymilk with an increased fermentation period [40]. Higher TPC is attributed to the higher free radical scavenging capacity, that eventually enhances the antioxidant potential of the fermented drinks [29].", "3.5.4. Variation in Antioxidant Activity", "The antioxidant activities (estimated in terms of DPPH radical scavenging ability) of the fermented buttermilk and soy milk enhanced significantly after LAB fermentation. The antioxidant activity of buttermilk increased from 27.2 \u00b1 0.51 to 67.3 \u00b1 0.41%, which is 2.5-fold higher than the unfermented one. In the case of soymilk, the antioxidant activity also showed an increase from 24.3 \u00b1 0.36% to 44.72 \u00b1 0.09% with a 1.8-fold increase in the activity. Soymilk fermentation using LAB strains has also been previously reported to enhance the antioxidant potential in terms of DPPH radical scavenging activity. Marazza and coworkers, in 2012, reported that soymilk fermentation using Lactobacilli sp. enhanced the DPPH radical-scavenging activity up to 50% in comparison to the unfermented soymilk. In another study, soymilk fermented for 48 h with a LAB consortium consisting of Limosilactobacillus fermentum LAB 10, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LAB 11, and P. acidilactici LAB 5 strains exhibited tremendously higher DPPH radical-scavenging activity, approximating 100% value. Fakri and co-workers reported the utilization of Pediococcus sp. for the fermentation of soymilk for the first time for enhancing its DPPH radical scavenging activity [29]. According to this study, the enhancement of the antioxidant potential of the LAB fermented drinks could be attributed to the higher isoflavones content, which has been known for protecting the cells from the detrimental effects of free radicals [41]. Tachakittirungrod, Okonogi, and Chowwanapoonpohn [42] also reported that in soymilk fermented using Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CRL981, aglycones generated during the fermentation process acted as the hydrogen donors, which eventually scavenged DPPH radicals present in the soymilk. Additionally, higher contents of antioxidative compounds such as phenolics and flavonoids have been reported to be responsible for enhancing the free radical scavenging capability of fermented drinks. Therefore, unfermented soybeans or soymilk withlow phenolic content eventually possess low antioxidant potential [30].", "3.5.5. Variation in Total Flavonoid Content", "LAB fermentation also enhanced the TFC content in the buttermilk and soymilk samples. In the case of fermented buttermilk, TFC values enhanced by 1.7 folds from 3.71 \u00b1 0.29 to 6.19 \u00b1 0.03 mg quercetin equivalents/mL, whereas in the case of fermented soymilk, TFC contents increased by 1.4-fold from 5.76 \u00b1 0.05 to 7.89 \u00b1 0.10 mg quercetin equivalents/mL, which could also be attributed to the enhanced levels of phenolics and antioxidants. Quercetin is a well-known chelator, phytoestrogen, and a free radical scavenger, which could havecontributed to the enhanced DPPH radical scavenging activity of the fermented drinks [43].", "3.6. Comparison of Sensory Characteristics of the Fermented and Unfermented Buttermilk and Soymilk", "Consumer acceptance of soymilk has still been limited due to its undesirable beany aftertaste, caused mainly by the presence of hexanal and pentanal compounds. The formation of these aldehyde compounds has been catalyzed by the lipoxygenase enzyme, which is responsible for the hydroperoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has been reported that LAB metabolizes the hexanal and pentanal compounds and converts them into diacetyl and lactic acid during fermentation. Diacetyl is an organic compound produced during LAB fermentation that imparts a buttery, sweet, and soft flavor to dairy food items [21,44].", "Other sensory attributes like flavor, odor, mouthfeel, aftertaste, and overall acceptability of the fermented drinks improved considerably after fermentation using the P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain. In the case of soymilk, homogenized samples were used for hedonic testing and the most important change observed in the sensory attributes of soymilk was a reduction of its beany flavor. Therefore, LAB fermentation of soymilk is being highly recommended to mask its beany flavor and to enhance its commercial value and consumer acceptability.", "Fermentation using LAB strains has been associated with the development of a creamy mouthfeel, better bulk properties, improved taste and flavor, and higher acceptability among health-conscious consumers. The overall acceptability of the fermented buttermilk was higher as compared to the fermented soymilk due to the formation of soy curd after 8 h of fermentation; however, it can be limited by reducing the duration of fermentation from 6\u20137 h. Radar graphs clearly depict the improved sensory attributes and better acceptability of the fermented drinks due to the production of LAB-associated metabolites (Figure 3). Thus, the study strengthens the claim of industrial applications of the L-alanine-producing P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain in enhancing creamy mouthfeel and sweet flavor and masking off-flavors of the drinks, thus opening new vistas for the commercialization of health-promoting LAB-fermented drinks.", "3.7. GC-MS Based Metabolomic Fingerprinting for the Identification of Significant Bioactive and Heath Health-Promoting Compounds", "GC-MS has been extensively used in metabolomic fingerprinting studies, due to its highly sensitive and specific compound identification ability [45]. The present GC-MS-based study revealed the occurrence of various bioactive compounds, which could account for the improved functional and sensory characteristics of the fermented buttermilk and soymilk using P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) (Table 2 and Table 3; Figure 4). LAB fermentation of buttermilk and soymilk eventually increased the number and intensity of many bioactive compounds. The identified compounds belong to diverse classes like alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes, amines, amides, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, ethers, esters, fatty acids, ketones, and organic compounds, which were manually integrated with the previous literature to draw significant inference regarding their role in improving nutritional, functional, and therapeutic attributes of the drinks [3,43,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55]. Metabolomic data haverevealed the presence of 32 and 48 compounds in the unfermented and fermented buttermilk, respectively. In the case of soymilk, 37 compounds were detected before and 51 compounds after the LAB fermentation process. The nature, pharmacological significance, and potential applications of the identified compounds were predicted by manual comparison with the available scientific literature. It was found that many compounds detected in the fermented drinks have significant biological activities such as being anti-allergic, anti-Alzheimer\u2019s, anti-arthritic, anti-cancer, anti-convulsant, anti-diabetic, anti-diuretic, anti-depressing, antifungal, anti-gout, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-malarial, anti-nephrotoxic, antioxidant, anti-pyretic, anti-protozoal, anti-proliferative, anti-trypanosomal, anti-tubercular, anti-tumor, and anti-viral [3,43,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55] as given in detail in Table 2 and Table 3.", "Analysis of the untargeted metabolomic fingerprinting data has revealed the crucial role of LAB fermentation in enhancing intensities of certain desirable bioactive and pharmacologically relevant compounds, while reducing the levels of many undesirable and quality detrimental compounds. Fold changes have revealed a considerable decline in the levels of certain undesirable metabolites such as 1-pentadecene, 2-bromopropionic acid, 8-heptadecene, formic acid, and propionic acid upon LAB fermentation, which is responsible for imparting bitterness, rancidity, spoiled flavor, unpleasant odor, and unhealthy attributes to the buttermilk and soymilk. Meanwhile, higher intensities of 1-dodecene, 2-aminononadecane, 4-octen-3-one, acetic acid, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, chloroacetic acid, heptadecanenitrile, hexadecenoic acid methyl ester, etc., account for the enhancement of aroma, flavor, odor, and taste, the appearance of a creamy texture, and better overall acceptability of the fermented buttermilk and soymilk. Thus, these important metabolic modulations signify the role of the P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain in improving the quality attributes of the fermented beverages.", "In buttermilk, considerably higher levels of 1-dodecene (1.2-fold), 9-octadecene (1.95-fold), benzoic acid (1.5-fold), chloroacetic acid (1.6-fold), colchicine (1.9-fold), Cyclohexadecane (1.8-fold), heptadecanenitrile (1.5-fold), and phosphonic acid (2.2-fold) were observed after fermentation using the P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain (Table 2). In the case of soymilk, similar metabolic modulations were also observed after LAB fermentation. A considerable increase of 1.2- to 2.05-fold was observed in the case 1-octanamine, 1-tridecene, 2-propenyl decanoate, 3-chloropropionic acid, 3-octadecene, 9-octadecene, decanohydrazide, dichloroacetic acid, lyxitol, octadecatrieonic acid, and phosphonic acid (Table 3). Therefore, the presence of these desirable bioactive compounds highlighted the role of LAB fermentation in improving the quality, functional, sensory, and therapeutic attributes of buttermilk and soymilk."]
