["3. Results", "3.1. Antibiotic Residues in Organic Fertilizer", "Because of sorption, antibiotics are often concentrated in the solid phase of manure [44,45,46,47]. In addition, the half-lives of different antibiotics in the manure varied [48,49], and the anticipated storage period of manure was longer than these half-lives. This result indicated that before manure was used for agriculture, the parent antibiotic compounds may have degraded.", "Figure S1 shows the degradation of antibiotics in the four groups of organic fertilizers before and after composting. With the completion of composting, TCs, SAs, and quinolones in the CM group were obviously degraded. In the CM group, the removal rates of OTC, Dox, Oflox, and SMN reached more than 60%. At the same time, the OTC concentration in the CM samples decreased significantly, and the final elimination rate reached 100%. It has been reported that during manure composting, OTC may degrade with a total removal of over 90%, which is consistent with our results. The antibiotic residues in the EC group and SM group were lower than the detection limit, so they were not detected. The Oflox (a quinolone) removal rate in the CM group organic fertilizer was 48%. The Enroflox removal rate was 26.7%. TC, CTC, and SDZ were not detected, probably due to the low levels remaining.", "3.2. Physicochemical Properties of Organic Fertilizer", "Composting can significantly reduce the pH of organic fertilizers compared to that of uncomposted fertilizers (Figure S2). However, in the CM organic fertilizer, the pH increased after composting. The initial value was 7.36, and the pH rose to 7.59 after composting. The organic fertilizers that were not composted had a pH of 7 or higher. After composting, the pH of the organic fertilizers fell below 7.", "When composting, the organic matter in the manure is generally utilized and converted by microbes by humification or mineralization. In addition, the microbial activity can be reflected by variation in the C/N ratio; obviously, the C/N ratio of the ECC, CDC, and SMC groups were lower than that of groups without composting (Figure S3). Conversely, the C/N ratio in the CM group after composting was significantly higher than that in the uncomposted samples.", "3.3. Structure and Characteristics of Microorganisms in Organic Fertilizer", "3.3.1. Diversity of Microorganisms", "After assembly and quality filtering, 389,667 high-quality sequences were found in all samples, and a total of 1913 OTUs were revealed by statistical analysis of the biological information. A community abundance (Chao1) analysis demonstrated that the composting treatment significantly increased microbial abundance relative to that of uncomposted samples. The abundance of organic fertilizers increased after composting, especially in the CM, EC, and SM groups (Figure 1).", "3.3.2. Composition of Microorganisms", "Venn diagrams demonstrate unique OTU distribution with significant differences between the uncomposted and composted groups. Figure S4a shows that there are 251 common OTUs in the four compost-treated samples, while in the uncomposted treatment group there are only 59 OTUs shared by the four groups. Figure S4a,b together showed that before the composting treatment, the OTUs with significant differences among the four samples accounted for the vast majority, reaching 441 OTUs in the ECU group, but after the composting treatment the common OTUs in the four samples increased significantly.", "In the CM group, Proteobacteria (36.7%) and Firmicutes (39.4%) were the main phyla in the uncomposted samples, but after composting Actinobacteria was the dominant phylum in the CM, CD, and SM groups. Clearly, composting was conducive to increasing the relative abundance of Actinobacteria while decreasing its relative abundance in the EC groups (Figure S5 and Figure 2).", "3.3.3. Correlation between Physicochemical Properties and Microorganisms", "As redundancy analysis shows (Figure 3), Planctomycetes, Bacteria, Acidobacteria, and Nitrospirae relative abundances were positively correlated with NO3\u2212 (p < 0.01) but negatively correlated with total organic carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN). In contrast, Firmicutes were significantly positively correlated with NH4+ and negatively correlated with NO3\u2212. Among the fertilizer groups, CM and CD showed obvious clustering before and after composting.", "3.4. ARGs in Organic Fertilizer", "3.4.1. Diversity of ARGs and MGEs in Organic Fertilizer", "The organic fertilizer samples exhibited a total of 228 ARGs (Figure 4), and up to 184 and 71 ARGs were detected in CMU and ECC, respectively. Although composting resulted in an average of 96 ARGs in the four composted samples, up to 103 ARGs were detected in the CDC sample. This result indicated that ARGs existed widely in organic fertilizer and that the incidence of ARGs was different in different organic fertilizer samples. Manure application not only adds nutrients and organic matter to cultivated soil for crop growth but also introduces ARGs, posing a potential risk to human health.", "As shown in Figure S6, antibiotic deactivation accounted for 41.74% of resistance mechanisms, efflux pumps accounted for 29.36%, and cellular protection resistance mechanisms accounted for 27.06% in the uncomposted samples. The detected ARGs could potentially confer resistance to all the major antibiotics. Of the targets of all the detected ARGs, aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB), TC, and vancomycin antibiotics are important for human medicine (Figure 5), and even resistance genes for the \u201clast-resort\u201d life-saving antibiotic vancomycin were detected [50]. The incidence of ten types of ARGs was determined in organic fertilizer samples (Figure 5). Resistance mechanisms targeting aminoglycosides (7.5\u201311.6%), TC (5.2\u201315.6%), multiple drugs (4\u201316.7%), beta-lactam ((not detected)~28%), and MLSB (5.7\u201312.9%) were the five most common types in organic fertilizer samples, followed by resistance mechanisms for vancomycin (2.9\u201332.9%), SA (6.9\u201313.8%), chloramphenicol (6.9\u201310.3%), and MGEs (5.2\u201313%). The incidence of ARGs differed with organic fertilizer sample.", "3.4.2. Abundance and Enrichment of ARGs and MGEs in Organic Fertilizer", "The absolute abundance of ARGs in organic fertilizer samples ranged from 2.3 \u00d7 104 to 2.49 \u00d7 107 copies g\u22121 solid dry weight (Figure 6). Figure 6 shows that after composting treatment, the content of ARGs in CM and CD groups is reduced, but the EC and SM samples show opposite trends. In EC samples and SM samples, MGEs increased after composting, which was the same trend as that found for ARGs.", "Because of the different numbers of bacterial cells in organic fertilizer samples, the normalized copy numbers of ARGs and MGEs were calculated relative to the 16S rRNA gene copy number (Figure S7). Obviously, composting reduced ARGs in organic fertilizers, but ARGs in SM samples increased after composting, as did MGEs. In addition, we observed that EC samples had less ARG richness and diversity than other samples, and their abundance of MGEs was much lower than that of other samples.", "According to a heat map analysis (Figure 7), the total abundance of ARGs in the samples after organic fertilizer composting was lower than that before organic fertilizer composting. However, in the SM group of organic fertilizers, the abundance of multidrug, MLSB, chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, ARGs, and MGEs after composting was higher than that of uncomposted fertilizers, and the same phenomenon appeared in the EC group for chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, ARGs, and MGEs.", "In view of the different amounts of antibiotics added to feed used in poultry farming, the abundance of native ARGs in the intestines of poultry also varies. Although the abundance of some ARGs after composting is higher than that before composting in this study, the overall results show that the abundance of most ARGs after composting is significantly reduced. ARGs from different sources of organic fertilizers are not exactly the same, but overall, aminoglycoside resistance genes and MGEs are relatively abundant.", "Figure 8 shows the enrichment in ARGs in each organic fertilizer sample, and the total enrichment in organic fertilizer samples was approximated for all ARGs. The absolute gene copy number of ARGs ranged from 0 to 313,328.57 (the CMU sample). This result showed that the antibiotic resistance in different manures showed large discrepancies and that the variation in different antibiotic types varied clearly among organic fertilizer samples, especially those without composting which had the highest abundance.", "The detailed change in each subtype of ARGs is shown in Table S3. The aminoglycoside resistance genes and MGEs had the most significant changes in total abundance, and the total abundance in the uncomposted samples was significantly higher than that in the composted samples. For MGEs, tnpA-04 was the most abundant gene in all samples. For TC resistance genes, the total abundance in the CMU sample was the highest, with tetX, tetG-02, and tetG-01 being the three most abundant genes compared with their abundance in the uncomposted samples. For multidrug resistance genes, floR, qacEdelta1-01, and qacEdelta1-02 had higher abundances in CMU and CDU samples than in CMC and CDC samples. For MLSB resistance genes, CMU samples had a high abundance and the abundance in uncomposted samples was significantly higher than that in composted samples. For chloramphenicol resistance genes, cmx(A) was the most abundant gene in all samples.", "3.4.3. Correlation between ARGs and Microorganisms", "The cooccurring ARGs, MGEs (relative gene copy number) and potential host bacteria (at the phylum level, 16S rRNA gene sequence data) based on Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) were analyzed by network analysis (Figure 9). As Figure 9 shows, bacteria in the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes showed close relationships with several ARG types (such as TC, MLSB, and intl-1 (clinic) ARGs). In addition, SA resistance genes, TC resistance genes and integrase genes showed significant and positive correlations with Proteobacteria; six multidrug resistance genes (marR-01, yceL/mdtH-01, emrD, acrA-04, oprJ, and oprD) and five vancomycin resistance genes (vanXD, vanHB, vanRA-01, vanA, and vanRA-02) showed significant and positive correlations with Nitrospirae; however, the relationship between Bacteroidetes and the ARGs was generally weak. When there was a strong and significant positive correlation between ARGs and coexisting microbial populations, it can be speculated that the cooccurrence pattern between ARGs and microbial populations is nonrandom, further indicating possible host information for ARGs. Thus, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Nitrospirae were identified as potential hosts for ARGs.", "The relationships between environmental factors, MGEs, microbial communities, and ARGs were explored by performing canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (Figure 10). The microbial communities at the phylum level and MGEs were analyzed as the environmental factors for ARGs, and the first two principal components (PCs) accounted for 88.3% of the total variation. The pH and NO3\u2212 exhibited a significant positive relationship with the abundance of ARGs in fertilizer. Additionally, TN, TC, and the C/N exhibited no significant correlation with ARGs. Four phyla (Deinococcus-Thermus, Actinobacteria,\nGemmatimonadetes, and Bacteroidetes) were found significantly correlated with the ARGs in fertilizer (p < 0.05). Deinococcus-Thermus, Actinobacteria, and pH positively correlated with the first axis (explaining 68.96% of total variance) and SMC and CMC samples. However, the phyla Nitrospirae and Planctomycetes were negatively correlated with the first axis but positively correlated with the second axis (explaining 19.34% of total variance) and the ECU sample. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to determine the key contributor of bacterial communities and MGEs to the variation as whole or separate factors (Figure 10), and the variation was 92.58%, which could explain the selected variables; the bacterial community contributed 46.29% of the total ARG variation, which was higher than the contributions of environmental factors (23.86%) and MGEs (22.43%). The Mantel test (Bray\u2212Curtis distance, r = 0.4959, p < 0.05) showed that, regardless of composting, a significant correlation between bacterial communities (OTUs) and ARG profiles was obvious."]
