["Results", "Characteristics of the C. purpurea ETP cluster", "Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of a C. purpurea NRPS-encoding gene (CPUR_02680) with significant sequence similarity to the ETP-toxin producing NRPSs in A. fumigatus and L. maculans [5]. By domain analysis using the NCBI Conserved Domain Database two AMPylation domains could be detected in the amino acid sequence of CPUR_02680 (TcpP). Analysis of the genes upstream and downstream of tcpP using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) uncovered a cluster of 11 genes with high homology to the gliotoxin cluster genes in A. fumigatus and to the sirodesmin cluster genes in L. maculans (Fig 1, Table 1). Genes highly conserved between the three clusters encode a zinc finger transcription factor, a methyltransferase, a dipeptidase, a transporter, a glutathione S-transferase, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, an aminotransferase, a NRPS and an oxidoreductase. A CPUR_02674 (tcpK) homolog is only present in the gliotoxin cluster and a CPUR_02678 (tcpD) homolog only in the sirodesmin cluster, encoding a glutamyltransferase and a prenyl transferase, respectively. There are differences in the arrangement of the genes within the three ETP clusters and for some genes, present in the gliotoxin or the sirodesmin cluster, no homologs could be identified in the C. purpurea ETP cluster (Fig 1). These enzymes are probably involved in modifications of the side chains of the core ETP moiety, like the acetyl transferase sirH or the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases gliF, sirB and sirE.", "Predicted functions and homologs of the ETP gene cluster in C. purpurea.", "Name Gene Code Homologa E-Value Predicted Function.", "tcpZ CPUR_02671 gliZ,sirZ 3.0e-142.7e-13 zinc finger transcription factor.", "tcpN CPUR_02672 gliN,sirN 4.6e-372.9e-06 methyltransferase.", "tcpJ CPUR_02673 gliJ,sirJ 1.0e-841.5e-104 dipeptidase.", "tcpK CPUR_02674 gliK 4.3e-30 glutamyltransferase.", "tcpA CPUR_02675 gliA 9.1e-106 transporter.", "tcpG CPUR_02676 gliG,sirG 2.7e-392.0e-47 glutathione S-transferase.", "tcpC CPUR_02677 gliC,sirC 1.2e-795.6e-92 cytochrome P450 monooxygenase.", "tcpD CPUR_02678 sirD 3.6e-70 prenyl transferase.", "tcpG CPUR_02679 gliI,sirI 1.0e-566.6e-77 aminotransferase.", "tcpP CPUR_02680 gliP,sirP 3.6e-1390 NRPS.", "tcpT CPUR_02681 gliT,sirT 1.8e-656.0e-57 oxidoreductase.", "agli: gliotoxin cluster A. fumigatus [19], sir: sirodesmin cluster L. maculans [28].", "Expression studies", "To study if the identified gene cluster is transcribed in planta, expression studies of the putative ETP cluster gene CPUR_02679 (tcpG) were carried out using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (primers can be found in S1 Table). Therefore, rye plants were infected with the C. purpurea strain 20.1, the sequenced standard wild-type strain 20.1 [5]. The tcpG gene expression 10, 15 and 20 days post-infection showed an increase towards late stages of infection (Fig 2A). This tendency was confirmed in three biological replicates although the data show high variability due to the heterogeneous biological material (the infection process cannot be completely synchronized).", "10.1371/journal.pone.0158945.g002Fig 2Gene expression and co-regulation of the ETP cluster genes.(A)\nIn planta gene expression of tcpG.

Since no expression of any of the putative ETP cluster genes could be detected for the C. purpurea wild-type, we overexpressed tcpZ (CPUR_02671), encoding a putative cluster-specific transcription factor. For this purpose, an additional copy of the gene was introduced under the control of the strong, constitutive A. nidulans oliC promoter (S1 Fig). For three independent transformants the overexpression of tcpZ could be confirmed via northern blot. In all three transcription factor overexpression transformants (OE::tcpZ) the expression of the putative cluster genes CPUR_02671 to CPUR_02681 was significantly upregulated (Fig 2B). For the genes CPUR_02670 (related to alpha-mannosidase) and CPUR_02682 (thioredoxin-like protein), which flank the putative ETP cluster, no co-regulation with the putative cluster genes could be observed, confirming the predicted borders of the cluster. A significant influence of the tcpZ overexpression on the physiology of the fungus (growth, conidia formation) could not be observed (data not shown).", "Identification of pathway intermediates", "We used a mass spectromic analysis of the metabolite profile of OE::tcpZ mutants to search for new ETP-like metabolites. Therefore, the metabolite profile of wild-type and OE::tcpZ strain, both cultivated in liquid Mantle media for seven days, were compared using reverse-phase\u2013high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013diode-array detection\u2013high resolution mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-DAD-HRMS). In order to evaluate the characteristic fragmentation behavior of ETPs with the used mass spectrometer, gliotoxin was used as reference compound. In this analytical procedure metabolites with a diketopiperazine (DKP) backbone and at least one sulfur bridge first show a neutral loss of both sulfur atoms and later the opening of the DKP ring, as already described in literature [35\u201337]. Based on this information every new peak in the mutant strain which was not present in the wild-type was analyzed by HRMSn. The HRMS data were further analyzed by Metworks (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany), to search for compounds which are featured by the characteristic sulfur isotopic pattern and ratio. In addition, neutral loss experiments were implanted using a highly sensitive HPLC-MS/MS system to screen for minor compounds with disulfide bridges.", "The HPLC-MS chromatograms of the wild-type and the OE::tcpZ strain showed several differences in the metabolite profile (Fig 3A and 3B). Surprisingly, the fragmentation pattern did not indicate the disulfide bridge characteristic of known ETPs. Nevertheless, based on HRMS and HRMSn analysis, two TcpZ-dependent metabolites with the characteristic sulfur isotope pattern could be identified as 1a/b (C21H29N3O5S2) and 2a/b (C23H31N3O6S2) (Fig 4). Both compounds included two sulfur atoms and differed by the mass of a C2H2O-group indicating an acetyl group. The chromatographic separation of each metabolite in two peaks indicated the presence of diastereomers (Fig 3D). A first hint of the structure was obtained by the fragmentation pattern using HRMSn, as shown in Fig 4C. Most striking was the cleavage of a dimethylallyl group, whose incorporation in the biosynthetic pathway of sirodesmin in L. maculans was already demonstrated [38]. Furthermore, the cleavage of homocysteine, respectively the acetylated homocysteine and the loss of a thiomethyl group as for example from m/z 333 to m/z 285 were characteristic. Compared to the elucidated fragmentation of gliotoxin the information from the HRMSn experiments implied that both compounds were build out of tyrosine and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and secondly glycine as the corresponding amino acid. The resulting DKP was then N-thiomethylated and finally homocysteine (or its acetylated form) was added during biosynthesis. Apart from 1 and 2 we noted the presence of a similar metabolite 3 (C17H22N2O4S) (Figs 3D and 4A). HRMSn experiments clarified that instead of homocysteine a hydroxyl group was added at position C-6.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0158945.g003Fig 3Comparison of the HPLC-MS metabolite profile (total ion chromatograms) between the wild type of Claviceps purpurea strain 20.1 (A), OE::tcpZ (B) and OE::tcpZ/OE::tcpN (C).

(C) HRMSn fragmentation of 1a as [M+H]+ illustrating the rapid cleavage of the thiomethyl group and dimethylallyl group.", "To provide security for the predicted structures, the compounds were isolated by solid phase extraction followed by preparative HPLC. The structures of 1a (0.3 mg), 1b (0.4 mg), 2a (1.9 mg), 2b (1.8 mg) and 3 (1.0 mg) were confirmed by detailed 1D- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments (see Fig 4B for selected 2D-NMR data of 2, the complete NMR data of 1a/b, 2a/b and 3 can be found in the supporting information. The structures of 1a/b were confirmed by comparing the 1H and 13C data to those of 2a/b). 1H-NMR analysis of compound 2, for example, clearly revealed the presence of a dimethylallyl moiety, which was characterized by the signals at \u03b4 = 5.42 (tdq, J = 7.3, 3.0, 1.4 Hz, H-15), 4,50 (m, H-14), 1.77 (d, J = 1.4 Hz, H-17) and 1.73 (d, J = 1.3 Hz, H-18) ppm and is described in previous studies [38,39]. Phase sensitive gradient Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlelation (gHSQC) experiments established one-bond correlations between these protons and the corresponding carbon atoms at \u03b4 = 65,80 ppm (C-14), 120.90 ppm (C-15) and the methyl groups at \u03b4 = 25.74 ppm (C-17) and 18.19 ppm (C-18). Furthermore, the 1H NMR spectrum revealed four aromatic protons (H-10,12 \u03b4 = 6,9 ppm and H-9,13 \u03b4 = 7.16 ppm), roofed to each other and spit into doublets as an AA\u2019BB\u2019 system with the same chemical shift indicating a 1,4 di-substituted benzene ring. These protons could be assigned to the carbon signals of the aromatic signals at 116.12 ppm (C-10,12) and \u03b4 = 132.81 ppm (C-9,13). Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlated Spectroscopy (HMBC) couplings between the carbon atoms C-10 and C-12 and the proton H-14 demonstrated that the aromatic ring was substituted at position 4 by the dimethylallyl group. In the same way the carbon atoms C-9 and C-13 showed strong couplings to a methylene group; showing a noticeable splitting of the chemical shift (H-7a \u03b4 = 2.66 ppm and H-7b \u03b4 = 3.65 ppm). The DKP moiety was indicated by HMBC couplings between H-7a/b and the carbon atoms at \u03b4 = 164.14 and 165.05 ppm as well as couplings to a quaternary carbon at \u03b4 = 65.30 ppm. The expected carbonyl groups of the DKP core could be assigned to the carbons of C-2 (\u03b4 = 164.14 ppm) and C-5 (\u03b4 = 165.05 ppm). Further HMBC couplings between the protons of \u03b4 = 3.44/4.19 ppm and the carbon atoms C-2 and C-5 correspond to a coupling to H-3a/b and confirm the predicted DKP moiety. The 13C NMR signal at \u03b4 = 13.65 ppm could be matched to a thiomethyl group. Due to exclusive HMBC couplings (Fig 4B, blue arrows) to C-3 and C-5 the unusual thiomethyl group could be located at N-4. H,H-COSY correlations and HMBC couplings between the protons at \u03b4 = 2.88, 2.10 and 3.62 ppm and their corresponding carbon atoms at \u03b4 = 26.90, 32.09 and 55.32 ppm give connectivity information about the substituted homocysteine and the acetyl group. HMBC measurements established the linkage between the DKP core and the substituted homocysteine. The couplings between the protons of H-7a/b and the carbons C-2, C-5, C-1\u2019 make the connection obvious (Fig 4B, red arrows). The NMR data of 3 only differed in the lack of signals corresponding to the homocysteine residue and a chemical shift of the carbon atom of C-6 from \u03b4 = 65.30 ppm to \u03b4 = 75.90 ppm.", "As in the OE::tcpZ strain no metabolites were detectable with a hydroxylated \u03b1-carbon of glycine, we hypothesized that in C. purpurea instead of the carbon the nitrogen of the glycine part is oxidized. In A. fumigatus a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is responsible for the bishydroxylation of the DKP during gliotoxin biosynthesis and thus enables the addition of glutathione at the \u03b1-carbon of each amino acid [30]. Previous studies of the gliotoxin pathway in A. fumigatus already indicated the possible feature of the cytochrome P450 enzyme to form N-oxidized shunt products [34,40]. Another example is the cytochrome P450 CypX in Bacillus subtilis, which is known to mediate the N-oxidation of diketopiperazines [41]. A subsequent addition of glutathione followed by the degradation to a thiol and finally a methylation could explain the unique N-thiomethyl structure in C. purpurea. In A. fumigatus, gliN, is responsible for the methylations during the ETP biosynthetic pathway [42] leading to the stabilization of the DKP [43]. To get further insights into the biosynthetic pathway in C. purpurea, we overexpressed the putative methyltransferase-encoding gene tcpN (CPUR_02672) in the OE::tcpZ background by introducing an additional copy of the gene under the control of the strong constitutive A. nidulans oliC promoter (S2 Fig) in order to obtain a N-methoxy diketopiperazine core.", "Compositions of the culture filtrates of the wild-type, the OE::tcpZ strain and the OE::tcpZ/OE::tcpN strain were compared by HPLC-DAD-HRMS and HRMSn. On the one hand this analysis revealed that the two major compounds 1a/b and 2a/b as well as 3 were missing in the extract from the OE::tcpZ/OE::tcpN strain. On the other hand, several other metabolites (4-6; Figs 3C and 5A) with the same carbon skeleton and the molecular formulas 4a (C21H29N3O6S, 1.1 mg), 4b (C21H29N3O6S, only traces) 5 (C20H27N3O6S, 1.3 mg) and 6 (C22H30N4O7S, 1.5 mg), indicating the substitution of one sulfur atom by oxygen, could be detected. Fig 5B illustrates that the fragmentation pathway confirms the N-methoxylated compounds 4-6, as we could clearly characterize the cleavage of a methoxy group at N-4, for example from m/z 249 to m/z 217. The N-methoxy group could be confirmed by comparing the 13C NMR chemical shift of 2 and 4. Whereas the carbon of the methoxy group in 4a showed a chemical shift of 64.80 ppm (S10B Fig), the thiomethyl group in 2a/b differs with a typical shift of 13.65 ppm (S7B and S8B Figs) which is in excellent agreement with literature data [44] and previous NMR data concerning the nitrogen-methoxy-group [34]. The 1H NMR spectra further showed a shift of the corresponding protons from \u03b4 = 3.32 ppm (S7B and S8B Figs) (2) to \u03b4 = 2.20 ppm (S10B Fig) (4). Apart from the described chemical shifts the other 1H- and 13C NMR signals of 2a/b and 4a were comparable.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0158945.g005Fig 5Identified structures of the OE::tcpZ/OE::tcpN strain.(A) 4-8 occur in axenic culture.

Metabolite 8 is in accordance with the known biosynthetic pathway [40] as it represents the hydroxylated intermediate of the \u03b1-carbon of tyrosine. Due to the low concentration 8 could only be characterized by HRMSn. Interestingly, the OE::tcpZ/OE::tcpN mutants also produced metabolite 7, containing again two sulfur atoms. The fragmentation revealed the characteristic pattern containing the methoxy group at N-4 as shown before. Conclusively a group at C-6 with a pseudo molecular formula of C3H5O2NS2 was cleaved during fragmentation resulting in the structure of 7, corresponding to cysteine bound via a disulfide bridge. In order to confirm this predicted structure 1D- and 2D- NMR experiments were performed. The 1H NMR of 7 (0.6 mg) (S13A Fig) revealed that most signals were similar to that of 5 (S11A Fig). Unfortunately, the signals in the 13C NMR were limited due to the small amount of the isolated compound. Nevertheless, HMBC couplings between C-6 and H-7a/b demonstrated a downfield shift of the carbon, which confirmed the predicted structure.", "TcpC as the critical enzyme during ETP biosynthesis", "In all analyzed mutants, we identified neither sulfur bridged ETP end-products nor intermediates, where the \u03b1-carbon of glycine is hydroxylated or glutathione is attached. Therefore, we concluded that bishydroxylation of the DKP is the critical step during ETP biosynthesis in C. purpurea and that TcpC oxidizes only the \u03b1-carbon of tyrosine, but not the second one of glycine. Thus, the second sulfur molecule could not be incorporated and the formation of a DKP with an internal disulfide bridge is not possible.", "The A. fumigatus gliotoxin gene cluster contains two cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes. GliC is reported to be responsible for the bishydroxylation of the DKP during gliotoxin biosynthesis, whereas the second cytochrome P450 enzyme, GliF, is presumably involved in the modification of the DKP side chain [30]. In L. maculans, besides sirC, two additional cytochrome P450-encoding genes, sirB and sirE, are located in the sirodesmin cluster and the Aspergillus terreus acetylaranotin cluster contains two cytochrome P450 genes: ataCT and ataF [45]. In the C. purpurea ETP cluster only one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene (CPUR_02677) is present (Table 1). In a phylogenetic tree, CPUR_02677 (tcpC) groups well with gliC, sirC and ataTC (Fig 6), indicating that the enzyme should be responsible for the bishydroxylation of the DKP during ETP biosynthesis in C. purpurea.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0158945.g006Fig 6Phylogenetic analysis of TcpC and its homologs from other fungal ETP clusters.Amino acid sequences were obtained from GenBank database (GliC EDP49542.1, GliF AAW03300.1, SirE AAS92549.1, SirB XP_003842422.1, SirC AAS92547.1, ataF XM_001212649.1 ataTC XM_001212652.1).

After transformation in the C. purpurea OE::tcpZ strain, ectopic integration of the vector was checked by PCR and expression of the gene was verified via northern analyses (S3 Fig). The OE::tcpZ/OE::sirC mutant was cultured in modified Mantle media and the culture filtrate as well as the fungal mycelium was analyzed in the same way as before by HPLC-HRMS.

Fig 7B\u20137D illustrates the HRMSn experiments characterizing the new products. Each metabolite showed the characteristic cleavage of a polysulfur group. The resulting fragment m/z 287 with a pseudomolecule formula of C16H18N2O3 was in perfect agreement with the already described fragmentation pathway of 1-8 and the HRMS experiments confirmed that the expected sulfur bridge was formed. Thus, by heterologous expression of the cytochrome P450 gene sirC, the actual end-products were identified and named as dithioclapurine (9), trithioclapurine (10) and tetrathioclapurine (11). To confirm the predicted structures, the new clapurines were isolated out of the fungal mycelium. Therefore, the fungal mycelium was extracted and the extract directly purified by preparative HPLC. Unfortunately, the concentrations of the metabolites were too low to measure 13C spectra. Nevertheless, 1H NMR spectra of tetrathioclapurine 11 (0.25 mg) (S14A Fig) exclusively shows the signals of the carbon skeleton as described for 2 above. The proton H-3 could be therefore assigned to the singulet at \u03b4 = 5,2 ppm. The more sensitive HSQC experiment assigned the 13C signal of C-3 as \u03b4 = 60.01 ppm and HMBC couplings between H-7a/b characterized the carbon atom C-6 at \u03b4 = 72.05 ppm (S14C Fig).", "In planta analysis of the new metabolites", "To determine the relevance and occurrence of the new metabolites in planta, rye was infected with the OE::tcpZ and the OE::tcpZ/OE::sirC strain as well as the C. purpurea wild-type. No influence of the overproduced metabolites on the infection process of the fungus could be observed. Eight to nine days post-infection first signs of the infection (honeydew production) were visible and after approximately 15 days sclerotia, the resting structure of the fungus, were formed. After three weeks the sclerotia were extracted and analyzed by HPLC-HRMS. The metabolites were identified by their retention time, exact mass and HRMSn data. The spectrum of metabolites in sclerotia was identical to that in axenic culture, including 1a/b, 2a/b and 3. Interestingly, these metabolites were also detectable in wild-type infected sclerotia, but in much lower concentrations. Apart from that, other shunt products were detectable, which did not seem to be connected to the dysfunctional P450 enzyme. In sclerotia of the OE::tcpZ/OE::sirC strain, additionally dithioclapurine (10) was detectable.", "In summary, we could show that the standard C. purpurea strain is not able to produce ETPs with the characteristic disulfide bridge although all genes required are present in the genome. Instead of the expected ETPs we isolated and purified several new, unusual metabolites of the ETP gene cluster in axenic culture and in planta. By expressing the L. maculans P450 monooxygenase-encoding gene sirC in Claviceps we could demonstrate that this is the critical step in the ETP pathway in C. purpurea: the actual end-products of the ETP-like gene cluster were identified and characterized by HRMSn. The so called clapurines are previously unknown ETPs, which might contribute to the toxicity of other C. purpurea strains with an intact and functional cytochrome P450 enzyme."]
