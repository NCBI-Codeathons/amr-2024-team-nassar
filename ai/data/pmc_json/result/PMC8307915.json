["3. Results", "3.1. Comparative Genomics and Taxonomic Assessment of Archangium Primigenium, Chondrococcus Macrosporus, and Environmental Isolates", "Genome sequencing provided high quality draft genomes for each of the six investigated myxobacteria, as indicated by the summary of general features in Table 1. The total genome sizes ranged from ~9.5\u201313 Mb, and the %GC content varied around ~69\u201371%. Of the six genomes, both environmental strains SCHIC003 and SCPEA002 were assembled on a single contig. Overall, the assemblies for each genome provided much lower total contig counts (1\u201317) than recently sequenced myxobacterial genomes [3,8]. Interestingly, a minimum evolution of phylogenetic trees generated from the whole genome sequence data clustered A. primigenium with Melittangium boletus DSM 14713T and not with the three currently sequenced strains from the genus Archangium (Figure 2, Figures S1 and S2). Accordingly, ANI and dDDH values supported the placement of A. primigenium in the genus Melittangium (Table 2) as a novel species with both values well below the established cutoffs for classification of distinct species (<95% ANI; <70% dDDH) [31,34,35,37,64]. These data suggest A. primigenium is currently misclassified as a member of the genus Archangium and should instead be placed in the genus Melittangium.", "The calculated ANI and dDDH values for the sequenced C. marcosporus strain acquired from the ATCC support the original assignment to the genus Chondrococcus, now Corallococcus [31,50]. As opposed to the recently reclassified Myxococcus macrosporus DSM 14697T, previously Corallococcus macrosporus, the minimum evolution phylogenetic tree suggested C. macrosporus ATCC 29039 to be a member or the genus Corallococcus most similar to Corallococcus exercitus DSM 108849T (Figure 2, Figures S1 and S3) [50]. The isolated strains NCCRE002 and NCSPR001 were also determined to be members of the genus Corallococcus (Figure 2, Figures S1 and S3). Comparative genome analyses implied that strain NCCRE002 is an isolate of Corallococcus exiguus DSM 14696T. However, the ANI and GBDP trees suggested that strain NCSPR001 is a novel member of the genus Corallococcus most similar to Corallococcus coralloides DSM 2259T (Table 3).", "The isolated SCHIC003 and SCPEA002 strains were initially determined to be members of the genus Myxococcus. However, inclusion of sequenced representatives from the genus Pyxidicoccus (considered to be synonymous with Myxococcus) [3] in our comparative analysis grouped strain SCPEA002 within the Pyxidicoccus clade (Figure 2, Figures S1 and S4). Most similar to Pyxidicoccus caerfyrddinensis CA032AT, dDDH and ANI analysis suggested the SCPEA002 strain to be a novel member of the genus Pyxidicoccus (Table 4). Similarly, comparative genome analysis determined that strain SCHIC003 is likely be a novel member of the genus Myxococcus, albeit highly similar to Myxococcus stipitatus DSM 14675T with ANI and dDDH values just below the cutoffs for species differentiation [31,37,64] (Table 4 and Figure 2, Figures S1 and S3).", "3.2. Biosynthetic Potential and Genus Level Correlations", "Analysis of our draft genomes using the biosynthetic pathway prediction platform AntiSMASH revealed a range of 29\u201342 total predicted BGCs with C. macrosporus including the highest total of BGCs. However, the draft genome for C. macrosporus also included the highest total of four partial BGCs positioned on the edges of contigs. No BGCs occurring on contig edges were observed from A. primigenium, NCSPR001, or SCPEA002. All of the sequenced strains included highly similar (\u226575% similarity score) biosynthetic pathways for the signaling terpene geosmin [65,66], the signaling lipids VEPE/AEPE/TG-1 [67,68], and carotenoids [69,70,71,72] (Figure 3). Excluding SCHIC003, each genome included a BGC highly homologous to the pathway associated with the myxobacterial siderophore myxochelin [73,74]. Pathways somewhat similar (similarity scores of 66%) to the myxoprincomide-c506 BGC were observed in every genome except the A. primigenium genome [75]. Clusters with \u226575% similarity to pathways from M. stipitatus DSM 14675T associated with the metabolites rhizopodin [76,77] and phenalamide A2 [78] were observed in the SCHIC003 draft genome as well as clusters also present in the M. stipitatus DSM 14675T genome deposited in the AntiSMASH database [79], including the dkxanthene [80], fulvuthiacene [81], and violacein [82,83,84] BGCs (Figure 4). Considering previously characterized BGCs from each genus associated with the six investigated myxobacteria, the corallopyronin BGC from C. coralloides B035 [85,86] was absent from all three of the putative Corallococcus strains, the melithiazol BGC from Melittangium lichenicola Me I46 [87] was not present in A. primigenium, and neither the disciformycin/gulmirecin BGC [88,89] or the pyxidicycline BGC [90] from Pyxidicoccus fallax were present in SCPEA002.", "Utilizing the BiG-SCAPE platform to render BGC sequence similarity networks, we sought to determine the extent of homology between BGCs from our six sequenced myxobacteria and BGCs from all currently sequenced members of the suborder Cystobacterineae [91]. The resulting sequence similarity network included 1080 BGCs connected by 3046 edges (not including self-looped nodes/singletons) and depicted genus-level homologies across all BGCs from the newly sequenced myxobacteria corroborating our suggested taxonomic assignments (Figure 5 and Table 5). For example, BGCs from the three newly sequenced samples C. macrosporus, NCSPR001, and NCCRE002 were almost exclusively clustered with BGCs from members of the genus Corallococcus, and BGCs from SCHIC003 and SCPEA002 samples clustered with the genera Myxococcus and Pyxidicoccus (Figure 5). However, SCPEA002 BGCs do not cluster as frequently with Pyxidicoccus BGCs as they do Myxococcus BGCs, and the majority (76.5%) were not clustered with any BGC within the network (Table 5). This is likely due to the highly fragmented nature of available Pyxidicoccus genomes resulting in many incomplete or partial BGCs. Therefore, few Pyxidicoccus pathways appear in the similarity network, and the percentage of unique pathways associated with SCPEA002 is likely overestimated. Regardless, the limited number of SCPEA002 BGCs clustered with BGCs from Myxococcus/Pyxidicoccus genomes indicates a potential to discover novel metabolites despite placement in the highly scrutinized clade. The only clustered groups with numerous edges formed between BGCs from the genera Myxococcus and Corallococcus included characterized biosynthetic pathways for ubiquitous signaling lipids VEPE/AEPE/TG-1, carotenoids, and the siderophore myxochelin as well as two uncharacterized BGCs predicted to produce ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs).", "Interestingly, a total of 23 A. primigenium BGCs (out of 32 BGCs) appear as singletons in the network with no homology to any of the included BGCs from Cystobacterineae. In fact, aside from the VEPE/AEPE/TG-1 cluster and a terpene cluster that included members of the genera Archangium and Cystobacter, all remaining BGCs from A. primigenium had connecting edges to BGCs from Melittangium boletus DSM 14713T. Out of 21 edges formed by A. primigenium in the network, four edges were formed with four species of Corallococcus (a total of 11 Corallococcus species in the network), four edges were formed with all species of Cystobacter (three species in the network), six edges were formed with all species of Archangium (three species in the network), and seven edges were formed with the only Melittangium species in the network, M. boletus DSM 14713T. Overall, these data corroborate our preliminary taxonomic assignments and suggest that the prioritization of A. primigenium for subsequent discovery efforts is most likely to yield novel metabolites."]
