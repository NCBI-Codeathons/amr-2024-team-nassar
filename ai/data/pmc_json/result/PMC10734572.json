["Results", "Algorithm and rg3m Computer Script", "Since SM genes are often clustered around easily identifiable core backbone synthesis genes, we reasoned that we could circumvent potential errors inherent in approaches based on SM cluster prediction algorithms by simply determining if a target resistance gene is located within a specified distance of a core biosynthetic SM gene, and at least one additional allele of the target gene is present elsewhere in the genome. SM BGCs can vary greatly in size; for instance, the F9775/orsellinic acid BGC in Aspergillus nidulans is only 11\u00a0kb in length (Sanchez et al., 2010), whereas the aflatoxin cluster of Aspergillus parasiticus is \u223c70\u00a0kb (Yu et al., 2004). In principle, the frequency of false positives (target resistance genes within the specified distance of a core biosynthetic gene even though there is no functional relationship between them) should increase as a function of the specified distance. Accordingly, we designed rg3m to allow the user to specify the maximum allowable distance between the center of the target resistance gene and the center of the closest core SM biosynthetic gene as defined by our input lists.", "Our workflow involves four main steps. In step 1, we create a database of comma separated values (CSV) files containing the genomic coordinates of all the core SM biosynthetic genes (DMATs, PKSs, NRPSs, and terpene synthases/cyclases) in MycoCosm. A useful feature of MycoCosm is that one can choose to focus on a particular class or phylum, but for all cases described in this manuscript, we created files for all the sequenced fungi in MycoCosm. To generate these core biosynthetic gene CSV files, one can use a variety of search options such as a BLAST search, a keyword search, or a EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG terms) search as defined by MycoCosm. To generate our NRPS file we used KOG term 1178 to generate a CSV file of all of the \u201cnon-ribosomal peptide synthetase/alpha-aminoadipate reductase and related enzymes\u201d on MycoCosm (27\u00a0807 genes). To generate our PKS file, we first did a trial run, generating three files using the search terms polyketide synthase, polyketide, and KOG1202 (\u201canimal-type fatty acid synthase genes and related proteins\u201d) and compared the results. The KOG1202 search gave the most complete file, yielding 27\u00a0249 genes. We have used it for all our analyses involving PKS genes in this paper and, henceforth, will refer to it as our PKS file. Using the search terms \u201cterpene synthase,\u201d \u201cterpene cyclase,\u201d and \u201ctryptophan dimethylallyltransferase,\u201d we generated files that contained 12\u00a0077 genes, 2436 genes and 3112 genes, respectively. While one could combine these files into a single large file containing all core biosynthetic genes, we have found it convenient to keep the various classes of core biosynthetic genes in separate files. These core biosynthetic gene files can be used for multiple searches and need only be updated from time to time as the number of sequenced fungal genomes increases.", "In step 2, we create a CSV file containing the genomic coordinates for all the homologs of our target gene in a chosen fungal group (in our case all the fungi on MycoCosm). If, for example, we wish to find BGCs that produce an HMGCR inhibitor, we would create a file containing, in principle, all genes encoding HMGCR. Although one could use a variety of searches, we have found that TBLASTN searches generally give the most complete data sets.", "In step 3, each core biosynthetic gene file and the target gene file are used as input data by rg3m (Fig.\u00a01). rg3m queries the two files, looking for instances in which two or more homologs of the target resistance gene are present in the same genome and one of the homologs is within a user-specified distance of a core SM biosynthetic gene. (Note, in this instance the distance is defined as the distance between the center of the target gene and the center of the core biosynthetic gene as designated by their genomic location in the input files. In all other cases in this manuscript, when we refer to distances between genes, we refer to the distances between the ends of genes as defined by the beginnings and ends of genes as annotated in MycoCosm.) The rg3m script creates a list of \u2018hits\u2019 which can be output into a CSV file at the user's command. This list contains the genome designation as specified in the MycoCosm database (which can include the species, strain, and annotation version), the E-value and percent identity of the predicted protein product of the putative resistance gene relative to the homolog used as the query for the TBLASTN search, the genomic coordinates of the resistance gene and the core backbone SM biosynthesis gene, and the distance between the resistance gene and core backbone synthesis gene. In step 4, the researcher evaluates these hits manually, aided by various tools such as the genome browser and SMURF SM cluster predictions available on MycoCosm.", "Fig. 1.Flowchart of our resistance gene-guided genome mining script, rg3m. The script initially reads a CSV file of all query genes (housekeeping and putative resistance genes) (a). If desired, the \u201cnocheck\u201d parameter (b) can be implemented to waive the requirement for each genome to contain at least two query genes (a housekeeping and putative resistance gene). This would preclude resistance gene-guided genome mining, but it might have other uses. One could, for example, find all the transcription factors within a user-specified distance of a secondary metabolism core biosynthetic gene. Normally, genomes in which there are fewer than two query genes are removed (c), resulting in a virtual table containing putative resistance genes along with the assembled genomes in which they are found (organism), as well as their scaffold numbers and genomic coordinates (d). Next, the script reads in the secondary metabolite gene data (e), creating a virtual secondary metabolite gene table that contains the genomic coordinates of secondary metabolism core biosynthetic genes (f). For each putative resistance gene, the script interrogates the secondary metabolite gene, determining if the resistance gene is in the same genome (organism) (g). If it is not in the same genome, the script moves to the next gene in the secondary metabolite gene table. If it is in the same genome, the script determines if the resistance gene is in the same scaffold (h), and if it is in the same scaffold, it determines if it is within a user-specified distance of the target SM gene (i). If it is within that distance, the script accepts it as a hit. If the homolog mode is active, any resistance genes with a matching organism are added to a Homolog table (j).

The script is then ended (q).", "To determine the efficacy of our approach, we tested it by looking for BGCs that putatively produce inhibitors of the \u03b26 subunit of the proteasome or of HMGCR. The proteasome is a critical cellular complex that is required for proteolysis of proteins targeted for destruction by ubiquitination. Proteasome inhibitors are increasingly valuable cancer chemotherapy agents (Goldberg, 2012; Kisselev et al., 2012), and the proteasome inhibitor fellutamide B is a potent inhibitor of the tuberculosis-causing bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Lin et al., 2010). Fellutamide B inhibits the proteasome by targeting the \u03b26 proteasome subunit, and the A. nidulans fellutamide B BGC contains a \u03b26 homolog (inpE) that has been demonstrated experimentally to confer resistance to fellutamide B (Yeh et al., 2016). HMG-CoA reductase is a critical gene in sterol biosynthesis in both fungi and humans. It is inhibited by lovastatin, and the Aspergillus terreus lovastatin BGC contains an HMGCR allele (lvrA) that confers resistance (Hutchinson et al., 2000). Fellutamide B and lovastatin clusters have been reported in several fungi in the MycoCosm database. We reasoned that if our approach works, known fellutamide B and lovastatin clusters should be included among our hits. Additionally, previously undiscovered fellutamide-like or lovastatin-like clusters might be found. Perhaps most interestingly, we anticipated our approach might find BGCs that putatively encode novel classes of inhibitors of the proteasome \u03b26 subunit or HMGCR.", "We also reasoned that analyzing the distinct cluster families whose members produce similar SMs could help us improve our algorithm and understand this unique class of SM BGCs that have resistance genes. For instance, our analysis of these clusters might teach us more about the sizes and gene arrangements of SM BGCs with resistance genes, which could aid us in setting generalized input parameters or optimizing our algorithm. Studying these clusters might also be informative to the evolutionary inheritance of SM BGCs among fungi, that is, horizontal gene transfer.", "Proteasome \u03b26 Subunit BGCs", "We used the \u201chousekeeping\u201d \u03b26 subunit proteasome gene AN5784 from A. nidulans (FungiDB.org) (Arnaud et al., 2012; Yeh et al., 2016) and an E-value cutoff of 1E-40 to conduct a TBLASTN search of fungal genomes in MycoCosm. This generated a list of 1557 \u03b26 subunit proteasome genes, and their coordinates. Inputting our NRPS and \u03b26 subunit proteasome files into the rg3m script with a distance cutoff value of 70\u00a0kb generated a list of 81 hits in 42 genomes, with two hits representing the A. nidulans fellutamide B BGC (Supplementary Spreadsheet 1, NRPS Hits at 70\u00a0kb tab). Note that because fellutamide clusters contain two NRPS genes, each complete fellutamide BGC generates two hits.", "Next, using MycoCosm's genome browser, we reviewed the hits by looking at the annotations and ontologies of the genes in the regions around the putative NRPS and proteasome subunit genes. The fellutamide B cluster in A. nidulans (Fig.\u00a02) contains two NRPS genes, a fatty-acyl-AMP ligase gene, a transporter gene, a TF gene, a proteasome \u03b26 subunit homolog, and an esterase or lipase gene, the product of which is predicted to be involved in product release/transfer (Yeh et al., 2013). For one hit, in Amylomyces rouxii NRRL 5866 v1.0 (Wang et al., 2023), due to the presence of a large number of genes with unknown functions in the region, it was not obvious to us that the genes around the proteasome \u03b26 formed an SM BGC. There were three hits in the Aspergillus multicolor v1.0 genome. Two hits were NRPS genes that formed part of a fellutamide cluster, but the third hit was an NRPS gene located almost 40\u00a0kb away from this fellutamide cluster. The clusters in the remaining genomes, however, were clearly complete or partial fellutamide clusters, based on the genes they contained and pairwise BLASTP comparisons that revealed the high degree of homology of the predicted products of those genes (low E-values, high percentage similarity, and high percentage identity) to the proteins encoded by homologous A. nidulans fellutamide cluster genes (Supplemental Spreadsheet 1, Fellutamide Cluster BLASTPs tab).", "Fig. 2.Representative fellutamide family BGCs in the genus Aspergillus.

Aspergillus navahoensis v1.0 contained an incomplete fellutamide cluster lacking homologs of the of the inpA NRPS gene and the inpF product release/transfer gene. BLAST searches did not reveal strong homologs of these genes elsewhere in the genome, so the absence of these genes did not appear to be a genome assembly error. The NRPS gene that was present was a homolog of inpB but was much shorter, with a predicted product of 688 amino acids versus 2327 amino acids for inpB. The smaller gene did not appear to be an annotation error. Rather, the 5\u2019 end of the gene appeared to be deleted. This cluster could, thus, be an evolutionary relict rendered dysfunctional by a deletion that removed a portion of the cluster.", "The hits in Aspergillus fructiculosus v1.0 and Aspergillus falconensis CBS 271.91 v1.0 genomes were in clusters very similar to each other (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1, Fellutamide Cluster BLASTPs tab and Supplementary Fig. S1). The cluster was near the end of a scaffold in each genome with the scaffolds extended in opposite directions from a syntenic region. Within the syntenic region there were genes putatively encoding an AMP-dependent synthetase/ligase NRPS, a proteasome subunit, which appeared to be fused to a TF gene, a transporter gene, a TF gene, and a fatty-acyl-AMP ligase gene, each with strong homology to genes in the A. nidulans fellutamide cluster (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1, Fellutamide Cluster BLASTPs tab). The genes were in the same order in the two clusters. We looked for inpA and inpB homologs in regions upstream and downstream of the BGCs, and they were absent. The syntenic region did contain genes encoding a monooxygenase and cytochrome P450 which often function in biosynthesis of SMs. These two clusters are clearly related to fellutamide BGCs but could not make fellutamides (assuming that the absence of other fellutamide BGC genes is not due to incorrect genome assembly), although they might make other products.", "Trichocoma paradoxa CBS 103.73 v1.0, Bisporella sp. PMI857 v1.0, and Spathularia flavida all had complete clusters. Note that the TF in S. flavida is not annotated in MycoCosm and that fellutamide clusters have been previously identified in Bisporella sp. PMI857 v1.0 and S. flavida (Lan et al., 2020). A fellutamide cluster is present in the lichen fungus Lobaria pulmonaria (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1, Fellutamide Cluster BLASTPs tab and Supplementary Fig. S2) as previously noted (Lan et al., 2020), and it merits additional comment. The cluster is present in the reference strain isolated in Scotland and in extracted genomes from Africa, Spain, Scotland, and Switzerland (i.e., genomes deduced from the sequenced lichen, including symbionts, rather than the purified fungus). The cluster lacks the NRPS product release/transfer gene inpF found in A. nidulans. However, in A. nidulans, inpF is not strictly required for fellutamide B production, but production is greatly reduced in its absence (Yeh et al., 2016). Given that lichens grow very slowly, it is possible that slow production of metabolites might be advantageous to match the growth rate and maintain appropriate levels in thalli. We noticed two additional oddities about the L. pulmonaria data. One is that the annotated versions of the proteasome subunit in the cluster appear shorter than in other organisms. However, there are sequences upstream of the putative start codon that are strongly homologous to the N-terminal regions of the predicted protein in other genomes in this study. This raises the possibility of a sequencing and/or annotation error, but a second oddity is that the sequences of the region encoding the subunit are extraordinarily conserved at the nucleotide level even though the sequenced samples were collected from geographically distant locations. For instance, in an MSA of a region spanning from 750 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of the proteasome subunit gene to 750 nucleotides downstream of the start codon of the proteasome subunit gene from the five L. pulmonaria genomes, we found only five instances where nucleotides differed. Note, however, that there is less conservation in the regions flanking the BGC (Supplementary Fig. S2).", "Finally, it is worth noting that some of the fellutamide gene clusters have adjacent genes that potentially have roles in secondary metabolism (examples are shown in Fig.\u00a02), and a small number have additional potential secondary metabolism genes within the BGCs. It is possible that the products of these genes may modify the products of the BGCs, creating fellutamide variants.", "Having confirmed the effectiveness of our approach in finding fellutamide clusters, we searched for other SM BGC classes looking for clusters that produce new classes of \u03b26 proteasome subunit inhibitors. Using the rg3m script to query our PKS file with a distance cutoff of 70\u00a0kb revealed only seven hits (Supplementary Spreadsheet 1, PKS Hits at 70\u00a0kb tab). In two of these, Bisporella sp. PMI857 v1.0 and Aspergillus recurvatus v1.0, the PKS was within 70\u00a0kb of a \u03b26 proteasome subunit in a fellutamide-family cluster we had found in our NRPS search. There were approximately 15 genes between the PKS and the core fellutamide BGC in each case, and the putative functions of several of these genes suggested a role in secondary metabolism. The distributions of SM and non-SM genes suggested, however, that in each case the PKS gene is likely to be a part of a separate SM BGC that is near to the fellutamide-family BGC rather than a component of a giant fellutamide-family BGC.", "In four hits (A. fructiculosus v1.0, A. falconensis CBS 271.91 v1.0, Leotiomycetes Genome 1 and Agaricomycetes Genome 3), the PKS genes appeared to be in BGCs, but there were several genes with no apparent role in secondary metabolism between the proteasome subunit gene and the PKS. In these instances, the reason for the proximity of the proteasome subunit to the BGC is unknown.", "The remaining hit was in an unpublished Eurotiomycetes Genome (Eurotiomycetes Genome 1, Supplementary Spreadsheet 1, PKS Hits at 70\u00a0kb tab) in which the proteasome subunit gene is located 18\u2009598\u00a0bp away from the PKS gene. The two genes are flanked by several genes with putative functions in secondary metabolism, suggesting that they are in a BGC and raising the possibility that the BGC makes a novel polyketide proteasome inhibitor. The validity of the BGC is called into question, however, by the fact that there are a number of hypothetical genes with no predicted function in the region, including some between the PKS gene and the proteasome subunit gene. If the large number of hypothetical genes is simply due to poor annotation and gene calling and the BGC is valid, this could be an exciting BGC to investigate further.", "To determine if terpene synthases might be backbone genes of other BGCs that produce proteasome \u03b26 inhibitors, we ran the rg3m script, again with a distance cutoff of 70\u00a0kb, and this returned only three hits (in Postia placenta MAD 698-R v1.0 (Martinez et al., 2009), Suillus occidentalis FC124 v1.0 (Lofgren et al., 2021), and Suillus lakei FC43 v1.0 (Lofgren et al., 2021) (Supplementary Spreadsheet 1, Terpene Synthase Hits at 70\u00a0kb tab). In each case, there was no obvious SM BGC around the terpene synthase, and they were, thus, not particularly good candidates for producing proteasome \u03b26 inhibitors. Finally, querying our terpene cyclase and DMATS databases for proteasome \u03b26 inhibitors using a 70\u00a0kb cut off yielded no hits.", "HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Lovastatin family BGCs", "To test our approach further, we looked for BGCs containing HMGCR genes, hoping to find known and, potentially, undiscovered lovastatin-like clusters, and other clusters that potentially produce new HMGCR inhibitors. To construct our HMGCR homolog file, we used the A. terreus NIH 2624 (Arnaud et al., 2012) HMGCR housekeeping gene (ATET_09520) to conduct a TBLASTN search of the MycoCosm database using an E-value cut off of 1E-40. This search generated a CSV file containing 2326 HMGCR homologs. Interrogating the HMGCR homolog file and our PKS file with the rg3m script, using a cutoff value of 70\u00a0kb, generated 85 hits including two hits representing the A. terreus NIH 2624 lovastatin cluster (the lovastatin BGC contains two PKS genes) (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, PKS Hits at 70\u00a0kb tab).", "Using MycoCosm's genome browser, we reviewed the hits by examining the gene annotations and ontologies of the genes in the regions around the putative PKS and HMGCR genes. In addition to the two A. terreus NIH 2624 hits, 18 hits in 10 genomes were in BGCs that resembled the A. terreus lovastatin cluster (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, PKS Hits at 70\u00a0kb tab and Lovastatin Cluster BLASTPs tab; examples are shown in Fig.\u00a03). Because the lovastatin cluster contains two PKS genes, our script generated two hits for most lovastatin family clusters. The exceptions were: Colletotrichum godetiae CBS 193.32 v1.0, which generated three hits because the lovF homolog was incorrectly annotated and split into two genes, Xylaria sp. FL1777 v1.0 (Franco et al., 2022), which generated only one hit because it does not have the lovF PKS (BLASTP searches did not reveal a strong lovF homolog anywhere in the genome), and Monascus ruber NRRL 1597 v1.0, which generated only one hit because the cluster was located at the edge of a scaffold, and this resulted in the lovF homolog being located on a different scaffold (we subsequently found the lovF homolog through a BLASTP search). Aspergillus homomorphus CBS 101889 v1.0 (Vesth et al., 2018) generated only one hit because it has a partial HMGCR cluster, containing only three annotated genes, one of which is a homolog of lovF (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Lovastatin Cluster BLASTPs tab). A TBLASTN search of the genome did not reveal strong homologs of the missing genes, and they are, thus, likely to be genuinely absent rather than separated from the remainder of the cluster by incorrect or incomplete genome assembly.", "Fig. 3.The order and orientation of genes within representative lovastatin family BGCs.

The three Colletotrichum BGCs have similar gene orders to each other, but they are different from the Aspergillus species gene orders, and they have different genes flanking the BGC. The gene order of the Ilyonectria sp. Biosynthetic gene clusters is different from the others but there are good homologs of all of the A. terreus genes except lovI, the efflux pump. Xylaria grammica does not have good homologs of lovF and lovI, but it has two MFS genes and a PKS nearby that could, in principle, be part of the BGC, functioning in place of lovF and lovI. Notes: There is a putative Zinc finger encoding gene (blue arrow) between the lovC and lovG homologs in Colletotrichum godetiae, although it was not present in the other BGCs. HYP in Xylaria grammica stands for hypothetical gene.", "Expression studies, deletion studies, and comparisons of the lovastatin/monocolin K gene clusters from A. terreus and Monascus pilosus have revealed that the lovastatin cluster in A. terreus contains the aforementioned two PKS genes (lovB and lovF), a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) gene (lovI), an HMGCR gene (lvrA), an acyl transferase gene (lovD), an enoyl reductase gene (lovC), a thioesterase gene (lovG), a P450 monoxygenase gene (lovA), and a TF gene (lovE) (Hutchinson et al., 2000; Kennedy et al., 1999; Sorensen et al., 2001; Sorensen and Vederas, 2003; Chen et al., 2008). We performed pairwise BLASTP comparisons of the genes surrounding each of our hits against their potential A. terreus NIH 2624 cluster homologs (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Lovastatin Cluster BLASTPs tab). The BLASTP comparisons showed a high degree of homology (low E-values, high percentage similarity, and high percentage identity) confirming that these BGCs are closely related to the A. terreus lovastatin BGC, further validating our approach (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Lovastatin Cluster BLASTPs tab). There were differences in the compositions and gene order of the BGCs, however (Fig.\u00a03), indicating that the BGCs have changed over time.", "Colletotrichum higginsianum IMI 349063 (Zampounis et al., 2016), C. godetiae CBS 193.32 v1.0 and M. ruber NRRL 1597 v1.0 had strong homologs of all of the genes in the A. terreus NIH 2624 lovastatin BGC, although in C. godetiae CBS 193.32 v1.0 the lovF PKS gene was misannotated as two genes. As mentioned, the A. homomorphus CBS 101889 v1.0 genome contained a partial BGC with only three annotated genes, homologs of lovD (acyl transferase), lvrA (HMGCR), and lovF (PKS) (and potentially the transcription factor lovE, although the TF was not annotated as a gene in MycoCosm). Since this cluster does not have the lovB PKS gene, it cannot make lovastatin, and it may be a remnant of a once functional lovastatin cluster. The BGCs in Ilyonectria sp. MPI-CAGE-AT-0134 v1.0 (Mesny et al., 2021), Aspergillus chrysellus CBS 472.65 v1.0, Aspergillus sclerotiorum CBS 549.65 v1.0, A. homomorphus CBS 101889 v1.0, Xylaria grammica CBS 120713 v1.0 (Franco et al., 2022) and Xylaria sp. FL1777 v1.0 genomes lacked homologs of the MFS gene ATET_09967 (lovI). Major facilitator superfamily proteins are membrane proteins that move small solutes across membranes. In lovastatin BGCs, the MFS is likely to export the compound produced by the BGC (i.e., lovastatin or a closely related compound). There are numerous MFS genes in fungal genomes, and, in instances in which there is no MFS gene in the BGC, this function may be carried out by an MFS separate from the BGC.", "The lovC enoyl reductase gene in Colletotrichum orchidophilum IMI 309357 (Baroncelli et al., 2018) was not found in the same stretch of DNA as the rest of the lovastatin genes, but we found a strong homolog elsewhere in the genome through a BLASTP search. We found two strong lovG homologs in C. orchidophilum IMI 309357. One homolog was located in the same area as the majority of the genes in the lovastatin cluster, and, as annotated, it encodes a predicted protein of 824 amino acids in comparison to the 243\u2013264 amino acids predicted in other species. The abnormal length appears to be due to an incorrect annotation that fuses the lovG homolog with the homolog of the lovI MFS gene. The second lovG homolog in C. orchidophilum IMI 309357 was found with a BLASTP search. It was located next to the lovC enoyl reductase gene, and the pair were separated in the genome from the remainder of the BGC. This suggests that a portion of the C. orchidophilum IMI 309357 lovastatin BGC has been duplicated and translocated.", "Pairwise BLASTP comparisons of the LovF PKS with its homologs revealed strong homology in most cases (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Lovastatin Cluster BLASTPs tab). Exceptions were Xylaria sp. FL1777 v1.0 that does not have a homolog, X. grammica CBS 120713 v1.0 in which the closest LovF homolog was only 32% identical to LovF, and Ilyonectria sp. MPI-CAGE-AT-0134 v1.0, in which the closest homolog was only 29% identical. LovF produces a side chain that is added to the core lovastatin scaffold. We speculate that the variability in the LovF homologs may result in different hydrocarbon chains being produced, particularly for the Ilyonectria sp. MPI-CAGE-AT-0134 v1.0 homolog, which has relatively low identity with LovF. It is also likely that the absence of a lovF homolog in Xylaria sp. FL1777 v1.0 results in production of monacolin J, a lovastatin-like compound that simply lacks this side chain but still retains HMGCR inhibitory activity (Endo et al., 1985). Finally, some of these lovastatin family BGCs contain, or are adjacent to, additional genes with likely roles in secondary metabolism. These genes may encode proteins that modify the lovastatin-like compounds to produce additional variants of lovastatin. These genes did not appear, however, to be conserved among the BGCs or among subsets of the BGCs.", "Examination of BGCs and BLASTP comparisons provide evidence for the divergence of regulatory mechanisms (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Lovastatin Cluster BLASTPs tab). The BGCs in C. orchidophilum IMI 309357, A. chrysellus CBS 472.65 v1.0, and A. sclerotiorum CBS 549.65 v1.0 lacked a homolog of the TF (lovE) gene and, therefore, must be regulated by TFs encoded by genes outside the cluster.", "Non-lovastatin Family BGCs With PKS Backbones", "BLASTP comparisons and thorough analyses of the regions surrounding the remaining 65 PKS hits confirmed that they are not part of lovastatin-family BGCs. We note, however, that in many, but not all, instances the HMGCR and PKS genes are clearly in SM gene clusters. Given the relatively low rate of false positives we see with our proteasome \u03b26 subunit search (discussed above), these data raise the exciting possibility that these BGCs may produce new classes of HMGCR inhibitors with polyketide backbones.", "While many of these BGCs are unique, without close relatives in MycoCosm (see examples in Supplementary Fig. S3), others have sibling clusters containing similar complements of homologous SM genes, forming, in aggregate, families of clusters. Aspergillus olivicola v1.0 and Aspergillus undulatus CBS 261.88 v1.0, for example, have very similar clusters containing genes putatively encoding an amidohydrolase, a multicopper oxidase, a polyprenyl synthetase, a prenyl transferase, an NAD(P)/FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, two cytochrome P450s, two MFS proteins, two conserved hypothetical genes, and an amino acid transporter in addition to the PKS and HMGCR genes (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, A. olivicola Family tab and Fig.\u00a04.) Pairwise BLASTP comparisons of homologs from these two clusters showed strong homology with extremely low E values and high percentages of identity and similarity, confirming that they are closely related. Genes on the right flank of the two BGCs have little homology. A pyrroline carboxylate reductase gene is present in both left flanks, but other genes differ. Overall the data are consistent with the BGC being inherited as a unit as would be expected for an SM BGC.", "Fig. 4.Two closely related non-lovastatin BGCs predicted to produce novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Arrows show genes (not to scale) and direction of transcription. Green arrows are putative members of the BGCs, and gray arrows are genes in flanking regions. The blue arrows are both hypothetical proteins, but they don't show strong identities with each other.", "Two closely related non-lovastatin BGCs predicted to produce novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Arrows show genes (not to scale) and direction of transcription. Green arrows are putative members of the BGCs, and gray arrows are genes in flanking regions. The blue arrows are both hypothetical proteins, but they don't show strong identities with each other.", "Similarly, Aspergillus transmontanensis CBS 130015 v1.0 (Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8lling et al., 2020) and Aspergillus parasiticus CBS 117618 v1.0 (Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8lling et al., 2020) have clusters containing, in addition to the PKS and HMGCR genes, genes putatively encoding a PKS dehydratase domain protein, an MFS protein, an oxidoreductase with a transmembrane domain and a PKS enoyl reductase domain protein (Supplemental Spreadsheet 2, A. transmontanensis Family tab). Pairwise BLASTP comparisons of homologs from these clusters showed very strong homology Aspergillus minisclerotigenes CBS 117635 v1.0 (Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8lling et al., 2020) has a truncated version of this cluster, only containing genes for the PKS, HMGCR, and PKS dehydratase domain proteins. As noted for previous examples, this apparent truncation could be a genome assembly artifact.", "Finally, Aspergillus uvarum CBS 121591 v1.0 (Vesth et al., 2018), Aspergillus violaceofuscus CBS 115571 v1.0 (Vesth et al., 2018), and Aspergillus japonicus CBS 114.51 v1.0 (Vesth et al., 2018) contained putative clusters containing genes encoding NADH-dehydrogenase, FAD oxidase, a PKS, two Zn2Cys6 TFs, an actin depolymerizing factor (ADF, also known as cofilin), an acyl transferase, a cytochrome P450, and HMGCR (Supplementary Fig. S4). BLASTP comparisons of these proteins with their A. japonicus CBS 114.51 v1.0 cluster homologs revealed extremely strong homology (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, A. japonicus Family tab and Supplementary Fig. S4). Aspergillus aculeatus ATCC16872 v1.1 (de Vries et al., 2017) has a similar cluster, but it lacks the FAD oxidase and one of the two Zn2Cys6 TFs. With the exception of ADF, the genes are typical of those found in SM BGCs, so these appear to be bona fide SM BGCs. There are, however, sterol biosynthesis genes in addition to HMGCR nearby in the genomes in each of these cases. This raises the slight possibility that these clusters are located in genomic regions that are simply enriched for genes involved in sterol biosynthesis, and that the HMGCR gene is associated with the cluster by chance. The regions flanking the putative BGC are distinct in the four genomes and this helps define the boundaries of the BGC. There are, however, some homologs in the flanks that are shared among flanks of two or more species. This is consistent with the BGC being inherited vertically with genes in the flanking regions changing over time.", "The conserved presence of an ADF gene, which is non-SM-biosynthetic, in the midst of these clusters raises additional questions. Actin depolymerizing factors are conserved in eukaryotes and ADF function (actin depolymerization) is essential. Actin depolymerizing factor inhibitors would certainly be toxic to non-resistant competitors. Phallotoxins produced by basidiomycetes of the genus Amanita, for example, stabilize F-actin, preventing disassembly (Wieland, 1983). We have looked for other ADF alleles in the A. uvarum CBS 121591 v1.0, A. violaceofuscus CBS 115571 v1.0, A. aculeatus ATCC16872 v1.1, and A. japonicus CBS 114.51 v1.0 genomes, and each genome contains two ADF homologs in addition to the one in the BGC. These data raise the possibility that these BGCs produce an ADF inhibitor rather than an HMGCR inhibitor and that the ADF gene in the cluster confers resistance. Without additional data, we cannot, of course, rule out the possibility that the cluster produces both ADF and HMGCR inhibitors or a single compound that inhibits both.", "Putative HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor BGCs With NRPS Backbones", "After confirming our approach through finding lovastatin family clusters and new families of PKS clusters that putatively produce new HMGCR inhibitors, we expanded our search to other classes of core biosynthetic genes. Querying our NRPS database using a distance of 70\u00a0kb returned 95 hits (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, NRPS Hits at 70\u00a0kb tab). Inspection of the regions around the NRPS and HMGCR genes revealed that, while some of these hits do not appear to be in BGCs, or there are multiple non-SM genes (genes with no feasible role in secondary metabolite production) between the NRPS and HMGCR genes, many of them appear to be in valid BGCs with the HMGCR gene contiguous with the remaining genes of the BGC. They are, thus, excellent candidates for BGCs that produce novel classes of HMGCR inhibitors.", "There was a notable family of 19 BGCs in the basidiomycete genera Pisolithus, Boletus, Rickenella, Suillus, and two different genera from unpublished Agaricomycetes (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Pisolithus Family tab. Several of the species in this group are dikaryons. This may explain why there are two similar, but not identical, clusters on scaffolds 5 and 14 in Pisolithus croceorrhizus subspA 74A v1.0 (Plett et al., 2023) and two on scaffolds 58 and 65 in Pisolithus thermaeus 11 v1.0 (Plett et al., 2023). In addition to the NRPS gene, all of these BGCs contain genes that putatively encode an alcohol dehydrogenase, an oxidoreductase with an NAD(P) binding domain, HMGCR, and at least one AMP synthetase/ligase (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Pisolithus family tab). Many also contain a putative multicopper oxidase gene, a fatty acid hydroxylase gene, and a second AMP synthetase/ligase. BLASTP comparisons of the predicted products of these genes, revealed that the homologs in these BGCs are highly conserved. Interestingly, all but two of the BGCs contain a gene encoding a homolog of the exocyst component Sec5, a protein that is unlikely to function in SM biosynthesis. This raises the possibility that these BGCs could make a Sec5 inhibitor with the sec5 allele in the BGC conferring resistance. In aggregate, these results suggest that these clusters are a family of related BGCs. They may produce a new class of HMGCR inhibitors that have a common backbone structure and related, but probably not identical, final products. Interestingly, members of the genera Boletus and Suillus are edible, raising the possibility that consuming them might have some cholesterol-reducing effect.", "Putative HMG-CoA Reductase BGCs With Terpene synthase, Terpene cyclase, and DMATS Backbone Genes", "Querying our terpene synthase and cyclase databases with a distance of 70\u00a0kb returned a total of 26 hits (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, Terpene Synthase & Cyclase Hits tab). Inspection revealed that several of these were not SM BGCs, and several more BGCs were in the vicinity of additional sterol biosynthesis genes, raising the possibility that they may simply be near a cluster of genes involved in sterol biosynthesis. There was a family of terpene synthase clusters in Aspergillus leporis CBS 151.66 v1.0 (Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8lling et al., 2020), Aspergillus alliaceus CBS 536.65 v1.0 (Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8lling et al., 2020), Aspergillus coremiiformis CBS 553.77 v1.0 (Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8lling et al., 2020), and Aspergillus albertensis v1.0 (Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8lling et al., 2020) (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, A. leporis Family tab and Fig.\u00a05). They contain genes that putatively encode a Zn2Cys6 TF, an MFS, two O-acetyl transferases, two cytochrome P450\u2019s, HMGCR, a sesquiterpene cyclase, an a C2H2 zinc finger TF, and a conserved hypothetical gene. Aspergillus. leporis CBS 151.66 v1.0, A. alliaceus CBS 536.65 v1.0, and A. albertensis v1.0 contained a gene putatively encoding an AMP-dependent synthetase/ligase. Pairwise BLASTP comparisons revealed that the genes are highly homologous (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2, A. leporis Family tab). BLAST searches also revealed that these BGCs are closely related to trichothecene BGCs found in multiple genera of fungi (Proctor et al., 2018, 2020) and, in particular, to the T2 toxin BGC from Fusarium species. The trichothecenes share a common core structure but are structurally diverse with approximately 200 structurally distinct trichothecene analogs having been described (Proctor et al., 2020). Trichothecenes are often toxic, but, to our knowledge none have yet been shown to inhibit HMGCR. The regions flanking these BGCs are quite distinct in the four species and, thus, help to define the limits of the BGC.", "Fig. 5.A family of biosynthetic gene clusters with terpene core biosynthetic genes that may produce novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
