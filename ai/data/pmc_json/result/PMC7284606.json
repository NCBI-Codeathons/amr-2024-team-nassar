["3. Results", "3.1. Regulation and Functionality of the MP1 Colicin", "MP1 offers the opportunity to explore whether colicins are important for a commensal bacterial strain living within a healthy gastrointestinal tract [32]. MP1 harbors a 8.5-kb colicinogenic plasmid that carries a colicin gene (colY) with substantial homology to previously characterized pore-forming colicins, colicin Y and colicin U, as well as genes with homology to lysis (cyl) and immunity (cyi) proteins (Figure S1) [38,39]. In E. coli, the expression of many colicins is triggered by DNA damage and regulated by the SOS response [12,13,15]. In the SOS response, transcription is repressed by LexA which binds to the promoters of SOS-controlled genes. In the presence of DNA damage, LexA undergoes self-cleavage, repression is relieved, and transcription can occur. Genetic analysis of the promoter region of the MP1 colicin gene suggested two potentially overlapping canonical SOS boxes where LexA could bind (Figure 1A). Additionally, the MP1 colicin-promoter region contains an iron\u2013sulfur cluster regulator (IscR) binding site upstream of the SOS boxes, suggesting another possible layer of colicin regulation [40]. IscR functions as a transcriptional repressor and dual repression of colicins with both LexA and IscR has been previously described in other colicins [41].", "To first explore the responsiveness of the colicin promoter (PcolY) to DNA damage, we engineered a reporter plasmid which places the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) under the control of the MP1 PcolY and introduced the plasmid into MP1. As a control, we placed gfp under the control of another well-studied SOS-inducible promoter from dinB (PdinB) [34]. In the absence of UV light as a DNA-damaging agent, no expression of GFP was observed for either construct. Upon exposure to UV light (50 J/m2) we observed inducible expression of GFP from both reporter constructs (Figure 1B). SOS-controlled genes also display time-dependent kinetics, with some genes being induced early in the SOS response, such as recA, and others being induced late in the response, such as dinB [35,42]. The GFP expression pattern of the colY promoter mirrored the expression pattern of the dinB promoter, suggesting there is a delay in colY induction from the initial activation of the SOS response, similar to some previous analysis of SOS-controlled colicins [43]. To verify the timing kinetics, we repeated the experiment in the presence of the SOS-inducible promoter, PrecA (Figure S2A). GFP induction from the PrecA construct was both higher in amplitude and faster than PcolY, reinforcing the conclusion that colicin production occurs later in the SOS response. To verify that the expression of gfp from the colicin promoter was due to LexA cleavage and SOS induction, we utilized a previously constructed MP1 strain that cannot activate the SOS response due to inactivation of LexA self-cleavage [22,44,45]. As predicted, we no longer observed GFP expression in the presence of UV light (Figure S2B). Additionally, we noted a slightly higher baseline level of GFP expression in the wild-type strain relative to SOS-off strain, which suggests that spontaneous induction of the SOS response in a small minority of cells may contribute to basal colicin expression [46]. Collectively, these data demonstrate that MP1\u2032s colicin is regulated by the SOS response, signifying that the MP1 colicin might be important for MP1 survival in the presence of genotoxic stress.", "To validate whether the MP1 model might prove useful for evaluating the role of colicin in vivo, we next aimed to explore the functionality of the MP1 colicin and to characterize its activity. To examine if the colicin could act upon closely related E. coli, we induced colicin production in wild-type MP1 by UV light and then spot plated serial dilutions of the cell lysate on soft agar plates containing the laboratory K-12 strain MG1655. The zone of inhibition was determined by scoring for either clear zones for complete inhibition or turbid zones for partial growth inhibition. In the absence of UV light exposure, turbid growth was only observed with the undiluted lysate, suggesting detectable but low basal levels of colicin production (Figure 1C). For cell lysate from UV-exposed MP1, however, clear zones of inhibition were seen up to a dilution of 103, suggesting significant production of active colicin upon induction of DNA damage. We also explored the spectrum of activity of the MP1 colicin against a broader range of isolates (Table S1). We observed activity against the E.coli Nissle 1917 strain, but not against other E. coli strains, including group A and B2 commensals, or more distantly related pathogens including Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, and Klebsiella. Collectively, these data demonstrate that MP1 carries an inducible, competent, and narrow-spectrum colicin, which could plausibly have a role in MP1 colonization and survival in its natural environmental niche, the mammalian gut.", "3.2. Sustained Colonization in Healthy Murine Gut Does Not Require Colicin Production", "Previous studies have reported the importance of colicins for bacterial survival within the inflamed mammalian gut [31,47]. These studies, however, do not address whether colicins are critical effector proteins used by commensals to initiate and maintain colonization in the absence of intestinal perturbations. The MP1 model of colonization is unique in that colonization can be achieved in the absence of continuous antibiotic treatment. Here, the MP1 model has a brief streptomycin pre-treatment to minimize colonization resistance followed by a 24 h washout period where streptomycin is removed from the water and not replaced prior to strain inoculation. The mice are then inoculated by oral gavage with the bacterial strain of interest and feces is collected at various time points to assess the efficiency and stability of strain colonization with time. Notably, in control experiments, several days following the brief streptomycin treatment the normal flora rebounds, making this system a reliable model for the unperturbed or minimally perturbed mammalian gut [48]. The validated MP1 model has been used to demonstrate a key role for bacterial nitrogen production in altering the gut microbiome, a role of the SOS response during E. coli colonization, and the importance of two-component signaling systems in sustained colonization [22,32,49].", "To investigate the role of colicins in our experimental system, we used a previously constructed pair of wild-type MP1 derivatives containing either mCherry or GFP under the control of a tet promoter [32]. We further engineered the GFP-expressing strain by replacing the colicin gene, colY, with a kanamycin-resistance cassette [33]. In this variant, only the colicin gene was disrupted, leaving the lysis and immunity genes intact. We validated that our colicin-deficient (\u2206colY) strain did not produce an UV-inducible colicin and that the strain remained resistant to the MP1 colicin, indicating that immunity was intact (Figure 2A). Therefore, using this strain we could specifically interrogate whether only the lack of colicin production would impact the ability of MP1 to sustain colonization.", "Taking advantage of the well-established MP1 mouse model, we orally inoculated C57BL/6 male mice with either the wild-type mcherry-marked strain or the \u2206colY gfp-marked strain. With the aim of understanding colonization dynamics in these solo-colonization experiments, we collected feces at the beginning of the experiment until termination of the experiment at 22 days. At each time point, feces were normalized by weight, serially diluted, and plated onto LB agar containing tetracycline, which permits selection of the MP1 strains and induces the expression of either gfp or mcherry. Across time points, the colonization levels of the \u2206colY strain and the wild-type strain showed no statistical difference (Figure 2B). For both groups of mice, there was an initial drop in colony forming units (CFU) after week one, but for both the wild-type strain and the \u2206colY strain the CFUs stabilized at ~107 per gram of stool for the duration of the experiment. These data suggest that MP1 colonizing its natural niche environment may not require colicin production for initiating and maintaining colonization.", "Given that MP1 is a host-adapted strain, we posited that it may have evolved to efficiently contend with ongoing environment perturbations as a consequence of living in a dynamic gastrointestinal tract. We therefore considered that more subtle fitness advantages might be masked in solo-colonization experiments and could potentially manifest when our colicin-proficient and colicin-deficient strains were in direct competition for an intestinal niche. Toward this end, we orally inoculated C57BL/6 male mice with equal mixtures of \u2206colY gfp-marked strain and the wild-type mcherry-marked strain. We quantified the initial inoculum and collected feces continuously throughout the experiment (Figure 3A). At each time point, we calculated the competitive index (CI) in order to quantify the relative fitness of the \u2206colY strain relative to the wild-type strain. The CI was calculated by taking the ratio of input CFU counts to output CFU counts. In this competition experiment between the wild-type strain and the \u2206colY strain, up to 7 days post-inoculation there was no relative colonization defect between the strains (Figure 3B, log CI = 0.061). By day 27, a mild colonization defect was observed whereby the wild-type strain outcompeted the colicin deficient strain by ~3-fold (log CI = \u22120.51, p = 0.003). Over the course of this experiment the overall CFU suggest stable maintenance of both strains, although the levels are reduced relative to the solo-colonization experiment (Figure 3C). Our data indicate that both strains can stably co-colonize the murine gut, and suggest that in this mixed population of commensals, the lack of colicin production has only a small effect on long-term maintenance of colonization.", "3.3. Sustained Colonization in Healthy Murine Gut Does Not Require Colicin Immunity", "Evaluation of the \u2206colY strain afforded us the opportunity to specifically test the effect of colicin production during sustained colonization. However, given that the \u2206colY strain is immune to the MP1 colicin, this experimental setup did not permit us to ascertain whether the colicin production and immunity pair together offers advantages to MP1 during competition. Since the \u2206colY strain is resistant to its colicin, it is conceivable that the engineered \u2206colY strain was benefiting from the colicin production of the wild-type strain, thus masking any fitness defect that might exist. Although there was no detectable difference between the wild-type and \u2206colY strain during solo-colonization experiments, it is possible that there are different and significant fitness requirements during direct competition in the mammalian gut. To address these possibilities, we further manipulated the \u2206colY strain to also delete the immunity gene, cyi. We confirmed that the \u2206colY \u2206cyi does not produce an UV-inducible colicin and that this engineered strain is now sensitive to MP1 colicin (Figure 4A).", "Before proceeding to competition experiments, we first evaluated whether colicin sensitivity had an impact on solo-colonization by MP1. Either the wild-type or the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain were orally inoculated into C57BL/6 male mice and evaluated for total CFU over a 4-week period. In this setting, the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain colonized to a similar extent and with comparable kinetics relative to the wild-type strain; the CFU counts stabilized in the gut within 1 week and remained stable for >4 weeks at ~107 per gram of stool (Figure 4B). The absence of any statistical difference between the colonization suggests that the ability of MP1 to initiate and sustain colonization is independent of both colicin production and resistance.", "To next evaluate whether competition would elicit differences between the two strains, we orally inoculated C57BL/6 male mice with equal mixtures of the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain and the wild-type strain, tracked CFU in feces over time, and calculated the competitive index. As with solo-colonization, there was an initial drop in CFUs with the levels plateauing around day 14 and remaining stable. At each timepoint evaluated, the wild-type strain and the \u2206colY \u2206coli strain were found in similar amounts, which was reflected in the log CI values (Figure 4C,D). Specifically, by day 14 a small colonization advantage was observed in the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain relative to the wild-type strain (log CI = 0.54, p = 0.002). However, the mild colonization advantage for the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain was not consistently significant over time. By the termination of the experiment there was only roughly a 3-fold advantage to the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain (log CI = 0.42, p = 0.003). Taken together, our results suggest that colicin production and resistance are not required for a commensal to establish and sustain colonization and does not augment niche competition in a healthy intestinal environment. Our results suggest that there may be a slight advantage to not harboring both a functional colicin and the immunity gene during commensal gut colonization.", "3.4. Withstanding Strain Invasion in the Murine Gut Does Not Require Colicin Production", "Our work thus far has demonstrated that MP1\u2032s colicin is not critical for stable gut colonization and does not provide a significant fitness benefit during direct niche competition in a healthy gut environment. However, resilience of commensals in the microbiome also depends upon their ability to withstand invasion of their niche by a competing strain. Therefore, we wanted to explore whether colicins aid in MP1\u2032s ability to withstand niche invasion by another commensal. To mirror that scenario, mice were pre-colonized with the gfp-marked \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain and at day 9 post-inoculation were fed mcherry-marked wild-type strain (~106 CFU/mouse). In contrast to the co-inoculating experiments, the wild-type strain failed to sustain colonization in mice pre-colonized with \u2206colY \u2206cyi. By day 3 post-inoculation with the wild-type strain, there was an initial drop in CFU for both strains, but the drop in CFU for the wild-type strain was ~10-fold greater than the drop in CFU for the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain (Figure 5A, p > 0.007). By day 10 post-wild-type inoculation, the wild-type strain dropped to ~104 CFUs whereas the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain remained stable at ~106 CFUs (p > 0.04). At the termination of the experiment, the wild-type strain was only recovered in two out of the five starting mice and the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain remained stable at ~106 CFUs (p > 0.05). Therefore, the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain was able to withstand invasion and prevent colonization by the wild-type strain, suggesting that colicin production and resistance is not critical for a commensal to outcompete invading strains.", "Since pre-colonization of the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain prevented the wild-type stain from robustly colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, we next wanted to assess whether the wild-type strain could prevent the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain from establishing and maintaining colonization. To do this, mice were pre-colonized with the mcherry-marked wild-type strain and at day 9 post-inoculation were fed gfp-marked \u2206colY \u2206coli (~107 CFU/mouse). Again, by day 3 post-inoculation with the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain, there was an initial drop in CFUs for both strains, but in this experiment the drop in CFUs for the invading \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain was ~10-fold (106) whereas the wild-type strain dropped by ~5-fold (~107) (Figure 5B). By day 10 post-\u2206colY \u2206cyi strain inoculation, the pre-colonized wild-type strain stabilized at 107 CFU whereas the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain continued to drop in CFUs eventually stabilizing at ~105 (p > 0.002). As with the reverse scenario, at the termination of the experiment the wild-type strain remained stable at ~106 CFU and the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain was unable to robustly maintain colonization (p > 0.001). Under these conditions, the \u2206colY \u2206cyi strain did not displace the wild-type strain and was unable to sustain colonization levels. Taken together, our data suggest that the ability to withstand strain invasion may be independent of colicin production and resistance."]
