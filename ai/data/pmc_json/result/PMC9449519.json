["Results", "Identification of strain L1 using morphological and molecular markers", "An endophyte (strain L1) was obtained from L. maackii (Rupr.) Maxim (Figure 1A). The strain L1 exhibited phenotypic similarity to the Bacillus spp. with respect to the biochemical, morphological, Gram staining, and cultural characteristics. Nucleotide blast on NCBI revealed that strain L1 shared extremely high similarity with Bacillus velezensis species (99%). On the basis of the strain L1 16S rRNA\u2019s sequence and blast alignment results, MEGA-X was employed to construct a phylogenetic neighbor connection tree that reflected the evolutionary relationship for L1 (Figure 1B). Combining all the resulting analyses, the isolate was identified to be B. velezensis (GenBank Accession No. ON340771).", "Figure 1(A) Morphological characteristics of B. velezensis L1 detected by a scanning electron microscope.

An increased inoculum concentration of B. velezensis L1 improved VOC-induced inhibition. Furthermore, increasing the concentration also enhanced the inhibitory effect of VOCs on pathogenic fungi. The mycelial growth of plug and spore suspensions was inhibited by the bacterial suspension at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\u2009CFU/ml by approximately 92.86 and 90.30%, respectively (Figures 2A,B); the spore germination and sporulation processes were inhibited by 33.11 and 12.04%, respectively (Figures 2C,D).
