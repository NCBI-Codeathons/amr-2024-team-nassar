["3. Results", "3.1. Designing of Synthetic alaD Gene Construct and Construction of Recombinant pLES003alaD Vector", "The synthetic alaD gene construct designed using online computational tools was obtained as a cloned construct in the pUC57 vector from GenScript, USA. The synthetic alaD gene cassette of 1336 bp was extracted from the recombinant pUC57 vector by EcoRI digestion and further ligated into the EcoRI linearized pLES003 plasmid (6134 bp) to generate a recombinant pLES003alaD vector (7464 bp) (Figure 1). Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed for size confirmation of the DNA constructs, which were visualized under UV illumination at 312 nm (Figure 2a).", "3.2. Transformation Efficiency, Plasmid Copy Number and Segregational Stability of Recombinant pLES003alaD Vector", "The shuttle vector pLES003 is a low copy number plasmid constructed for obtaining gene expression lactic acid bacterial strains [29,34]. However, the recombinant plasmid pLES003alaD showed a PCN value of ~10 copies per cell in the P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+), with a transformation efficiency of 8 \u00d7 106 cfu/mL. The recombinant plasmid also displayed an interesting segregational stability up to 70 subculturings in the recombinant host strain (Figure 2b), after which plasmid loss was evidenced in the selected expression host.", "3.3. L-Alanine Production in Recombinant P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) Using Fed-Batch Fermentation", "Dextrose was added to the fed-batch fermentation system after every 6 h till 36 h post inoculation. Supplementation of dextrose at defined intervals enhanced L-alanine production levels significantly upto 229.12 g/L, 2572 mM (which counts for 91.8% of the theoretical yield) after 42 h under oxygen deprived conditions (Figure 3). The L-alanine titers obtained in the present study are quite impressive, compared to most of the previous reports on L-alanine production using recombinant or wild type microorganisms (Table 1). L-alanine production in the wild type P. acidilactici BD16 strain (lacking the recombinant plasmid pLES003alaD) was also quantified, which was almost negligible (4.71 mM) to report here in comparison to the developed recombinant strain (2572 mM), when estimated spectrophotometrically.", "3.4. Crystallization and Enantiomeric Purity of Heterologously Produced L-Alanine", "The use of an auto-inducible promoter P289 for the expression of the synthetic alaD gene construct resulted in the over-expression of the recombinant AlaDH enzyme (12.44 IU/mL, using 55 mM pyruvate as an inducer\u2014unpublished data) and corresponding higher L-alanine titers in the recombinant culture broth, as evidenced by appearance of the turbidity in the recombinant culture broth after 18 h of incubation. The accumulation of L-alanine beyond its solubility triggered the formation of L-alanine crystals. Further, to recover soluble L-alanine from the culture broth, crystallization was performed. After crystallization, the crystal L-alanine titer was quantified, which is about 95% of the total yield (217.54 g/L). The amount was a little lower than the actual L-alanine titer quantified via spectrophotometric assay, possibly due to the inevitable losses observed during crystallization. The dried crystals were used to further study enantiomeric purity of L-alanine. Using a polarimeter, specific rotations of standard and test samples were calculated as +14.2\u00b0 and +13.8\u00b0. Positive values of the observed specific rotations correspond to the L-enantiomers (Pubchem Database). From the specific rotation, optical purity in terms of enantiomeric excess was calculated as 97%, which signifies 97% purity of the L-isomer of alanine produced by the recombinant strain. Earlier, Shibatani and co-workers [10] also reported the optical purity of L-alanine using a polarimeter under similar conditions (c = 4, 6 N HCL) in the form of positive specific rotation values (+14.3\u00b0) which corresponded to 93% purity of the L-isomer of alanine.", "3.5. Morphological and Analytical Characterization of L-Alanine Crystals", "L-alanine crystals were characterized using bioanalytical techniques such as FTIR, HPLC and SEM. The morphology of L-alanine crystals obtained from the fermentation broth was compared with the properties of commercially available L-alanine crystals (Himedia) by SEM. SEM imaging revealed a high similarity between the standard and microbial L-alanine crystals at different resolutions (Figure 4). Figure 4a (i) and (ii) of the standard L-alanine crystals (at a resolution of \u00d765 and \u00d7160, respectively) depict a needle-like morphology. L-alanine produced by the recombinant strain also showed a similar needle-like morphology at the respective resolutions (at \u00d765 and \u00d7160), as depicted in Figure 4b (i) and (ii). A similar morphology of L-alanine crystals has also been reported widely in the previous literature [10,37]; thus, it confirms the presence of L-alanine in the crystals obtained from the fermentation broth.", "FTIR spectra of both standard L-alanine and L-alanine extracted from the recombinant fermentation broth were generated to identify similarities in their relevant functional groups. As evident from Figure 5, the FT-IR spectrum of the microbial L-alanine is highly consistent with that of the standard L-alanine in the region of 3500\u2013500 cm\u22121. The broad absorption bands at 3430 and 3460 cm\u22121 in the spectra were associated with specific N-H stretching of the primary aliphatic amines. C-H stretching of the methyl group was confirmed by the presence of bands at 2728 and 2733 cm\u22121, respectively, and C=O stretching of the carboxylic group was confirmed by the presence of absorption bands at 1729 and 1726 cm\u22121. Typical curved absorption bands at 2594, 2593 and 2506 cm\u22121 were attributed to a typical O-H stretching and bands at 1449, 1450 and 1405 cm\u22121 to a typical O-H bending of the carboxylic group. The sharp signals at 1232, 1233, 1012 and 1013 were credited to C-N stretching of the primary amines [38,39,40].", "Analytical characterization and further confirmation of the L-isomer of alanine in the extracted crystals was also carried out by HPLC analysis. HPLC chromatograms of both the standard and extracted L-alanine were acquired under optimized conditions for comparative analysis. Presence of sharp and intense peak at a retention time of 8.7 min in both the chromatograms revealed and confirmed the presence of L-alanine (Figure 6)."]
