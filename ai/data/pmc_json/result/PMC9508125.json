["Results", "Mutants altered in Trp286 and Trp434 residues", "The productive binding of carbohydrates in HvExoI involves the participation of Trp286 and Trp434 residues that form an aromatic clamp at the +1-subsite, while the neighbouring subsite contains the Asp285 and Glu491 catalysts1\u20133 (Fig.\u00a01a). In HvExoI, after the hydrolytic cycle is completed, both subsites contain entrapped Glc products that are displaced after a new substrate is attached22. The Glc molecule entrapped in the \u22121 subsite (Fig.\u00a01b) is held at the bottom of the pocket by at least 10 residues (Fig.\u00a01a, b). The residues equivalent to the HvExoI 286 and 434 positions overlap in the homologous GH3 exo-hydrolases14,15,32, form similar aromatic clamps, and that of Bacteroides \u03b2-glucosidase (PDB 5JP0) harbours the Glc molecule after in crystallo perfusion (Fig.\u00a01a). To resolve phylogenetic relationships of HvExoI within the GH3 family4 a phylogenetic tree of selected entries was built revealing that the entries segregated in four clusters harbouring five enzyme activities: \u03b2-d-glucan glucohydrolases, \u03b2-d-glucosidases, \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidases, \u03b2-d-xylosidases, and \u03b1-l-arabinofuranosidases33,34 (Fig.\u00a01c; Supplementary Table\u00a01). The inspection of the \u03b2-d-glucan glucohydrolase cluster revealed that Trp286 and Trp434 remained conserved in subclade 1, while in the subclades 2 and 3 enzymes, we identified variations in both Trp residues \u2013 Trp286/Tyr286 and Gln434/Tyr434/Trp434 in subclade 2, and Gly434/His434/Lys434/Trp434 in subclade 3 (Fig.\u00a01c), which may impact substrate binding and processivity in these enzymes.", "To examine the precise mechanistic roles of the Trp286 and Trp434 residues in the binding of isomeric (1,2)-, (1,3)-, (1,4)- and (1,6)-linked \u03b2-d-glucosides in HvExoI, we methodically varied these residues to Ala, His, Phe, and Tyr to generate single (and in some instances) double mutants, and investigated their substrate specificity, steady-state and inhibitions kinetics and substrate binding in atomic structures (Figs.\u00a02\u20134; Supplementary Figs.\u00a02\u20134; Supplementary Tables\u00a02\u20136).Fig. 2WT HvExoI in complex with thio-saccharide analogues.a Thio-sophoroside (G2SG-OMe; pink); b thio-laminaribioside (4NP-G3SG; magenta); c thio-cellotrioside (G4SG4OGS; cyan); and d thio-gentiobioside (G6SG-OMe; green) moieties are bound across the \u22121 to +2 subsites.

Of the tested mutants, W434H was the only mutant that exhibited broad substrate specificity similar to WT, contrary to W286F and W286Y, and W434F, W434Y, W286F/W434F, and W286F/W434A that lacked activities of at least with one carbohydrate substrate (Supplementary Table\u00a02). The absence of hydrolytic activities was observed with (1,4;1,3)-\u03b2-d-glucans (barley glucan and lichenin) and 4NP-cellobioside in all mutants except W434H and a decrease in hydrolytic rates with oligomeric substrates and aryl \u03b2-d-glucosides except in W286Y with 4-nitrophenyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (4NP-Glc) (Supplementary Table\u00a02). Remarkably, W434A lost all hydrolytic activities with poly- and oligosaccharides, except (1,3)-\u03b2-d-linked \u03b2-d-glucosides, turning this mutant into a strict (1,3)-\u03b2-d-glucosidase, albeit with low specific activities (Supplementary Table\u00a02). Our findings suggest that although the mutations of Trp286 to Ala and His led to folded but inactive enzymes, enzyme activity retention is more sensitive to alterations of Trp286 than Trp434, likely due to the proximity of Trp286 to Asp285, the catalytic nucleophile (Supplementary Table\u00a02).", "Steady-state kinetic constants of WT, and Trp286 and Trp434 mutants", "Consistent with our predictions, catalytic rate kcat (first-order rate) constants and in some instances, Michaelis-Menten KM values of single W286A, W286H, W286F, W434A, W434H, W434F, and W434Y, and double W286F/W434F and W286F/W434A mutants with poly- and oligomeric substrates decreased compared to WT\u00a0(Supplementary Table\u00a03). This trend continued with the catalytic efficiency kcat/KM (second-order rate) constants, where these values corresponded to those of relative hydrolytic rates (Supplementary Table\u00a02). These values confirmed the strict (1,3)-\u03b2-oligosaccharide specificity of W434A, with little change in the apparent strength of binding of laminaribiose, but by an about 21-fold decrease of kcat (compared to WT), consequently yielding a low kcat/KM value. A similar profile was noted for W286F/W434A, although in this case, the kinetic parameters decreased even more, pointing to a negative effect of the non-conservative (radical) W434A mutation on substrate binding and hydrolysis (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Notable was the behaviour of W286Y that showed increased catalytic efficiency values with (1,3;1,6)-\u03b2-d-glucan (laminarin), laminaribiose (G3OG), and 4NP-Glc, while these values in W434Y were considerably lower (Supplementary Table\u00a03). In W286F/W434F, the catalytic efficiency values were also drastically reduced compared to WT, whereas the W434H and W434F mutants showed higher catalytic efficiency than the double mutants, with W434F being more active except with laminaribiose. These data signal that although the mutations of Trp434 affected the catalytic properties of HvExoI more substantially compared to Trp286, both Trp residues are required for binding the isomeric \u03b2-d-glucosides to achieve productive binding modes required for high catalytic efficiency.", "Inhibition constants Ki of WT, and Trp286 and Trp434 mutants", "To further examine binding modes of \u03b2-d-glucosides, we used the thio-analogues with (1,2)-, (1,3)-, (1,4)- and (1,6)-linkages to quantify apparent inhibition constants (Ki) of the HvExoI:inhibitor complexes (Supplementary Table\u00a04). In WT HvExoI, the (1,3)-\u03b2-d-linked (4NP-G3SG), (1,4)-\u03b2-d-linked (G4SG-OMe), and (1,6)-\u03b2-d-linked (G6SG-OMe) thio-analogues showed a competitive inhibition with Ki values in low to medium micromolar ranges, except G2SG-OMe, which was weakly inhibitory (Supplementary Table\u00a04). The W434A mutant was sensitive to 4NP-G3SG and G4SG-OMe, and the data with 4NP-G3SG correlated with substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency (Supplementary Tables\u00a02 and 3). As expected, the (1,3)- and (1,4)-linked thio-inhibitors were less potent with tested mutants, while the most effective thio-inhibitor was G6SG-OMe, except that it did not bind to W434A, and compared to WT, it showed 8- and 6-fold higher Ki constant values with W434H and W434F, respectively (Supplementary Table\u00a04). These data pointed out that the replacements of Trp434 with Ala, His, or Phe residues in the +1 subsite, disturbed the optimal binding of thio-analogues, due to the removal or weakening stacking interactions crucial for the correct positioning of inhibitors in the active site.", "WT and mutant HvExoI:thio-\u03b2-d-glucoside complexes reveal the details of binding at the atomic level", "We observed that the thio-analogue Ki constants (except G2SG-OMe) measured with the Trp286 and Trp434 mutants, correlated with their capacity to hydrolyse (1,3)-, (1,4)- and (1,6)-linked \u03b2-d-glucosides. To decipher their precise binding modes at the atomic levels, we pursued structural studies (Figs.\u00a02\u20134; Supplementary Figs.\u00a02\u20134; Supplementary Tables\u00a05 and 6).", "G2SG-OMe binding", "The G2SG-OMe thio-analogue bound weakly to native and WT recombinant HvExoI with the respective Ki of 2 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M and 4 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M (Supplementary Table\u00a04), reflecting its ability to attach at the +1 and +2 subsites instead of the \u22121 and +1 subsites (Fig.\u00a02a)22, which was most likely due to the rigidity of this thio-ligand. On the other hand, in W286F the electron density map of G2SG-OMe was defined at the \u22121 and +1 subsites (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c), where this thio-ligand formed H-bonds with Asp95, Lys206, His207, Arg158, Tyr253, Asp285, Arg291, and Glu491, and stacking interactions with W286F and Trp434, whereas G2SG-OMe did not bind to W286A and W286Y. The dispositions of G2SG-OMe at the \u22121 and +1 subsites in the W434A, W434F, W434H, and W434Y mutants (Figs.\u00a03a, 4a; Supplementary Figs.\u00a03a and\u00a04a) revealed similar structural features of the ligand binding to those seen in W286F (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c).", "4NP-G3SG and 4NP-G3SG3OG binding", "4NP-G3SG bound tightly to native and WT recombinant HvExoI with the Ki constant of 0.7 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M (Supplementary Table\u00a04); the Ki value of 0.2 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M was previously observed with 4NP-G3SG3OG in WT HvExoI3. These relatively tight binding constants suggested that these thio-analogues should be seen in the active sites, as we observed with WT, and the W286F, W434A, W434F, W434H, and W434Y mutants. The well-defined electron density maps of the (1,3)-linked thio-ligands illustrated that the saccharide moieties were attached through the networks of H-bonds formed between nine to ten residues in each case (Figs.\u00a02b, 3d, 4b; Supplementary Figs.\u00a02d, 3b, 4b). The 4NP-G3SG thio-analogue in WT was located at the +1 to +2 subsites, with the 4NP group clearly discernible at the +2 subsite (Fig.\u00a02b). However, in W286A, and W286Y, 4NP-G3SG was not observed, and in W286F, the reducing-end Glc moiety of 4NP-G3SG at the +1 subsite remained disordered (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d). This emphasised that the Trp286 mutations to Ala, Tyr, and Phe disturbed the binding of (1,3)-linked thio-\u03b2-d-glucosides and that this residue was necessary for inhibitor\u00a0binding.", "G4SG-OMe and G4SG4OG4SG4OG4SG binding", "G4SG-OMe bound to native and WT recombinant HvExoI with the Ki values of 1.0 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M (Supplementary Table\u00a04). This compares favourably to the hexasaccharide G4SG4OG4SG4OG4SG, where we previously observed the Ki constant of 0.6 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M with native HvExoI2. These binding constants suggested that the (1,4)-linked thio-analogues should locate in the enzyme\u2019s active sites. This occurred with WT, and the W434A, W434F, W434H, and W434Y mutants, while no binding was observed in the W286A, W284F, and W286Y mutants. The well-defined electron density maps in W434A (Fig.\u00a03c) and W434F (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c) revealed three saccharide moieties at the \u22121 to +2 subsites with the reducing thio-saccharide moiety protruding beyond the environment of the active site pocket at the +2 subsite. In W434A, we observed that the tri-thio-cellobioside moiety was somewhat misplaced (compared to WT) and that the W434A substitution unexpectedly allowed Lys493 to be rotated outward and become engaged in the binding of this thio-ligand; here, 11 residues participated in forming H-bonds with tri-thio-cellobioside moiety (Fig.\u00a03c). To generate the W434H and W434Y complexes, we perfused the G4SG-OMe ligand, consequently, only two thio-saccharide moieties were observed in active sites (Fig.\u00a04c; Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c). But with W286H, and W286Y, we could not see the binding of G4SG-OMe, which correlated with their weaker Ki values compared to WT (Supplementary Table\u00a04), and suggested that the conservative Trp286 mutation to Phe and Tyr affected the binding of (1,4)-linked thio-\u03b2-d-glucosides.", "G6SG-OMe binding", "G6SG-OMe bound tightly to native and WT recombinant HvExoI with the respective Ki values of 0.1 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M and 0.2 \u00d710\u22123\u2009M (Supplementary Table\u00a04), hinting that this thio-analogue should be observed in the active sites of WT and mutants (Figs.\u00a02d, 3d, 4d; Supplementary Figs.\u00a02a, b, e, 3d, 4d). This is what we indeed observed in WT, and the W286A, W286Y, W286F, W434A, W434F, W434H, and W434Y mutants, where well-defined electron density maps of G6SG-OMe and tight H-bond networks that were formed through eight to ten residues (Asp95, Lys206, His207, Arg158, Tyr253, Asp285, Arg291, Glu491, Trp286, and Trp434). In W434A we noticed approximately 120o rotation (through the x-axis) of the reducing-end moiety of G6SG-OMe compared to its disposition in WT (or in-solution structure of G6OG or gentiobiose), due to the presence of a rotatable C1-O-C6 glycosidic bond of G6SG-OMe; this did not occur in WT or other mutants. To find out, if the Glc molecule alone adopts similar or different dispositions at the \u22121 and +1 subsites, we perfused Glc into WT, W434A, and W286Y, and compared their positions, which at the \u22121 subsite were identical in all instances, but at the +1 subsite of W434A the Glc molecule was disordered (data not shown). We noted that the quality of the G6SG-OMe electron density map slightly declined in W286Y (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b) but that these maps were well-formed in W286A and W286F (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a, e), suggesting that in the W286Y mutant the process of ligand-binding in (or near) the active site may have been perturbed. These findings reinforce the conclusion that G6SG-OMe binds in HvExoI regardless of mutations (particularly into aromatic residues) of Trp286 or Trp434. Although these mutations impact the precise orientation of the glucopyranoside moieties, as observed in W434A, they permit G6SG-OMe binding.", "Conformational behaviour of S- and O-linked \u03b2-d-glucosides", "To determine the conformational landscape of \u03b2-d-glucosides bound in HvExoI, we analysed enzyme-thio-ligand-binding modes in the crystal structures before and after cMD simulations. As described above, the \u03b2-d-glucopyranose rings of thio-saccharide analogues at the \u22121 subsites in the WT crystal structure complexes were engaged in H-bond networks and observed in the 4C1 conformation for G2SG-OMe and G6SG-OMe, the 4H3 conformation for 4NP-G3SG, and the 4E/4H3 conformations for G4SG4OG (Supplementary Figs.\u00a05 and 6; Supplementary Table\u00a07), while the \u03b2-d-glucopyranose moieties of thio-ligands at the +1 subsites adopted the 4C1 conformation. To analyse the dynamic behaviour of \u03b2-d-glucosides, a total of eight models were generated for G2(S or O)G, G3(S or O)G, G4(S or O)G, and G6(S or O)G systems, wherein we reverted mutations (if present) in HvExoI, removed ions and\u00a0other molecules from thio-analogues, and for the O-linked systems, replaced S-atoms with O-atoms. While cMD simulations revealed that \u03b2-d-glucopyranose rings in thio-analogues adopted predominantly the 4C1 conformations in both subsites, alternate conformations also participated, such as 4H3/4E/4H5 or 1S3/1,4B, depending on a type of the glycosidic linkage (Fig.\u00a05; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06; Supplementary Table\u00a07). Additionally, we reconstructed O-derivatives in the active sites based on the thio-analogue complexes and subjected these to cMD (Fig.\u00a05; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07; Supplementary Table\u00a07). Compared to the analyses of the thio-analogue complexes discussed above, these data indicated that the \u03b2-d-glucopyranose rings of G2OG, G3OG, G4OG4OG, and G6OG adopted mainly 4C1 conformations in both subsites, although other states contributed to binding in the \u22121 subsite (32% in the 4H5/4E region for G3OG, and respective 5%, 10% and 27% in 4H3, 4E, 4H5 regions for G2OG, G6OG, and G4OG4OG). In the +1 subsite, the G3OG \u03b2-d-glucopyranose ring was located at respective 66% and 28% in the 4C1 and 2SO regions, while the \u03b2-d-glucopyranose rings of G2OG, G6OG, and G4OG4OG occupied the 4C1 regions in more than 90% of occurrences (Supplementary Table\u00a07). Notably, the Mercator projection of G3OG (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08) concurred with its conformational Free Energy Landscape (FEL) map (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), computed by QM/MM MD metadynamics. As recently found for other exo-acting GH enzymes35,36, these findings predicted that HvExoI likely exhibits a two-fold hydrolytic itinerary with a positionally isomeric disaccharide such as G3OG, where the hydrolytic reaction starts either from a distorted 4H3/4E/4H5 region or from an undistorted 4C1 \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl ring, which would evolve towards a transition state with a 4H3/4E conformation in both cases.Fig. 5Conformational behaviour\u00a0of O-linked oligosaccharides bound in the active site of HvExoI calculated by cMD simulations plotted as a function of \u03b8 and \u03c6 puckering coordinates.a Sophorose (G2OG; pink); b laminaribiose (G3OG; magenta); c cellotriose (G4OG4OG; cyan); and d gentiobiose (G6OG; green) ligands are bound at the \u22121 to +2 subsites (colour gradients from purple at 0\u2009ns to yellow at 200\u2009ns in Mercator projections are indicated).

The complex with G4OG3OG was generated based on the WT HvExoI:G4SG4OG complex (Fig.\u00a02c), upon replacing G4 with G3. The analysis of cMD simulations of this complex showed that the Glc moieties of G4OG3OG adopted the stable 4C1 conformations at the +1 and +2 subsites (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). However, Glc at the \u22121 subsite adopted a state, that was nearly identical to the Glc moiety in G3OG, and not entirely a perfect chair, thus we defined it as a pseudo-chair (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010b). Again, this is consistent with the conformational FEL of G4OG3OG at \u22121 subsite, computed by QM/MM MD metadynamics (Fig.\u00a06a; Supplementary Fig.\u00a011), which shows a wide free energy minimum that extends from 4C1 towards 4H3.Fig. 6Binding of the G4OG3OG natural substrate in the HvExoI active site calculated via cMD and QM/MM MD metadynamics simulations, plotted as a function of \u03b8 and \u03c6 puckering coordinates.a Conformational FEL map of the Glc moiety at the \u22121 subsite in WT; Glc moieties of G4OG3OG in the subsites \u22121 to +2 are indicated along with the key residues; b conformational\u00a0behaviour (Mercator projection) of the G3OG product after the \u22121 Glc moiety is hydrolysed from G4OG3OG and removed from the \u22121 subsite in WT; c conformational\u00a0behaviour (Mercator projection) of the G3OG product after the \u22121 Glc moiety is hydrolysed from G4OG3OG and removed from the \u22121 subsite in W434A.

The cluster analysis of the trajectory of the G3OG product in WT indicated that the Glc moieties adopted at least two poses: ~96% of the populations located in the +1 and +2 subsites, and ~4% to the intermediary poses at the \u22121 and +1 subsites (Fig.\u00a06b). Conversely, the cluster analysis of the G3OG product in W434A indicated a dramatic shift in poses to ~15% of the populations located in the +1 and +2 subsites, and ~74% to the intermediary (midway) poses at the \u22121 and +1 subsites (Fig.\u00a06c). These observations imply that Trp434 plays a key role in the sliding of the (1,3)-\u03b2-d-linked hydrolytic products through the active site during catalysis and that Trp434 prevents the sliding of mixed-linkage substrates.", "Binding and displacements of laminaritriose (G3OG3OG) and laminarihexaose (G3OG3OG3OG3OG3OG) hydrolytic products", "These studies were performed in the WT, W434H, and W434A enzymes with active sites accommodating hydrolytic products of laminaritriose, i.e. Glc in the \u22121 subsite and laminaribiose (G3OG) in the +1 and +2 subsites, or laminarihexaose, i.e. Glc at the \u22121 subsite and laminaripentaose (G3OG3OG3OG3OG) in the +1 and +2 subsites, and exposed to bulk solvent. The selection of these mutants was based on relative hydrolytic rates of poly- and oligosaccharide substrates, where these mutants either retain (W434H) or lose (W434A) their broad substrate specificity (Supplementary Table\u00a02). To assess the effect of saccharides on HvExoI behaviour, cMD simulations were also performed with the WT apo-form, lacking bound Glc or \u03b2-d-glucosides.", "The cMD and GaMD simulations with laminaritriose and laminarihexaose hydrolytic products indicated that the WT structure was stable (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012), as indicated by backbone Root-Mean-Square-Deviation (RMSD) values, although high mobilities in some loops were detected. Conversely, cMD and GaMD simulations of W434H and W434A with laminaritriose and laminarihexaose hydrolytic products showed contrasting behaviour compared to WT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012). cMD simulations of the mutants with the Glc and the G3OG products (run for 1000\u2009ns) revealed that the protein backbones remained stable (respective RMSD values: 1.7\u2009\u00c5 for W434H, and 1.25\u2009\u00c5 for W434A) and that Glc was attached at the \u22121 subsite, but, after around 100\u2009ns in W434H and 200\u2009ns in W434A, G3OG moved to bulk solvent, indicating that the mutants were ineffective in retaining the G3OG product (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). Such behaviour was not observed with laminarihexaose hydrolytic products, within the time-frames of cMD simulations (600\u2009ns), whereby these products remained attached in WT and both mutants (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). These simulations indicate that the dynamics\u00a0of ternary complexes of mutants presented variabilities compared to WT, where these differences depend on the length of hydrolytic products bound, i.e. longer products were more stable.", "To resolve variability with the length of hydrolytic products in mutants, GaMD simulations (800\u2009ns) with enhanced sampling were conducted. We found that the protein scaffold of the W434A mutant was more flexible (RMSD value 2.5\u2009\u00c5) than that of WT or W434H (RMSD values between 1.0\u2009\u00c5 \u2212\u00a01.5\u2009\u00c5) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012), and that the Gly210-Met230 loop in the vicinity of the catalytic site exhibited Root-Mean-Square-Fluctuation (RMSF) values of up to 7\u2009\u00c5 in both mutants compared to WT (RMSF value \u2264 2\u2009\u00c5). While Glc remained highly restrained in the \u22121 subsite in WT and W434H, it was mobile in W434A, hinting that the overall flexibility of the catalytic site was little affected in W434H, but strongly affected in W434A. During GaMD simulations, the G3OG and laminaripentaose products remained bound in WT, but G3OG vacated the catalytic site in both mutants, in contrast to laminaripentaose, which initially remained bound (~25% and ~50% of simulation time for W434A and W434H, respectively), but eventually, it traversed to bulk solvent. These findings suggested that the replacements of Trp434 by His and specifically by Ala led to a loss of G3OG and laminaripentaose retention, and thus, a potential unbinding of these products could occur before the next catalytic cycle begins. This also implies that in W434H and W434A, but not in WT, the (1,3)-linked products would need to re-bind and cannot slide through the active site uninterrupted.", "Glc displacement route (egress) or substrate-product assisted processivity in WT", "The modelling of the Glc displacement from the \u22121 subsite performed with GPathFinder37, commenced from the most populated cluster of structures based on cMD, to further explore dynamic traits of Glc unbinding.

Next, Glc migration induced a rotation of Tyr253 that opened the lateral cavity due to the disruption of the Arg291-Glu220 salt bridge \u2013 these re-orientations and motions collectively opened the lateral cavity for Glc to exit. During these simulations, CH\u2013\u03c0 interactions between the non-reducing-end Glc moiety of laminaripentaose and the Trp286/Trp434 aromatic clamp remained stationary, holding the Glc moiety in the +1 subsite.", "GPathFinder simulations with W434H (Glc at the \u22121 subsite and laminaripentaose in the +1 and +2 subsites and bulk solvent), revealed that the Glc egress path was identical to that of WT (path 1) (Figs.\u00a07b, 8; Supplementary Movie\u00a02). Here, a toll-like Arg158-Asp285-Glu491 barrier also re-oriented, Asp285 changed its rotameric state, and as Glc advanced through the lateral cavity, the side-chain of Tyr253 re-orientated, and the Arg291\u2013Glu220 salt bridge was broken \u2013 these events enlarged the lateral cavity volume and facilitated Glc egress from the \u22121 subsite to bulk solvent.", "For the W434A mutant (Glc at the \u22121 subsite and laminaripentaose in the +1 and +2 subsites, and bulk solvent), GPathFinder identified a different Glc exit path (path 2) (Figs.\u00a07c, 8; Supplementary Movie\u00a03). In this mutant, Glc exited through the preformed active site opening after the non-conservative mutation of W434 into Ala, while the Gly210-Met220 loop adopted a position that was seen in WT. This was supported by the higher flexibility of the region containing W434A, which adopted an altered conformation resulting from the displacement of Trp430 that could otherwise block path 2. In this Glc egress path, the toll-like Arg158-Asp285-Glu491 barrier, Tyr253, and the Arg291-Glu220 salt bridge were not involved.", "When laminaripentaose was removed from the +1 and +2 subsites (and bulk solvent) in WT, W434H, and W434A, we identified path 3 (we termed it vertical) for Glc displacement (Fig.\u00a08), where Glc utilised the space vacated by laminaripentaose and exited via the Trp286/Trp434 aromatic clamp, and through the +2 subsite into bulk solvent. This path could only be available when no products or substrates are bound. This scenario for Glc egress is, however, only a hypothetical option, also challenging our previous study22, where in native HvExoI, two Glc molecules were bound at the \u22121 and +1 subsites, effectively blocking path 3.", "In summary, GPathFinder simulations revealed that path 1 is the preferred route in WT and W343H with bound (1,3)-linked hydrolytic products, and is independent of a substrate length, contrary to W434A, which utilises path 2, where the essential structural attributes of substrate-product assisted processivity (toll-like barrier, salt bridge, loop motions, lateral cavity) do not participate."]
