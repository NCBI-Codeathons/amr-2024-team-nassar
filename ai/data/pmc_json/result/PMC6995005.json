["Results", "Radial Growth Patterns and Anatomical Changes in Cambial Cells.", "Generally, woody plants exhibit variations in morphology as they become mature and older. We took tree-ring cores of 34 female trees of different ages with an increment borer and analyzed the tree rings using dendrochronological procedures. The diameters at breast height (DBHs) of these trees were 11.5 to 450 cm and the ring widths became thinner with age (Fig. 1). For example, the average tree ring width of a 25-y-old tree (see SI Appendix, Dataset S1, sample 4) was 5.25 mm, while that of a 991-y-old tree (see Dataset S1, sample 33) was about 1.20 mm. Similarly, in one 143-y-old tree (see Dataset S1, sample 20), the ring width in the year 1885 CE was 7.37 mm (Fig. 1A, blue point), whereas in 1981 CE it was 1.67 mm (Fig. 1A, red point). Through tree-ring analysis combined with the DBH, we determined that the ages of the sampled trees ranged from 15 to 1,353 y (Dataset S1). The average increment of ring width in the first 10 y was 50.47 \u00b1 24.70 mm. From 100 y to 200 y, the increment decreased to an average of 15.89 \u00b1 4.45 mm. In trees over 200 y of age, the mean increment of ring width was about 14.84 \u00b1 3.95 mm (Fig. 1B). Although ring widths declined with age, we could not evaluate the trend of age-related growth decline by ring width alone. Therefore, we further calculated the basal area increment (BAI) every 10 y, and found that the stem BAI still maintained a high level in old trees, even up to 510 y old (Fig. 1C). The bark thickness of a young tree was about 0.5 cm while that of an old tree was up to 2.5 cm (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Moreover, the cracks in the bark of old trees were markedly deeper than those in the bark of young trees (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). However, all trees had exuberant foliage and produced large amounts of seeds (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A).", "Fig. 1.Phenotypic analysis of G. biloba trees of different ages.

It is evident that the ring width and DBH are different among 20-, 200-, and 600-y-old trees (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). The mean DBH of 20-, 200-, and 600-y-old trees was 13.83, 84.00, and 203.33 cm (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), and their mean ring width was 3.81, 2.41, and 1.53 mm, respectively (Fig. 1E). The average leaf areas of 20-, 200-, and 600-y-old trees were 24.87, 24.56, and 24.69 cm2, respectively, showing no significant difference (Fig. 1F). In addition, the seed germination rates of 20-, 200-, and 600-y-old trees were 56.33%, 55.00%, and 54.67%, respectively (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, the maximum quantum efficiency values of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) were 0.83, 0.82, and 0.85; the photosynthetic capacities were 5.9, 6.0, and 5.7; and the relative chlorophyll contents were 50, 52, and 53 soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) units in the three groups (Fig. 1 H\u2013J). None of these differences was significant.", "To determine whether the structure of vascular cambium changed with age, we compared the anatomy of the cambial zone among the three groups (Fig. 2A).

Approximately 50 million raw reads were obtained for each RNA-seq sample. After stringent quality checks and data cleaning, more than 47,540,294 clean reads for each sample were retained (SI Appendix, Table S1). The generated reads were mapped to the reference genome; each sample had >97% total mapped reads (SI Appendix, Table S2). In total, we obtained 27,449, 27,300, and 27,820 unigenes in VC20, VC200, and VC600, respectively, and found 1,246 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between VC20 and old trees (VC200 and VC600), of which 712 DEGs were down-regulated and 534 were up-regulated in old trees (Datasets S2 and S3). In addition, there were 209 DEGs between VC200 and VC600, of which 97 were up-regulated and 112 down-regulated in VC600 compared to VC200. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the expression of a number of genes associated with cellulose biosynthetic process, cell wall, and metabolic pathways differed markedly among the three groups (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B).", "Cell division and differentiation takes place in the cambium zone and are important for vascular tissue growth (8). Therefore, we investigated the genes associated with cell division and expansion in the cambium, including actin, cyclin, histone, WOX4, expansin, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH), and cellulose synthase-related genes. Among these DEGs, most showed significantly lower transcript levels in old trees. Specifically, the transcript levels of the cell division-related genes ACT7 (Gb_01254), CYCs (Gb_11201, Gb_30101, Gb_03779), CDKB1 (Gb_38629), EB1C (Gb_24506, Gb_11921), ATK5 (Gb_10632), E2F8 (Gb_38482), AGD9 (Gb_36242), and Histone H3 (Gb_19428, Gb_29027, Gb_29026) were markedly lower in VC200 and VC600 compared to VC20 (Fig. 3A). Indeed, the transcript levels of Gb_11201 (CYCs), and Gb_11921 (EB1C) were more than 80% lower in old trees compared to VC20. Although the transcript level of the WOK4 gene (associated with auxin responsiveness of cambial cells) Gb_12565 did not change significantly, expression of the other (Gb_05339) WOX4 gene was lower in all old cambium samples (Fig. 3A).", "Fig. 3.Changes in the expression of genes associated with cell division, cell expansion, and phytohormone signaling in the cambium of trees of different ages.

Most were down-regulated in old trees (Fig. 3B). In addition, the transcript levels of several genes related to cell differentiation, such as AGD9 and HD-ZIP III, were also down-regulated in old trees. Notably, expression of the genes related to cell division, expansion, and differentiation differed little between VC200 and VC600.

Notably, of the two PCBER homologs in the G. biloba genome, only one (Gb_21756) was strongly expressed in vascular cambium, at similar levels in VC20 and VC200 (Fig. 6D).", "Studying transcriptional changes across whole biosynthetic pathways might provide a more reliable estimation of changes during aging in Ginkgo, a species in which little functional analysis of genes has been performed. We first examined the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, comprising a series of 10 biosynthetic steps in poplar (13) (Fig. 6E). Apart from single coumaroyl shikimate 3\u2032-hydroxylase (involved in synthesis of both guaiacyl and syringyl lignin) and ferulate/coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (critical only for the biosynthesis of syringyl lignin) genes, all other enzymes were encoded by gene families with either four or five members (Fig. 6E). Consideration of the most highly expressed member of each gene family revealed that, apart from cinnamoyl CoA reductase and caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, the expression level of monolignol pathway genes in the oldest tree was no lower than in the youngest. Among the less strongly expressed gene family members, there was again little evidence for a strong decline in expression with aging.", "The monolignol pathway also provides coniferyl alcohol as a substrate for formation of antimicrobial lignans. Downstream steps in the pathway involve laccase and dirigent protein for stereoselective dimerization, and pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase. The expression pattern of laccases homologous to the Arabidopsis Lac11 and Lac17 genes (functionally ascribed a role in lignin polymerization) (14) suggested small but nonsignificant reductions in expression between VC600 and VC20 (Fig. 6F). A similar pattern was seen for the most highly expressed pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase (Gb_31335), although there was no reduction in expression of the two most highly expressed dirigent proteins (Fig. 6G).", "Flavonoids are a major class of plant secondary metabolites which can protect against both biotic and abiotic stresses (15). In our dataset, 41 genes were annotated as key genes encoding enzymes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis, including chalcone and stilbene synthases. Apart from Gb_01519 and Gb_21868, there was no lower expression level of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes in the cambium of old trees than in the youngest (Fig. 6 H and I and SI Appendix, Fig. S5D)."]
