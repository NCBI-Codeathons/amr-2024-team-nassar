["RESULTS", "To determine the structure of the target compound, \u223c1.5\u2009mg of material was purified from FAC-transformed A. nidulans extracts and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) analysis, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and two-dimensional (2D) correlation approaches, including correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) (see Table\u00a0S2 and Fig.\u00a0S2 and S3 in the supplemental material). Structural analysis revealed an unusual secondary metabolite backbone, a 3,4-dihydro-1H-1-benzazepine-2,5-dione, resulting from the unusual cyclization of kynurenine. The metabolite\u2019s structure matches that of a previously synthesized kynurenine derivative, 2-amino-N-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2,5-dioxo-1H-1-benzazepin-3-yl)benzamide (26). On the basis of its structure and the parent organism, it was given a common name of \u201cterreazepine.\u201d To determine the stereochemical configuration of terreazepine, R and S enantiomers were synthesized, each with an enantiomeric excess of \u226595% (Fig.\u00a0S4). Each enantiomer and the purified natural compound were acylated to enable separation using supercritical fluid chromatography. Interestingly, natural terreazepine was found to be a 2:1 mixture of S-R enantiomers by comparing against synthetic standards separated by chiral chromatography (Fig.\u00a0S4). During the course of this work, Li et al. reported the independent discovery of (S)-terreazepine (nanangelenin B) as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the related compound nanangelenin A (27). Given that our discovery of terreazepine was completed prior to the publication by Li et al., the strategies outlined herein nonetheless provide promise for the discovery of novel chemical scaffolds.", "MS2 fragmentation spectra for terreazepine, fragmented through HCD at a normalized collision energy of 25.0%.

Labeling with [13C6]anthranilate resulted in an m/z shift of +6\u2009Da (Fig.\u00a02B), supporting incorporation of anthranilate into the molecule (Fig.\u00a02C). Consistent with terreazepine\u2019s chemical structure, labeling with l-Trp-D5 did not result in the expected shift of +5 in the mass spectrum, instead resulting in a mass shift of +4 (Fig.\u00a02B). Given the existence of an IDO in the AtFAC7O19 BGC, these data provide support that tryptophan is converted into kynurenine prior to incorporation into terreazepine. For further confirmation of the IDO activity in terreazepine biosynthesis, a FAC deletion mutant was produced lacking the IDO tzpB by RedET-mediated recombineering (10). Mass spectral analysis of the FAC deletion mutant revealed no terreazepine production (Fig.\u00a0S5).", "Selected ion chromatograms of terreazepine in FAC control (top) and tzpB deletion mutants (bottom).

To investigate the function of the seemingly extraneous T3 domain, we constructed FAC truncation mutants either lacking the C2T3 domains (\u0394C2T3) or only the T3 domain (\u0394T3). These constructs were transformed into A. nidulans, and extracted metabolites were subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. A very small amount of the target compound was detected in \u0394C2T3 extracts (5,000-fold lower than control), suggesting that terreazepine formation can occur slowly without catalysis. We were unable to detect the presence of any offloaded intermediates. Interestingly, \u0394T3 extracts contained terreazepine levels close to that of the intact NRPS (Fig.\u00a02D). Given that analyses focused on endpoint abundance of terreazepine, it is possible that the T3 domain increases the catalytic efficiency of product formation. This is in contrast to recent findings by Li et al. in which NanA, the TzpA ortholog involved in nanangelenin A biosynthesis, requires the T3 domain for product formation (27). The reasons for these differences are unknown but may involve differences in protein sequence or other ancillary protein interactions.", "Using heterologous expression, stable isotope feeding studies, and NRPS backbone deletions, we propose a biosynthetic scheme for terreazepine (Fig.\u00a02E). In this scheme, N-formyl-kynurenine is formed through the catabolism of tryptophan by TzpB, an IDO. TzpB shares 41% sequence identity to Aspergillus fumigatus IdoA and 45% identity to IdoB, and only 26% identity to IdoC. Enzymatic studies using Aspergillus oryzae suggest that only ido\u03b1 and ido\u03b2 (orthologs of idoA and idoB, respectively) encode enzymes that participate in tryptophan catabolism (28, 29). Because most aspergilli contain three IDOs, TzpB, a fourth IDO in the parent organism A. terreus, may no longer play a role in primary metabolism and instead represent a duplicated enzyme dedicated to terreazepine biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a0S1). This is reminiscent of daptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces roseosporus, in which the TDO DptJ supplies kynurenine for daptomycin formation (19). The biosynthesis of terreazepine mirrors that of its relative nanangelenin A, where tzpA and tzpB orthologs in Aspergillus nanangensis (nanA and nanC) encode enzymes with near identical activity.", "As the next step in the proposed biosynthesis, TzpA, a two-module NRPS, utilizes anthranilate and kynurenine to assemble terreazepine. The first adenylation domain (TzpA-A1) loads anthranilate onto the T1 domain, while TzpA-A2 loads kynurenine, generated through spontaneous nonenzymatic deformylation of the TzpB-supplied N-formyl-kynurenine. The substrate-binding residues of TzpA-A1 resemble those of other fungal adenylation domains that recognize anthranilate (Table\u00a0S3). TzpA-A2, responsible for incorporating kynurenine, has a new pocket code quite dissimilar from other kynurenine-binding A-domains (Table\u00a0S3). However, this disparity may be attributable to evolutionary distance between source organisms and the unstudied nature of kynurenine incorporation into fungal secondary metabolites. Given that the isolated terreazepine was a 2:1 mixture of S-R enantiomers, we can speculate that TzpA-A2 accepts both d- and l-kynurenine. The peptide bond formation between the tethered amino acids is catalyzed by the first condensation domain, TzpA-C1, between anthranilate\u2019s carbonyl carbon and kynurenine\u2019s aliphatic primary amine. The second C domain (TzpA-C2) catalyzes the final cyclization event between the aromatic amine of kynurenine and the tethered carbonyl carbon, yielding the final terreazepine product.", "Adenylation domain substrate predictions for TzpA, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and C2, T2, and T3 domain active site sequence alignments. (A) TzpA-A1 substrate-binding residues bear similarity to many additional anthranilate-activating adenylation domains. Additionally, adenylation domains from A. thermomutatus (RHZ670305-A1) and A. lentulus (GATaQ05471-A1) have an identical A-domain sequence to that of TzpA-A1, suggesting they also bind anthranilate. (B) TzpA-A2 possesses a specificity sequence that is disparate from known kynurenine-binding A domains. It does, however, bear resemblance to the A2 domains from the orphan NRPSs RHZ670305-A2 and GAQ05471-A2 and may represent a new type of kynurenine-activating adenylation domain. (C) The C2 domain of TzpA does possess the catalytic histidine purported to be required for activity (J. A. Baccile, H. H. Le, B. T. Pfannenstiel, J. W. Bok, et al., Angew Chem Int 58:14589\u221214593, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201909052), although the remainder of its sequence diverges from other C2 domains part of NRPSs with the ATCATCT domain architecture such as GliP and HasD. (D) The T2 and T3 domains of TzpA both appear functional compared to GliP T domains and GrsA T domains with known functionality (G. L. Challis, J. Ravel, C. A. Townsend, Chem Biol 7:211\u2013224, 2000, https://doi.org/10.1016/s1074-5521(00)00091-0) given their sequence similarity and the presence of a conserved serine in the sequence. Residues are colored according to the Taylor coloring scheme (W. R. Taylor, Protein Eng 10:743\u2013746, 1997, https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/10.7.743). Download Table\u00a0S3, PDF file, 0.3 MB.", "While the role of the terminal TzpA-T3 domain remains uncertain, we can glean insight by looking at related NRPSs. For example, the unusual NRPS domain structure of TzpA mirrors that of GliP, the NRPS involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis (30, 31). When studied in vitro, GliP mutants show behavior mirroring that of TzpA deletants: truncated GliP \u0394T3 mutants retain dipeptide synthetase activity, while \u0394C2T3 mutants show reduced activity (30, 31). However, in vivo, GliP \u0394T3 loses activity, suggesting that the in vivo pathway involves transfer of the dipeptidyl-S intermediate from T2 to T3 (30). In light of these two possible pathways of cyclization from T2 and T3, as well as a slow reported rate of approximately 1 per h, it has been suggested that T3 facilitates interaction with downstream tailoring enzymes (30, 31). Given that terreazepine biosynthesis does not appear to require the activity of downstream tailoring enzymes, both cyclization pathways may exist. Like the T domains of GliP, TzpA-T2 and T3 possess the predicted active site residue (S1937 and S2473, respectively), suggesting that they are both functional (Table\u00a0S3). Similarly, TzpA-C2 possesses the purported catalytic histidine at position H2137. However, the adjacent residue sequence diverges from the conserved SHXXXDXX(S/T) sequence shared by diketopiperazine-forming NRPSs such as GliP and HasD (30), and slightly from the SHXXXD sequence of NanA (27), suggesting it may have different cyclization requirements (Table\u00a0S3). More studies will be required to elucidate the nuanced functions of terminal T domains in natural product biosynthesis.", "The discovery of terreazepine and its BGC revealed that fungal IDOs can play a role in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and that kynurenine incorporation into secondary metabolites can yield novel chemical scaffolds. This suggests that targeted efforts to characterize fungal BGCs containing IDOs may facilitate the discovery of completely new molecules with unique chemical scaffolds and their derivatives. To explore this possibility, we searched sequences of 1,037 fungal genomes from GenBank and the Joint Genome Institute and located BGCs containing IDOs. Of the \u223c38,000 BGCs contained within these genomes, 118 contain an IDO. We then grouped IDO-containing BGCs into gene cluster families (GCFs) based on sequence identity and the fraction of protein domains shared between BGC pairs, anticipating that a single GCF groups BGCs that produce similar metabolites. Of the 118 IDO-containing BGCs, 68 were sorted into 16 GCFs. The remaining 50 BGCs represent singletons that had no similar BGC pairs (Fig.\u00a03A).", "FIG\u00a03Diversity of indoleamine 2,3 diooxygenase (IDO)-containing BGCs across fungi.

First, many BGCs originate from phylogenetically diverse aspergilli, an NRPS-containing subset of which are illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B. BGCs from two Aspergillus GCFs in particular were identified as putative terreazepine clusters. The first GCF includes the terreazepine BGC itself, which exists in Aspergillus terreus and A. pseudoterreus. The second GCF contains BGCs from Aspergillus thermomutatus, A. funiculosus, and A. lentulus. The NRPSs in this GCF follow the same unusual domain sequence of ATCATCT (with the exception of A. lentulus which lacks the terminal T domain). Adenylation domain specificity codes bear remarkable similarity to those of TzpA-A1 and TzpA-A2 (Table\u00a0S3), suggesting that these NRPSs biosynthesize terreazepine. Unlike the terreazepine BGC, however, the BGCs in this family contain several tailoring enzymes expected to diversify the terreazepine scaffold, raising the possibility that the shared NRPS T3 facilitates interaction with downstream enzymes in these pathways. The tailoring enzymes present in these BGCs differ from those present in the nanangelenin A cluster in A. nanangensis, indicating that a variety of terreazepine/nanangelenin analogs may exist (27). Moreover, IDO-containing BGCs from Aspergillus ibericus and A. homomorphus may encode yet undiscovered dipeptide scaffolds containing kynurenine (Fig.\u00a03B). Interestingly, the IDOs contained in these three GCFs represent a distinct clade of duplicated IDOs with moderate sequence homology (\u223c40%) to both A. fumigatus IdoA and IdoB (Fig.\u00a0S1).", "Perhaps even more remarkable is the degree to which IDO-containing BGCs span the kingdom of fungi, encompassing five taxonomic classes and two phyla (Fig.\u00a0S6). Particularly interesting is the presence of several NRPS-containing BGCs originating from Basidiomycetes, given the rare and unstudied nature of NRPSs in this phylum (32). Taken together, these results reveal the rich biosynthetic potential of IDO-containing BGCs that has only just begun to be explored.", "IDO-containing biosynthetic gene clusters in fungi.
