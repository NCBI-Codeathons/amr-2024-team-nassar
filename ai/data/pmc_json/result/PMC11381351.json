["Results", "B. subtilis YfmR is a member of the Uup/EttA ABCF clade", "YfmR is classified with ABCF Hidden Markov models as a member of the Uup subfamily (29). The Uup subfamily is not monophyletic, but rather is paraphyletic to the EttA subfamily, which arose from an Uup-like progenitor (Figure 2, (29)). Uup subfamily members typically carry a C-terminal domain (CTD), which is absent in EttA, suggesting this domain was lost after the uup gene duplication that gave rise to EttA. The monophyly of the Uup\u00a0+\u00a0EttA clade is strongly supported (99.7% SH-aLRT and 100% bootstrap support).", "Figure 2.\nB. subtilis YfmR is an Uup ABCF subfamily member within the EttA/Uup clade.

Even in the absence of IPTG, leaky expression of the wild-type protein partially suppressed the growth defect; addition of 1 mM IPTG resulted in full suppression (Figure 3B). Low-level expression of the ATPase-deficient YfmR-EQ2 driven by the native Shine-Dalgarno motif fails to complement, consistent with the ATPase activity being essential (Figure 3B). Next, we tested whether ectopic overexpression of housekeeping ABCFs could suppress the growth defect of the \u0394efp \u0394yfmR strain. While Phy-spank-driven overexpression of YfmM and YkpA/YbiT has no effect, overexpression of YdiF further exacerbates the growth defect of \u0394efp \u0394yfmR B. subtilis (Figure 3C). A genetic interaction between efp and ydiF has previously been shown earlier by Hummels and Kearn who have demonstrated that the swarming defect of the \u0394efp B. subtilis strain can be suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in ydiF (58). Notably, in the absence of IPTG, low-level leaky expression of YfmM and YkpA partially suppresses the growth defect of the \u0394efp \u0394yfmR strain, which could suggest partial functional redundance between YfmR and these two ABCF ATPases (see the section Redundancy and specialisation of B. subtilis ABCFs, below).", "YfmR is not essential for efficient translation of polyproline stretches in efp+\u00a0B. subtilis", "There can be several alternative explanations for the strong genetic interaction between efp and yfmR. One possibility is that EF-P and YfmR are both required for translation of proline-rich motifs, providing partially redundant solutions to this stalling problem. To test this hypothesis we used a homopolymeric polyproline stalling reporter based on that developed by Chadani and colleagues (54). The reporter gene encodes an N-terminal GFP and C-terminal SUMO tag linked by a 24-amino-acid-long linker with a sequence of P10-(GS)2-P10; two 10-amino-acid-long stalling motifs connected by a flexible \u2018joint\u2019 that is not stalling-prone. The gene encoding the reporter was cloned on a self-replicated plasmid pHT01-based plasmid (56) and the expression was driven by IPTG-inducible Phy-spank promoter. While the full-length version of the reporter construct was efficiently produced in the wild-type B. subtilis, only a fraction of the full-length product is synthesised in the \u0394efp strain, with the majority of the ribosomes stalling and generating a short version of the reporter (Figure 3D). The \u0394yfmR strain behaved like the wild-type, with no short versions of the reporter being produced. Therefore, we concluded that YfmR is unlikely to be involved in translation of strongly stalling polyproline stretches and that EF-P and YfmR synergise in other, yet-undefined stalling motifs.", "EF-P variants lacking the K32 residue or its 5-aminopentanol modification can still efficiently suppress of the growth defect of \u0394efp \u0394yfmR B. subtilis", "With the notable exception of Actinobacterial EF-P (11), the posttranslational modification of a conserved lysine residue is crucial for the factor's functionality in resolving polyproline stalling, both in living cells and a reconstituted biochemical system (6,8,14,18). However, it is conceivable that the modification is not essential for the hypothetical activity on which EF-P and YfmR work together. To probe this hypothesis, we tested whether EF-P lacking the modification of conserved K32 residue\u2014or the K32 residue altogether\u2014can suppress the synthetic growth defect of \u0394efp \u0394yfmR B.\u00a0subtilis. Surprisingly, a \u0394yfmR B.\u00a0subtilis strain expressing the K32A EF-P variant does not phenocopy the severe growth defect of the \u0394efp \u0394yfmR double knockout (Figure 4A). Next, we tested the genetic interaction between yfmR and the genes involved in the 5-aminopentanol modification of the K32 residue: yaaO, yfkA, ynbB, gsaB\u00a0and yfmI (18). Previous mass spectrometry studies have established that while in \u0394yaaO and \u0394yfkA B. subtilis strains EF-P retains low levels of 5-aminopentanol modification, in \u0394ynbB and \u0394gsaB strains the K32 residue is acetylated and in \u0394ymfI it carries 5-aminopentanone instead of 5-aminopentanol (18,59).

The K32A substitution phenocopied the \u0394efp strain (Figure 4C). This result is in good agreement with analogous in vivo assays by Rajkovic and colleagues who tested an array of different PPX stalling peptides such as PPW, PPG, PPP, PPR (15). Mutations in the enzymes implicated in the 5-aminopentanol modification of the K32 residue strongly\u2014although not as completely as the K32A substitution\u2014compromised EF-P\u2019s activity (Figure 4C). The weakest effect was observed in the case of disruption of YfmI, an enzyme which catalyses the last step in EF-P modification, the reduction EF-P-5-aminopentanone to EF-P-5-aminopentanol (59).", "Overexpression of YfmR/Uup alleviates the ribosomal stalling on Asp-Pro motifs in \u0394efp B. subtilis", "We next tested whether overexpression of YfmR can improve the ability of the B. subtilis translational apparatus to synthesise challenging motifs. Inspired by the work by Chadani and colleagues (54), we used a series of diverse GFP-linker-SUMO reporters with different linker sequences. The presence of a C-terminal SUMO domain allowed efficient separation of the stalled product that lacks this domain from the full length version. Specifically, we tested homopolymeric P10-(GS)2-P10 and D10-(GS)2-D10 as well as \u2018mixed\u2019 (DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)2. The two proline-rich linkers are expected to specifically cause ribosomal stalling in \u0394efp B. subtilis while the highly negatively charged poly-Asp motif is in general challenging for translation (54). Finally, the A10-(GS)2-A10 motif was used as a negative control as no stalling is expected in wild-type and \u0394efp B. subtilis. The FLAG-tagged versions of either wild-type or functionally compromised proteins (ATPase-deficient EQ2 variants) were expressed under the control of a xylose-inducible Pxy promotor. In this case YfmR was expressed under the control of strong Shine-Dalgarno motif, and this strong expression of YfmR-EQ2 is associated with a growth defect, most likely due to non-productive ribosomal association inhibiting translation. We have observed analogous effects in the case of ATPase-deficient housekeeping ABCFs in E. coli (29). Overexpression of either wild-type or K32A-substituted EF-P was used as two additional controls, and the reporter assays were performed either in wild-type or a \u0394efp genetic background. Anti-FLAG immunoblotting experiments revealed that wild-type and K32A-substituted EF-P variants are expressed at similar levels, while YfmR-EQ2 is expressed at a lower level than the wild-type factor, consistent with the inhibitory function of the ATPase-deficient ABCF factor on protein synthesis (Supplementary Figure S1).", "As expected, no truncated versions of the control GFP-A10-(GS)2-A10-SUMO reporter are detectable by anti-GFP antibodies regardless of the strain background and the protein expressed (Figure 5A). Near 100%-efficient stalling on P10-(GS)2-P10 in \u0394efp B. subtilis is fully resolved upon overexpression of wild-type EF-P; overexpression of the K32A-substituted variant failed to resolve the stall (Figure 5B). While overexpression of wild-type YfmR did not restore the production of the full-length reporter, it resulted in formation of a longer stalled product (marked with a red asterisk on Figure 5B), indicative of a possible modest stimulatory effect. Expression of YfmR-EQ2 decreased both the full-length and stalled reporter signal, most likely due to translation inhibition caused by the factor being locked in the ribosomal E-site. Experiments with a weaker EF-P-sensitive staller, (DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)2, indicated the ability of YfmR to resolve ribosomal stalls on proline-rich motifs: expression of either EF-P or YfmR abrogated the stalled signal, and the effect was specific for wild-type factors (Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure S2). Finally, we tested whether overexpression of either EF-P or YfmR could overcome ribosomal stalling on acidic poly-Asp motifs (Figure 5D). In agreement with EF-P not being able to resolve the poly-Asp stalling, the strength of stalled signal was similar in wild-type and \u0394efp B. subtilis. Overexpression of neither of the factors could resolve ribosomal stalling on the D10-(GS)2-D10 motif.", "Figure 5.Overexpression of YfmR/Uup ABCF alleviates the ribosomal stalling on Asp-Pro motifs.

As expected, all of the strains produce exclusively the full-length version of the GFP-A10-(GS)2-A10-SUMO reporter (Figure 6A).

To test this hypothesis, we created a set of efp+ B. subtilis strains in which we disrupted the ABCF genes in pairwise combinations, in combinations of three and, finally, a \u03944abcf strain in which all the four genes are disrupted\u2014in which to test our stalling reporters. The strains displayed no growth defects or increased sensitivity to low concentrations of translation targeting antibiotics c (Supplementary Figure S3)", "As expected, we did not detect any stalling on the A10-(GS)2-A10 motif in any of the strains (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figure S4A). Similarly, no stalling was observed on the P10-(GS)2-P10 motif either, which is expected for efp+ B. subtilis (Figure 7B, Supplementary Figure S4B). While stalling is not detected on the (DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)2 motif in either of the tested double-KO strains (Figure 7C), modest stalling is detectable in the \u0394yfmR \u0394ykpA \u0394yfmM background (Figure 7D). The effect is not exacerbated by the additional loss of YdiF in the \u03944abcf strain (Figure 7D), suggesting that YdiF does not contribute to resolution of the stalls. Taken together with the observation that leaky overexpression of YfmM and YkpA partially suppresses the growth defect of the \u0394efp \u0394yfmR strain (Figure 3C), this result further strengthens the idea of a functional overlap between YfmR, YkpA and YfmM. Additional disruptions of ABCF genes in the \u0394ykpA B. subtilis strain does not exacerbate the stalling on the polybasic K10-(GS)2-K10 and R10-(GS)2-R10 (Figure 7E,\u00a0F, Supplementary Figure S4C,\u00a0D) as well as polybasic in E10-(GS)2-E10 and D10-(GS)2-D10 (Figure 7G,\u00a0H, Supplementary Figure S4E,\u00a0F).

We wondered is the same holds for B. subtilis YfmR/Uup. To test this, we have systematically disrupted the abcf genes in wild-type, \u0394bipA and \u0394lepA strains; the latter served as a specificity control. Since YfmR/Uup appears to have functional similarities to EF-P, we have also disrupted epf in all of the three genetic backgrounds. The strains were grown on solid LB either at optimal (37\u00b0C) and low (24\u00b0C) temperatures (Figure 8). In contrast to E. coli, we see no synthetic phenotype in \u0394bipA \u0394yfmR double-deletion strain. However, the \u0394bipA \u0394epf strain has a strong phenotype. At 37\u00b0C, while there is no clear growth defenct, the colonies are slightly translucent; at 24\u00b0C, the synthetic growth defect is clearly evident.
