["Results", "Development of a fungal genome mining tool", "Recent studies on the biosynthesis of fungal natural products have identified many biosynthetic enzymes lacking a detectable Pfam domain, such as NvfI and NvfL, which are not recognized by antiSMASH. Because these domainless biosynthetic enzymes occasionally drive intriguing chemical reactions, we hypothesized that a genome mining strategy focusing on BGCs encoding weak homologues of such enzymes would offer a promising approach to obtaining untapped metabolites. To identify biosynthetic proteins without detectable Pfam domains, we first collected known fungal biosynthetic proteins. Although these proteins can be obtained from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot or MIBiG database16, these databases contain gene or protein sequences that can be mispredicted and are not manually corrected. Thus, we created our own fungal BGC database by manually collecting, reviewing, correcting where necessary, and systematically annotating approximately 700 fungal BGCs (Supplementary Data\u00a01). We named this database the FunBGCs database.", "Next, we extracted all protein sequences from the created database and conducted a Pfam domain search on the resulting 5070 proteins. This led to the identification of 520 Pfam domains. However, 572 proteins lacked a detectable Pfam domain. These domainless proteins were divided into groups based on their sequence similarity, and their hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles were generated for HMMER17 analysis. The representative members of these protein groups include the terpene cyclase Pyr418, the Diels\u2013Alderase Fsa219, the hetero Diels\u2013Alderase AsR520, the epoxide hydrolase CtvD21, and the isomerase Trt1422. Furthermore, several additional HMM profiles were created for the domains of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The identified Pfam domains, the manually added protein families or domains, and a few additional protein domains from the SMART23 and TIGRFAMs24 databases (Supplementary Data\u00a02 and 3) were combined for use in biosynthetic protein detection. Moreover, a DIAMOND25 database was constructed with all of the extracted biosynthetic proteins.", "BGCs were extracted as follows (Fig.\u00a01a). Initially, genes whose products belonged to a protein family of interest were identified from a given fungal genome. Subsequently, genes in the flanking regions of each identified gene were examined to determine if they encoded a core protein (e.g., PKSs, NRPSs, terpene synthases or cyclases, and prenyltransferases; refer to Supplementary Table\u00a01 for more details) or another type of biosynthetic protein using the previously created in-house HMM library and DIAMOND database. If a target gene was found to be colocalized with a core protein gene, then the genomic region was extracted as a BGC by applying a similar strategy used for other fungal genome mining tools, such as antiSMASH9 and SMURF10. To determine whether a gene in flanking regions was clustered with the target, the following factors were considered: (i) whether the gene encoded a biosynthetic protein, (ii) whether the gene was duplicated in the genome (to include a possible self-resistance enzyme gene26), (iii) whether the gene was biosynthetically related to nearby genes, (iv) whether the gene encoded a small protein (to ignore mispredicted small proteins), and (v) the distance between a given gene and the next one (refer to the Methods section for the detailed procedure). In addition, the extracted BGCs were visualized using a web browser, which displayed general information on each BGC and each gene (Fig.\u00a01b). The fungal genome mining tool developed in this study was named FunBGCeX (Fungal BGC eXtractor).Fig. 1Fungal genome mining tool.a General workflow to extract biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with a target gene from a given fungal genome. b Example of output from the genome mining tool.

Thus, such BGCs were extracted from 1990 annotated fungal reference genomes downloaded from the NCBI database (Supplementary Data\u00a04) using an HMM profile created from Pyr4 and its homologues15,30. This process resulted in the identification of 1050 BGCs (including those with a single gene; Supplementary Data\u00a05). More than half (690) of the identified BGCs did not contain an additional core protein gene, whereas 182 BGCs possessed at least one PKS gene, and 131 BGCs were found to encode a PaxC-like prenyltransferase, which is specifically required for the biosynthesis of indole sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids31. Thus, except for standalone pyr4-like genes, the majority of the pyr4-like genes were clustered with either a PKS gene or a paxC-like gene. This observation was consistent with the fact that, in fungi, Pyr4-family terpene cyclases have been found only in the biosynthetic pathways of polyketide\u2013terpenoid hybrids and indole terpenoids32,33.Fig. 2Discovery of atypical BGCs encoding a Pyr4-family terpene cyclase.a Reactions catalyzed by the selected members of Pyr4-family terpene cyclases. b Phylogenetic analysis of known Pyr4 homologues and those identified in this study, along with their associated biosynthetic gene clusters.

After manual inspection of the raw output from the genome mining tool, we found that 16 BGCs encoded one or two protein(s) homologous to squalene\u2013hopene cyclases (SHCs) or oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs), which are involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoids. Intriguingly, Pyr4-like proteins encoded by these BGCs formed a distinct clade when subjected to phylogenetic analysis with known Pyr4-family terpene cyclases (Fig.\u00a02b). During our study, we also observed that the genome of Aspergillus fumigatus A1163, a nonreference genome of A. fumigatus, contained a similar BGC, which was reserved for further investigation. To date, no metabolic pathway involving both a Pyr4-family terpene cyclase and an SHC/OSC-like enzyme has been identified. Furthermore, the nature of these BGCs suggests that their products are triterpenoids whose biosynthesis requires two cyclization events. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the known fungal metabolites appear to be synthesized by these BGCs. Therefore, we speculate that these BGCs are responsible for the biosynthesis of untapped triterpenoid molecules. In addition, we found seven BGCs that encoded a UbiA-like prenyltransferase but lacked a PKS gene (Fig.\u00a02b). Thus, it is predicted that these UbiA-like prenyltransferases accept a non-polyketide substrate to attach a prenyl group, which would then be cyclized by the Pyr4-family terpene cyclase encoded by these BGCs. However, such a biosynthetic mechanism has never been reported, and therefore, these BGCs might be involved in the formation of meroterpenoids with a non-polyketide moiety.", "In terms of the sources of the Pyr4-like proteins identified in this study, most of them (1010/1050) are of ascomycete origin, which is consistent with the fact that all of the characterized fungal Pyr4-family terpene cyclases are from ascomycete fungi. However, we also noted the presence of Pyr4 homologues from fungi in other divisions, namely Chytridiomycota (12/1050), Mucoromycota (3/1050), and Basidiomycota (25/1050), some of which are clustered with other potential biosynthetic genes (Fig.\u00a02b). Two basidiomycete fungi, Marasmius tenuissimus GH-37 and Psilocybe cf. subviscida CBS 101986, possess homologous BGCs with a pyr4-like gene. These two BGCs apparently lack a prenyltransferase gene or other well-known core enzyme genes, and therefore, the Pyr4 homologues encoded by these BGCs might directly accept a ubiquitously present polyprenyl molecule. Furthermore, the chytrid fungus Rhizophlyctis rosea JEL0764 harbors a BGC that encodes a Pyr4-like protein and a PaxC-like prenyltransferase. Since this Pyr4 homologue is distantly related to any of the known Pyr4-family terpene cyclases, the BGC could potentially synthesize an unprecedented meroterpenoid species. Collectively, our global genome mining analysis could readily identify several different groups of unexploited BGCs in diverse fungi, which are worth studying further.", "To compare the performance of our genome mining methodology with that of antiSMASH (fungiSMASH) analysis, the same set of 1990 fungal genomes used in our genome mining were analyzed by the standalone version of antiSMASH. The detected BGCs were then examined to see whether they encoded a Pyr4 homologue, resulting in the extraction of 325 BGCs (Supplementary Data\u00a06). Although these BGCs include those encoding an (oxido)squalene cyclase, most of the other uncharacterized BGCs mentioned above could not be detected by antiSMASH. Furthermore, antiSMASH analysis is unable to tell which BGCs encode a Pyr4-like protein (or another protein of the user\u2019s interest), and therefore, the extraction of BGCs with a pyr4 homologue by antiSMASH requires (i) detection of all BGCs from given genome sequences and (ii) manual inspection to determine whether each BGC encodes a Pyr4 homologue. Altogether, the antiSMASH analysis fails to detect certain types of BGCs, which can be detected by our approach, and also requires a much longer time for the completion of the analysis. On the contrary, our genome mining method allows for the automated extraction of BGCs of the user\u2019s interest within a short period of time.", "Characterization of selected triterpenoid BGCs", "To examine whether the unusual BGCs identified by our global genome mining analysis can yield untapped natural products, we then focused on those encoding an SHC/OSC-like protein and selected three BGCs for experimental investigation. The three BGCs were from Aspergillus homomorphus CBS 101889, A. fumigatus A1163 (CBS 144.89), and Aspergillus alliaceus CBS 536.65, which were designated as the homo, fumi, and alli clusters, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a, Supplementary Table\u00a02, and Supplementary Data\u00a08). The homo cluster was the simplest of the three and encoded the squalene or oxidosqualene cyclase HomoS, the Pyr4-family terpene cyclase HomoB, and the FAD-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) HomoM, the last of which is homologous to epoxidases involved in fungal meroterpenoid pathways32,33. In addition, the homologues of the three enzymes were conserved in the other two BGCs, although the fumi cluster contained two homoS homologues, fumiS1 and fumiS2. On the basis of the predicted functions of Homo enzymes, the product of the homo cluster could be synthesized as follows. First, HomoS cyclizes squalene or oxidosqualene to yield a cyclized product. Then, HomoM epoxidizes one of the olefinic double bonds present in the cyclized product, and HomoB finally performs a second round of cyclization to produce the end pathway product. The other two BGCs would employ a similar biosynthetic mechanism; however, they each encoded one or two tailoring enzymes predicted to modify the triterpenoid scaffold. The fumi cluster contained a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene fumiP, whereas the alli cluster encoded the P450 AlliP and the acetyltransferase AlliA. Collectively, all of the three BGCs were expected to yield different triterpenoid species.Fig. 3Functional analysis of fungal onoceroid BGCs.a Schematic representations of fungal onoceroid biosynthetic gene clusters and BLASTp comparisons of each gene product. b Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry profiles of the metabolites obtained from Aspergillus oryzae transformants. c Structures of triterpenoids obtained in this study.

The numbers of previously undescribed compounds are given in blue (Note that 8 had only been obtained as a synthetic compound42).", "To analyze the functions of the three BGCs and identify the metabolites produced, we performed heterologous expression experiments in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR134, which has been widely utilized for the characterization of orphan BGCs27,35\u201337. We first individually expressed the four putative triterpene synthase genes (homoS, fumiS1, fumiS2, and alliS) in A. oryzae and then analyzed metabolites from the resulting transformants using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS). The findings revealed that all of the enzymes, except FumiS2, yielded specific metabolite(s) (Fig.\u00a03b, traces i to v). The homoS-transformed strain produced a major product 1 with m/z 410 [M]+, which was not present in the host strain. After isolation, metabolite 1 was identified as bicyclic triterpene \u03b1-polypodatetraene based on the comparison of its nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and specific rotation with reported data38 (Fig.\u00a03c). Compound 1 was also obtained from the A. oryzae transformant harboring fumiS1; however, the transformant produced another product 2, which was identified to be \u03b1-polypodatetraen-3\u03b2-ol39, the C-3 hydroxy analogue of 1 (Fig.\u00a03c). The metabolic profile of the A. oryzae strain with alliS differed from those of the other two. A specific metabolite 3 was detected as a major peak and was identified as 8\u03b1-hydroxypolypoda-13,17,21-triene40 (Fig.\u00a03c).", "We then identified the downstream metabolites of the three pathways and first focused on the end product of the homo pathway. The co-expression of the epoxidase gene homoM and the pyr4 homologue homoB with homoS resulted in the formation of an additional metabolite 4 with m/z 426 [M]+ (Fig.\u00a03b, trace vi). Analysis of the NMR data of 4 revealed the presence of two additional ring systems, whose absolute structure was established using the modified Mosher\u2019s method41 (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Thus, compound 4, hereby named homomonoceroid A, is synthesized through the cyclization of squalene from both termini and is classified as an onoceroid.", "Next, the co-expression system of fumiS1, fumiM, and fumiB was constructed, which yielded two additional metabolites, 5 and 6 (Fig.\u00a03b, trace vii). The major product 5, designated as fumionoceroid A, was determined to be another onoceroid; its structure was established through NMR and X-ray crystallographic analyses (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03; CCDC: 2279439). Compound 5 was also found to be a tetracyclic onoceroid as 4, and both 4 and 5 appeared to be derived from 1. However, the newly formed bicyclic system of 5 differed from that of 4. The other product 6, fumionoceroid B, was determined to be the C-3 hydroxy form of 5 and appeared to be synthesized in the same manner as 5, using oxidosqualene as a starting material (Fig.\u00a03c). The absolute structure of 6 was deduced based on that of 5. Subsequently, the P450 gene fumiP was introduced, yielding an additional product 7 (Fig.\u00a03b, trace viii). NMR and X-ray crystallographic analyses revealed that 7, named fumionoceroid C, was a hydroxylated form of 5 at C-24 (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03; CCDC: 2279440).", "When alliS, alliM, and alliB were introduced into A. oryzae, the transformant with the three genes produced compound 8 (Fig.\u00a03b, trace ix). In contrast to the products obtained from the other BGCs, 8 was identified as a pentacyclic onoceroid and named alliaonoceroid A (Fig.\u00a03c). Although 8 has never been isolated from natural sources, it was predicted to be a biosynthetic precursor of cupacinoxepin42, which had been isolated from the Ecuadorian plant Cupania cinerea43. We investigated steps involved in the biosynthetic processes catalyzed by the P450 AlliP and the acetyltransferase AlliA. We created four gene expression systems with either alliP or alliA to determine the enzyme required first in the biosynthetic process. Both the transformants yielded a specific product. The introduction of alliP and alliA led to the formation of 9 and 10, respectively (Fig.\u00a03b, traces x and xi), which were characterized to be the C-21 keto and C-6\u03b1 hydroxy analogue of 8 and the O-acetylated form of 8, respectively, through NMR and X-ray crystallographic analyses (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03; CCDC: 2279441 and 2279442). Finally, the transformant harboring all five alli genes produced 11 (Fig.\u00a03b, trace xii), which was determined to possess two acetoxy groups at the C-16\u03b2 and C-21\u03b1 positions (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03; CCDC: 2279443). Compounds 9\u201311 were designated as alliaonoceroids B\u2013D, respectively.", "We then investigated whether the fungal strains that originally harbor the onoceroid BGCs yield the onoceroid species obtained in this study. We found that, based on LC\u2013APCI\u2013MS/MS analysis, A. homomorphus CBS 101889 and A. alliaceus CBS 536.65 produced 4 and 11, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04), which are the predicted end pathway products of the homo and alli clusters, respectively. Accordingly, the expression of the biosynthetic genes was also confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). Meanwhile, the metabolite analysis of A. fumigatus CBS 144.89 suggested that 7, the product from the fumi cluster, is formed by the fungus when it was cultivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04); however, the MS/MS spectrum of the concerned compound could not be obtained due to its low productivity, and therefore, we were unable to confirm the production of 7 in A. fumigatus.", "Discovery of 4-hydroxybenzoate-derived meroterpenoids", "To further demonstrate the utility of our genome mining strategy, we then aimed to discover another type of fungal metabolites by characterizing an atypical BGC that is not detected by antiSMASH. To this end, we focused on a BGC derived from Neoarthrinium moseri CBS 164.80, which was designated as the mos cluster (Figs.\u00a02b and 4a and Supplementary Table\u00a03). The mos cluster encoded the two FAD-dependent monooxygenases/oxidoreductases MosA and MosD, the Pyr4-family terpene cyclase MosB, the UbiA-like prenyltransferase MosC, the N-acetyltransferase MosE, and the hypothetical protein MosF. To obtain the metabolite synthesized by the mos cluster, the six mos genes were heterologously expressed in A. oryzae NSARU144. The resultant A. oryzae transformant yielded metabolites 12 and 13, which were absent in the host fungal strain (Fig.\u00a04b, traces i and ii), both of which possess the molecular formula C21H32O3. However, the productivity of the two metabolites was considerably low, probably due to the insufficient supply of their precursor molecule. Interestingly, we noted that the FMO MosD is highly homologous to the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase BisD (60% amino acid sequence identity), which is involved in the biosynthesis of biscognienyneB45. Thus, we reasoned that 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) served as the precursor for 12 and 13. To investigate this hypothesis, the A. oryzae transformant was cultivated in the presence of 4-HBA, which resulted in the production of 12 and 13 in a much higher yield (Fig.\u00a04b, trace iii). Subsequently, both compounds were isolated from large-scale cultivation. The minor product 13 was identified as ent-yahazunol based on its NMR spectra and specific rotation (Fig.\u00a04c)46,47, which was originally isolated from a sponge of the genus Dysidea. The NMR spectra of 12 revealed that 12 possesses the same planar structure as 13 and is the C-8 epimer of 13, and 12 was named moserinol (Fig.\u00a04c). As discussed later, the structures of 12 and 13 suggested that MosB, MosC, and MosD are sufficient to synthesize these compounds. Thus, we created another A. oryzae transformant harboring mosB, mosC, and mosD, which expectedly afforded 12 and 13 (Fig.\u00a04b, trace iv). The metabolite analysis of N. moseri CBS 164.80 revealed the presence of 12 upon feeding 4-HBA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04), and the RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of all mos genes except for mosA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05).Fig. 4Characterization of the BGC for 4-hydroxybenzoate-derived meroterpenoids.a Schematic representations of the mos cluster. b High-performance liquid chromatography profiles of the metabolites obtained from Aspergillus oryzae transformants.
