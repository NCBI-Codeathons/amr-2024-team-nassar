["3. Results", "3.1. Chemical Characterization and Morphological Analysis of Synthesized Ba Salt Particles", "3.1.1. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR)", "FT-IR was used to confirm the formation of Ba salt particles (BaSO4/BaSO3/BaCO3) by revealing the functional groups. Figure 3 displays the FT-IR spectrum obtained for three different Ba salt particles. IR spectrum for BaSO4 (Figure 3a) shows peaks at 1188 cm\u22121, 1060 cm\u22121, and 982 cm\u22121 which are attributed to symmetric stretching of SO42\u2212, peaks at 1635 cm\u22121 due to stretching vibration of SO42\u2212 and peaks at 604 cm\u22121 and 637 cm\u22121, representing out-of-plane bending for SO42\u2212. Peaks at 2360 cm\u22121 seem to be the overtone of S-O vibration [24,25]. The existence of the functional group suggests the generation of BaSO4 particles. Figure 3b shows the characteristic peaks for SO32\u2212 found at 490 cm\u22121, 630 cm\u22121, 912 cm\u22121, and 1133 cm\u22121 position, suggesting the formation of BaSO3 particles [26,27]. The characteristic peaks for CO32\u2212 found at 855 cm\u22121 and 692 cm\u22121 (Figure 3c) were owing to in-plane and out-of-plane bending, whereas the peak at 1414 cm\u22121 corresponds with asymmetric stretching of C\u2013O bond and peak at 1059 cm\u22121 is attributed to the symmetric C\u2013O stretching vibration [28], thus indicating the formation of BaCO3 particles.", "3.1.2. Element Analysis of Ba Salt Particles by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)", "EDX was carried out for elemental analysis of Ba salt particles (Figure 4). The presence of the desired elements in the samples would confirm the formation of the respective particles. Elemental analysis of BaSO4 (Figure 4a) and BaSO3 (Figure 4b) shows the presence of Ba, S, and O, whereas analysis of BaCO3 confirms the presence of Ba, C, and O (Figure 4c).", "3.2. Particle Stability Assessment", "One of the biggest challenges in oral delivery is pre-systemic degradation due to harsh pH in the stomach having a fluctuating pH which can be extremely acidic (~pH 1) in fasting state. Therefore, any oral delivery agent needs to be resistant to extreme acidic pH to survive during GIT transport. To test how stable Ba salt particles are in different pHs, a set of in vitro experiments were designed and carried out by exposing the formulations to a wide range of pHs for a period of 3 h.Figure 5 shows changes in the turbidity pattern at 320 nm for Ba salt particles. Both BaSO4 and BaSO3 particles demonstrated much higher absorbance than BaCO3 particles when measured immediately after their generation at pH 7.78, reflecting the tendency of BaSO4 and BaSO3 to generate a significantly higher number of particles than BaCO3. Consistently high turbidity values for BaSO4 particles indicate their excellent resistance to degradation over a wide range of pHs at different time points (1\u20133 h), while the turbidity of BaSO3 particles sharply dropped at pH 1.69 suggesting the considerable amount of particle loss. BaCO3 maintained almost the same level of turbidity throughout the range of pHs, with apparently no significant particle loss at low pH.", "3.3. Insulin Loading of Ba Salt Particles", "3.3.1. Insulin Loading Efficiency of Ba Salt Particles and Subsequent Release of Insulin from Particles at a Wide Range of pHs", "The affinity of insulin molecules towards different Ba salt particles was assessed by separating FITC-conjugated insulin-loaded particles from free fluorescent insulin by centrifugation. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 485 nm/535 nm (excitation/emission) wavelengths. The amount of FITC-insulin present in the pellet was calculated from the standard curve prepared with a known amount of FITC-insulin vs. respective absorbance. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the standard curve prepared with free FITC-insulin. % loading was calculated by dividing the amount of FITC-insulin present in the pellet with the amount initially added and then multiplying with 100. Figure 6a shows % of insulin binding to three different Ba salt particles, with BaCO3 particles demonstrating a higher binding affinity for insulin (100%) than BaSO4 and BaSO3 particles. The equations used to calculate the % of loading and % of release of insulin were shown in Figure 6b. FITC-insulin-loaded particles were exposed to a wide range of pHs, and as shown in Figure 6c, nearly 20%, 50%, and 60% of insulin were released from BaSO4, BaCO3, and BaSO3 particles, respectively, when the respective insulin-particle complexes were exposed to pH of 2.47, whereas at a pH of 1.78, only around 30% of insulin was released from BaSO4 and approximately 80% of insulin was released from BaSO3 particles.", "3.3.2. Morphological Analysis of Ba Salt Particles by FE-SEM", "FE-SEM analysis was carried out to study the particle morphology with respect to particle size, shape, and aggregation pattern with and without insulin loading into the particles. Figure 7 shows micrographs for 3 different types of Ba salt particles. (a) BaSO4 particles possessed distinctive irregular, oval to hollow rounder shape, with the bigger particles having oval to hollow rounder shape with particle size between 110\u2013200 nm and the smaller ones being irregularly shaped with particle size between 30\u2013100 nm. (b) BaSO3 particles also had the prominent distribution of big (90\u2013270 nm) and very small (15\u201340 nm) sized particles. The particles were found to be rounder shaped and held in tight baseball-shaped clusters with a rough surface area. Each distinctive particle cluster ranged from 500 nm to 1.0 \u00b5m size in diameter. Bigger particles displayed rounder shape morphology with smooth surface area, without forming a cluster (c) BaCO3 particles demonstrated distinctive square to rectangular shaped morphology, with the particle size varying widely from 50 to 500 nm. Particles were closely aggregated with one another, forming rod/filament-like structures.", "3.4. Analysis of Effect of Insulin Loading into Particles by FE-SEM", "Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the scanning electron microscopy images of empty Ba salt particles and insulin-loaded particles placed side-by-side to observe any morphological changes in the context of size, shape, and aggregation patterns as a result of insulin loading.", "3.4.1. Effect of Insulin Loading into Baso4 Particles: Changes in Morphology and Aggregation Pattern", "Insulin was loaded into BaSO4 particles in varying amounts. Loading of insulin altered the shape of the particles, with different concentrations of insulin showing a different degree of structural changes in particle morphology (Figure 8).", "Figure 8a shows that free BaSO4 particles are of rounder shape with a distinctive hollow structure in the middle and a smooth outer surface. Figure 8b shows BaSO4 particles prepared with 2 \u00b5g of initially added insulin, giving the impression of free particles residing with insulin-loaded particles which were morphologically different from the empty particles. Insulin-loaded particles are baseball-shaped with a rough surface area and without a hollow structure. Figure 8c,d show insulin-loaded BaSO4 particles prepared with 10 \u00b5g and 50 \u00b5g of insulin. With increasing insulin concentrations, the particle looked more elongated-shaped and the surface area appeared rougher. Interestingly, there was no empty BaSO4 particle visualized in a high concentration of insulin.", "Different amounts of insulin loading show different degrees of structural changes in particle morphology. (a) Free particles were of rounder shape with a distinctive hollow structure in the middle and a smoother outer surface. (b) A low amount of insulin (2 \u00b5g) added prior to particle formation showed the presence of characteristic free particles along with few insulin-loaded particles with a distinctive change in morphology. (c) and (d) Insulin-loaded particles prepared with 10 \u00b5g and 50 \u00b5g of initially added insulin. With an increasing amount of insulin, particles became more oval-shaped and the surface area looked rougher. Pictures were taken at 2.0 kV.", "3.4.2. Effect of Insulin Loading into Baso3 Particles: Change in Morphology and Aggregation Pattern", "Figure 9 shows morphological features of empty and insulin (FITC-insulin)-loaded BaSO3 particles. There were no noticeable changes in size, shape, or surface morphology of a single particle. However, a very distinctive change in aggregation pattern was observed. Empty particles tended to get clumped together, whereas insulin-loaded particles looked much less aggregated, with their clusters clearly oval shaped.", "3.4.3. Effect of Insulin Loading into Baco3 Particles: Changes in Morphology and Aggregation Pattern", "Figure 10 shows morphological features of empty and insulin-loaded BaCO3 particles with no noticeable changes in size, shape, and surface morphology of individual particles. However, very distinctive patterns in the aggregation pattern could be observed. Free particles tended to get clumped together, whereas insulin-loaded particles looked much less aggregated.", "3.5. Assessment of Mucin Adhesion to Ba Salt Particle", "In vitro tests were done to determine the affinity of different Ba salt particles for mucin to predict whether the particles would be capable of crossing the intestinal lining. The data from the FT-IR analysis would indicate any possible interactions of mucin molecules with the particles. Mucin adhesion to the particles was further assessed by the spectrophotometric protein quantification method.", "3.5.1. Analysis of Mucin Adhesion to Ba Salt Particles Using FT-IR", "FT-IR was used to confirm the mucin binding of Ba salt particles (BaSO4/BaSO3/BaCO3) by revealing the functional groups for particle along with mucin protein. Samples for particles only, mucin only, and particles adhered to mucin were analyzed with FT-IR. The comparison of the peak patterns showed positive mucin binding for all three Ba salt particles. Free mucin displayed characteristic peaks of N-H at 3279 cm\u22121, Amide I at 1634 cm\u22121, Amide II at 1549 cm\u22121, C-H at 1434 cm\u22121, and 1374 cm\u22121, Amide III 1232 cm\u22121, C\u2013O\u2013C at 1115 cm\u22121 and C\u2013C\u2013O at 1029 cm\u22121 [29]. Figure 11a reveals FT-IR spectrum of BaSO4 particles alone, free mucin, and BaSO4 particle-mucin complexes. BaSO4 particles showed 8 characteristic peaks as described in an earlier Section 3.1.1. On the other hand, mucin displayed 8 characteristic peaks (as found in the free mucin sample). Mucin-adhered BaSO4 particles demonstrated 12 distinctive peaks, with peaks 2360 cm\u22121, 1188 cm\u22121, 1064 cm\u22121, 982 cm\u22121, 635 cm\u22121, and 605 cm\u22121 matching the peaks of BaSO4 particles in the similar positions. The peak at 3415 cm\u22121 showed a deviation to 2392 cm\u22121 probably due to mucin attachment to the particles. Similarly, mucin peaks at 3279 cm\u22121, 1549 cm\u22121, and 1434 cm\u22121 seemed to be shifted to 3275 cm\u22121, 1539 cm\u22121, and 1439 cm\u22121 respectively in mucin-attached particles. The existence of characteristic peaks for BaSO4 and mucin indicates interactions between BaSO4 particles to mucin.", "Figure 11b shows the FI-IR spectrum for free BaSO3 particles, free mucin, and BaSO3-mucin complex. BaSO3 particles possess 4 characteristic peaks as described in the previous Section 3.1.1. On the other hand, mucin has 8 characteristic peaks (as shown in the free mucin sample). Mucin-adhered BaSO3 particles showed 13 distinctive peaks. The peaks of BaSO3 particles, 1133 cm\u22121, 912 cm\u22121, 630 cm\u22121 and 409 cm\u22121 were found at 1131 cm\u22121, 919 cm\u22121, 509 cm\u22121, and 474 cm\u22121 positions in mucin-adhered BaSO3 particles. On the other hand, 8 characteristic peaks from mucin were found at 3311 cm\u22121, 1648 cm\u22121, 1539 cm\u22121, 1434 cm\u22121, 1298 cm\u22121, 1343 cm\u22121, 1187 cm\u22121, and 1101 cm\u22121 positions. Mucin peaks showed deviation from their positions apparently due to its binding to BaSO3 particles. The presence of characteristic peaks for BaSO3 particle as well as for mucin indicates positive adhesion of BaSO3 particles to mucin.", "Figure 11c shows the spectrum for free BaCO3 particles, free mucin, and BaCO3-mucin complex. BaCO3 particles showed 4 characteristic peaks as described in the earlier Section 3.1.1. Mucin-adhered BaCO3 particles demonstrated 9 distinctive peaks. Mucin characteristic peaks at 3279 cm\u22121, 1634 cm\u22121, 1549 cm\u22121, 1232 cm\u22121, and 1115 cm\u22121 were found, respectively, at 3384 cm\u22121, 1645 cm\u22121, 1555 cm\u22121, 1213 cm\u22121, and 1121 cm\u22121 positions in mucin-adhered BaCO3 particles. The presence of characteristic peaks for BaCO3 particles and mucin indicates positive adhesion of BaCO3 particles to mucin.", "3.5.2. Quantitation of Mucin Adhesion to Particles", "Percentage (%) of mucin adhesion to different Ba salt particles was calculated by measuring the protein content (mucin) precipitated out with the particles after centrifugation. Protein quantification was done by the Bradford method. The standard curve was prepared with a series of a known amount of mucin versus respective absorbance values. Figure 12 presents Bradford assay data for mucin adhesion, where (a) shows the standard curve prepared from abs vs. known amount of mucin, whereas (b) reveals the % of adhesion to 3 different types of Ba salt particles. BaSO4 particles showed highest mucin adhesion (100%), followed by BaSO3 and BaCO3 particles with 60\u201370% of mucin adhesion.", "3.6. Oral Administration of Insulin-Loaded Particles to Diabetic Rats and Effect on Blood Glucose Level", "Short-acting human insulin analog, Insulin Aspart (NovoRapid, Novonordisk)-loaded Ba salt particles were administrated to STZ-induced diabetic male Wister Kyoto (WKY) rats. For oral administration, particles prepared with a high concentration of reactant salts (20\u00d7 higher than that used in original formulations) were loaded with a high dose of insulin aspart (100 IU/kg).", "Effect of Orally Administrated Insulin on Hyperglycemia", "Insulin aspart loaded into Ba salt particles were administrated to STZ-induced diabetic male WKY rats. For oral administration, Ba salt particles prepared with 20X concentrated reactant salts (Table 2) were loaded with a high dose of insulin aspart (NovoRapid\u00ae, Novo Nordisk, Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark) (100 IU/kg). Figure 13 shows the data from control groups and treatment groups. Control groups consist of no treatment (negative control) and oral treatment of free insulin (100 IU/kg) (positive control). As expected, none of the groups showed any significant reduction of blood glucose level (p < 0.05) at any time point in the study. For BaSO4 particles with loaded insulin, blood glucose level was significantly low compared to the baseline level in 1\u20133 h (p < 0.05). At 4th h, the level was still low compared to the baseline level but not significant, with an ascending trend. BaCO3 particles with loaded insulin showed a significant decrease of blood glucose level at 1\u20132 h, although blood glucose level started to show a slight rise at 3rd h, and by 4th h, it was back to the baseline level. However, insulin-loaded BaSO3 particles showed a reduction in blood glucose level but the reduction was not significant at 4 h.", "Figure 14 shows a calculated % reduction of blood glucose level for BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3 loaded insulin. % reduction calculation shows a significant reduction of blood glucose level for BaSO4 loaded insulin from 1\u20133 h and BaCO3 loaded insulin between 1\u20132 h (p < 0.05). Again, because of inconsistency in glucose reduction pattern in different animals, % of reduction in case of BaSO3 loaded insulin treatment was not significant at any point in time."]
