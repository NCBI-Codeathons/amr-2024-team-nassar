["Results", "Identification and Characterization of the Roseopurpurin BGC.", "To find gene clusters capable of producing inhibitors of CDK2, we looked within our library of annotated BGCs for those that contained a gene encoding a protein that had \u226550% amino acid identity with human CDK2. This search yielded seven related BGCs from diverse fungal species, including BGC HX1012 in the genome of A. uvarum and BGC HX1035 in the genome of Phaeosphaeria sp. TTI001159 (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). The biosynthetic enzymes encoded in these BGCs comprise one nonreducing-polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) core protein, multiple putative tailoring enzymes, a cluster-specific transcription factor, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, and a CDK2 homolog. Metabolites are produced by BGCs through the combined activity of the enzymes encoded by the core genes and most or all of the tailoring genes. The consecutive nature of the transformations in these pathways leads to the production of multiple metabolites, as both intermediates and shunt products, at varying levels of maturity from a single BGC. From a therapeutic discovery perspective, it is valuable to profile the bioactivity of metabolites at all stages of maturation, as each metabolite provides potentially valuable data information about the structure\u2013activity relationship of the compound class.", "Fig. 2.Biosynthesis of 1.

However, in addition to BGC HX1012, the genome of A. uvarum encodes 75 additional BGCs (per antiSMASsh 6.0 (23)), which can each produce unique metabolites. Given the abundance of metabolites, it can be challenging to determine which are produced by a specific BGC. To determine the metabolites specific to BGC HX1012, we employed targeted gene disruption of the core NR-PKS gene (rosJ, Fig. 2A) in A. uvarum by replacing it with a hygromycin resistance marker (hygR). As we were unsure which growth conditions would induce BGC HX1012 expression, A. uvarum \u0394rosJ::hygR was cultured alongside wild-type A. uvarum (empty vector control) in 12 diverse growth media (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) analysis of these cultures yielded clear differential production of metabolites with [M+H]+ = 347.11 and [M+H]+ = 345.10 across the majority of conditions (representative trace in GLX media shown in Fig. 2 B\ni and ii). These metabolites were isolated and characterized as depside 4-o-demethyl barbatic acid (6, SI Appendix, Table S9 and Figs. S20\u2013S23) (24) and depsidone hypoprotocetraric acid (7, SI Appendix, Table S10 and Figs. S24\u2013S27) (25), respectively.", "Based on the tailoring enzymes encoded in BGC HX1012, we reasoned that metabolites 6 and 7 would be early intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway. In addition to biosynthetic genes and a CDK homolog, BGC HX1012 also contains rosH, a Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor. Such transcription factors within BGCs have shown to be specific regulators of BGC expression, and overexpression of these transcription factors has proven an effective means of BGC activation in fungi (26\u201328). We employed this approach to increase the expression of all genes in the cluster in order to generate more mature cluster products. rosH was cloned under the control of PcoxAN, the strong constitutive promoter of the A. nidulans cytochrome C oxidase, and transformed into A. uvarum. The resulting strain was cultured in the same 12 media used above. Across most conditions, overexpression of the cluster-specific transcription factor yielded stable or decreased production of 6 and 7 with concurrent increases in signals for related compounds 8 (SI Appendix, Table S11 and Figs. S28\u2013S31) previously isolated from Penicillium sclerotiorum (29), and roseopurpurin C (1, SI Appendix, Table S8 and Figs. S15\u2013S19) previously isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium roseopurpurin (30, 31), as well as small amounts of depsidone roseopurpurin G (10, SI Appendix, Table S12 and Figs. S32\u2013S35), aculeatusquinone C (11, SI Appendix, Table S13 and Figs. S36\u2013S39) (32), and roseopurpurin D (12, SI Appendix, Table S14 and Figs. S40\u2013S43), the C-4 epimer of 1 (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2).", "To gain deeper insight into the biosynthesis of the roseopurpurins and to enable the production of as many BGC-associated metabolites as possible, we sought to characterize BGC HX1012 by heterologous expression in A. nidulans. Heterologous expression of BGC HX1012 produced only trace amounts of cluster-related metabolites. However, heterologous expression of BGC HX1035, a closely related BGC (core gene identity = 51%, Fig. 2A) from the genome of TTI001159, produced high levels of 1. The observation that related BGCs will produce different amounts of metabolites when expressed in a heterologous host is not uncommon and highlights the benefit of having access to multiple related BGCs.", "pRosJ, the core NR-PKS in BGC HX1035, is similar (39% amino acid identity) to DrcA, an NR-PKS involved in the biosynthesis of duricamidepside, a fungal depside related to 1. Consistent with the activity reported for DrcA (33), we see that the heterologous expression of pRosJ alone is capable of producing 3-methylorsellinic acid and catalyzing depside bond formation to yield 6 (Fig. 2 C, i). Oxidative ether formation for conversion of 6 to depsidone 7 is subsequently catalyzed by cytochrome P450 pRosK (Fig. 2 C, ii), followed by decarboxylation by pRosB to yield compound 8 (Fig. 2 C, iii). Addition of the genes for either cytochrome P450 pRosA or reductase pRosC alone to this system yielded no additional significant products, but the concerted expression of both led to the generation of small amounts of a compound with [M+H]+ = 335.11 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). We hypothesize that this signal comes from intermediate 9, a compound that undergoes spontaneous dehydration and rearomatization to yield 10. Addition of the gene for O-methyltransferase pRosF led to the ultimate production of 1 (Fig. 2 C, iv) and its C-4 epimer 12.", "This scheme demonstrates that glyoxalase pRosD serves no obvious role in the biosynthesis of 1. Heterologous expression of prosD alongside the genes necessary for the production of 1 led to the conversion of 1 to 11 by cleavage of the central ring (Fig. 2 C, v and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B).", "Roseopurpurins Are Potent Inhibitors of CDKs.", "1 and 10 have been previously isolated from A. fumigatus and P. roseopurpurin and found to be generally cytotoxic, but neither their BGCs nor their molecular target were known (30, 31). Based on the presence of a putative CDK2 resistance gene (Fig. 3A), we hypothesized that the metabolites would be inhibitors of human CDK2. To test this hypothesis, the BGC HX1012/HX1035-derived metabolites (1, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12) were assayed for their ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of histone H1 by cyclin E1-activated CDK2 using a luciferase-coupled ADP-detection biochemical assay (ADP-Glo; Promega). Inhibition of CDK2 was observed for five of the six BGC-derived metabolites (1, 8, 10, 11, and 12; Fig. 3B), with 1 displaying the most potent inhibition (IC50 = 47 \u00b1 6 nM). Intriguingly, the inhibitory activity of the compounds increased as the compounds advanced through the biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, epimerization of the 4-hydroxyl group of 1 to afford 12 resulted in an approximately 50-fold reduction in activity. To ensure that inhibition of the luminescence signal was attributable to CDK2 inhibition rather than to inhibition of the ADP-detection enzymes, control reactions where CDK2 was replaced with 10 \u00b5M adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (ADP) were performed. None of the metabolites inhibited the detection of ADP in the control reactions, demonstrating that the activity was due to the inhibition of the CDK2/cyclin E1 complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).", "Fig. 3.BGC HX1012/HX1035-derived metabolites are ATP-competitive CDK inhibitors.

None of the commercial depsidones or depsides had an IC50 lower than 10 \u00b5M (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).", "1 Is an ATP-Competitive CDK2 Inhibitor.", "We next sought to characterize the mechanism of action of 1. The IC50 of 1 was within fivefold of the concentration of CDK2/cyclin E1 complex in the biochemical assay, suggesting that tight-binding inhibition may be observed under the assay conditions (34), which would complicate mechanism of action studies. To test for tight binding inhibition under the assayed conditions, we determined the IC50 of 1 at varying concentrations of CDK2/cyclin E1. Indeed, tight-binding inhibition was observed at concentrations of cyclin E1-activated CDK2 greater than 7.5 nM (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). To remove confounding effects of tight binding inhibition, 1 was checked for ATP-competitive inhibition of cyclin E1-activated CDK2 with 5 nM enzyme. Consistent with an ATP-competitive mechanism of inhibition, the IC50 of 1 was dependent on the concentration of ATP (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). Moreover, kinetic curves revealed that treatment with 1 increases the KM for ATP without affecting kcat (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Fig. S6 C and D). Fitting the kinetic curves to a competitive inhibition model using PRISM resulted in a Kiapp for 1 of 44 nM \u00b1 8 nM, which is consistent with the observation that tight-binding inhibition is observed at enzyme concentrations greater than 7.5 nM.", "1 Inhibits CDK2 in Human Cell Lines and Induces Cell-Cycle Arrest.", "To determine whether the BGC HX1012/HX1035-derived metabolites can engage with CDK2 in a cellular context, we profiled the activity of 1, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12 in a nanoBRET-based CDK2 engagement assay (35) in HEK293 cells.

Depending on the cyclin-bound state, CDK2 promotes S-phase entry (cyclin E-bound) and drives the S/G2 transition in the cell cycle (cyclin A-bound) (36). Based on the biochemical and nanoBRET data demonstrating 1 is a potent inhibitor of CDK2, we expected the metabolite to induce G1 phase arrest in G0 synchronized cells. To test this, HCT116 cells were synchronized at G0 by serum starvation (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 A and B) and released into serum-containing medium containing 1. For comparison, control treatments were performed with known G1 arrest-inducing CDK inhibitors (flavopiridol, KO3861, dinaciclib, and palbociclib) and a G2/M arrest-inducing microtubule polymerization inhibitor (nocodazole). Following a 24-h inhibitor treatment, cell cycle stages were assessed by measuring DNA content (G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase alterations), EdU incorporation (S phase alterations), and histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation (pHH3) levels (M phase alterations) via flow cytometry. Based on DNA content, treatment with 25 \u00b5M 1 resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G1 stage and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of cells in the S and G2 stages compared to a DMSO-treated control (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S7C). Consistent with these results, treatment with 1 also significantly reduced the percentage of EdU and pHH3 positive cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C and SI Appendix, Fig. S7D) suggesting that the metabolite prevents cells from entering S phase. Similar results were obtained in cells treated with the known G1-arresting CDK inhibitors flavopiridol, dinaciclib, KO386, and palbociclib but not in cells treated with the G2-arresting microtubule inhibitor nocodazole (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 C and D).", "Taken together, these data demonstrate that 1 is cell permeable and inhibits CDK2 in a cellular environment, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.", "1 Is CDK-Selective Type 1 Kinase Inhibitor.", "To obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of CDK2 inhibition by 1, we determined the co-crystal structure of 1 bound to CDK2 at a resolution of 2.62 \u00c5. The co-crystal structure revealed that 1 is bound to the ATP-binding pocket, consistent with the ATP-competitive mechanism of inhibition (Fig. 5A). The 3\u2032-OH group of 1 formed hydrogen bonds with the amide backbone of Glu81 and Leu83 in the hinge region of CDK2 (Fig. 5B). Notably, the hydrogen bond with Glu81 is unusually short, 2.6 \u00c5, suggesting its energetic favorability. The structure also revealed key hydrogen bond interactions between the 4-OH and the 9\u2019-carbonyl with Asp86 and Asp145, respectively (Fig. 5B). These critical contacts in the ATP-binding pocket with the 4-OH, as well as the 9\u2032-carbonyl, explain the potency differences observed with the intermediate/shunt metabolites produced by BGC HX1012/HX1035 (Figs. 3B and 4A).", "Fig. 5.1 binds to the ATP-binding pocket of CDK2.

Similar to the type I ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, 1 makes favorable interactions with the kinase hinge region. Indeed, the binding mode of 1 was similar to that of dinaciclib (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix, Fig. S8) (37, 38) despite sharing no chemical similarity or conserved pharmacophore-protein interactions.", "Hinge-binding, ATP-competitive inhibitors are the predominant class of kinase antagonists identified to date (39). However, given the conservation in protein sequence and structure of the ATP-binding pocket across the kinase superfamily, selectivity is a significant challenge for compounds with an ATP-competitive mechanism of action. Given the relatively small size of 1 and the common mechanism of inhibition, we anticipated that kinase selectivity for 1 would be limited. To evaluate selectivity, 1 was assayed for its ability to inhibit a panel of 30 diverse kinases spanning seven kinase families (SI Appendix, Fig. S9) using a luciferase-dependent ADP-detection assay (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). For reference, the pan-kinase inhibitor staurosporine was also profiled (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S11). Of the 30 kinases profiled, 1 inhibited seven with a nanomolar IC50. Of these, five were in the CDK family, with CDK2 being the most sensitive (potency shift relative to data in Fig. 3B is due to tight-binding inhibition). Moreover, in contrast to the pan-CDK inhibitors dinaciclib and flavopiridol, 1 shows modest selectivity for CDK2 over CDK1 and strong selectivity for CDK2 over CDK9 (36, 40), both of which are associated with toxicity (16). Outside of the CDK family, only AMPK and CAM4K were inhibited with nanomolar IC50s. This starkly contrasts staurosporine, which inhibited 24 kinases with a nanomolar IC50 and showed no kinase family selectivity. These data indicate that despite the small size of 1 and common mechanism of action, selectivity for CDK proteins evolved, consistent with the phylogeny of the putative CDK resistance gene.", "Kinase selectivity of 1 and staurosporine", "IC50 \u00b1 STDEV (nM)  IC50 \u00b1 STDEV (nM).", "1 (n = 3) Staurosporine (n = 2)  1 (n = 3) Staurosporine (n = 2).", "CDK1/Cyclin A2 950 \u00b1 160 3 \u00b1 1 FGFR1 8,000 \u00b1 5,000 <1.", "CDK2/Cyclin E1 160 \u00b1 20 43 \u00b1 6 JAK3 >50,000 <1.", "CDK3/Cyclin E1 370 \u00b1 150 37 \u00b1 2 LCK 30,000 \u00b1 10,000 8 \u00b1 3.", "CDK5/p35 260 \u00b1 160 <1 SYK 12,000 \u00b1 3,000 <1.", "CDK6/Cyclin D3 720 \u00b1 180* 150 \u00b1 40* MINK1 >50,000 6.0 \u00b1 1.", "CDK9/Cyclin K 19,000 \u00b1 3,000 20 \u00b1 7 PAK1/CDC42 >50,000 60 \u00b1 30*.", "CLK3 2,900 \u00b1 400 1,200 \u00b1 100 IRAK4 >50,000 15 \u00b1 7.", "Aurora A 13,000 \u00b1 3,000 11 \u00b1 4 TAK1-TAB1 17,000 \u00b1 4,000 8 \u00b1 1.", "CK2\u03b11 4,000 \u00b1 1,000 >20,000 GSK3\u03b2 1,100 \u00b1 200 8 \u00b1 2.", "IKK\u03b2 >50,000 >20,000 p38\u03b1 >50,000 >20,000.", "CK1\u03b11 1,200 \u00b1 200 >20,000 AMPK \u03b11/\u03b21/\u03b32 100 \u00b1 15 <1.", "CK1\u03b31 >50,000 >20,000 CAMK4 600 \u00b1 200 21 \u00b1 2.", "PKC\u03b1 >50,000 <1 CHK1 >50,000 5 \u00b1 1.", "ROCK1 23,000 \u00b1 4,000 4 \u00b1 1 DAPK1 >50,000 98 \u00b1 7.", "AKT1 6,000 \u00b1 3,000 18 \u00b1 7 MAPKAPK2 >50,000 160 \u00b1 30.", "IC50 values represent the averages from the indicated number of experiments \u00b1 SD of the mean.
