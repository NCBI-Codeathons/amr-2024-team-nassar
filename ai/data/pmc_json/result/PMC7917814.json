["3. Results", "3.1. Biosynthesis of Rishirilides Is Positively Regulated by RslR1, RslR2, and RslR3 Cluster-Situated Regulators", "The rsl-gene cluster encodes four regulatory proteins. Analysis of domain architecture of RslR1 and RslR2 identified an N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding and Bacterial Transcriptional Activation (BTA) domains that are typical for members of the SARP-family regulatory proteins. RslR3 is a 1112-amino acid transcriptional factor which belongs to large SARPs and has multi-domain architecture similar to AfsR and PolY [19,39]. Like RslR1 and RslR2, it consists of an N-terminal SARP domain, which is followed by an additional ATPase (AAA/NB-ARC) domain and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that usually mediates protein\u2013protein interactions. RslR4 is a member of the MarR-family (Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Regulator) transcriptional factors.", "To investigate the role of these regulators in rishirilide biosynthesis, we inactivated them individually in the S. bottropensis chromosome by in frame replacement of their coding sequences with the spectinomycin resistance gene. To estimate rishirilides production, the resulted mutants together with wild type strain were grown in YMPGv medium for five days and their metabolite profiles were analyzed using UHPLC-MS. Inactivation of rslR1, rslR2, and rslR3 completely abolished production of all rishirilide compounds indicating their positive role in the biosynthesis (Figure 1a). Inactivation of rslR4 did not distinctly affect rishirilides production.", "To exclude the possibility of any polar effect and to confirm that changes in the production of rishirilides were solely due to the inactivation of the targeted regulatory gene, the integrative pSET152-based construct carrying a native rslR gene allele together with its promoter region was introduced into mutants. Complementation of rslR1 and rslR2 mutants restored the production of rishirilides. Complementation of S. bottropensis \u2206R3 failed when rslR3 was expressed from its putative promoter region in pSET-rslR3. However, complementation with pTES-rslR3, where the regulatory gene is under control of the constitutive ermE-promoter (Figure 1b,c), restored the ability of rslR3 mutant to produce rishirilides. This result suggests that rslR3 lacks its own promoter, that was further confirmed by gene co-expression analysis (see Section 3.3). In order to overexpress rslR1-R3 in the wild type strain, replicative multi-copy plasmids expressing each regulatory gene from the ermE-promoter (pUWLH-rslR1, pUWLH-rslR2, and pUWLH-rslR3) were constructed and conjugated into S. bottropensis. Indeed, overexpression of rslR1, rslR2, and rslR3 in the wild type increased rishirilides production from 3- to 5-fold (Figure 1d). These results are in agreement with the gene deletion experiments, and indicate that the SARP regulatory proteins RslR1, RslR2, and RslR3 are positive regulators of the rsl-gene cluster. Moreover, the activity of all three proteins is required for rishirilide biosynthesis. On the other hand, RslR4 might be not involved in direct regulation of transcription of structural genes. However, it may control strain self-resistance to produced compound(s).", "3.2. Expression Pattern of Regulatory Genes in Wild-Type and Mutant Strains", "S. bottropensis initiates rishirilides production after 48 h of growth in fermentation medium. To determine putative interconnections between regulatory genes, their expression was analyzed in the wild type and in the rslR1-, rslR2-, rslR3-, and rslR4-disruption mutants. Total RNA was isolated from the strains after 72 h of growth and genes transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR. As a control, the hrdB gene, which encodes a RNA polymerase principal sigma factor, was used.", "In the semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the level of transcripts of rslR4 was the same in the wild type strain and in S. bottropensis \u0394R1, S. bottropensis \u0394R2, and S. bottropensis \u0394R3 (Figure 2a). This result indicates that rslR4 transcription is independent from a control by RslR1, RslR2 or RslR3. Transcriptional profiles of rslR3 and rslR1 were very similar in all analyzed strains as well, indicating that both genes are independently expressed. In contrast, the low level of rslR2 transcripts in S. bottropensis \u0394R3 indicates that rslR2 may be positively regulated by RslR3. In addition, transcription of rslR2 might be under a negative control of RslR1 due to the increased abundance of rslR2 transcripts in S. bottropensis \u2206R1 (Figure 2a).", "To verify these results as well as to investigate the possibility of self-regulation, expression of rslR1 and rslR2 at transcriptional level was analyzed in the wild type and in S. bottropensis \u0394R1, S. bottropensis \u0394R2, and S. bottropensis \u0394R3 using the GusA-reporter system [38]. Promoter regions of rslR1 and rslR2 were cloned upstream of the \u03b2-glucuronidase gene and the obtained plasmids were then conjugated into the wild type and mutant strains. Activity of GusA in strain lysates was measured after 72 h of growth. Strains carrying the empty vector pGUS were used as a control (Figure 2b). There was no significant difference in the rslR1 promoter activity in the wild type and in S. bottropensis \u0394R1, S. bottropensis \u0394R2, and S. bottropensis \u0394R3 (Figure 2c). These data are in agreement with the results of the RT-PCR experiments. In contrast, the transcription of rslR2 was strongly downregulated in the rslR3 mutant and increased two-fold in S. bottropensis \u0394R1 and S. bottropensis \u0394R2 (Figure 2d). These data indicate that RslR3 and RslR1 can act as positive and negative regulators, respectively. Moreover, RslR2 acts as a negative regulator of its own transcription.", "In summary, these data suggest that transcription of rslR2 is controlled by multiple regulators. It is activated by RslR3 and downregulated by RslR1 as well as by RslR2. Thus, RslR3 controls the pathway specific regulator RslR2. Finally, transcription of rslR4 is independent from the other Rsl-regulatory proteins.", "3.3. Transcriptional Organization of rsl-Genes", "To identify putative promoter regions in the cluster, the transcriptional organization of the rsl-genes was determined. The co-transcribed genes were mapped by RT-PCR with primers, which anneal across gene pairs using cDNA from the wild type strain as a template. The obtained PCR products represent junction sequences between the genes (Figure 3). Amplification products between rslK1 and rslK2, as well as rslK3 and rslA, indicate that the minimal PKS genes form a single operon. The PCR products obtained for gene sets rslT1-rslT2, rslT3-rslO1, rslO1-rslO2, rslO2-rslP, and rslP-rslR1 indicate that genes between rslR1 and rslT1 are transcribed together. The faint PCR products obtained for rslT1-rslT2 and rslP-rslR1 indicate that there may be promoters located upstream of rslT1 and rslP in addition to a promoter upstream of rslR1. The PCR products were also obtained for further gene pairs (Figure 3) but not for rslC2-rslO3. These data indicate that genes between rslR2 and rslO4, rslR4 and rslR3, and rslT4 and rslH clearly form transcription units and that there are promoters located upstream of rslC2, rslO3, rslR2, rslR4, and rslT4. The weak PCR fragment for rslR3-rslR2 may suggest the co-transcription of both genes. However, successful complementation of S. bottropensis \u2206R2 by pSET-rslR2 confirmed the existence of a promoter upstream of rslR2 because in our complementation construct rslR2 can only be expressed from its own promoter. Interestingly, the transcription unit rslR4-rslO6-rslR3 indicates that rslR3 lacks its own promoter region. This explains the ability to complement S. bottropensis \u2206R3 only by expressing rslR3 from the constitutive ermE-promoter. Complementation failed when a fragment containing rslR3 and the region between rslO6 and rslR3 was used.", "3.4. RslR3 is a Multi-Domain Protein That Regulates rslR2", "To further confirm direct interaction of RslR3 with the promoter region of rslR2, a radio-labeled DNA probe was used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a recombinant RslR3. Beside the rslR2p, rslR1p and promoters of rsl-transcriptional units were used. Production of the recombinant full-length RslR3 with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag resulted in insoluble protein, which hampered the investigation of its DNA-binding ability. It has been shown that truncated versions of AfsR containing either the SARP and ATPase domains or only the SARP domain, show the same DNA interaction pattern as the full-length protein [39]. As domain organization of RslR3 is similar to AfsR, an analogous experiment was performed. Two truncated versions of RslR3, consisting of only the SARP-domain (RslR3DBD) and the SARP-domain accompanied by the ATPase domain (RslR3DBDP) were constructed. Only the RslR3DBD version could be produced as a soluble protein and was used for further studies. Increasing concentrations of purified RslR3DBD were incubated with a DNA fragment containing the promoter region of rslR2 (Figure 4a). DNA-protein complexes were formed at concentrations of 0.5\u20131 \u00b5M. RslR3DBD yielded a bit smeared and broad bands, which could be due to instability of the truncated protein. To confirm a specific binding of RslR3DBD to rslR2p, the protein (1 \u00b5M) was incubated with labeled DNA probe at the presence of 10 to 500-fold excess of unlabeled DNA. Unbound labeled rslR2p was detectable indicating a specific binding of RslR3DBD to the promoter region of rslR2 (Figure 4b). No binding was observed using rslR1p or any other tested promoter region (Figure 4c,d).", "Altogether, these results are in a line with data of RT-PCR and in vivo reporter system experiments. This finding suggests that rslR2 is directly activated by RslR3 and is its sole target in rishirilide gene cluster.", "3.5. RslR4 Negatively Regulates Transcription of MFS Transporter Gene rslT4 and Its Own Expression", "RslR4 is a member of the MarR family of transcriptional factors, often involved in regulating antibiotic resistance, stress responses, catabolism of aromatic compounds, and virulence regulation [40,41,42,43,44]. Most of the members are known to be transcriptional repressors of genes located next to it, including transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Gene rslR4 is located upstream and divergently oriented to rslT4, encoding MFS membrane protein. It is predicted to be an efflux pump providing strain self-resistance to rishirilide(s) and pathway intermediates. We assumed that RslR4 negatively controls rslT4 transcription until rishirilide and/or its intermediate are accumulated.", "To study the function of RslR4 on transcription of rslT4 and its own gene, two plasmids pGUS-rslT4p and pGUS-rslR4p were constructed. In these plasmids, promoters of respective genes are fused with the \u03b2-glucuronidase reporter gene gusA. Constructs were introduced into S. bottropensis and into S. bottropensis \u2206R4. Both strains carrying pGUS-rslT4p were grown in YMPGv medium. After two days, \u03b2-glucuronidase activity in the lysates was measured. In comparison to the wild type strain, S. bottropensis \u2206R4 showed ca. 5-fold higher \u03b2-glucuronidase activity, indicating that RslR4 represses rslT4 transcription (Figure 5a). The same experiment was carried out with the strains harboring pGUS-rslR4p. Here, a 2-fold increased \u03b2-glucuronidase activity in S. bottropensis \u2206R4 in comparison to the wild type strain was observed (Figure 5b). This result concludes that RslR4 also negatively controls transcription of its own gene, acting as an autorepressor.", "To confirm direct binding of RslR4 to intergenic region between rslR4 and rslT4, a recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged protein was heterologously produced in E. coli (DE3) Star, and its DNA-binding ability was analyzed by EMSA. Figure 5c shows a formation of retarded bands with increased concentration of RslR4. MarR regulators act as dimers and binds to palindromic sequences within target DNA [45]. The existence of several protein-DNA complexes indicates the presence of multiple binding sites in a given DNA sequence. Multiple sites could facilitate differential regulation of rslT4 and rslR4 genes. Next, a competition assay was carried out to prove binding specificity. As shown in Figure 5d, an excess of non-radioactive probe specifically competed with the labeled probe for binding to RslR4.", "3.6. Rishirilides and Intermediates of the Pathway Interact with RslR4", "The final product or pathway intermediate(s) often exert a regulatory role on strain resistance by modulating activity of cognate regulator. To assess the effect of end products and key intermediates on DNA binding by RslR4, the recombinant protein was incubated with the rslR4-T4 region in reaction mixture containing different concentrations of putative ligands. In addition, we tested the newly isolated alkene derivatives RSH-O7a-d, which are accumulated in an enoyl reductase RslO7-deficient mutant. As shown in Figure 6, the interaction of RslR4 with its ligand molecules is concentration dependent. Rishirilides, RSH-O5, RSH-O9, RSH-O7a, and lupinacidin A at high concentration could eliminate DNA\u2013protein interaction (Figure 6a\u2013e,g). Little interaction was observed for RSH-O7b-d (Figure 6h,i) and no interaction was observed for the shunt product galvaquinone A (accumulated in \u2206rslO1 and \u2206rslO4 mutants) (Figure 6f). This result demonstrated that RslR4 DNA-binding ability is regulated by the final products and some key intermediates of the rishirilide pathway.", "Altogether, these findings demonstrate that RslR4 negatively controls transcription of rslR4 and rslT4 genes by direct binding to their intergenic region. The repression is eliminated upon RslR4 interaction with cognate ligand molecules. This leads to the expression of the MFS transporter gene rslT4 and provides strain with a resistance to synthesized metabolites."]
