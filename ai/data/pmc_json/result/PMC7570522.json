["2. Results", "2.1. Genome Sequencing Revealed a Circular Chromosome of Strain DSM 44131T", "The rapid development in genome sequence technology has enhanced the blooming of genome sequencing for various microorganisms and promoted the development of a number of bioinformatics tools for natural product exploration [27,28]. In order to deeply explore the secondary metabolite potential of A. pretiosum subsp. auranticum, the high-quality draft genome of strain DSM 44131T was sequenced through Illumina Miseq technology, and the acquired reads were assembled by A5-miseq. The genome sequence revealed a circular chromosome of 8,105,537 bp, a G+C content of 73.95%, and 6,663 protein coding genes. Total 7 rRNA and 57 tRNA genes were predicted as well (Table S3). The information of each predicted gene, such as gene product annotation and KEGG orthology, were available on the GeneBank database. The function analysis of the predicted proteins was based on COGs categories using the COGs database. The categories assigned a part of genes to transcription (9.37%), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (5.63%), amino acid transport and metabolism (4.91%), signal transduction mechanisms (4.55%), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (4.05%), energy production and conversion (3.94%), and secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (3.03%). While a large number of genes were assigned to unknown function category (31.51%) (Figure S1). The genome sequence data have been deposited in the GenBank database and the accession number is JABBHD000000000.1; the BioProject number is PRJNA541432.", "2.2. Comparative Genomic Analysis within Actinosynnema Resulted in the Discovery of Dnacin B1 BGC", "Comparative genomics has not only been used in the evaluation of the evolutionary relationship between different strains, but also in the prediction of the putative functional genes in many strains [29,30]. The online antiSMASH analysis of the harbored BGCs within chromosomes of these four strains indicated that strain DSM 44131T was nearly identical to strain X47 (CP023445.1), and different from strain DSM 43827T (CP001630.1) and strain ATCC 31280 (CP029607.1) (Tables S4 and S5), in which strain DSM 44131T contained 28 potential BGCs, which was the average number of typical streptomycete strains (Table S4). In addition, the 66.9 kb DNA fragment garnered our significant interest, given that it was located in both strain DSM 44131T and strain X47, close to a NRPS BGC, and exhibiting 64% similarity with the biosynthetic gene cluster of the THIQ alkaloid, naphthyridinomycin (NDM) (Figure 1B). This discovery showed us that this region should be related to the biosynthesis of two THIQ alkaloids, dnacin A1 and dnacin B1, which were isolated from strain DSM 44131T (identified as Nocardia sp. No. C-14482 before) [8].", "Subsequently, the crude extract of strain DSM 44131T was prepared, as well as the initial HPLC-MS analysis, however, it failed to detect the production of dnacin. To facilitate the following study, we tried to improve dnacin yield through media optimization and supplement with resin HP-20, and the titer was evaluated by the transcription levels of relevant genes with qPCR analysis and the inhibition activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923. A set of optimizations of the fermentation conditions in four different media (including H, K, 17 and J medium) were carried out. Fortunately, J medium showed a preferred expression level of the targeted functional genes, which might be due to a better growth level or some other unknown reasons caused by resin HP-20 absorption (Figure S2). The HPLC-MS analysis displayed that dnacin B1 was clearly produced in strain DSM 44131T, fermented in J medium with resin HP-20 for three days (Figure 2D,E).", "2.3. Functional Genes Involved in the Assembly of Dnacin B1 Skeleton", "The detailed bioinformatics analysis of the dnacin B1 BGC from strain DSM 44131T revealed that it contained 41 open reading frames encoding for NRPS, PAPA NRPS extender unit, Pictet\u2013Spengler (PS) reaction, tailoring modification, resistance and regulations (Figure 1C) [21,31,32]. The putative function of the related genes was listed in Table 1. To verify the function of four modular NRPS genes (dinL, dinM, dinN and dinO) in dnacin B1 biosynthesis, a dnacin B1 BGC inactivation (\u0394din) mutant HXJA01 was constructed by deleting these four genes and replaced with an apramycin resistance gene. HPLC-MS analysis displayed that no dnacin B1 was produced in mutant HXJA01 compared with the wild type strain, indicating the BGC was responsible for the biosynthesis of dnacin B1 in strain DSM 44131T (Figure 2).", "In dnacin B1 BGC, the modular NRPS genes dinL, dinJ, dinN and dinO displayed about 52% sequence similarity with those located in NDM BGC. The enzymes encoded by these four genes were responsible for a typical tetrahydroisoquinoline NRPS biosynthesis system (Figure 3) [21]. DinN was a didomain enzyme with acyl-CoA ligase (AL) and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) activities, responsible for the cryptic fatty acyl chain loading and initiation of the dnacin B1 skeleton assembly. DinO was similar to the typical NRPS proteins composed of three C-A-PCP modules, and all of the A domains recognized alanine as the extension substrate.", "The two-component transketolases encoded by dinS and dinU were homologous to napB and napD in the NDM BGC, supporting their functions related to the generation of hydroxyethyl unit from d-xylutose-5-phosphate and transferred to DinT [33]. DinQ resembled a family of KASIII proteins that served as acyl unit-loading activity, which was probably involved in tethering glyceryl group to the 4\u2032-phosphopantetheinyl arm of the ACP of DinT. The A domain of DinL (46% identity with A domain in NapL) was inactive, whereas the C domain was in charge of the condensation of the hydroxyethyl group and the nascent N-fatty acid substituted peptidyl chain, providing the tethered PCP with a linear thioester intermediate.", "DinJ played an important role as NRPS in THIQ biosynthesis. It comprised a tetradomain including a reductase (RE) domain embedded at the terminal of the C-A-PCP, which catalyzed PS- and Mannich-type reactions, conferring the core scaffolds in dnacin B1 biosynthesis [26]. The 3-OH-PAPA precursor was transferred to the PCP domain in DinJ after the adenylation by DinH. The A domain of DinJ (69% indentity with A domain of NapJ) recognized and activated L-(E)-4,5-dehydroarginine, which was modified by DinI (non-heme iron, \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase). Subsequently, DinJ-RE domain reduced the assembling hybrid-peptidyl chain anchored at the PCP domain at DinL to release the aldehyde intermediate. Then, the DinJ-C domain catalyzed the aldehyde intermediate and the PCP linked aromatic acid through PS reaction. The DinJ-RE domain further mediated the reduction in the DinJ-PCP-linked product to deliver an aldehyde intermediate, preparing for the intramolecular Mannich reaction with another DinJ-PCP-tethered L-(E)-4,5-dehydroarginine substrate. The resultant DinJ-PCP attached intermediately, then underwent reduction and cyclization to form the final aldehyde product.", "In addition to the NRPS skeleton assembly and tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold formation, a set of post-tailoring enzymes encoded by dinX, dinY, dinC and dinA were present in dnacin B1 BGC. Two tailoring enzymes DinX and DinY were predicted to proceed with the hydroxylation and N-methylation of dnacin B1 skeleton. The gene product of dinX showed 67% sequence similarity with the FAD-dependent monooxygenase NapA, which might be responsible for the hydroxylation in naphthyridinomycin biosynthetic pathway. DinY showed 65% sequence similarity with the methyltransferase NapV, which might be in charge of the N-methylation in dnacin B1 biosynthetic pathway. The peptidase DinC showed 56% similarity with NapG, which might be the membrane-bound peptidase participating in the cleavage of leader peptide and then exporting the precursor from the cell. DinA, an FAD-linked oxidase with 75% similarity with NapU, might have the same function as NapU, which was confirmed to be in charge of oxidative activation and over the oxidative inactivation of a matured prodrug [31]. The dnacin B1 BGC contained three regulator genes, separately belonging to the TetR family (dinR2), SARP family (dinR3) and LysR family (dinR9). DinR8, annotated as a DNA excision repair enzyme UvrA, showed 84% similarity with NapR1, and was deduced as the resistance gene in dnacin B1 biosynthesis [34]. In addition, five ABC transporter genes, dinR1 and dinR4-7 were also found in dnacin B1 BGC (Table 1).", "2.4. Reconstitution of PAPA Pathway Revealed TyrB Participating in the Mature of PAPA", "In the dinacin B1 biosynthetic machinery, DinV resembled the proteins from aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS) family that are widely found in Actinobacteria, and was involved in the dehydration of C-5 hydroxyl group and transferring an amino group into chorismic acid at C-3 to generate of p-amino-deoxychorismate [35]. This was further proved by a phylogeny comprising ADCS, anthranilate synthase (AS), isochorismate synthase (IS) and salicylate synthase (SS) (Figure S3). Genes dinE and dinF shared a homology with 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate mutase papB and dehydrogenase papC from Streptomyces venezuelae, respectively, and might be candidates for the transformation of enol pyruvic acid and decarboxylation to generate p-amino-phenylpyruvic acid [36]. Finally, an aminotransferase of the TyrB family, whose encoding gene was located apart from the BGC of dnacin B1, mediated an amino group transformation at the keto position to produce PAPA. The PAPA biosynthetic machinery in strain DSM 44131T was also considered to be a pathway parallel to that from chorismic acid to tyrosine (Figure S4).", "In order to reconstitute the originated PAPA pathway in dnacin B1 BGC, dinV was cloned from gDNA of strain DSM 44131T and inserted into the vector pETDuet to obtain pJQK354, dinE and dinF were amplified and inserted into vector pCDFDuet to afford pJQK355. Each gene was under the control of its own T7 promoter and transcription ended by the terminator. These two recombinant plasmids were together transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3), conferring HXJE03. Meanwhile, both pETDuet and pCDFDuet were transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) generating HXJE04 as the control strain. Then, the fermentation was carried out in modified M9 medium with corresponding antibiotics and induced by IPTG at 25 \u00b0C and 220 rpm. After the fermentation was completed, HPLC-MS analysis of both fermentation broth showed that PAPA was clearly produced in HXJE03, while there was no PAPA detected in strain HXJE04 (Figure 4). In the absence of aminotransferase that catalyzed the last mature step of PAPA, the achievement of the PAPA production in strain HXJE03 suggested that the endogenous aminotransferases might have participated in the last amino transformation, especially for the aminotransferase involved in the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. This deduction was reasonable because PAPA has a similar chemical structure to tyrosine, and as we know, the aminotransferase TyrB catalyzed the last step of amino group transformation in the mature tyrosine. In order to evaluate the enzymatic property of aminotransferase in PAPA biosynthesis, gene tryB, responsible for the amino transformation in tyrosine biosynthesis, was cloned from the gDNA of E. coli MG1655 and heterologous expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). As was expected, incubation of the recombinant N-His6-TyrB with PAPP and glutamate (Glu) as the substrates generated PAPA, whereas PAPP also could be produced in the presence of PAPA and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) as substrates (Figure 5). The chemical structures of PAPA from the TyrB-catalyzed reactions were determined by NMR and HR-ESI-MS analysis (Figures S5\u2013S8). This result indicated that the TyrB involved in the tyrosine biosynthesis displayed a flexible substrate and transferred an amino group in a reversible reaction with PAPP or PAPA and related auxiliary substrates.", "2.5. Aminotransferases Responsible for the PAPA Maturation Dispersed within the Genome", "Aiming at exploring the possible aminotransferase participating in PAPA biosynthesis during dnacin B1 assembly, nine candidate aminotransferase (AT) genes apat1-9 were screened from the annotation results of the whole genome of strain DSM 44131T with the reference sequence of TyrB (Table S6). To date, the aminotransferases have been divided into five classes, among which tyrosine aminotransferase (TyrB) belongs to class I, together with aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and other aromatic aminotransferase [37]. Moreover, class I is further divided into Ia, Ib and Ic subgroups [38,39]. To better confirm the function of the nine aminotransferases APAT1-9, the phylogenetic relationship was analyzed among these candidates and the other related class I aminotransferases (Figure S10). Consequently, TyrB was located in the Ia subgroup, while all of the nine candidates, together with some extremophile-originated aminotransferases, gathered into the Ib subgroup. This result implied that the unusual function or property might be involved in the strain DSM 44131T-originated aminotransferases.", "To further correlate the function of the nine aminotransferases APAT1-9 in vitro in the biosynthesis of PAPA from PAPP or the reversed reaction, the encoded genes were amplified from the gDNA of strain DSM 44131T and cloned into pET28a, respectively. The obtained plasmids were individually transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and all of the N-terminally His6-tagged fusion proteins were obtained after purification by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. For systematic comparison of their catalytic abilities, equal amounts of APAT1-9 and TyrB were used to convert PAPP to PAPA using Glu as amino donors, or convert PAPA to PAPP with \u03b1-KG as an amino acceptor, individually at optimal reaction conditions. The reactions were subjected to HPLC for the yield analysis of the final products with authentic standards. Remarkably, APAT4 and APAT9 showed a closer relationship in the phylogenetic tree and displayed the preferable conversion rate of 63% and 74% for PAPA formation using PAPP as the amino group acceptor, which were superior to TyrB catalyzed ability. APAT3, APAT6, APAT7 and APAT8 showed the moderated conversion rates (less than 30%) during PAPA maturation with PAPP as the substrate. However, APAT1, APAT2 and APAT5 only exhibited catalytic capacity for the PAPP formation with PAPA as the substrate (Figure 5). Our systematic investigation of the aminotransferases involved in PAPA biosynthesis from the genome of strain DSM 44131T present the preferred aminotransferase candidates for further heterologous expression of PAPA in other hosts."]
