["2. Results and Discussion", "Here, we present SYN-view, an easy-to-use pipeline in order to make rapid comparison of NGIs and provide an additional way to detect putative novel antibiotic resistant targets. SYN-view allows for easy to interpret visualizations of NGIs in order to distinguish genes of interest with different functions. Using an external tool such as autoMSLT [18], SYN-view uses homology search tools to find the input protein and its surrounding genes from closest taxa, in order to perform a synteny search for easy detection of unique gene cluster structures. SYN-view can be easily installed using conda packages [20] and is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/jstahlecker/syn-view/. An overview of the workflow is illustrated in Figure 2.", "2.1. Positive Controls", "For the proof of concept of our proposed method, first we examined bacterial strains reported for antibiotic production with known resistance mechanisms shown in Table 1, to test if there is a significant difference between NGI structures of regular housekeeping genes and genes responsible for self-resistance. Results suggested that when the resistance mechanism includes a duplication event, difference in respective NGIs can be easily recognized. In certain cases where resistance genes have been mutated instead of duplicated (Table 1, A. mediteranei S699, rpoB), differences in NGIs could not be observed. Nevertheless, it would be possible to detect a difference in NGIs even if there is no duplication of self resistance genes but if they are unique to a certain bacterial genome. All of the corresponding results are visualized in detail in the Supplementary Results.", "2.2. SYN-View as a Complementary Method", "In order to prove that SYN-view can further improve the current ARTS pipeline as a complementary method, we employed a final test case where ARTS could not find hits for a known self resistance mechanism. As stated in the first ARTS paper, 23S rRNA methyltransferase, which confers resistance for Avilamycin, was undetected by hmmsearch due to its short sequence length and low homology score. As HMMs are dependent on profiles built from multiple sequence alignment [22], it may fail to represent sequences which are not fully reflecting specific domains characterized from respective proteins. For such cases, SYN-view supports homology search using blastp algorithm, which makes it possible for users to analyze shorter sequences or proteins without an accurate HMM model. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, the synteny among closest relatives of the NGI of 23S rRNA methyltransferase, conferring self-resistance, is significantly different than the NGI with regular housekeeping function."]
