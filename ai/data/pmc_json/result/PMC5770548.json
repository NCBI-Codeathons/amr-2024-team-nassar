We compared the frequency with which spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants accumulate in four species of Pseudomonas, including Pseudomonas\u00a0protegens Pf-5, Pseudomonas\u00a0fluorescens SS101, Pseudomonas\u00a0aeruginosa PAO1, and Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84. These strains were cultured in NYB (nutrient broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract), a medium in which P.\u00a0protegens CHA0 was previously shown to accumulate Gac\u2212 mutants (21). Bacterial cultures were diluted and spread on LMA (litmus milk agar) plates at 6 days postinoculation (dpi) and assessed for exoprotease activity. Production of exoprotease requires the GacS-GacA system (33) and is a readily visualized phenotype (27) that has been used reliably to estimate the proportion of Gac\u2212mutants in cultures of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 (17).

Strains SS101 and PAO1 accumulated spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants to a level of <2% of the total CFU in the culture. Strain 30-84 was more variable between experimental replicates, but on average, cultures were composed of <5% Gac\u2212 mutants. P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 was strikingly different, with 99% of total CFU on average being spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants.

Importantly, the production of these secondary metabolites is known to be positively regulated by the GacS-GacA system (15). We hypothesized that secondary metabolism contributes to the accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the accumulation of Gac\u2212 mutants of a Pf-5 derivative strain that contains mutations in hcnB, ofaA, phlA, pltA, prnC, and rzxB (referred to as the 6-fold mutant hereafter) (35). This 6-fold mutant does not produce any of the six secondary metabolites: hydrogen cyanide, orfamide A, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, or rhizoxin (35). After 6\u00a0days of growth, the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants was significantly lower in cultures of this 6-fold mutant relative to wild-type Pf-5 (Fig.\u00a03A), which supports our hypothesis that secondary metabolism plays a role in the accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants in strain Pf-5.", "FIG\u00a03\u00a0Accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 and its secondary metabolism knockout mutants.

Of the six mutants, only the \u0394pltA mutants and \u0394ofaA mutants, which are unable to produce pyoluteorin and orfamide A, respectively, significantly differed from wild-type Pf-5 in the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants that accumulated in culture (Fig.\u00a03A). The proportions of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of wild-type Pf-5 and \u0394pltA and \u0394ofaA mutants were also assessed in another independent experiment, in which the production of secondary metabolites was quantified over time (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). Again, cultures of the \u0394pltA and \u0394ofaA mutants accumulated a smaller proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants than a culture of the wild type in NYB medium. Results also confirmed that strain Pf-5 produced pyoluteorin and orfamide A in the NYB cultures, whereas the \u0394pltA and \u0394ofaA mutants did not produce pyoluteorin and orfamide A, respectively. Additionally, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and rhizoxin were not detected in the cultures of wild-type Pf-5, the \u0394pltA mutant, or the \u0394ofaA mutant, which is consistent with results that the \u0394phlA and \u0394rzxB mutants accumulated proportions of Gac\u2212 mutants similar to those accumulated by the wild type when cultured in NYB medium (Fig.\u00a03A).

A total of 24 exoprotease-deficient colonies were evaluated: two colonies were randomly selected from LMA plated with three independent populations of each strain, for a total of six colonies per strain. Of the 24 exoprotease-deficient colonies, 23 have a single missense or nonsense mutation, an insertion, or a short deletion in the open reading frame (ORF) or ribosome binding site (RBS) of gacA or gacS (Table\u00a01). This result substantiates that counting colonies lacking exoprotease production provided an accurate estimate of the number of gacS and gacA mutants in a culture of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5, as shown earlier (17). The mutations of 23 colonies mapped to 17 different sites of gacS or gacA. Ten colonies were affected in gacA, with nine having a point mutation in the ORF, and one having a point mutation in the predicted RBS. Thirteen colonies have mutations in gacS, of which two have small deletions that cause a frameshift and one has a single-nucleotide insertion that introduces a stop codon (Table\u00a01). Two colonies were sampled from each of the 12 cultures of this experiment; 3 of the 12 pairs of colonies had identical mutant alleles and are probably siblings (Table\u00a01).

To confirm the role of pyoluteorin biosynthesis in the accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants, we complemented the \u0394pltA mutant with a wild-type pltA gene. Data showed that the complemented mutant accumulated spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants at a level similar to that of the wild type (Fig.\u00a03B). We also evaluated cultures of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 growing in NBG (nutrient broth supplemented with 2% glucose).

No spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutant was detected when strain Pf-5 was cultured in NBG (193, 155, and 148 colonies were screened in three independent cultures), which further supports the conclusion that pyoluteorin biosynthesis contributes to accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants of Pf-5.", "Accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants is associated with the expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes, but not the product pyoluteorin.", "We then hypothesized that the presence of the compound pyoluteorin increased the accumulation of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5. To test this hypothesis, we cultured the \u0394pltA mutant in NYB broth spiked with different concentrations of purified pyoluteorin. Our data showed that pyoluteorin did not increase the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of the \u0394pltA mutant (Fig.\u00a04). To the contrary, the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants decreased with the increased concentration of pyoluteorin added to the \u0394pltA mutant cultures. The addition of pyoluteorin had no significant effect on the growth of the \u0394pltA mutant (Fig.\u00a04B). Because pyoluteorin is present in cultures of wild-type Pf-5 grown in NYB (Fig.\u00a0S2), reduced sensitivity of Gac\u2212 mutants to pyoluteorin could enhance their fitness relative to the wild-type strain in this medium. To test this possibility, we compared the \u0394gacA mutant to the wild-type Pf-5 in their sensitivity to pyoluteorin. No significant difference was observed between the \u0394gacA mutant and the wild-type Pf-5 in sensitivity to pyoluteorin either in NYB broth or on NYA (NYB with 1.5% agar) plates (Fig.\u00a0S3).
