["Results", "mRNA-Seq data set summary", "To gain a deeper insight into the regulatory circuits of the MAP-kinase MpkA in A. fumigatus we extracted RNA from a null mpkA mutant and from the corresponding wild-type strain. We sequenced a total of six libraries, three biological replicates for the \u0394mpkA strain and three for the wild-type strain. We obtained about 263 million paired end reads. Of these, 193 million (74%) were uniquely mapped against the A. fumigatus A1163 genome. Using a stringent RPKM cut-off of 10 reads per gene, 8172 genes (80% of the total annotated genes) were found to be transcribed in the wild-type strain we used. The coverage obtained was similar to that analysed in the dataset published by Gibbons et al.[12] for A. fumigatus (72% of the genes having an RPKM greater than 10). It was also similar to an mRNA-Seq study in A. oryzae[13], where the majority (83.4%) of the genome was covered by at least one read. Requiring coverage of at least 10 overlapping paired-end reads per base-pair, 70.4% (~20 million base pairs) of the genome was found to be expressed. This is remarkable, considering the fact that according to the A. fumigatus CADRE genome database, only ~50% of the genome is potentially transcribable. These findings indicated that the A. fumigatus transcriptome has been greatly underestimated.", "UTRs prediction and annotation of new genes", "So far, most studies have used mRNA-Seq data to identify transcriptional islands, which are consecutive areas of overlapping reads [13]. We additionally checked these Transcript Active Regions (TARs) for open reading frames. Since this approach is error prone, we employed ab initio gene prediction combined with mRNA-Seq data to improve the quality of gene prediction (Figure 1). This evidence-based gene prediction has the advantage over the classic ab initio prediction of finding gene structures by making use of the mRNA-Seq expression profiles. This combination incorporates intron-junction information derived from intron-spanning reads and allows the prediction of not translated regions (UTR) in a systematic manner.", "Figure 1Workflow for evidence-driven gene prediction. The evidence is obtained by deep-sequencing which provides valuable hints like splice junctions or expressed regions.", "Workflow for evidence-driven gene prediction. The evidence is obtained by deep-sequencing which provides valuable hints like splice junctions or expressed regions.", "Gene prediction still requires manual work to find appropriate adjustments for integrating data within a classic gene-predicting framework. By using mRNA-Seq data, we identified 185 new transcripts coding for putative proteins ( Additional file 1: Table S1 and Table S2). However, we could not exclude the possibility that the new transcripts are part of untranslated regions (UTRs) or even part of genes that need to be re-annotated. Among all the identified new transcripts, 44 of them have unknown functions, while 141 have orthologs in the genomes of other fungi.", "Incorporating mRNA-Seq data into gene prediction also allowed the identification of UTRs ( Additional file 1: Table S2). However, UTR prediction remains a difficult task as only expressed regions provide evidence for UTR length. The method can therefore result in vague length predictions, especially for genes with low expression, due to insufficient coverage. Nevertheless, the identification of 5'UTR can help to find upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and led in our case to the identification of one potential uORF among the newly identified genes ( Additional file 1: Table S2). However, knowledge of UTR sequences in A. fumigatus remains poor. This is mainly due to the lack of available expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries. Our analysis highlighted the fact that some genes can have multiple or alternative transcriptional starting points. We found an average median length for 5'UTR of 308 and for 3'UTR of 97 nucleotides based on 9912 UTR sequences for each gene considered ( Additional file 2: Figure S1).", "Comparison of transcriptome technologies", "To better evaluate the performance of microarrays and mRNA-Seq, differentially expressed transcripts were investigated. We compared transcript levels in both the wild-type strain and the \u0394mpkA mutant strain by repeating the experiment performed by Jain et al.[8].", "Transcriptome data obtained by mRNA-Seq identified 2046 differentially regulated genes (log2 fold change >2 and likelihood >0.99). For comparison, using the Febit microarray platform, 653 differentially expressed genes were identified (fold change >1.5) (see Additional file 1: Table S3, Table S4, and Table S5). KEGG analysis showed that common gene categories were enriched by the differentially expressed genes identified in the two datasets (Figure 2 and Additional file 1: Table S6, Table S7, and Table S8). The main difference between data sets was that mRNA-Seq gave a more detailed picture. The number of enriched genes for a specific category was substantially higher showing, for example, complete secondary metabolite gene clusters to be differentially regulated (e.g. the gene cluster bordered by genes AFUB_000840 and AFUB_000750). It is noteworthy that genes enriched in the KEGG category 0.1.1., i.e. genes involved in metabolic pathways, were differentially regulated in the mRNA-Seq data, but in contrast, were not enriched in the data set obtained using microarrays. The majority of these genes, in particular genes putatively involved in fatty acid metabolism, were down-regulated in the \u0394mpkA mutant. This suggests that the RNA deep sequencing technique is more sensitive in finding differentially expressed genes than the microarray technique. This might be explained by the greater dynamic range covered by the RNA technique [14,15].", "Figure 2Comparison of KEGG-enriched categories. Enriched categories were obtained by analysing two different transcriptome analyses performed by mRNA-Seq (dark grey) and microarray (light grey), both performed to investigate genes expressed differently in a wild type compared to a \u0394mpkA mutant strain.", "Comparison of KEGG-enriched categories. Enriched categories were obtained by analysing two different transcriptome analyses performed by mRNA-Seq (dark grey) and microarray (light grey), both performed to investigate genes expressed differently in a wild type compared to a \u0394mpkA mutant strain.", "For a more detailed analysis, we computed log fold changes for the \u0394mpkA mutant vs the wild-type of the differentially expressed genes based on both microarray and mRNA-Seq data, including two biological replicates for each (Figure 3). Correlation of log fold changes of expressed genes was highest within the same technology. Correlation within mRNA-Seq replicates (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient r\u2009=\u20090.96) was higher than that between the two microarray replicates (r\u2009=\u20090.53). This low correlation was mainly due to genes that only slightly changed their expression between conditions and are therefore more affected by the technological noise resulting from the technology used. A possible explanation is the low sensitivity of microarrays for low expressed genes that results in a smaller dynamic range compared to sequence data [15].", "Figure 3Comparison of log2fold changes. Analysis of wt vs \u0394 mpkA mutant among and across both technologies (microarrays and mRNA-Seq). Genes are coloured blue if they were up-regulated (being in the 10% quantile of the genes with the highest fold-change) in both technologies (181 DEGs), red if down-regulated in both technologies (141), green if down-regulated on the arrays and up-regulated for sequence platform (70) and cyan for the opposite case (141).", "Comparison of log2fold changes.

This was not surprising because most genes are not expected to be differentially expressed, which consequently reduces the correlation. Since these genes are usually not of interest, we selected genes having the highest absolute fold change in both studies (10% quantiles of the total number of genes, intersection from mRNA-Seq and microarrays). The correlation value for this subset resulted in a large increase of both the within-array correlation (from 0.53 to 0.83) and the cross-technology correlation (between mRNA-Seq and microarrays, from 0.19 to 0.41). However, the 0.41 correlation is still lower than those found in other studies (e.g. Marioni et al. [16] found a correlation of 0.73 by comparing log fold changes between Affymetrix arrays and Illumina sequencing in experiments performed on human samples).", "With the purpose of having additional values for evaluating the transcriptome data from the two technical platforms, qRT-PCR was performed in order to quantify transcript levels of genes that showed different expression levels in both studies (Figure 4, Additional file 1: Table S9 and Additional file 3 :Figure S2). Among the 15 transcripts investigated, 10 confirmed the direction of expression change detected by both transcriptome analysis techniques (with higher significance for mRNA-Seq data). Surprisingly, qRT-PCR did not reveal significant changes in some genes that showed opposite regulation in the analyses of the two techniques. For instance, qRT-PCR confirmed the mRNA-Seq results for the sidD gene, coding for a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase involved in siderophore production (AFUA_3G03420). Microarray data showed that genes expressed during low iron stress response were down-regulated in the \u0394mpkA mutant strain. Previous experiments reversed microarray results, demonstrating that MpkA negatively regulates genes involved in siderophore production, indicating that many genes involved in iron depletion response are up-regulated in the \u0394mpkA mutant strain (e.g. sidA or sidD) [8]. Current mRNA-Seq data confirmed our experimental hypothesis, by showing that genes involved in the iron starvation response are, in fact, up-regulated.", "Figure 4Differentially expressed gene and protein abundances.A) qRT-PCR used to check genes that showed differential expression between wt and \u0394 mpkA strains during microarray, mRNA-Seq and 2D proteome analysis.

A pair wise scatter plot was realised by computing the Pearson and Spearman correlations for all pairs (Figure 5 and Additional file 1: Table S10 and Table S11). Spearman is a rank correlation technique that can capture some non-linear relationships and is less prone to outliers produced by highly abundant genes. As for Marioni et al. [16] and Feng et al. [14] the correlation between replicates for the same experiment ranged from 0.93 for the dataset of Bruns et al.[17] to 0.99 for the both mRNA-Seq studies, indicating high platform-reproducibility for microarrays as well as for sequencing data (data not shown). Therefore, it was sufficient to include only one representative replicate for each platform to obtain concise comparisons.", "Figure 5Pair-wise scatterplot of transcriptome datasets.

Cross platform correlation was quite low, ranging from 0.12 ([17]vs[18]) to 0.52 ([4]vs[18]). Correlation between the independent measurements (probes A and B) as calculated for the dataset of Jain et al. [8] was only 0.64, although all probes were exposed to the same samples. This indicates a strong technological bias of microarray data due to variation in hybridisation. At the same time, the correlation between the two Febit datasets for the combined probe measurements was quite high (0.89) pointing to a high conservation of technological bias in microarray platforms. In order to perform a general comparison between technologies, i.e., microarrays vs mRNA-Seq, the correlation of data within the same technology was used as a reference for the correlations between technologies. The highest correlation (0.68) among comparisons of mRNA-Seq data to microarray data was higher than the highest correlation between arrays (0.52, Roche vs. TIGR v1). This points to the fact that RNA sequencing data are less affected by technological bias, which is confirmed by the scatter plot comparing both mRNA-Seq datasets (Figure 5).", "Comparison between A. fumigatus transcriptome and proteome", "In order to analyse a possible correlation between transcripts and protein abundances as well as fold-changes, mRNA-Seq data, microarray data and the proteome data of the A. fumigatus wild-type and \u0394mpkA mutant strain were compared. Looking at differential expression, 48 different proteins were identified by 2D-gel electrophoresis and subsequent MALDI-TOF / TOF, which showed a significant fold change in abundance (employing DIGE) in the \u0394mpkA mutant compared to wild type. Gene enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that abundance of many proteins involved in metabolic processes and in oxidation/reduction processes is affected by MpkA ( Additional file 1: Table S12 and Additional file 4: Figure S4).", "The regulation of protein levels was also compared with transcriptome data obtained from microarrays developed by Febit and used in the study of Jain et al.[8] and our mRNA-Seq data. As in earlier results (Figure 3, based on 9800 genes rather than 48) the fold change correlation between microarrays and mRNA-Seq was low (r\u2009=\u20090.14, Additional file 5: Figure S3). The measurements for transcriptome fold change often display low reproducibility because of difficulties in capturing the \u201ctrue\u201d fold change. For this reason, a low correlation between proteome and transcriptome technologies was assumed. However, the correlation between data obtained by microarrays and the proteome data was significantly higher (r\u2009=\u20090.28) than the correlation between mRNA-Seq data vs proteome (r\u2009=\u20090.19). As in the comparative analysis of the transcriptome data, the low correlation applies to all genes with a low fold change resulting in a higher relative impact of technological noise. Furthermore, it has already been shown by studies on human and mouse [19,20] that the relationship between transcriptome and proteome data is quite complex and protein levels are greatly influenced by post-translational processing and inherent variations in stability. These factors result in low correlations.", "In order to study absolute protein abundances, we reanalysed the A. fumigatus 2D proteome map generated by V\u00f6disch et al.[21], resulting in the identification of 312 unique proteins. These proteins were also present in the different transcriptome data mentioned above ( Additional file 1: Table S13 and Table S14). In A. fumigatus, the relative abundances of the proteome map correlated surprisingly well with mRNA-Seq expression levels (r\u2009=\u20090.36 for our data, and r\u2009=\u20090.5 for data from [12], Figure 5) as well as with most microarrays, in particular the Febit arrays (r\u2009=\u20090.47\u20130.49). It is also noteworthy that the genes on the scatter plots (Figure 6) are more equally distributed for mRNA-Seq vs proteome comparison (left bottom corner) whereas, in particular for Febit arrays, a bias was observed towards genes that are highly expressed on the arrays but with low expression on the proteome-map. This is most probably due to cross-hybridisation. By contrast, this sort of bias was not observed in the NGS data.", "Figure 6Pair-wise comparison of all three technologies (microarrays, mRNA-Seq and 2D proteomics).

FunCat-analysis using FungiFun tools [22] indicated that the \u201cgreen\u201d genes (i.e. those genes that are highly expressed according to mRNA-Seq but little expressed according to proteome data) were not significantly enriched within a functional category (even after multiple correction), whereas the red ones (i.e. those genes that are little expressed according to mRNA-Seq but highly expressed according to microarray data) were over-represented within the tricarboxylic-acid pathway and amino acid metabolism. These processes constantly require large amounts of proteins that are therefore less subjected to transcriptional regulation."]
