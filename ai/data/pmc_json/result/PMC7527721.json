["RESULTS", "Interaction of CesAB NRPS with CesC ATPase identified by bacterial two-hybrid screen.", "In order to identify interactions between Ces NRPS and the ABC transporter, we employed the bacterial adenylate cyclase-based two-hybrid system (BACTH), which is an in vivo genetic approach based on reconstitution of the Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (Cya) enzyme if proteins of interest interact (32). Ces NRPS, like other enzymes of this class, is a large multimodular protein complex, consisting of CesA (375\u2009kDa) and CesB (300\u2009kDa) subunits (20). Due to the large size of this complex, it is difficult to assess interactions between CesAB and CesCD directly. Consequently, we selected candidate domains within CesAB for BACTH screening (Fig.\u00a01A). We tested all three condensation domains of the complex (the C and C* domains of CesA and the C domain of CesB), as well as one adenylation domain (A2) and the thioesterase domain (TE) of CesB, for potential interactions with CesC. In addition, the C-terminal fragment of CesA, comprising the peptidyl carrier PCP2 and the epimerization (E) and C* domains, was tested for interaction with CesC and CesD. Since CesCD is a putative ABC transporter consisting of ATPase CesC and transmembrane protein CesD (Fig.\u00a01B), we also checked the interaction between these two proteins as a proof of concept. For this purpose, selected ces domains as well as cesC and cesD were subcloned into BACTH vectors pUT18C and pKT25. The new constructs expressed respective CesA/CesB domains, CesC and CesD with N- and C-terminal fusions to the B. pertussis adenylate cyclase domains T18 and T25. Combinations of recombinant plasmids were cotransformed into the Escherichia coli BTH101 reporter strain, deficient in adenylate cyclase gene (cya). When an interaction between the proteins of interest occurs, T18 and T25 are reunited, reconstituting a catalytically functional adenylate cyclase that boosts the production of cAMP in the E. coli\ncya-deficient host, resulting in transcription activation of reporter genes under the control of a CAP/cAMP promoter, such as a reporter gene encoding the \u03b2-galactosidase. The activity of \u03b2-galactosidase can be tested using isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG/X-Gal) plates or quantified using the liquid Miller assay (33).

An interaction was also observed between CesC and the second CesA module including PCP2, E, and C* (cesA_PCP2/E/C*) (Fig.\u00a01C) but not between cesD and cesA_PCP2/E/C* (data not shown). Notably, the BACTH assay revealed an interaction between CesC and all C domains from CesA and CesB, while no interaction between CesC and the A2 domain of CesB (CesB_A2) or the TE domain (CesB_TE) was observed (Fig.\u00a01C). Overall, these results indicate a specific interaction between the putative ATPase CesC and the Ces NRPS. To ensure the specificity of the interaction between CesC and Ces NRPS, additional BACTH control assays were performed by using cells coexpressing T18/T25-CesA_PCP2/E/C* with T18/T25 tags fused to MinD from B. subtilis, a protein unrelated to cereulide biosynthesis. MinD, which is a vital part of the B. subtilis division site selection system, is an ATPase that binds reversibly to the cell membrane and recruits the MinC protein, an inhibitor of tubulin-like FtsZ assembly (34).

Extracts from E. coli cells overexpressing both fusion proteins (CesA_C* 6\u00d7His tag and CesC S tag) were loaded onto an Ni2+ column. After several washing steps followed by elution, the fusion proteins were subsequently detected by multiplex Western blotting, using anti-His tag and anti-S tag antibodies. As shown in Fig.\u00a03 and Fig.\u00a0S2, CesA_C*-6\u00d7His tag protein pulled down the CesC-S tag protein, indicating interaction between the C* domain of CesA and the ATPase CesC. To exclude unspecific binding of the CesC-S tag protein, extracts from the cells expressing only CesC-S tag were loaded onto the Ni2+ column as a control, which indeed resulted in hardly any detectable protein in the eluate (Fig.\u00a03, control).

Consequently, the interaction partner of CesC is thought to be attached to the cell membrane. In order to test this hypothesis, cesA_C*-mNeon green (mNG) fusion was constructed using double-joint PCR (DJ PCR) (36), cloned into the pDG1664 suicide vector, and integrated into the homoserine kinase gene thrB in B. subtilis 168. cesC was C-terminally labeled with mScarlet (mSc) and, together with unlabeled cesD, cloned into pKAM241 suicide vector and integrated into the alpha-amylase locus amyE of B. subtilis 168.

(D and E) BACTH experiments analyzing binary interactions between the ABC transporter BerA or CesC and as a partner BerB, CesD, and CesA_C* by \u03b2-Gal assay (D) and by using LB X-Gal/IPTG agar (E). Each experiment was performed three times independently. Error bars depict standard deviations from the mean value.", "To examine whether the role of the ABC transporter in cereulide biosynthesis described here is unique to cesCD or whether it is potentially a widespread mechanism, we amplified berAB from B. thuringiensis 407, fused it to a xylose-inducible promoter in the expression vector pWH1520, and introduced the constructs into the F4810/72 \u0394cesCD strain. Induction of berAB with 0.1% xylose in the new strain, designated F48\u0394cesCDberAB, resulted in cereulide production levels comparable to those of the wild type (Fig.\u00a06C). These data clearly demonstrated that the structurally related transporter BerAB complements CesCD function in cereulide biosynthesis, even though B. thuringiensis is not a cereulide producer.", "Since BerAB restored cereulide production in F48\u0394cesCD to the wild-type (WT) level, it could be assumed that there is also physical contact between CesNRPS CerAB and the ATPase BerA. To test this hypothesis, berA and berB were cloned into BACTH vectors and interaction studies were carried out as described above. As expected, BerA and BerB showed a very strong interaction (see Fig.\u00a06D and E). However, there were also strong interactions between the ATPase BerA from B. thuringiensis and the membrane protein CesD from B. cereus as well as between the ATPase CesC from B. cereus and the membrane protein BerB from B. thuringiensis. These data indicate that BerAB is similar to CesCD not only in terms of structure but also in terms of function. These findings were corroborated by the results from the BACTH studies of BerA and the condensation domains of the cereulide synthetase CesAB. A positive interaction between BerA and CesA_C* was observed, while no interaction was found for BerA and CesB_A2 (Fig.\u00a06D and E). These results, which are in line with the ones from our interaction studies of CesAB and CesC (see Fig.\u00a01), demonstrated that the described function of the ABC transporter CesCD in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis could indeed be a widespread mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we used the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) repository (38) to search for CesC-homologous ATPases associated with NRPS gene clusters. As shown in Table\u00a0S4, this search revealed several putative ATPases adjected to NRPS gene clusters, showing between 46% and 32% identity to CesC.", "With our work we showed that not only CesCD, encoded within the cereulide operon, provides an essential function in cereulide biosynthesis but also that the structurally similar transporter B. thuringiensis BerAB, nota bene not located within any NRPS biosynthetic locus, could functionally complement CesCD by creating a biosynthetic complex with the CesAB cereulide synthetase."]
