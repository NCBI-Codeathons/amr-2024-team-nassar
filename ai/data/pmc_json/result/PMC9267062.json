["2. Results", "2.1. Cytotoxicity of FB1 and AFB1 on Caco-2 and HepG2 upon Different Exposure Times", "The cytotoxic effects of FB1 and AFB1 on Caco-2 and HepG2 cells were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays over three different exposure times (24 h, 48 h and 72 h). As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, all the tested concentrations have reduced the cell viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In Figure 1, the dose response curve of the SRB assay was still lower than the MTT assay for all treatments of FB1 in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells. A similar phenomenon was also observed when AFB1 treated HepG2 cells for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (Figure 2).", "All IC50 values of FB1 and AFB1 on Caco-2 and HepG2 cells were calculated based on the obtained results from Figure 1 and Figure 2 and are shown in Table 1. It was observed that all the IC50 values after 24 h of exposure were much higher than those after 48 h and 72 h, except for AFB1 exposure in Caco-2 cells detected by MTT assay. There is a remarkable difference in all the obtained IC50 values between 24 h and 48 h treatments, which is not the case between 48 h and 72 h. For this reason, the exposure times (24 h and 48 h) were chosen to study the effects of FB1 and AFB1 on the mitochondrial respiration in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells. To ensure a sufficient number of living cells after 24 h and 48 h of exposure, the maximum concentration of the two toxins was chosen to induce a 65% cell viability in both cells. In addition, another three concentrations were chosen based on cell viabilities of 75%, 85% and 95%.", "2.2. Different Time Effects of FB1 and AFB1 on Mitochondrial Respiration of Caco-2 and HepG2 Cells", "As shown in Figure 3, after the Caco-2 cells were treated with FB1 for a period of 24 h, the mitochondrial respiration was significantly inhibited. Basal respiration, ATP production and spare respiratory capacity considerably declined regardless of the applied toxic dose of FB1. Moreover, the maximum rate of respiration that the cell can achieve was significantly decreased with increasing FB1 concentration. With all test concentrations of FB1, no difference in both proton leak and non-mitochondrial respiration was observed. For the 48 h of FB1 exposure, it can be seen that the respiratory capacity of the Caco-2 cells has partially recovered compared to the 24 h condition, but also that basal respiration, maximum respiration, ATP production, proton leak and non-mitochondrial respiration significantly decreased depending on FB1 concentrations (Figure 3). The spare respiratory capacity significantly increased at 10, 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL of FB1 in 24 h of exposure, while it became of no significance with all treatments in the case of 48 h of exposure.", "On the other hand, after Caco-2 cells exposure to AFB1 for 24 h with 1 \u00b5g/mL and 2.5 \u00b5g/mL (the corresponding viabilities are 95% and 85%), mitochondrial respiration was not inhibited, and AFB1 stimulated Caco-2 cells to produce more energetic values, which were observed in all the six mitochondrial parameters (Figure 4). However, after the Caco-2 cells were treated by AFB1 for 48 h with 1.25 \u00b5g/mL and 2.5 \u00b5g/mL (with corresponding viabilities of 95% and 85%, respectively), all the mitochondrial parameters were significantly decreased. With all the applied concentrations taken together, except proton leak and non-mitochondrial respiration, the mitochondrial parameters were significantly decreased in a concentration dependent manner.", "For HepG2 cells, the effects on mitochondrial respiration after exposure to FB1 and AFB1 for 24 h and 48 h are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. After 24 h of exposure to any applied dose of FB1 (1, 2.5, 10 and 25 \u00b5g/mL) or AFB1 (1, 2.5, 5 and 15 \u00b5g/mL), there was a difference in proton leak, non-mitochondrial respiration and spare respiratory capacity. Exposure to FB1 (10 and 25 \u00b5g/mL) and AFB1 (5 and 15 \u00b5g/mL) results in a significant decrease in basal respiration, maximum respiration and ATP production. A lower concentration of 2.5 \u00b5g/mL of either FB1 or AFB1 did not have a significant effect over 24 h, while upon exposure to either FB1 or AFB1 at 1 \u00b5g/mL, there was a significant increase in the three mitochondrial parameters (basal respiration, maximal respiration and ATP production). With more prolonged time of exposure (48 h) to FB1 and AFB1, all the mitochondrial parameters were significantly decreased in a concentration dependent manner except spare respiratory capacity. Interestingly, upon FB1 exposure of 48 h, basal respiration was not recovered under the exposure of 0.625 \u00b5g/mL (95% viability) compared to the 24 h exposure for 1 \u00b5g/mL (95% viability), thereby pointing to an adaptation process to the FB1 stress in these conditions, as was also seen for the Caco-2 cells.", "2.3. ROS Production and MMP", "As shown in Figure 7, Caco-2 and HepG2 cells were treated with five concentrations of FB1 and AFB1 (the corresponding viability are 95%, 85%, 75%, 65% and 50%) for a period of 24 h, respectively. ROS generation and MMP disruption in the FB1/AFB1-treated cells resulted in a significant and concentration-dependent increase (p < 0.05 or 0.01), but no significant increase in ROS generation was induced by FB1 in Caco-2 cells. ROS generation was significantly induced by FB1 (400 \u00b5g/mL) and AFB1 (25 \u00b5g/mL) in Caco-2 cells. For HepG2 cells, there is a significant decrease after the exposure to FB1 (25 \u00b5g/mL) and AFB1 (15 \u00b5g/mL), respectively. Similarly, MMP is remarkably disrupted by both mycotoxins, except Caco-2 cells exposure to AFB1 with 25 \u00b5g/mL."]
