["Results", "Synthesis and in vitro testing of putative ClbP inhibitors", "To design a specific inhibitor of colibactin biosynthesis, we targeted the colibactin-activating enzyme ClbP. This membrane-embedded periplasmic serine peptidase is essential for the genotoxicity of pks+\nE. coli. Genetic deletion of ClbP results in an accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates and shunt metabolites from the nonribosomal peptide synthetase\u2013polyketide synthase assembly line, termed \u2018candidate precolibactins,\u2019 many of which have been structurally characterized30,31. This enzyme is an attractive target for inhibition as it belongs to the same enzyme family as \u03b2-lactamases like AmpC, which have been successfully targeted with small molecule inhibitors13,32. However, ClbP is not inhibited by several known \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors or broad-spectrum serine hydrolase inhibitors in vitro33. Although one study identified a pair of boronic acid-based ClbP inhibitors using in silico screening34, we found that these compounds have minimal impact on ClbP\u2019s catalytic activity in vitro or in bacterial culture33. Thus, there are currently no potent and/or selective inhibitors of this enzyme available.", "ClbP contains a catalytic triad typical of the S12 family of serine peptidases formed by the essential residues S95, K98 and Y186 (ref. 13). We aimed to target S95 by exploiting ClbP\u2019s essential and unusual acyl-d-Asn substrate-recognition motif (Fig. 1a). Boron-based electrophiles have frequently been employed in inhibitors of serine and threonine peptidases35, but posed a synthetic challenge here because of the proximity of the potentially nucleophilic asparagine side chain. We ultimately accessed a small panel of pinacol boronate esters: MRV03-037 (1), MRV03-068 (2), MRV03-069 (3) and MRV03-070 (4), which are precursors of the corresponding boronic acids, using an enantioselective copper-catalyzed hydroboration reaction of an ester intermediate followed by ammonolysis (Fig. 1b)36.Fig. 1Activity of ClbP guides rational design of colibactin biosynthesis inhibitors.a, ClbP activates colibactin by removing an N-myristoyl-d-Asn prodrug scaffold (red).

With 25\u2009nM purified ClbP, all compounds had median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 20 and 80\u2009nM after 1\u2009h preincubation, indicating similar potency (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Because these compounds were designed to inhibit ClbP by forming a covalent bond with the critical active site serine residue, we examined the kinetics of inhibition using this assay. Highly potent boronic acid-based inhibitors often exhibit slow-binding kinetics, where the free inhibitor is in equilibrium with the noncovalently bound inhibitor\u2013enzyme complex and the subsequent covalent bond-forming step is rate-limiting37. As expected for this type of binding, preincubating 100\u2009nM 1\u20134 with ClbP for varying amounts of time confirmed that longer preincubation leads to increased potency (Fig. 2b). Although 1\u20133 reached maximum potency within 30\u2009min, 4 showed a substantial lag, suggesting that the initial noncovalent complex of 4 with ClbP is weaker. Previous work showed that ClbP substrates with smaller acyl groups exhibit higher KM values, so the relatively smaller phenyl substituent of 4 may explain this difference33. Further control experiments ruled out boronate ester hydrolysis as being rate-limiting (Extended Data Fig. 1).Fig. 2Compounds 1\u20134 inhibit ClbP activity.a, ClbP activity in vitro upon treatment with 1\u20134 using a fluorescent substrate analog. b, ClbP activity in vitro upon treatment with 1\u20134 at 100\u2009nM and varying incubation time before initiating the assay. c, Activity of E. coli overexpressing ClbP toward a fluorescent substrate analog after treatment with 1\u20134.

All compounds decreased the quantity of prodrug released, but compound 4 showed slightly lower potency than the others in this format.", "Establishing the mechanism of ClbP inhibition", "To directly examine the interaction between an inhibitor and ClbP, we obtained a crystal structure of full-length ClbP bound to 1 because it bears the same type of aliphatic linear hydrocarbon tail as the native prodrug scaffold (PDB 7MDC, Supplementary Table 2). In this structure, the d-Asn side chain of the inhibitor projects into a tight-fitting pocket and hydrogen bonds with the side chains of residues S188, H257 and N331 (Fig. 3a). N331 also hydrogen bonds to E92, setting its orientation and helping to enforce ClbP\u2019s selectivity for d-Asn- over d-Asp-containing substrates.

This boronate complex is a structural analog of the tetrahedral intermediates formed during amide bond hydrolysis and participates in several stabilizing interactions that are likely relevant to the activation of precolibactin. The backbone amides of Q330 and S95 hydrogen bond to one of the boronate oxygen atoms and are thus well positioned to stabilize the negative charge that accumulates upon formation of the covalent bond with S95. In addition, Y186, which is part of the catalytic triad that defines this enzyme family, is positioned to stabilize this complex by donating a hydrogen bond to either the other boronate oxygen atom or the oxygen nucleophile on the serine side chain (Fig. 3c). Thus, the potency of these ClbP inhibitors arises both from their ability to mimic the hydrogen-bonding interactions of intermediates in the hydrolysis of precolibactin and the formation of a covalent bond with the catalytic serine residue.", "Selectivity of ClbP inhibitors", "Having established that this group of compounds can bind and inhibit ClbP with high potency, we next focused on establishing the selectivity of these interactions. Because our structural studies suggest that ClbP can only accept inhibitors of this class with the S stereochemical configuration, we selected a high-potency inhibitor, 3, and synthesized the opposite enantiomer, MRV03-095 (5). We hypothesized that 5 would be a much less potent inhibitor given that N-acyl-l-Asn-containing substrates are not accepted by ClbP14,33. Indeed, 5 is 40-fold less potent than 3 at inhibiting the release of the prodrug from BWpks (Fig. 4a). The weak inhibitory effect of 5 likely results from the presence of a small amount of 3 as an expected minor product of our synthetic route. Both compounds were prepared in an enantiomeric ratio of 95:5 (determined by chiral LC\u2013MS, Extended Data Fig. 2) for the desired versus undesired enantiomer.Fig. 4Compound 3 is selective for ClbP inhibition and active in a community setting.a, LC\u2013MS measurement of N-myristoyl-d-Asn released from BWpks after treatment with 3 or 5. n\u2009=\u20093 biological replicates, individual replicates shown. b, Volcano plot representation of metabolites detected by LC\u2013MS that are altered in BWpks treated with 1\u2009\u00b5M of compound 3 versus untreated (left) and BW\u0394P versus BWpks (right).

An ideal chemical probe should block colibactin biosynthesis while minimally disrupting other metabolic functions, leading to an accumulation of the same shunt metabolites that have previously been observed in pks+ \u0394clbP mutant strains. We compared the metabolites produced by BWpks with the metabolites produced by an isogenic \u0394clbP mutant (E. coli BW25113 BACpks\u0394clbP, \u2018BW\u0394P\u2019) using LC\u2013MS (Fig. 4b)39. We conducted the same experiment comparing BWpks treated with 1\u2009\u00b5M 3 versus the DMSO-treated culture (Fig. 4b). The inhibitor-treated wild-type strain displayed similar changes in metabolite abundance as the \u0394clbP mutant. The primary features identified in both cases were decreased levels of the prodrug scaffold (observed 343.2609 [M+H], theoretical 343.2591 [M+H] mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)) relative to the DMSO-treated wild-type and an accumulation of known shunt metabolites from colibactin biosynthesis (precolibactins m/z 414.3004, m/z 442.3344 and m/z 713.3699)6\u20138. One other significant feature, an increase of a metabolite at m/z 164.1055, was observed only in the case of inhibitor treatment and is consistent with the mass of phenylbutanamide (theoretical 164.1070 [M+H] m/z), a likely degradation product of 3. Based on these observations, 3 appears to be sufficiently potent and specific to serve as a tool for precise control of ClbP activity in living organisms.", "To explore other possible targets of inhibitors 1\u20134, we used an activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) approach to broadly assay their activity against serine hydrolases in bacterial and mammalian proteomes. In this gel-based assay, the binding of a small molecule to a target protein is detected as a decrease in that protein\u2019s ability to bind a nonspecific fluorophosphonate (FP) probe compound which irreversibly inhibits a wide variety of serine hydrolases40. We observed no visible changes in protein labeling by FP at inhibitor concentrations of up to 100\u2009\u00b5M in either E. coli or HEK293T cell lysates (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 3). One limitation of this assay is that ClbP is not labeled by the FP probe, so we cannot observe it as a reference for binding. However, this type of assay has been widely used to study the specificity of small molecule\u2013protein binding interactions and provides strong evidence that most serine hydrolases do not bind inhibitors 1\u2013441.", "To further assess the specificity of our inhibitors, we used another ABPP assay in which we replaced the broad-spectrum FP probe with a probe that specifically targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), BOCILLIN-FL. We chose this probe because of ClbP\u2019s homology to AmpC \u03b2-lactamases13. Because \u03b2-lactamases and PBPs both recognize and bind \u03b2-lactams, we reasoned that these enzymes are more likely to be secondary targets of our inhibitors. Although this labeling strategy detected several PBPs in various bacterial lysates, inhibitor 3 did not reduce the labeling of any targets (Extended Data Fig. 4). This suggests that the acyl-d-asparagine recognition motif is highly specific to ClbP and its closest homologs.", "Compound 3 inhibits colibactin-associated genotoxicity", "Because colibactin is produced in the context of the gut microbiota, we need to understand how 3 can affect other members of this community and whether it remains an effective inhibitor under these conditions. We simulated a complex pks+ community by inoculating anaerobic liquid cultures with fecal pellets from C57BL/6J mice from the Jackson Laboratory, which do not contain colibactin-producing organisms, and adding E. coli NC101 to this community27. NC101 is a colibactin-producer isolated from a mouse gut for which an isogenic E. coli NC101\u0394clbP mutant is available as a control42. We treated both the simulated pks+ and pks\u0394clbP gut communities with 3 or DMSO and monitored production of the colibactin prodrug scaffold in these cultures by LC\u2013MS. Treatment with 3 fully suppressed production of the prodrug scaffold in the pks+ community to the same level as observed in the pks\u0394clbP community (Fig. 4d). To evaluate the effects of 3 on other members of the gut microbiota, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1\u20134 against various bacterial strains from common gut phyla, including E. coli (Supplementary Table 3). In all cases, MICs were above the upper limit tested in this assay (200\u2009\u00b5M), although some species showed partial growth inhibition at 200\u2009\u00b5M (Extended Data Fig. 5). The maximum concentration tested here is more than 100-fold greater than the IC50 value for inhibition of prodrug release, suggesting that 1\u20134 can be used at concentrations that effectively inhibit ClbP without damaging other members of the gut microbiota.", "In addition to blocking the metabolic indicators of colibactin biosynthesis, we also assessed whether 3 could inhibit the genotoxic effects of colibactin on human cells. Cells exposed to colibactin exhibit cell-cycle arrest which can be quantified by DNA staining and flow cytometry4. We exposed HeLa cells to NC101 (ref. 15\ufeff]) and added 3 at varying concentrations in the infection medium. Treatment with 3 partially inhibits this effect at 100\u2009nM (Fig. 5a), with complete inhibition at 1\u2009\u00b5M. We also confirmed that 3 is not cytotoxic to human cell lines at all concentrations tested (\u226410\u2009\u00b5M, Extended Data Fig. 6).Fig. 5Compound 3 prevents colibactin-induced genotoxicity in human cells.a, Flow cytometry analysis of HeLa cells infected with NC101 and treated with 3.

All conditions were run in three biological replicates with one representative sample shown.", "Source data", "To directly assess the impacts of 3 on colibactin\u2019s DNA alkylating activity, we infected HeLa cells with NC101 with or without 3 added and isolated their genomic DNA. This DNA was hydrolyzed and analyzed by LC\u2013MS to detect two diastereomeric colibactin-derived DNA adducts (Fig. 5b)11. Treatment with 1\u2009\u00b5M 3 suppressed adduct formation similarly to genetic deletion of clbP. Finally, we assessed the impact of 3 on the response to colibactin-mediated DNA damage in HeLa cells. In response to stalled replication forks caused by DNA crosslinks, the protein FANCD2 is monoubiquitinated (FANCD2-Ub)43, and cell lines missing FANCD2 show increased sensitivity to colibactin12. Using a western blot, we detected an increase in abundance of FANCD2-Ub in HeLa cells in response to exposure to NC101, as well as in response to the DNA crosslinking agents mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (Fig. 5c). Treatment of cells with 1\u2009\u00b5M 3 prevented FANCD2 ubiquitination in cells exposed to colibactin but not MMC or cisplatin, indicating that 3 is specific to the colibactin biosynthetic pathway and does not inhibit the DNA damage response. Thus, compound 3 is not only an inhibitor of ClbP, but a potent and specific inhibitor of colibactin\u2019s genotoxicity.", "Compound 3 is a tool for natural product characterization", "Finally, we explored the generality of this approach for controlling biosynthetic pathways by inhibiting other prodrug-activating peptidases (Fig. 6). Because compounds 1\u20134 exploit ClbP\u2019s unusual N-acyl-d-asparagine recognition motif, we expected them to also inhibit ClbP\u2019s closest relatives which hydrolyze similar substrates. Although no ClbP homologs have been annotated outside of the pks gene cluster in organisms from the human gut microbiota, they are widely distributed in biosynthetic gene clusters from environmental bacteria38. As genetic deletion of clbP causes an accumulation of upstream biosynthetic intermediates and shunt products, characterization of which was key to the structural elucidation of colibactin6\u20138, we reasoned that 3 could be used in a similar fashion to identify other natural products biosynthesized using an N-acyl-d-asparagine-mediated prodrug activation step. This could accelerate the discovery and structural characterization of such targets without the need to develop new genetic tools in each host organism which encodes a ClbP homolog.Fig. 6Compound 3 can be used to manipulate other natural product biosynthesis pathways.a,c, Comparative metabolomic analysis of culture supernatants of (a) B. cereus UW85 and (c) B. formosus ATCC 51669 treated with inhibitor 3 versus untreated.

Though zwittermicin biosynthesis was the first pathway proposed to use this type of prodrug mechanism, the precursor prezwittermicin has not yet been identified. As expected, 1\u20134 inhibit purified ZmaM with similar potency to ClbP in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 8). We compared the metabolite profiles of untreated cultures of the zwittermicin producer Bacillus cereus UW85 and cultures exposed to 3 using LC\u2013MS. Treatment with 3 caused an accumulation of a species whose mass is consistent with the proposed structure of prezwittermicin (observed 693.4136, theoretical 693.4141 [M+H] m/z, Fig. 6a). In addition, masses consistent with both free zwittermicin (observed 397.2046, theoretical 397.2041 [M+H] m/z) and a free N-lauroyl-d-asparagine (observed 315.2279, theoretical 315.2278 [M+H] m/z) were depleted in the treated cultures (Fig. 6a). MS/MS fragmentation patterns of these ions and their counterparts from cultures fed 13C4-asparagine support these structural assignments (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 9). The successful detection of prezwittermicin highlights the capabilities of an inhibitor-guided discovery approach.", "We then applied this strategy to study edeines, a family of natural products whose biosynthetic gene cluster encodes a ClbP homolog, but whose production has never been reported to involve a prodrug resistance mechanism38,45. We treated the edeine producer Brevibacillus formosus ATCC 51669 with 3 and observed a depletion of several masses corresponding to edeines, as well as masses consistent with both N-lauroyl- and N-myristoyl-d-asparagine (Fig. 6b). There are currently four known members of the edeine family (A, B, D and F), each of which has two naturally occurring structural isomers (1 or 2)45. Focusing on edeine A, treatment with 3 resulted in accumulation of a mass consistent with a larger premetabolite incorporating the N-myristoyl-d-asparagine motif (observed 1155.5952, theoretical 1155.5940 [M+2K-H] m/z, Fig. 6b). Employing the same 13C4-asparagine labeling and MS/MS fragmentation strategy, we observed +4 m/z shifts in the mass corresponding to this putative premetabolite, as well as consistent with N-lauroyl- and N-myristoyl-d-asparagine (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9). Based on this, we propose that edeine biosynthesis uses a prodrug activation strategy and that the larger mass discovered after treatment with 3 represents a newly discovered \u2018preedeine\u2019. The greater number of metabolites that change in abundance after treatment with 3 in B. formosus compared with B. cereus likely reflects the known structural diversity of edeines. Further adding to this complexity, bioinformatic analyses reported in an accompanying paper identified a gene encoding a second ClbP homolog in B. formosus (locus tag BP422_09930 in the CP018145.1 genome), suggesting that it produces another family of uncharacterized natural products using a similar prodrug resistance strategy38. It is likely that some of the mass shifts that we observed can be attributed to this cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster. Together, these experiments demonstrate that compound 3 can be used as a tool to discover and study other natural products from diverse environmental microbes."]
