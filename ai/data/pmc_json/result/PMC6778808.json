["Results", "Different levels of uninduced aod-1 mRNA in different strains", "We will use the terms \u201cinducing conditions\u201d or \u201cinduced\u201d to refer to the growth of cells in the presence of Cm (+Cm). Growth in Cm gives rise to elevated aod-1 mRNA levels and results in the production of AOD1 protein in wild type cells. Growth in the absence of Cm (-Cm) or other inducers of aod-1, will be referred to as \u201cnon-inducing conditions\u201d or \u201cuninduced\u201d. We previously reported (Descheneau et al. 2005) that a tyrosinase gene (gene symbol T, mutant allele T-, wild type allele T+) mutant strain named T1P11 (Fuentes et al. 1994) and a derivative reporter strain (T11-76), made by transformation of T1P11 with a reporter construct, had high levels of aod-1 transcript following growth in non-inducing conditions compared to standard wild-type lab strains. Despite the presence of this mRNA, no AOD1 protein was detected in the mitochondria of T11-76 under non-inducing conditions. These observations raised two questions. Why were relatively high levels of aod-1 mRNA produced in the absence of inducing conditions in this strain and; why was no AOD1 protein observed in the strain as a result of the high levels of mRNA?", "Previously, analysis of a cross between T1P11 and a strain (NCN233) with a wild type tyrosinase gene, and the typically low levels of uninduced aod-1 mRNA, showed that the high uninduced aod-1 transcript levels in T1P11 did not segregate with the mutant allele of the tyrosinase gene (Descheneau et al. 2005). However, following this previous analysis, the progeny of this original cross were lost. To verify the previous data, and to generate strains for further analysis, we repeated the cross and analyzed 11 progeny strains. The presence of the T- or T+ allele was evaluated in the progeny by PCR amplification and sequencing of the region of the T gene known to contain mutations induced by repeat induced point mutation (Selker 1990) in the T- allele (Descheneau et al. 2005). Progeny strains (referred to by their isolation numbers) 3, 4, 19, 34, and 36 were wild-type (T+) for the tyrosinase gene, while strains 6, 9, 16, 23, 26, and 33 carried the mutated (T-) allele of the tyrosinase gene (Table 1).", "We then determined the levels of aod-1 mRNA present in the parental and progeny strains by qPCR. As shown in Figure 1A, the control strain contained roughly ten-fold the amount of aod-1 mRNA when grown in inducing conditions (+Cm) relative to non-inducing (-Cm) conditions. However, uninduced cultures of strain T1P11 contained levels of mRNA approaching the induced level in control cells. Furthermore, induced T1P11 cultures had about three times more aod-1 mRNA than induced control cells. Examination of AOD1 protein levels in the parental strains confirmed that no AOD1 protein could be detected in uninduced T1P11, despite the high levels of aod-1 mRNA in these cells (Figure 1B). We also showed that the increased level of mRNA seen in induced T1P11 cells gave rise to more AOD1 protein than found in induced control cells (Figure 1B). For the progeny strains there was a range of uninduced mRNA expression levels. We arbitrarily defined progeny that had greater than 3.5 times the level of aod-1 mRNA present in uninduced control cells as having \u201chigh\u201d expression (progeny strains 9, 16, 19, 23 and 26), while progeny with below 3.5 times the level of uninduced control cell mRNA were designated as having \u201clow\u201d expression (progeny strains 3, 4, 6, 33, 34, 36). With respect to the traits of tyrosinase (T+or T-) and aod-1 mRNA levels (high or low), the cross yielded four parental, high aod-1 mRNA, T- progeny (9, 16, 23 and 26) and four parental, low aod-1 mRNA T+ progeny (3, 4, 34, and 36). However, recombinant types were also recovered. Strain 19, which is T+, had elevated levels of aod-1 transcript, while strains 6 and 33, which are T-, had low levels of aod-1 transcript (Figure 1, Table 1). These data agree with the previous conclusion that the state of the tyrosinase gene is not responsible for the uninduced high level of expression of aod-1 that is observed in some strains (Descheneau et al. 2005). In addition, although the number of progeny analyzed was low, the finding that six progeny had low levels of aod-1 transcripts, while five had high levels, suggested that the expression level phenotype is determined by a single gene. However, given the arbitrary designation of high and low expression, and the low number of progeny examined, we cannot exclude the possibility that more than one gene may contribute to uninduced aod-1 expression.", "Figure 1aod-1 transcript levels in the standard laboratory strain NCN233 as a control (ct), T1P11, and progeny from a cross of the two strains indicated by the strain isolation number (Table 1).

Antibody to mitochondrial HSP70 was used as a loading control.", "Identifying the gene responsible for high uninduced aod-1 mRNA expression", "The most obvious explanations for the production of aod-1 mRNA in strain T1P11 in non-inducing conditions would include a mutation in the aod-1 promoter that allows it to be transcribed in the absence of an inducing signal, or a mutation in either the aod-2 or aod-5 genes that would make these known transcription factors for aod-1 constitutively active. Since the transcription factors are considered to be constitutively bound to the promoter of the genes they regulate (Qi et al. 2017) a change in the amino acid sequence of AOD2 or AOD5 could be responsible for the production of aod-1 mRNA seen in T1P11. In this regard, it should be noted that mutations affecting the RSE2 and RSE3 proteins of the fungus Podospora anserina (the orthologs of N. crassa\u2019s AOD2 and AOD5, respectively), which result in higher levels of P. anserina alternative oxidase transcripts in non-inducing conditions, have been identified (Sellem et al. 2009).", "To address these possibilities, we sequenced the promoter region of aod-1, and the genes for the transcription factors aod-2 and aod-5 in strain T1P11. The sequences obtained completely matched those of the reference sequence with one exception. There was a single transition (T to C) in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of aod-5. The change occurs at position -815 relative to the A of the ATG start codon taken as position +1. It seems very unlikely that a change in the 5\u2032UTR of aod-5 could cause the protein to become constitutively active. Thus, it appears that there are no relevant changes in the T1P11 sequence at the aod-1, aod-2 or aod-5 loci that would account for the observed increase in transcripts.", "Whole genome sequencing of high and low aod-1 transcript expressing strains", "In an attempt to identify other genes that might be responsible for the upregulation of aod-1 transcripts in non-inducing conditions, genomic DNA was extracted from several progeny and the parental strains of the NCN233 x T1P11 cross. Strains 3, 4, and 6, were chosen as low expressing progeny while 19, 23, and 26 were chosen as high expressing (Figure 1, Table 1). The sequenced DNAs were mounted in g-browse (http://ascobase.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/ncrassa_public/) and a \u201c.vcf\u201d file was generated containing the data for all strains. This file was exported to Microsoft Excel, and analyzed (see Materials and Methods) to find changes common to the high expressing strains that were not present in the low expressing strains.", "A large number of changes among the high expressing strains were identified when the whole genome sequences were considered (Table 2). We then examined the Excel sequence files for all differences within exons of protein coding regions of genes in the high expressing strains (T1P11, 19, 23, and 26) relative to the OR74A assembly 10 reference sequence transcript annotations. Only those changes that were not present in any low expressing strains were considered further (Table 2). These comparisons revealed 123 protein coding genes that were changed in T1P11, 105 genes in strain 19, 151 genes in strain 23, and 48 genes in strain 26. The genes in these four strains were then compared using a Venn diagram (Oliveros 2007-2015) to identify any changes common to all four strains (Figure 2). This analysis revealed mutations in two candidate genes, kin-9 (NCU05180) and flbA (NCU08319).

All four changes were present in the kin-9 allele of the T1P11 parental strain of the cross and the progeny that inherited that allele. Three of these were single nucleotide G to A changes in the 3\u2032UTR. The fourth was also a G to A transition that occurred in the coding region of exon 3 or 4, depending on the splice variant considered. The latter transition would result in an amino acid change from aspartic acid to asparagine at residue 740 of the 743 residue protein, or 906 of the 909 residue protein, depending on the splice variant. The amino acid sequences of kin-9 orthologs from five fungal species in the phylum Ascomycota were aligned. The Asp residue was conserved in species more closely related to N. crassa such as Magnaporthe oryzae, and Aspergillus nidulans, but was not conserved in the more distant species Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Yarrowia lipolytica (Figure S2). AmiGO2 gene ontology bioinformatics analysis (Ruepp et al. 2004) revealed that the gene product of kin-9 is most likely involved with the cytoskeleton and is predicted to be associated with microtubules and vesicle mediated transport. Examining the NCU05180 predicted protein sequence using the Interpro protein sequence analysis and classification tool (McWilliam et al. 2013) revealed a conserved kinesin motor domain that was present in all five of the compared species (Figure S2). Given the predicted role for the NCU05180 protein, the fact that the amino acid change observed in NCU05180 of the aod-1 high expressing strains is relatively conservative, and that the change does not occur in the functional domain identified in the protein, it seemed unlikely that this mutation would have an effect on aod-1 transcript levels. This was confirmed by qPCR analysis of strains carrying a deletion of the kin-9 gene found in the N. crassa knockout library (Colot et al. 2006). No significant difference in aod-1 mRNA levels was seen in the strains compared to the control (Figure 4A).", "Figure 3Location of mutations in kin-9 (NCU05180) and flbA (NCU08319) in strains T1P11, 19, 23 and 26.

FlbA is an RGS protein that interacts with the G\u03b1 protein of heterotrimeric G proteins. G protein signaling is known to play a role in a number of cellular processes in a large number of organisms (Neves et al. 2002; Li et al. 2007; Syrovatkina et al. 2016; Pandey and Vijayakumar 2018). Briefly, the typical signaling cascade consists of a heterotrimeric G protein complex that contains G\u03b1, G\u03b2, and G\u03b3 subunits, which exists in an inactive state associated with a GPCR (G protein coupled receptor) that is localized to the cell membrane. In this inactive state, GDP is bound to the G\u03b1 subunit. Upon interaction of the GPCR with an extracellular ligand, GDP is exchanged for GTP on the G\u03b1 subunit. This results in the dissociation of the heterotrimer from the GPCR and the further dissociation of G\u03b1 from G\u03b2G\u03b3. In their dissociated forms, both G\u03b1 and G\u03b2G\u03b3, are able to regulate downstream effectors. Eventually, a GTPase activity carried on the G\u03b1 subunit converts the bound GTP to GDP and restores G\u03b1 to its inactive form, which also enables rebinding and inactivation of G\u03b2G\u03b3. RGS proteins interact with the G\u03b1 subunit and accelerate its native GTPase activity, thus reducing the time that G protein signaling would be active. Both the N. crassa and A. nidulans FLBA proteins contain an RGS domain as well as two DEP (disheveled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domains (Figure S3) (Wang et al. 2013). The RGS domain is required for interaction with G\u03b1 proteins (Ross and Wilkie 2000; Siderovski and Willard 2005; Soundararajan et al. 2008; Kosloff et al. 2011). DEP domains have been shown to promote association of proteins with the cell membrane, but may also promote association with specific GPCRs so that a given RGS protein might be localized to sites that contain its substrate G\u03b1 protein (Ballon et al. 2006; Chen and Hamm 2006; Consonni et al. 2014).", "The change in common to the four overexpressing strains in the flbA gene was a single C-G base pair deletion in exon 2 (codon 320) or exon 3 (codon 336), depending on the splice variant of the gene (Figure 3B). None of the strains expressing low levels of aod-1 transcript contained the mutation. The deletion would result in a frameshift in the coding sequence leading to the creation of a stop codon and truncation of the encoded protein from 766 amino acids to 375 amino acids for splice variant 1, or 750 amino acids to 359 amino acids for variant 2. This mutation would have a drastic effect on the function of the protein given that both the RGS and DEP domains would be lost (Figure S3). Since the normal function of RGS proteins is to accelerate the GTPase activity found in the G\u03b1 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, inactivation of the RGS protein would result in prolonged activity of the active GTP bound form of G\u03b1.", "Data supporting the effect of the flbA mutation on aod-1 transcript levels", "The Neurospora genome project (Colot et al. 2006) has reported an abnormal morphology at the edge of the mycelium of flbA deletion strains growing on plates at 37\u00b0 (http://fungidb.org/fungidb/). Under these conditions of growth, we found that the growing mycelium of the strains expressing low levels of aod-1 transcript had a diffuse and uneven edge, while the high expressing flbA mutant strains had a compact and even edge, that was similar to that of the deletion strains (Figure S4).", "Various studies have been conducted on flbA mutants of Aspergillus species. Directly relevant to our study is a result from a microarray analysis on an A. niger \u0394flbA strain which found that one of the top 50 upregulated genes in the \u0394flbA background was the A. niger AOX-encoding gene, aox1 (Krijgsheld and W\u00f6sten 2013). This observation supports the hypothesis that the frameshift mutation found in the flbA gene in the high aod-1 expressing strains of N. crassa is responsible for the upregulation. To further test this hypothesis, we examined strains lacking the flbA gene from the N. crassa single gene deletion library (FGSC strains 12372 and 12373, Table 1) for levels of aod-1 transcript in non-inducing conditions and found elevated aod-1 transcript levels as observed in T1P11 (Figure 4B). Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that loss of function of the flbA gene is responsible for the high uninduced levels of aod-1 mRNA in strain T1P11 and other high expressing strains.", "The results described above suggested that loss of the RGS protein encoded by the flbA gene resulted in a G\u03b1 protein that is active for a longer time, which would further lead to an increase in aod-1 transcripts. Thus, it would be predicted that loss of the G\u03b1 protein controlled by the FLBA protein should lead to a reduction of aod-1 expression. In A. nidulans, the FlbA protein interacts with the G\u03b1 protein FadA (Yu et al. 1996; Yu et al. 1999). The Neurospora ortholog of FadA is a class I fungal G\u03b1 protein called GNA1 (NCU06493) that is most closely related to the G\u03b1i family in mammals (Turner and Borkovich 1993; Ivey et al. 1996; B\u00f6lker 1998; Li et al. 2007). GNA1 is known to be involved in various aspects of growth and development in N. crassa (Kays and Borkovich 2004; Li et al. 2007). Interestingly, we previously identified the gna-1 deletion strain in the N. crassa single gene deletion library, as having a slight deficiency of the AOD1 protein when grown in the presence of Cm (inducing conditions) (Nargang et al. 2012). To determine if levels of aod-1 mRNA were also reduced in the \u0394gna-1 strain, we performed qPCR analysis following growth in both inducing and non-inducing conditions. A reduction in aod-1 mRNA levels of about three fold was seen in the \u0394gna-1 strain grown under inducing conditions (+Cm) relative to the control (Figure 5), supporting the predicted role of the protein based on the effects seen in the flbA mutants. However, no significant reduction in aod-1transcript levels was detected in uninduced cultures (Figure 5). Thus, it seems likely that in the absence of an inducing signal, the presence or absence of GNA1 has little effect on aod-1 transcription.", "Figure 5Levels of aod-1 mRNA in the \u0394gna-1 strain (FGSC #12370).

This result raised a question about our earlier observation that strains with high levels of aod-1 mRNA contained no AOD1 protein (Descheneau et al. 2005). That is, it was possible that protein levels in previous studies had been measured in cultures that may have contained, by chance, the lower levels of mRNA that sometimes occurs in these strains. To address this question, we grew several separate uninduced cultures of the high expressing strain 23 and isolated both RNA, for determination of aod-1 mRNA levels; and mitochondria, for determination of AOD1 protein levels, from each culture. The proteins of mitochondria isolated from four of the cultures with very high aod-1 mRNA levels (strain 23 cultures A, B, C, and D, Figure 6A), were examined on western blots for the presence of the AOD1 protein (Figure 6A). As seen in our previous results, the mitochondria from three of these cultures contained no detectable AOD1 protein, despite having levels of aod-1 mRNA higher than in induced wild type cells (compare Figure 6A and Figure 1). However, strain 23 culture A was found to contain detectable levels of AOD1 protein, though at lower levels than induced control cells (Figure 6B). Of the four strain 23 cultures examined, culture A contained the highest level of aod-1 mRNA.

An undiluted sample of uninduced (-Cm) NCN233 mitochondria containing 30 \u03bcg mitochondrial protein was included as a control.", "To estimate the level of AOD1 protein found in strain 23 culture A, relative to the amount present in an induced wild type control, twofold serial dilutions of mitochondria isolated from a +Cm induced culture of the control NCN233 strain were electrophoresed on a gel that also contained a mitochondrial sample from culture A of strain 23. The gel was then examined by western blot using antibody to the AOD1 protein. Comparison of the band intensities revealed that the protein abundance for replicate A grown in the absence of Cm was approximately fourfold less than the protein amount of NCN233 grown in the presence of Cm (Figure 6C). However, the amount of aod-1 transcript in NCN233 +Cm cultures was typically about 10-fold more than in uninduced NCN233 cultures (Figure 1), while the strain 23 replicate A had 100 times as much transcript as uninduced NCN233 (Figure 6A). Based on these numbers for the transcripts it would be predicted that replicate A would have approximately 10-fold more AOD1 protein than induced NCN233 rather than fourfold less. This finding, coupled with the observation that most uninduced cultures with high levels of aod-1 mRNA have no detectable AOD1 protein, strongly supports the hypothesis that a mechanism of post-transcriptional control, most likely at the level of translation, exists for aod-1 mRNA in non-induced cultures."]
