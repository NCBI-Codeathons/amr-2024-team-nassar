["RESULTS", "CPT resistant mutant Top1 are defective in nucleolar delocalization", "To investigate the impact of CPT on the nuclear dynamics of human Top1 (see the domain structure, Figure 1A) in live cells, we ectopically expressed wild-type (WT) EGFP-tagged nuclear Top1 (EGFP\u2013Top1WT) and its mutant variants such as catalytically inactive mutant (EGFP\u2013Top1Y723F), CPT-resistant mutant (EGFP\u2013Top1N722S) in the C-terminal domain and N-terminal mutant (EGFP\u2013Top1W205G) in HCT116 cells. We confirmed the expression of all the chimeric EGFP\u2013Top1 variants by western blotting using anti-GFP antibody (Figure 1B). Top1 specific antibodies (Figure 1C), detect EGFP\u2013Top1 variants as an additional band of slower migration (117 kDa) and with similar intensity as compared with endogenous Top1 (91 kDa), suggesting that the ectopic Top1 variants were not over expressed. Cells transfected with EGFP empty vector failed to show the additional band (Figure 1C, lane 5).", "We confirmed the colocalization of the ectopic EGFP\u2013Top1 with the nucleoli by double-immunostaining with an antibody specific against nucleolin (17,18,24). Figure 1D shows that in absence of CPT, EGFP\u2013Top1WT was predominantly confined to the nucleolus, while CPT treatment markedly accumulate Top1 in the nucleoplasm (Figure 1D, panel CPT). Next, we followed the subnuclear distribution of the ectopic EGFP\u2013Top1 variants using live cell confocal microscopy. CPT treatment delocalized Top1 (EGFP\u2013Top1WT) from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in 85\u201390% of cells (Figure 1E, panel EGFP\u2013Top1WT + CPT, see the quantification in Figure 1F), which is consistent with the earlier reports (18,23,24,56). Interestingly, under similar conditions, CPT failed to delocalize EGFP\u2013Top1Y723F in 65\u201375% of cells (Figure 1E, panel EGFP\u2013Top1Y723F + CPT, and the quantification in Figure 1F) and EGFP\u2013Top1N722S in 70\u201385% of cells from the nucleoli to nucleoplasm (Figure 1E, panel EGFP\u2013Top1N722S\n+ CPT, and the quantification in Figure 1F). However, EGFP\u2013Top1W205G showed CPT-induced partial re-distribution in the nucleoplasm (Figure 1E, panel EGFP\u2013Top1W205G+ CPT, see the quantification in Figure 1F), suggesting that Top1 subnuclear rearrangements depend on CPT-sensitive Top1 activity.", "To elucidate the mechanistic link between nuclear dynamics, catalytic activity and CPT sensitivity of Top1 variants, we tested them in plasmid DNA relaxation assays (53\u201355). We IP ectopic EGFP\u2013Top1 and its mutants using anti-GFP antibody (Figure 2A) and the immune complexes were used as source of Top1 (EGFP\u2013Top1WT, EGFP\u2013Top1Y723F, EGFP\u2013Top1N722S or EGFP\u2013Top1W205G) for the time course DNA relaxation experiments (Figure 2B\u2013F) in the presence or absence of CPT. As expected, no plasmid relaxation activity was observed with the IgG-control beads (Figure 2B) or catalytically inactive Top1 (EGFP\u2013Top1Y723F) (Figure 2D). In the absence of CPT, EGFP\u2013Top1WT relaxes supercoiled DNA at a similar rate as that of EGFP\u2013Top1N722S and EGFP\u2013Top1W205G (Figure 2C, E and\u00a0F, panel (\u2212) CPT). Under similar condition, the rate of plasmid DNA relaxation by EGFP\u2013Top1WT was inhibited by CPT in a time dependent manner (see Figure 2C, panel (+) CPT and quantification in Figure 2G), whereas the drug has a reduced effect (\u223c2-fold) on the rate of relaxation by EGFP\u2013Top1W205G (compare CPT-induced DNA relaxation inhibition (%) by WT versus W205G with time in Figure 2G), which may account for the abrogation of CPT-induced nucleolar delocalization in live cell microscopy (Figure 1E, panel CPT + EGFP\u2013Top1W205G). Under similar conditions CPT failed to inhibit the DNA relaxation activity by EGFP\u2013Top1N722S (Figure 2E and\u00a0G). We therefore conclude that the molecular interactions of CPT with Top1\u2013DNA cleavage complexes (Top1cc) drive or limit the mobility of Top1 in the nuclear compartments.", "Figure 2.Effect of CPT on the plasmid DNA relaxation activity of EGFP\u2013Top1 variants.

Quantification are based on mean FRAP data (n = 15).", "In absence of CPT, the FRAP recovery curves revealed two populations of EGFP\u2013Top1WT: a mobile population representing \u223c80\u201385% of the total and a smaller (\u223c15\u201320%) immobile population (see Figure 3B, and the quantification in 3C; No CPT), indicating that Top1 is mobile in the nucleus under steady state and were exchanged promptly between nuclear compartments. However, EGFP\u2013Top1 shows slower recovery than EGFP alone (Supplementary Figure S1A, showing free diffusion of EGFP), suggesting that the Top1 is not freely diffusible. During DNA relaxation, Top1 binds DNA non-covalently followed by transient covalent binding (reversible Top1cc; Figure 3A) and finally religation of the DNA strand and release of the enzyme (2,13), which plausibly contributes to the (\u223c15\u201320%) immobile Top1 population in the FRAP recovery curves (Figure 3B). However in the presence of CPT (1 \u03bcM), Top1 is covalently trapped on the DNA (Figure 3A; CPT), which significantly blocks FRAP recovery by increasing \u223c35\u201340% of Top1 immobile population in the nucleoplasm (Figure 3B, and the quantification in 3C; (+) CPT) as well as in the nucleolus (Supplementary Figure S1B). Fluorescence recovery of Top1 was further retarded by \u223c40\u201355% with increasing dose of CPT (Figure 3B and\u00a0C). The dissociation timescale of covalently bound complexes (irreversible Top1cc) in the presence of CPT are normally high and does not contribute to the FRAP recovery process. Therefore, we assume that CPT-induced immobile/bound fraction is exclusively due to the formation of Top1cc in the live cell nucleus (Figure 3A; CPT).", "To further test this possibility, we performed the fluorescence recovery of Top1 inactive mutant (EGFP\u2013Top1Y723F), which shows no significant variation in the mobile fraction of Top1Y723F either in the presence or absence of CPT (Supplementary Figure S1C, and the quantification in supplementary Figure 1D).", "Next, kinetic modelling was applied to fit the complete set of Top1\u2013FRAP data that best approximate the experimental dynamics (Supplementary Figures S2 and 3) and this yields an estimated CPT-induced bound/immobile fraction, mobile fraction and the diffusion rate of Top1. The diffusion coefficient for all the Top1 variants were comparable, suggesting no gross change in the diffusion rate of Top1 due to its point mutations (Table 1). However, we observed a marked accumulation (\u223c2-fold increase) of CPT-induced in vivo Top1cc (Table 1, WT), absent in the inactive mutant Top1Y723F (Table 1, Y723F), which is in agreement with the CPT mediated inhibition of the in vitro plasmid DNA relaxation activity (Figure 2C, panel WT (+) CPT). Together these results provide evidence that CPT impairs Top1 mobility and induce Top1cc (Figure 3) in the nucleus.", "Top1-mutants (W205G and N722S) abrogate CPT-induced Top1 immobile fraction", "Because Top1-mutants (N722S and W205G) were completely or partially resistant to CPT in the plasmid DNA relaxation assays (see Figure 2E and\u00a0F, panel (+) CPT), we further investigated the FRAP kinetics of both EGFP\u2013Top1N722S and EGFP\u2013Top1W205G in the live cell's nucleus. As expected, we observed no significant variation in the fluorescence recovery of EGFP\u2013Top1N722S in the presence or absence of CPT (Figure 4A and\u00a0B). This is in complete agreement with the estimated bound fraction of Top1N722S in the presence or absence of CPT (Table 1, N722S; fittings of the FRAP data shown in Supplementary Figure S4), and accounts for resistance to CPT-induced dynamic mobility of Top1N722S in the nuclear compartments (Figure 1E and\u00a0F).", "Figure 4.Top1 W205 and N722 residues are critical for CPT-induced nuclear dynamics.

Top1 dynamics was determined under conditions that blocked cellular PAR formation (31,32). Figure 5A shows that in absence of ABT-888, EGFP\u2013Top1WT was predominantly confined to the nucleolus as shown in Figure 1D.

To further examine these possibilities, we co-IP ectopic EGFP\u2013Top1 variants in cells treated with CPT. PARP1 was readily detected in all the immunoprecipitates independent of Top1 mutations (Figure 5C). Under these conditions, PAR signal was observed with a prominent band of \u223c120 kDa, consistent with PARylation of ectopic EGFP\u2013Top1 (Figure 5C). However, under similar conditions we detected limited PAR signal in the co-immunoprecipitates of EGFP\u2013Top1N722S (Figure 5C, top panel, fifth lane) compared to other Top1 variants (Top1WT or Top1W205G) as measured by western blotting. Therefore, the attenuation in the subnuclear rearrangement of the Top1N722S mutant in response to CPT + ABT-888 is not due to its inability to form PARP1\u2013Top1 complexes but due to its deficiency in accumulation of PAR polymers (Figure 5C, N722S), which is in agreement with the decreased PAR signal on the catalytically inactive Top1 (Top1Y723F) (Figure 5C, top panel, third lane). Taken together, these results suggest that PAR polymers regulate Top1 dynamics in the nucleus.", "PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) enhance CPT-induced Top1 trapping on the DNA", "Because PARP inhibitors (ABT-888) efflux Top1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A), we investigated the potential involvement of PAR polymers on Top1 trapping on DNA using FRAP experiments in cells treated with PARP inhibitors and/or in combination with CPT (Figure 6). FRAP kinetics of EGFP\u2013Top1WT in the presence of ABT-888 (Figure 6A and\u00a0B) was determined under conditions that blocked cellular PAR formation (31,32). In the presence of ABT-888, Top1 shows faster rate of fluorescence recovery similar to untreated condition (70\u201380%) at early times (30 s), however between 50 and 90 s we observed small but significant reduction (\u223c5\u20138%) in the ABT-888 induced mobile population of Top1 (Figure 6B). The impact was more dramatic with combination of CPT + ABT-888 compared to CPT alone (Figure 6A and\u00a0B) as evidenced by marked reduction (25\u201330%) in the mobile fraction of EGFP\u2013Top1WT (Figure 6C). FRAP kinetic modelling shows CPT + ABT-888 markedly increased (\u223c2-fold) the bound/immobile fraction of Top1 (Top1cc) compared to CPT alone (fittings of FRAP data are shown in Supplementary Figure S2 and estimated values are shown in Table 1; WT).", "Figure 6.PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) promotes CPT-induced prolong Top1 trapping across nuclear genome.

Consistent with the resistance of EGFP\u2013Top1W205G to form CPT-induced Top1\u2013DNA covalent complexes in the plasmid relaxation assays (Figure 2F) and FRAP kinetic modelling (Supplementary Figure S5 and estimated values are shown in Table 1; W205G), ABT-888 failed to markedly increase the CPT-induced bound/immobile fraction of EGFP\u2013Top1W205G in FRAP recoveries (Figure 6C). Taken together, these results indicate that PAR polymers indeed counteract CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc in the live cell nucleus."]
