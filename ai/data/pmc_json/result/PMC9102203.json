["3. Results and Discussion", "3.1. Biofilm Formation on the EC Nanofiber Mat", "Cell growth and attachment are influenced by both the roughness as well as the hydrophobicity of a scaffold\u2019s surface. For instance, Valamehr et al. reported that stem cells were more likely to proliferate and differentiate on hydrophobic surfaces [16], with hydrophobic interactions regarded as the dominant factor determining the magnitude of cell-surface adhesion [17]. In addition, it was found that a greater surface roughness promoted bacterial attachment by increasing the area of contact between the cells and the material surface [18], with the maximum reduction of bacterial adhesion on abutment surface occurring at a roughness of 0.2 \u03bcm [19]. Therefore, an average roughness above 0.2 \u03bcm is assumed to be favorable for biofilm formation. As far as the EC nanofiber mat prepared in this study was concerned, Figure 1a,b shows that the water contact angle and average roughness were 136\u00b0 and 20 \u03bcm, respectively, thereby indicating its suitability for biofilm formation. Thus, it was used as a scaffold for biofilm formation by L. plantarum GIM1.648. After cultivation for 24 h, SEM was performed to observe the biofilm formed on the nanofibers. Compared with the control (Figure 1c), a high density of cells was found to be attached to the microfibers used as a scaffold (Figure 1d). In addition, a number of channels were present in the biofilm. These results, therefore, indicated that the nanofiber mat was an excellent scaffold material for biofilm formation by probiotics.", "3.2. Effects of Media on Biofilm Formation", "MRS medium is often used for the isolation and culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), but modified trypticase soy broth (mTSB) has been reported as an optimal medium for its biofilm formation, despite its lack of salts and a lower concentration of carbon. Therefore, the ability of L. plantarum GIM1.648 to produce biofilms in the two media were compared under the same conditions (Figure 2). Overall, it was found that biofilm formation was less pronounced in mTSB medium compared to MRS (p < 0.05). Some authors reported that a lack of nutrients can increase the bacterial transition from a planktonic to a sessile mode [14]. The results obtained in this study seemed to disagree with this general behavior, since the number of sessile cells in the biofilm was greater in MRS medium. This could probably be attributed to differences between lactic acid bacteria strains.", "The nonionic surfactant Tween 80, as a component of the MRS medium, was previously reported to influence biofilm formation in some LAB, with MRS medium without the surfactant being more favorable for biofilm formation [20]. Hence, the capacity of L. plantarum GIM1.648 to form biofilms in the presence or absence of Tween 80 was compared. The results, presented in Figure 3, showed that biofilm formation was promoted in the absence of Tween 80 from MRS (p < 0.05). This observation was in agreement with the report by Terraf et al. [20]. The auto-aggregation (binding capability) level is an index used during the preliminary screening of bacterial capacity to produce biofilms. Ibarreche et al. [21] reported that a higher auto-aggregation level was achieved when MRS medium without Tween 80 was used, and this could have been due to the dispersing effects of Tween 80. Based on the above results, MRS medium without Tween 80 was selected for further experiments.", "3.3. Impact of Culture Conditions on the Formation of Biofilms", "Biofilm formation by L. plantarum GIM1.648 on the EC nanofiber mat was analyzed by CFU enumeration and SEM. As shown in Figure 4, culture time had an important impact on biofilm formation (p < 0.05), as the increasing length of incubation resulted in an increased number of sessile cells until a maximum was reached at 36 h. However, further increases in culture time decreased the number of sessile cells, with a decline of approximately 0.4 log CFU/g occurring after 60 h. This could have been because, as the culture time increased, not only were nutrients depleted, but the pH of the broth media also decreased, inhibiting bacterial growth. Furthermore, the limited spaces available on the porous nanofiber mats were being increasingly taken up by bacteria.", "SEM was further applied to visualize the biofilms. Figure 5 shows that after 8 h, L. plantarum GIM1.648 occurred either individually or in pairs and was thus considered to be in a planktonic growth mode. After 12 h, some aggregation could be observed as cells formed bridges across fibers and created colonies using the substrate as a scaffold. Larger aggregates were then generated at 24 h, with many cells growing into the pores of the nanofiber mat, although gaps between cell aggregates remained clear. At 36 h, the cells almost completely occupied the mat, which was consistent with the above results obtained for CFU enumeration.", "Temperature has a significant influence on the growth of bacteria as well as their ability to form biofilms. The effects of temperature on L. plantarum\u2019s GIM1.648 ability to form biofilms were as shown in Figure 6. In this case, it was clear that, as the temperature increased from 25 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C, the number of sessile cells increased, with the optimal temperature for biofilm formation by L. plantarum GIM1.648 being 30 \u00b0C. Further increases in temperature up to 37 \u00b0C were not favorable for biofilm formation, although the latter is considered to be optimal for the growth of L. plantarum GIM1.648. These results were consistent with those reported in other studies [22,23]. It was also reported that the ability of different L. rhamnosus strains to form biofilms increased at lower growth temperatures [22]. For microorganisms other than LAB (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), it was also found that the suboptimal growth temperature was more beneficial for biofilm formation [23]. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the expression level of genes related to biofilm formation is sensitive to the temperature [23]. In addition, bacterial biofilm is generally formed under stressful conditions [10].", "It has been reported that the biofilm formation of some lactic acid bacteria were enhanced in acidic media [24]. Thus, in this work, the effects of pH on biofilm formation by L. plantarum GIM1.648 were investigated. As shown in Figure 7, the selected strain could produce more biofilms with increasing pH. In this case, the number of sessile cells reached its maximum (11.34 log CFU/g) at pH 6.5, but this was in disagreement with the above-mentioned report [24]. In addition to differences in microbial strains, variations in experimental methods could account for the different results obtained in this study. Indeed, in the previous study, 96-well microtiter plates were used for biofilm formation, with the biofilms subsequently stained for quantification by spectrophotometry. On the other hand, this study used nanofiber mats as a scaffold for biofilm formation, and CFU enumeration was used to determine the number of sessile cells within the biofilms.", "The influence of inoculum concentration on biofilm formation by L. plantarum GIM1.648 was as shown in Figure 8. Overall, the highest number of sessile cells was obtained at an inoculum concentration of 1% (v/v), with higher or lower concentrations decreasing their numbers. This result was in agreement with Hu\u2019s report [7]. There was almost no statistically significant difference between 1% (v/v) and 2% (v/v) (p > 0.05). The possible reason may be that limited space in the fiber mat was remained for more cells to reside, as seen from Figure 5. Since inoculum 1% (v/v) was also suitable for the densest biofilm development, to save costs, it was used for further study. Altogether, based on the results, the optimal environmental conditions for biofilm formation by the selected strain was determined to be MRS medium without Tween 80, a culture time of 36 h, a culture temperature of 30 \u00b0C, pH 6.5, and an inoculum concentration of 1% (v/v).", "3.4. Sessile Cells\u2019 Survival against Environmental Stresses", "The suitability of probiotics is evaluated based on their ability to resist the damaging conditions of the GI tract [25]. Hence, in this study, the resistance of L. plantarum\u2019s GIM1.648 sessile cells during in vitro digestion was explored. As shown in Figure 9, up to 92% of the cells in biofilm survived 2 h of gastric digestion, while the corresponding value for planktonic cells was only 83%. After digestion in a simulated GI tract for 5 h, 82% of the sessile cells were still viable, with this value representing only a 1.58 log CFU/g loss in viability. This was a clear improvement of 43.9% compared to planktonic cells (82% vs. 57%), indicating that the sessile cells in biofilms had better tolerance to GI tract conditions. He et al. also reported that some lactic acid bacteria had the ability to resist acid stress and display improved survivability in the GI tract after forming biofilms in microcapsules [9]. Hence, the formation of a biofilm is helpful to enhance the resistance of probiotics against gastrointestinal digestion.", "It is crucial for probiotics to display heat resistance for their applications. In this study, the cells in planktonic and biofilm growth modes were treated at different temperatures in the range of 55\u201370 \u00b0C. As shown in Figure 10, treatments at 55 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C did not significantly influence the sessile cells\u2019 viability (p > 0.05), while that of planktonic cells decreased to approximately 87%. Above 60 \u00b0C, there was a sharp decrease in the viability of planktonic cells, with only 43% surviving at 70 \u00b0C. In contrast, the sessile cells in biofilms displayed good heat stability, as their viability could reach over 82%, even at 70 \u00b0C. Cheow et al. [26] previously reported the superiority of biofilm over the planktonic cells in surviving harsh environments. Our results, while being similar to their findings, suggested that biofilm formation can improve the thermotolerance of probiotics.", "3.5. luxS Expression", "The luxS gene was a critical gene in the biofilm development of probiotic strains [6,10], and it has been shown that deletion of the luxS gene causes L. rhamnosus GG to fail in biofilm formation [27]. Lebeer et al. found that changes in cultivation conditions, such as temperature and medium, upregulated the expression of the luxS gene, thus enhancing the formation of biofilms [28]. Likewise, when over-expressed, the gene caused Bifidobacterium longum NCC 2705 to produce more biofilms [29]. In order to further understand the relationship between luxS expression and biofilm formation for L. plantarum GIM1.648, RT-qPCR was used to investigate changes in the luxS expression of planktonic and sessile cells.", "As observed from Figure 11, the sessile cells in biofilms increased luxS expression, with the relative expression being 8.7-fold higher compared to planktonic ones. Previous reports found that the signal molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2)\u2019s synthesis was induced by luxS, and this could improve biofilm formation of lactic acid bacteria, including their ability to resist acids and bile salts [28,30]. These results clearly demonstrate that the luxS gene was involved in the biofilm formation by L. plantarum GIM1.648."]
