["RESULTS", "The supernatant of S. rapamycinicus is sufficient to induce yellow pigment and orsellinic acid production", "To better understand the interaction between A. nidulans and S. rapamycinicus, we set up an experimental system that allowed us to differentiate fungal hyphae directly interacting with S. rapamycinicus from non\u2010directly interacting fungal cells. This setup used fungal and bacterial cultures grown on solid surface in contrast to the previously applied conditions of co\u2010culturing them in liquid shake flasks. In the actual approach the fungal and the bacterial colonies were inoculated at opposing sides of a Petri dish that contained only agar without nutrients. To allow for some limited growth of the inoculated fungal and bacterial cells, the points of inoculation were supplied with nutrients. This set\u2010up produced a thin, low\u2010density fungal colony spreading out over the agar surface and this allowed us to easily observe colour or morphological changes of the colonies. Figure\u00a01(A) top shows an example of the experiment in which fungal inoculation points were fed with AMM and bacterial inoculation points with M79 media. Starting from these nutrient reservoirs at the opposite sides of the Petri dish the organisms were able to grow into the nutrient\u2010free agar. Using this setup, we observed that fungal mycelium spreading from the opposite side towards the bacterial colony was producing some YPs although there was no direct contact yet with the S. rapamycinicus colony [Figure\u00a01(A)]. No colour changes at the A. nidulans mycelia were observed in control experiments growing the fungal cells alone (data not shown). These observations indicated that YPKs and orsellinic acid may be produced by A. nidulans cells in response to the presence of S. rapamycinicus already before their physical contact takes place. To make sure there is no direct interaction via buried bacterial or fungal cell interactions we used a similar setup but containing S. rapamycinicus cells within a dialysis tube. The molecular weight cut off 8.000\u201310.000\u2009kDa allowed nutrients passing through the membrane at the point of inoculation but prevented bacterial cells to spread on or through the agar. We found also in this setup an induction of YPs [Figure\u00a01(B)]. We assume that the reduced induction in these experiments is likely caused by the dialysis tube barrier affecting free metabolite movements. To test if the signal for fungal pigment production requires actively growing bacterial cells or if a bacterial metabolite may be sufficient to induce YPs we subsequently applied sterile\u2010filtered culture supernatant from an S. rapamycinicus liquid culture grown in M79 media without A. nidulans. When adding these bacterial culture supernatants to an A. nidulans colony growing alone on the nutrient\u2010free agar we also observed YP production, although colouration was less intense [Figure\u00a01(C)]. Since in this latter approach S. rapamycinicus was grown \u2018solo\u2019 without A. nidulans, we could conclude that production of the YPs in A. nidulans is triggered by one or more compounds secreted by S. rapamycinicus cells growing in M79 medium and that the production of this inducer(s) does not depend on the presence of a competing or interacting organism. However, the presence of a competing organism like A. nidulans may cause elevated production of this unknown molecule(s).", "FIGURE 1(A) Top: Schematic setup; Aspergillus minimal medium (AMM) and M79 medium were placed into phosphate\u2010buffered water agar (green and blue circles, respectively).

The concentrations of ORS, as well as lecanoric acid (LEC), showed strong correlation with the absorption at 400\u2009nm that visually appears as yellow colour (Spearmen rho: 0.72 and 0.70 for ORS or LEC, respectively, with p\u2010values of 6.36E\u20107 or 1.52E\u20106, see also correlation plot in supplementary Figure\u00a0S2). These data indicated that our macroscopically observed YPs actually contain ORS and LEC. Additional fungal metabolites have been found in the analysed agar blocks (Figure\u00a0S1). Some of them are also found in higher quantities in the competition zone between fungal and bacterial colonies, but others are more abundant in blocks excised from regions outside of the competition zone.", "Interestingly, also S. rapamycinicus metabolites seem to be induced by the presence of the fungal mycelium, for example terragine is clearly more abundant in the competition zone between the two organisms than anywhere else in the agar of the Petri dish. On the other hand, production of the fungal diketopiperazines cyclo(l\u2010Pro\u2010l\u2010Tyr) and cyclo(l\u2010Pro\u2010l\u2010Val) are apparently repressed by the interaction and they show a comparatively lower abundance in this zone (see Figure\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1 with measurements for additional metabolites).", "Taken together, our experiments showed that an active communication based on secreted metabolites takes place between these two organisms and that the cellular responses do not depend on physical interaction among them. Different concentrations of specific SMs at different locations within the whole growth area moreover indicate that fungal and bacterial metabolites can be induced or repressed by the chemical signals generated by the cultures.", "The inducer of YPs comprising orsellinic and lecanoric acid is a guanidine\u2010containing polyhydroxyl macrolide", "To identify the metabolite(s) from S. rapamycinicus inducing YPs in A. nidulans we grew S. rapamycinicus in the absence of fungal cells \u2018solo\u2019 in M79 medium for 7\u2009days and used a sterile\u2010filtered culture supernatant for the development of an A. nidulans bioassay that would monitor YP induction. The fungal bioassay was based on miniature cultures in a 24\u2010well microtiter plate format where we grew A. nidulans colonies in submerged cultures and were able to use simple colour change of the medium as an indicator of YP production (see details in Experimental procedures). Using this assay we could confirm that the supernatant of S. rapamycinicus cultures was indeed inducing YP in A. nidulans and thus can be used for bioassay\u2010guided fractionation tests. Subsequently, several liquid\u2013liquid extraction methods (n\u2010Hexane, Dichlormethane, Acetonitrile) were tested and we found that the YP inducer always remained in the aqueous phase indicating that it is a polar substance that may be extractable with methanol. Finally, S. rapamycinicus was grown massively on M79 agar plates and the methanol extracts were then further fractionated successively using flash column chromatography and preparative HPLC. All fractions were then tested in the bioassay for YP\u2010inducing activity. Subsequent structural elucidation of the purified active fraction by HPLC\u2010MS/MS and NMR identified the guanidine\u2010containing polyhydroxyl macrolide polaramycin B as the YP, that is ORS and LEC inducing compound (Figure\u00a03).", "FIGURE 3Structure of Polaramycin B.

As polaramycin is similar to azalomycin, a well\u2010characterized guanidine\u2010containing macrolide, we assumed that similarity to the known azalomycin BGC would be indicative for a BGC potentially responsible for polaramycin production. Only in S. rapamycinicus and S. iraniensis a homology with the azalomycin F3a BGC from Streptomyces sp. 211726 (MIBiG accession: BGC0001523) could be detected (Figure\u00a04). To substantiate our hypothesis, we also cultivated isolates of four additional Streptomyces species under identical conditions as done before for S. rapamycinicus. Strikingly, only the two species S. rapamycinicus and S. iranensis, which contained the predicted gene cluster similar to the azalomycin cluster in their genomes, induced YP production. In contrast, the other four species not harbouring these BGCs showed no YPs (see Figure\u00a0S3). These findings suggest that the region showing homology to the azalomycin biosynthesis cluster is responsible for the production of polaramycin in S. rapamycinicus and S. iraniensis and thus for YP induction. The data pertaining to S. iranensis metabolites are published separately from this manuscript in the context of azalomycins distribution and putative functions in microbial interactions (pre\u2010print available at BioRxiv by Krespach et al., doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.09.491136).", "FIGURE 4Homology search (anti\u2010SMASH) in S. rapamycinicus, S. iraniensis, S. zaomyceticus, S. ederensis, S. lateritius and S. europaeiscabiei for putative secondary metabolite clusters.

In this former set\u2010up, the concentration necessary to trigger ORS induction may only have been reached when cells directly interacted with each other because this physical interaction prevented immediate diffusion of the inducer away from the fungal cell surface. We, therefore, tested YPs production and orsA gene expression in A. nidulans cultures treated with different concentrations of polaramycin B in our 24 well plate bioassay. We found that after 48\u2009h of incubation a concentration of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml polaramycin B in the A. nidulans growth medium is necessary to induce YPs as well as orsA transcription (Figure\u00a0S4). This concentration was then used in our genome\u2010wide transcriptional analysis aimed at determining whether polaramycin B treatment induced a similar genetic response as previously observed in the physical interaction and if other fungal SMs are also affected by the addition of polaramycin B treatment. Moreover, the identification of transcriptional network changes by the treatment is of interest to understand which fungal targets are affected by this compound.", "Polaramycin B induces the dba1\u2013dba2 gene cluster for ORS biosynthesis", "For RNA\u2010seq analysis, we used A. nidulans cultures pre\u2010grown for 18\u2009h in AMM shake cultures and subsequently added polaramycin B at a concentration of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. As the transcriptional network changes triggered by the substance may differ depending on the duration of treatment, we chose two different harvesting times. To test for the short\u2010term response, we harvested the mycelia after 30\u2009min of incubation and for the response to an extended treatment time the cultures were harvested after 3\u00a0h of incubation with polaramycin B. It needs to be mentioned that at this time point there is still 0.45%\u20130.5% glucose remaining in the AMM medium, a concentration that is known to repress starvation\u2010induced SMs, such as the production of sterigmatocystin. To control if under these conditions polaramycin B also induces YPs and ORS, we first tested the expression levels of orsA (AN7909), the polyketide synthase\u2010encoding gene. Using RT\u2010qPCR we could confirm the induction event (data not shown) and we thus used these samples for RNA sequencing via Illumina Hi\u2010Seq.", "In respect to the ORS gene cluster, our data analysis showed that the genes of the split dba1\u2013dba2 cluster are induced by polaramycin B treatment (Figure\u00a05). Moreover, the regulatory gene dbaA, which encodes the specific transcription factor of this BGC, and which resides within the dba1 cluster, is induced already after 30\u2009min. Consistent with DbaA being the cluster\u2010specific transcriptional activator protein, other genes within the dba1\u2013dba2 BGC were found to be induced after 3\u2009h post\u2010treatment. Interestingly, one gene of unknown function (AN7913, designated orsD) and located within the dba2 region also shows the same induction kinetics as the transcription factor (induction after 30\u2009min).

For example, a majority of genes in the terrequinone (Bouhired et al.,\u00a02007) or aspercryptin (Henke et al.,\u00a02016) BGCs are significantly upregulated. Some BGCs showed only partial activity, such as the asperfuranone or the AN10289 cluster (Klejnstrup et al.,\u00a02012), in which only roughly half of the predicted cluster genes are induced. Interestingly the penicillin cluster, whose three genes are already transcribed at intermediate levels in our overnight cultures, is significantly downregulated by polaramycin B treatment (see Table\u00a01). Thus, apart from the YPs and few other substances, the majority of BGCs do not show significant alterations in their expression profiles. This transcriptional response is similar to what has been also observed in the previous experiments in which A. nidulans cells experienced direct physical contact with S. rapamycinicus (Schroeckh et al.,\u00a02009).

The downregulation of these hydrolytic enzymes may be a result of the reduced growth probably to avoid self\u2010digestion or a reduced turnover of metabolites to not allow potential competitors to feed easily on such generated metabolites.", "Genes with a transient response to polaramycin treatment", "There are genes that have a strong short\u2010term response to the treatment with polaramycin B (measured after 30\u2009min of exposure) but this response is lost upon prolonged treatment with the drug (measured after 3\u00a0h of exposure) Gene set D1 holds 54 genes which are immediately upregulated by the presence of polaramycin B but no response is observed any more in the 3\u00a0h treatment cultures. No clear picture comes out from this gene set but two GPI\u2010anchored proteins (AN7792 a putative lysophospholipase A and AN8609), AN2798 (predicted role in response to stress and integral to membrane localization), AN0209 (mepB, high\u2010affinity ammonium transporter), AN4372 (pgaB, a protein with polygalacturonase activity) have been found in this gene set. This may hint towards a reaction on the membrane due to polaramycin B that is transient as the cell may be able to balance the membrane defects after the respective genes have been induced and new membrane components have been produced.", "Also, quite a significant number of genes were found to be transiently repressed by polaramycin B treatment. Ninety genes were found in this set of genes designated D2 (Figure\u00a06). Interestingly three genes associated with trehalose, an important storage carbohydrate in fungi, are in this gene set, AN9340 (treA), AN10533 and AN5523 (tpsA). Since trehalose plays also an important role in conidial stability, this may be a reflection of the dynamics following the immediate downregulation of carbohydrate metabolic processes (see gene set A2) post polaramycin B treatment."]
