["2. Results", "Figure 2 emphasizes the stark reduction in the antibiotic discovery rate after the \u201cGolden Age\u201d, the most prolific period of antibiotic research [11,12]. In fact, the rate of discovery is now at its lowest since the first antibiotic, arsphenamine, was discovered in 1909. The Golden Age is usually roughly defined as 1940\u20131960, beginning with the discovery of streptomycin [8]. Extending the linear part of the sigmoidal discovery curve in Figure 1 allows us to better define the Golden Age as 1943\u20131962, when streptomycin and the quinolones were discovered, respectively. A 2011 review in Clinical Microbiology Reviews defined the \u201cdiscovery void\u201d, during which no new antibiotic classes have been discovered, as starting from 1987, and several sources have repeated this claim [5,13,14,15]. However, the diarylquinolines were FDA-approved the year after this review, and thus this definition requires revision [16].", "Figure 3 shows the discovery, first clinical use, and resistance dates for the 38 antibiotic classes. From these dates, we can define two periods of time:The development window: how long after its discovery the antibiotic was first used in the clinic.The resistance window: how long after its first use clinical resistance was reported.", "The development window: how long after its discovery the antibiotic was first used in the clinic.", "The resistance window: how long after its first use clinical resistance was reported.", "There are some obvious outliers in this analysis. The antibiotics with long development windows were either technically challenging to optimize or shelved because they were not considered to be promising drugs until the antibiotic resistance crisis worsened [17,18,19,20]. Five new antibiotic classes have been approved for human use by the FDA in this century: oxazolidinones (2000), lipopeptides (2003), pleuromutilins (2007), diarylquinolones (2007), and lipiarmycins (2011). Three of these were abandoned early in their development because of adverse side effects [16,17,21]. The diarylquinolones carry a black box warning\u2014the strongest warning that the FDA requires\u2014because of their significant life-threatening side effects [16]. The lipiarmycins and pleuromutilins were first approved for human use long after their discovery: 36 and 56 years, respectively [17,22].", "More promisingly, there are a few examples of antibiotics with unusually long resistance windows, from which we can derive some lessons for designing or identifying \u201cresistance-proof\u201d antibiotics [23,24].", "Figure 3A timeline for the discovery, first clinical use of, and first report of clinical resistance to the 38 classes of antibiotics. For each antibiotic class, the orange bars are the \u201cdevelopment windows\u201d and the blue bars are the \u201cresistance windows\u201d.", "A timeline for the discovery, first clinical use of, and first report of clinical resistance to the 38 classes of antibiotics. For each antibiotic class, the orange bars are the \u201cdevelopment windows\u201d and the blue bars are the \u201cresistance windows\u201d.", "2.1. Multiple Targets", "The polypeptide antibiotic tyrothricin has only been used topically, which is likely part of the reason for its long resistance window [25]. However, even after decades of use, no clinical resistance to the antibiotic has been seen and significant resistance cannot be induced in vitro [25,26]. Wenzel et al. interrogated the antibiotic mechanism of tyrothricin and found that even though its component peptides are highly similar in sequence, they have different mechanisms of action [27]. Their combined effects are to damage DNA, increase membrane permeability, decrease membrane fluidity, and delocalize membrane proteins [27]. This attack on multiple fronts is difficult for bacteria to defend against and makes tyrothricin a natural combination therapy [28]. Clinical phenazine resistance is also extremely rare, although it has been induced in vitro [29,30]. Like tyrothricin, these antibiotics likely have multiple mechanisms of action, which makes resistance more difficult to evolve [31,32]. Identifying new antibiotics with multiple mechanisms of action, or using multiple antibiotics as combination therapies, is likely to slow the development of resistance [28].", "2.2. \u201cResistance-Proof\u201d Targets", "Glycopeptides such as vancomycin bind D-Ala-D-Ala residues at the ends of glycan chains, preventing the binding of peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes [33]. This mode of action targets a structural component of the cell that is not directly genetically encoded, so it is difficult to evolve resistance by mutating the target [34]. Furthermore, glycopeptides do not have to enter the cell to act, which means that resistance cannot evolve by reduced permeability to or modification of the antibiotics [34]. Resistance to glycopeptides did not arise in pathogens directly: the self-resistance genes were transferred from the producing microorganisms to pathogens [34]. New antibiotics with similar targets are likely to be \u201cresistance-proof\u201d [23].", "2.3. Low Use", "The long resistance window for sulfones is probably due to their main indication as drugs for leprosy [35]. Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease and there are many gaps in our understanding of it [36]. Furthermore, sulfones are only weakly antibacterial against Mycobacterium leprae, which made resistance to these antibiotics more difficult to definitively prove [37]. Enniatins are thought to act as ionophores, collapsing ion gradients across membranes in general [38]. In vivo resistance to ionophores has been recorded and can occur by enzymatic degradation or exclusion of the compounds from the cell [39]. Presumably, such mechanisms are also possible for the enniatins, and their limited use due to their cytotoxicity has delayed the onset of resistance [40,41]. The most important lesson for safeguarding antibiotics is that reducing their use will slow the development of resistance [4]."]
