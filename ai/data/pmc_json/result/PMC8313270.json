Two bacterial isolates that survived in the presence of Txn were isolated. The isolated bacteria were identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva SG14 and Agrobacterium sp.

To identify the genes responsible for Txn degradation, random mariner\u2010based transposon mutagenesis was performed in S. adhaesiva SG14. Seven mutants of S. adhaesiva SG14, which exhibited growth deficiency in Txn, were isolated, and their transposon\u2010flanking regions were analysed using touchdown PCR and sequencing. Sequencing revealed that the mutation sites were physically close. Two possible open reading frames, called stdA (Sphingomonas toxoflavin\u2010degrading gene) and stdR, were identified (GenBank accession no. MH253465) in 2.1\u00a0kb\u2010DNA regions, which were confirmed by PCR analysis using primers StdB and StdH, and sequencing (Fig.\u00a01). One mutant of Agrobacterium sp. AL14, which exhibited growth deficiency in Txn, was isolated, and its transposon\u2010flanking region was analysed. Surprisingly, a gene 100% identical to that of S. adhaesiva SG14, annotated as glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance/dioxygenase, was identified (Fig.\u00a01).", "Fig. 1Organization of stdRA genes responsible for Txn degradation.
