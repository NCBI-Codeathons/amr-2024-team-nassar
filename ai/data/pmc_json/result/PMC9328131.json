["RESULTS", "Expression of ecm16 provides resistance against echinomycin", "Although previously proposed, there is no direct experimental data in the literature confirming that Ecm16 renders resistance against echinomycin (Watanabe et al.,\u00a02006). To provide this evidence and characterize Ecm16, we used E. coli K\u201012 cells as a heterologous host system to express ecm16. The natively echinomycin\u2010sensitive E. coli cells were transformed with a low\u2010copy vector encoding ecm16 under the arabinose inducible promoter [p(ecm16)]. In the absence of echinomycin, E. coli cells with vector\u2010control\u2010only (VCO) reached saturation (OD600nm\u2009~\u20091.0) within a 6\u00a0h growth period (Figure\u00a01b). The same VCO cells grown in the presence of 1\u2009\u03bcM echinomycin only reached ~0.35 OD600nm within the same 6\u00a0h period. Almost no detectable growth was observed for VCO cells at echinomycin concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM or higher. In contrast, E. coli cells expressing ecm16 reached equivalent maximal densities when grown in the presence or in the absence of supplemented echinomycin. Using growth curve analyses, we determined the effect of ecm16 expression on bacterial doubling time (Figure\u00a0S1). In the absence of echinomycin, E. coli with or without the expression of ecm16 were able to double every ~0.54\u2009h under our growth conditions. However, in the presence of echinomycin, the doubling time of VCO cells increased nearly 4\u2010fold at the highest concentration used in this study. Remarkably, cells expressing ecm16 were able to maintain their normal doubling time up to levels of 20\u2009\u03bcM echinomycin. Furthermore, we confirmed that Ecm16 renders resistance against echinomycin using survival assays under titrated levels of echinomycin (Figure\u00a01c). These data revealed that echinomycin is bacteriostatic in E. coli.", "Ecm16 prevents cellular filamentation caused by exposure to echinomycin", "E. coli adopt filamentous shapes in response to a variety of stressful environments, including DNA damage and exposure to antibiotics (Adler & Hardigree,\u00a01965; Kantor & Deering,\u00a01966; Miller et al.,\u00a02004; Suzuki et al.,\u00a01967). To determine whether Ecm16 can prevent cellular filamentation, we analyzed the cell length of E. coli after exposure to echinomycin. The mean cell length of E. coli was determined to be ~2\u00a0\u03bcm when grown in the absence of echinomycin. Exposure to echinomycin resulted in cells with a broad cell length distribution (Figure\u00a02a). We observed that the expression of ecm16 alone in the absence of echinomycin resulted in a\u2009~15% increase in mean cell length compared to the VCO. However, when echinomycin was supplemented to cells expressing ecm16, cell length was not altered compared to the no echinomycin control treatment. To further characterize the potential mechanism involved in the filamentation observed in cells exposed to echinomycin, we analyzed the cell length of SOS mutant strains. Upon DNA damage, the SOS response is triggered to simultaneously accomplish at least two goals: repair the damage and halt cytokinesis while DNA repair is underway. RecA activates the SOS response by deactivating the repressors of SOS (Murli & Walker,\u00a01993). SulA is made during SOS induction to prevent FtsZ assembly that ultimately inhibits cytokinesis (Bi & Lutkenhaus,\u00a01993; Cordell et al.,\u00a02003; Gottesman et al.,\u00a01981; Huisman & D'Ari,\u00a01981; Mizusawa et al.,\u00a01983). For our analyses, we used two E. coli strains with knockouts of genes encoding these two SOS regulators: recA and sulA (Keio Collection) (Baba et al.,\u00a02006). Our cell length analyses revealed that both mutant strains retained their filamentation phenotype upon exposure to echinomycin, suggesting that echinomycin triggers primarily an SOS\u2010independent filamentation in E. coli (Figure\u00a02b,c). Based on average cell length, we observed a decrease in filamentation in response to echinomycin in the sulA and recA strains compared to the wildtype background, suggesting echinomycin can also trigger an SOS\u2010dependent filamentation, albeit to a lesser extent. Notably, the expression of ecm16 in both mutant strains recA and sulA prevented any filamentation. In summary, our in vivo analyses revealed that the expression of ecm16 in E. coli cells results in protection against the toxicity caused by echinomycin exposure.", "FIGURE 2\nE. coli cells expressing ecm16 do not filament after echinomycin treatment.

The NER UvrA from E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to exhibit stronger affinity for single\u2010stranded DNA (ssDNA) versus double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Rossi et al.,\u00a02011; Seeberg & Steinum,\u00a01982). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we characterized the DNA binding activity of purified recombinant Ecm16 to various DNA substrates (Table S1) (Figure\u00a03a). The DNA substrates (32\u2010mer ssDNA and dsDNA oligonucleotides) used in these experiments were designed with sequences previously shown to be UvrA substrates (Jaciuk et al.,\u00a02011) modified at the center to contain a central echinomycin binding sequence (5\u2010ACGT\u20103\u2032). These substrates were chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa) and incubated over a range of Ecm16 concentrations. Slower mobility species corresponding to DNA\u2010protein complex were generated as a result of DNA binding to Ecm16 (Figure\u00a03a). Ecm16 displayed similar binding affinity to dsDNA (Kd\u00a0=\u00a034.8\u00a0nM) and ssDNA (Kd\u00a0=\u00a039.6\u00a0nM) (Figure\u00a03b). The substrate affinity of Ecm16 increased when dsDNA was combined with echinomycin (Kd\u00a0=\u00a020.6\u00a0nM) (Figure\u00a03a,b). Class I UvrA proteins are also known to display higher binding affinity for damaged DNA compared to non\u2010damaged DNA (Jaciuk et al.,\u00a02011; Rossi et al.,\u00a02011). Given that echinomycin intercalates DNA with a preference for CpG sites (Dawson et al.,\u00a02007; Van Dyke & Dervan,\u00a01984), we tested whether Ecm16 displays stronger affinity for specific DNA sequences. We analyzed the binding of Ecm16 to DNA sequences with differing AT/GC content using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Figure\u00a03c). Our results revealed no significant differences in Ecm16\u2019s substrate binding with varying AT/GC content, suggesting that Ecm16 primarily interacts with the DNA backbone, and not the bases. These data indicate that Ecm16 has substrate specificity and/or higher binding affinity for DNA\u2010echinomycin and binds DNA in a nucleotide sequence\u2010independent mode.", "FIGURE 3DNA binding activity of Ecm16.

Ecm16, similar to other UvrA homolog proteins, has high conservation of amino acids involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, including those found in Walker A, Walker B, and the alpha\u2010helical ABC signature sequence (Figure S2). To determine whether Ecm16 displays ATPase activity and whether this activity is required in protection against echinomycin, we first characterized Ecm16\u2019s ability to hydrolyze ATP in vitro. We used an enzyme\u2010coupled assay that utilizes the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) (Figure\u00a04a). During the reaction, PNP combines inorganic phosphate (Pi) produced by Ecm16\u2019s ATPase with 2\u2010amino\u20106\u2010mercapto\u20107\u2010methylpurine (MESG) to form 2\u2010amino\u20106\u2010mercapto\u20107\u2010methylpurine. This enzymatic conversion of MESG results in a spectrophotometric shift that is monitored using a spectrophotometer. Ecm16 shows basal level ATP hydrolysis activity in the absence of any substrate, a characteristic which is also observed in class I UvrA (Rossi et al.,\u00a02011). The addition of dsDNA increased Ecm16\u2019s ATPase specific activity ~10\u2010fold, indicating that the protein shows DNA\u2010dependent ATP hydrolysis activity. The addition of echinomycin\u2010dsDNA complex increased Ecm16\u2019s ATPase activity ~200\u2010fold (Figure\u00a04a). We next tested whether Ecm16\u2019s ATPase activity is involved in its ability to render echinomycin resistance in vivo. To do that, we targeted two conserved lysine residues in UvrA\u2010type proteins that have been shown to be essential for scanning DNA and discriminating between native and damaged DNA (Kraithong et al.,\u00a02017; Pakotiprapha et al.,\u00a02012; Thiagalingam & Grossman,\u00a01991, 1993). We engineered two Ecm16 variants: one at the proximal ATP\u2010binding site with the conserved residue Lys56 changed to an alanine, and the other at the distal site with Lys526 changed to an alanine. Our data revealed that E. coli cells exclusively expressing either Ecm16K56A or Ecm16K526A failed to rescue cells from echinomycin toxicity (Figure\u00a04b). These data suggest that Ecm16 requires the energetics of ATP hydrolysis to render echinomycin resistance.", "FIGURE 4ATPase activity of Ecm16.

In E. coli, UvrA or UvrA2\u2010UvrB2 detects DNA damage and recruits the rest of the NER system (UvrB/C/D) (Caron et al.,\u00a01985; Kisker et al.,\u00a02013; Orren & Sancar,\u00a01989; Yeung et al.,\u00a01986).

To each of these strains, we transformed the replicating plasmid encoding ecm16 or VCO. We tested the ability of these strains to grow in the presence of echinomycin concentrations that were tolerated by cells expressing ecm16.

To determine whether Ecm16 can complement UvrA's activity, we examined the ability of various strains to recover from UV radiation by performing colony\u2010forming unit (CFU) assays (Figure\u00a05b). E. coli cells with their native uvrA gene and VCO can effectively recover from 10\u00a0J/m2 of UV radiation exposure as evidenced by the similar number of CFUs compared to the no\u2010radiation control. However, the cell's ability to recover from UV radiation is significantly reduced when E. coli's native uvrA gene is knocked out. Once uvrA was expressed in trans from a replicating plasmid under the control of the arabinose inducible promoter, the ability to repair DNA damage was fully recovered. These data are in accordance with previous analyses of uvrA knockout strains (Springall et al.,\u00a02018). However, when the gene encoding for Ecm16 was expressed in trans from the same replicating plasmid controlled by the arabinose promoter, E. coli cells were unable to recover from UV radiation. The number of CFUs of the strain expressing ecm16 was as diminished as the CFUs observed on the uvrA knock out strain. The same trend of UV resistance was also observed among the E. coli strains when lower levels of radiation (5\u00a0J/m2) were used. The inability of Ecm16 to complement an uvrA knockout suggests that Ecm16 is unable to recognize thymine dimers and/or recruit the rest of the NER system for proper DNA repair.", "Given that E. coli K\u201012 cells display sensitivity to echinomycin suggested that UvrA is unable to protect from echinomycin toxicity. To determine whether increasing the cellular levels of UvrA would result in protection against echinomycin, we constructed an E. coli strain with two copies of uvrA: its native copy and a second copy expressed in trans from a replicating plasmid (same vector used for ecm16 expression). Cells expressing uvrA from the inducible promoter grown in the presence of echinomycin display the same growth defect as the empty vector control (Figure S3). These results confirm that UvrA and Ecm16 cannot complement each other's function due to either differences in damage detection and/or repair."]
