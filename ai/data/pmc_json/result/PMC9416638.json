["3. Results", "3.1. Isolation and Identification of Bacterial Antagonists", "Ten bacterial isolates that show clear antagonistic activities against A. euteiches on \u00bd PDA plates were identified from lentil field soil samples in this study (Figure 1). Among these ten isolates, four were identified as Pseudomonas spp., three were identified as Paenibacillus spp., and the other three were identified as Bacillus sp., Pseudarthrobacter sp. and Chryseobacterium sp., respectively, via 16s DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1C, Figure S1 and Table S1). Overall, the isolates of the Pseudomonas group showed stronger inhibition than strains of the other groups (Figure 1A,B).", "Figure 1Bacterial antagonists inhibit the growth of A. euteiches.A. euteiches was cultured in the center of the plates and the bacterial cells were inoculated around the pathogen.

Our results showed that both strains strongly inhibited the growth of A. euteiches on \u00bd PDA plates (Figure 1A,B).", "3.2. 2,4-DAPG Biosynthesis Pathway Is Required for the Inhibition of A. euteiches by Strains Pf-5 and 2P24", "We used P. protegens Pf-5 as a model to identify the antibiotic(s) that inhibit the growth of A. euteiches, because Pf-5 is known to produce many antibiotics including pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), orfamide A, rhizoxin, and hydrogen cyanide [40]. We first tested a Pf-5 derivative, the \u0394gacAPf-5 mutant, which lacks the regulator protein GacA that globally controls the production of many secondary metabolites including the above-mentioned antibiotics [40]. Compared to the wild-type strain, the \u0394gacAPf-5 mutant has no clear inhibition of A. euteiches on the culture plates (0 mm of inhibition zone was recorded, Figure 2A), suggesting that GacA-controlled antibiotic production is required by Pf-5 to inhibit the pathogen.", "In strain Pf-5, GacA positively controls the production of at least six different antibiotics including pyoluteorin, 2,4-DAPG, pyrrolnitrin, orfamide A, rhizoxin, and hydrogen cyanide. To test if these antibiotics are involved in the growth inhibition of A. euteiches by Pf-5, a 6-fold mutant which lacks all these six antibiotics was tested in the inhibition assays. The 6-fold mutant did not inhibit the pathogen\u2019s growth (0 mm of inhibition zone was recorded, Figure 2B), indicating that at least one of these six antibiotics contributes to the growth inhibition against A. euteiches by Pf-5. We then tested six single mutants, each lacking the production of one of the six antibiotics due to a mutation of their biosynthesis genes (Figure 2C,D). Among these six mutants, five mutants that lack pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, orfamide A, rhizoxin, or hydrogen cyanide inhibited the pathogen to a similar level (sizes of the inhibition zone were 9.1\u201310.4 mm) with the wild type strain (10.8 mm of the inhibition zones). The \u0394phlAPf-5 mutant, which has an abolished biosynthesis pathway of 2,4-DAPG due to a mutation of its biosynthesis gene phlAPf-5 (Figure 3A), shows almost no inhibition against A. euteiches (0 mm of inhibition zone was recorded, Figure 2D). 2,4-DAPG is a polyketide antibiotic that is toxic to many plant pathogens including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes [41,42,43]. To confirm the role of the 2,4-DAPG pathway in the growth inhibition, we restored the \u0394phlAPf-5 mutant by replacing the deleted phlAPf-5 gene with its wild-type copy in the chromosome. The repaired strain phlA+ inhibited A. euteiches to a similar level as the wild type Pf-5 (Figure 2B). Similarly, a 5-fold mutant, which has a restored 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis pathway in the 6-fold mutant background, strongly inhibited A. euteiches. Further, we tested a \u0394phlFPf-5 mutant, which overexpresses 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis genes due to a mutation of the transcriptional repressor PhlF (Figure 3A) that negatively regulates the expression of 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis genes [44]. Compared to the wild type, the \u0394phlFPf-5 mutant has a slightly stronger inhibition (12.0 mm of inhibition zone was recorded) against the growth of A. euteiches (Figure 2A). Taken together, these results indicate that the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis pathway of Pf-5 contributes to the inhibition against A. euteiches on culture plates.", "Strain P. fluorescens 2P24 is known to produce 2,4-DAPG and hydrogen cyanide [30]. Based on the results that the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis pathway is required for Pf-5 to inhibit A. euteiches, we hypothesized that the same antibiotic pathway also contributes to the inhibition by strain 2P24. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the antagonistic activity of the wild type 2P24 and its two derivatives: a \u0394phlACBD2P24, mutant, which lacks the four biosynthesis genes phlACBD for 2,4-DAPG production, and a \u0394gacA2P24 mutant, which produces neither 2,4-DAPG nor hydrogen cyanide. Our results show that the \u0394phlACBD2P24 and the \u0394gacA2P24 mutants have similar levels of inhibition (0 mm of inhibition zones were recorded for both mutants), which were much decreased compared to the wild type strain (10.4 mm of inhibition zone was recorded) (Figure 2E). These results show that the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis pathway contributes to the inhibition of A. euteiches by strain 2P24.", "3.3. Purified 2,4-DAPG Suppresses A. euteiches Growth and Alters Its Mycelia Morphology", "In Pseudomonas spp., the biosynthesis pathway of 2,4-DAPG generates three metabolites including two intermediates, phloroglucinol (PG) and monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG), and the final product 2,4-DAPG (Figure 3B). A previous study showed that the intermediates of the antibiotic pathway may play a role in the inhibition against the target pathogens [45]. The \u0394phlACBD2P24 mutant lacks all these three metabolites due to the deletions of their respective biosynthesis genes (Figure 3A,B). The \u0394phlAPf-5 mutant lacks MAPG and 2,4-DAPG but produces the first-step intermediate PG because phlD remains functional. The result that \u0394phlAPf-5 mutant has an abolished inhibition to A. euteiches (Figure 2D) suggests that PG did not inhibit the pathogen.", "We directly tested the toxicity of the three metabolites produced by the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis pathway against A. euteiches. Growth of A. euteiches was inhibited by 25 nmol of 2,4-DAPG or 500 nmol of MAPG but was not inhibited by PG even at 1 \u03bcmol (Figure 3C). The sizes of inhibition zone caused by 25 nmol of 2,4-DAPG, 500 nmol of MAPG, and 1 \u03bcmol of PG were 2.9 mm, 0.8 mm, and 0 mm respectively. These data show that, among the three metabolites, 2,4-DAPG is the most potent antibiotic against A. euteiches and likely plays a major role in the pathogen inhibition by strains Pf-5 and 2P24.", "We then investigated the impact of 2,4-DAPG on mycelial growth of A. euteiches under a microscope. Compared to the normal hyphal branching and growth of A. euteiches in the control treatment, the 2,4-DAPG-treated pathogen showed excessive branching of the hyphae and stunted growth of the branches (Figure 3D), which is consistent with the reduced mycelial growth caused by the purified antibiotic metabolite and the producing bacteria.", "3.4. Expression of the 2,4-DAPG Biosynthesis Genes Is Induced by Germinating Pea Seeds", "Antibiotic production of beneficial microorganisms can be strongly regulated by environmental factors, host plants, and target pathogens, which then influences plant disease control suppression. To investigate if the bacterial 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis is regulated by pea seeds and A. euteiches, we measured the expression of 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis genes in the pea-Pseudomonas-A. euteiches tri-trophic system. Strain P. protegens Pf-5 was used as a model of the 2,4-DAPG producing bacteria in this experiment. A reporter construct, pphlApromoter-gfp, which contains the promoter of phlAPf-5 fused with a promoter-less gfp, was made to measure the transcription of the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis genes. This reporter construct was transferred into the wild type Pf-5. The resultant reporter strain, Pf-5/pphlApromoter-gfp, was incubated with germinating pea seeds with or without A. eut eiches. As shown in Figure 4A, Pf-5/pphlApromoter-gfp had a significant higher GFP level when it was incubated with germinating pea seeds than with the buffer control.", "The presence of A. euteiches did not significantly influence phlA transcription by Pf-5, as assessed by the GFP level of the reporter strain. Similarly, the translational expression of phlAPf-5, which was measured using the reporter strain Pf-5/pphlAtranslation-gfp, was also induced by the germinating seeds but not the pathogen (Figure 4B). These results indicate that expression of the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis genes of Pf-5 is activated at both transcriptional and translational levels by germinating pea seeds which likely results in the production of 2,4-DAPG by the bacterium on pea seed surfaces.", "3.5. 2,4-DAPG Plays a Role in the Biocontrol of Pea Aphanomyce Root Rot", "Based on the above results that purified 2,4-DAPG and its producing bacteria strongly inhibited A. euteiches on culture plates, and that expression of 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis genes is activated by germinating pea seeds, we hypothesized that this antibiotic plays an important role in the biological control of A. euteiches root rot on pea. In the first step of testing this hypothesis, we set up an A. euteiches-pea root rot system and a biocontrol assay in greenhouse conditions. We found that inoculation of A. euteiches at a concentration of 50 oospores per gram soil caused a significant disease severity on the pea plants (Figure 5).", "Next, we tested the disease control efficacy of the 5-fold mutant of Pf-5 which has a functional 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis pathway but lacks the other five antibiotics to avoid their potential impacts on plant development such as seed germination. Results show that pea plants that were treated by the 5-fold mutant have a significantly lower level of disease severity than the control plants treated by only the pathogen. Moreover, pea plants treated by the 6-fold mutant, which has a mutation in the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis gene phlAPf-5 in the background of the 5-fold mutant, developed a disease level that is significantly higher than the 5-fold mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that 2,4-DAPG plays an important role in the biocontrol of A. euteiches root rot by P. protegens on pea plants."]
