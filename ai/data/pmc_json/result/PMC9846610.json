["Results", "Evaluation for the criteria of maize lodging resistance by Fmax values", "From 2018 to 2020, 1,172 maize plants were tested in Laizhou and Weifang Region, Shandong Province, at the flowering, milk ripening, and maturity period. As the plant tilted angle increases, the pull trajectory of the plant determined by a tester complies with the equation y\u00a0=\u20130.0028x\n2 +\u00a00.3989x+2.4187 (R\n2 = 0.9991, n\u00a0=\u00a01172), where x represents the tilted angle, and y represents the pull value at the angle (\nFigure\u00a05A\n).", "Figure\u00a05The data analysis of lodging resistance from maize plants at different locations in three years.

Accordingly, the lodging resistance levels of maize was divided into four levels: poor lodging resistance (cluster 3, F\nmax \u226411.8\u00a0N), low lodging resistance (cluster 2, F\nmax >\u00a011.8\u00a0N but \u226417.5\u00a0N), medium lodging resistance (cluster 1, F\nmax\n>17.5\u00a0N but \u226425.8\u00a0N), and high lodging resistance (cluster 4, F\nmax\n>25.8\u00a0N) (\nTable\u00a02\n).", "The Fmax\n clustering by the Euclidean distance method.", "F\nmean F\nmin F\nmax Samples in each cluster.", "cluster 1 31.33 26 55.8 84.", "cluster 2 20.61 17.6 25.8 266.", "cluster 3 14.53 11.9 17.5 444.", "cluster 4 9.25 3.4 11.8 378.", "A correlation between F\n45 and F\nmax", "As shown in \nFigure\u00a05E\n, F\n45 and Fmax are strongly correlated, and Fmax predicted by F45 can be used to assess the lodging resistance of maize plants according to the correlation. Simulation results agree well with measurements.", "As the tilt angle of the maize plant increased, the breaking ratio of the plants gradually increased. When the tilt angle was below 45\u00b0, the breaking ratio was relatively low. When tilt angle was between 5\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 the cumulative proportion of breaking plants was 10.41%; at 45\u00b0 the proportion was 4.27%, and at 50\u00b0 the proportion was 11.60%, indicating that a plant tilt angle of 45\u00b0 was the critical point for a significant decrease in the survival rate of plants. The proportion of plants breaking increases slowly as tilt angle increases up to<45\u00b0, and the survival rate of plants has a curve slope of \u20130.3527; when the tilt angle goes beyond 45\u00b0, the survival rate of plants decreases quickly, accompanied by a curve slope of \u20131.8749 (\nFigure\u00a05C\n).", "In the process of the test, as the tilted angle \u03b8 of the plant increases, the pull force of the F value (expressed as F\n\u03b8) increases until the plant breaks or does not break at a 90\u00b0 angle. Subsequently,the maximum F value (expressed as F\nmax) can be determined. As the results, the larger the tilt angle, the closer to F\nmax is F\n\u03b8. A map was made by using F\n\u03b8/F\nmax values and tilted angles (\nFigure\u00a05D\n). It wis interesting that, at tilt angles in the 15\u201355\u00b0 range, th F\n\u03b8/F\nmax increases proportionally, and F\n\u03b8/F\nmax is about 0.9 at a 45\u00b0 tilt angle (\nFigure\u00a05D\n), which could characterize the lodge resistance of maize plants.", "Out of 1,172 tested maize plants, 1,000 tilted by 45\u00b0 without the stalk breaking and were selected to determine F\n45 values and F\nmax, and comparing F\n45 with its corresponding F\nmax developed the equation y = 1.1354x \u2013 0.3358 (R\u00b2 = 0.9112), indicating that a strong correlation exists between F\n45 and F\nmax (\nFigure\u00a05E\n). By measuring F\n45 and applying the formula, expected values for maximum stalk resistance can be obtained. The maize plants under a 45\u00b0 tilt angle maintained a 85.32% survival rate in a large complex population; therefore, F\n45 can be used to evaluate the lodging resistance of maize plants with a simple method.", "Evaluation of lodging resistance for the different varieties of maize", "The Fmax was predicted by F45 and the lodging resistance of plants were evaluated under non-damaged conditions. Comparing the measured and expected values in pairs, the results are shown in \nTable\u00a03\n. In the low-resistance group the accuracy reached 97.28%; in the high-resistance group the accuracy was 88.57%, which was the lowest accuracy (\nTable\u00a03\n).

The planting density usually is negatively associated with F\nmax, that is, higher planting density usually led to a lower F\nmax. Under low-density conditions, the differences of varieties are significant, that is, the data of lodging resistance from a population consisting of different varieties show great heterogeneity, while at high density, the differences between varieties become smaller. Maize plants at different developmental stages or in different reproductive periods show obvious differences in lodging resistance. From \nFigure\u00a06\n, it is obvious that the F\nmax estimation and F\nmax measurement produced consistent results.", "Figure\u00a06Measurement of lodging resistance of six varieties in different densities of maize plants.
