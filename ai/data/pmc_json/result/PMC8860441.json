["Results", "The CEACAM gene family has undergone repeated episodes of positive selection in primates", "To assess patterns of primate CEACAM gene evolution, we compiled sequences of human CEACAM orthologs present in publicly available genome databases (Figure 2\u2014source data 1A-C). Nineteen representative species were analyzed including four New World monkeys, ten Old World monkeys, and five hominid species. Some orthologs of human CEACAMs were not identified in a subset of primate genomes, likely due to losses or gains of specific CEACAMs along different lineages or incomplete genome assembly. With the exception of CEACAM3, for which additional exons annotated in Old World monkeys were included (detailed in Materials and methods), only genomic sequences that aligned to annotated human exons were used for subsequent phylogenetic analyses. To determine if primate CEACAMs have been subject to positive selection, protein-coding sequences were analyzed using the PAML NS sites package (Yang, 2007). This program uses a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the rate of evolution of each gene or codon, expressed as the ratio of normalized nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions (dN/dS or \u03c9), under different models of evolution. An excess of nonsynonymous substitutions relative to synonymous substitutions between orthologs can suggest that beneficial mutations have been repeatedly fixed by positive selection. A comparison of models that allow and disallow sites evolving under positive selection (\u03c9 > 1) can determine the likelihood that a particular protein-coding sequence has been evolving under positive selection. We found that eight of the twelve primate CEACAM paralogs in our dataset possess genetic signals of positive selection (p-value \u2264 0.05; Figure 2\u2014source data 1D) including CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 which have previously been shown to interact with bacterial adhesins (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006). In addition, we also identified elevated \u03c9 values for CEACAM7, CEACAM8, CEACAM18, and CEACAM20.", "To identify specific amino acid positions that contribute to signatures of positive selection, we analyzed CEACAM sequences using the Bayes empirical Bayes analysis as implemented in the PAML NS sites package, as well as the programs FUBAR and MEME from the HyPhy software package (Figure 2\u2014source data 1E). To control for the potential impact of recombination on these inferences, we used the program GARD to identify potential breakpoints in our datasets and build phylogenies of gene segments based on predicted breakpoints. We then performed phylogenetic analyses using these GARD-informed phylogenies. Our analyses collectively revealed that sites with elevated \u03c9 were concentrated in the N-domain of many CEACAM proteins (Figure 2A; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). Sites under positive selection in CEACAM18 and CEACAM20 were more dispersed throughout the protein, not localizing to a specific domain. The statistical support for positive selection of CEACAM18 and CEACAM20 in primates was also modest compared to that for other CEACAM proteins.", "Figure 2.Rapid evolution of primate carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) N-domains.(A) Sites in CEACAM proteins exhibiting elevated \u03c9.

Residues that contribute to protein-protein interactions have been extensively annotated for CEACAM1, involving both host factors and bacterial adhesins. Overlaying sites under positive selection with known adhesin and host protein-binding sites (Figure 2\u2014source data 1F) revealed extensive overlap between all three categories (Figure 2B) and demonstrates that sites with elevated \u03c9 tend to cluster on the protein-binding surface. Mapping rapidly evolving CEACAM1 residues onto a co-crystal structure of human CEACAM1 bound to the HopQ adhesin from H. pylori strain G27 (Moonens, 2018), we confirmed that multiple sites fall along the binding interface of the two proteins (Figure 2C). In summary, these results demonstrate that multiple primate CEACAM orthologs exhibit signatures of repeated positive selection within the N-domain which facilitates bacterial and host protein interactions.", "CEACAM divergence impairs recognition by multiple bacterial adhesins", "To assess how rapid divergence of primate CEACAMs influences recognition by bacterial adhesins, we focused on CEACAM1 which is widely expressed across different cell types (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) and has numerous well-documented microbial interactions (Figure 2\u2014source data 1F). Recombinant GFP-tagged CEACAM1 N-domain proteins from a panel of primate species were expressed and purified from mammalian cells (see Materials and methods). Previous studies have demonstrated that the CEACAM N-domain is both necessary and sufficient to mediate interactions with bacterial adhesins (Javaheri et al., 2016; Kuespert et al., 2007; Markel et al., 2004). We focused our experiments on CEACAM1 binding to two distinct classes of bacterial adhesins: HopQ encoded by H. pylori and the Opa family adhesins expressed by Neisseria species.", "The HopQ adhesin is a H. pylori-specific outer membrane protein that appears to be universally encoded by H. pylori strains and whose interaction with human CEACAM1 has been well characterized (Bonsor et al., 2018; Javaheri et al., 2016; K\u00f6niger et al., 2016; Moonens, 2018). For our assays we used the common H. pylori laboratory strains G27 (Baltrus et al., 2009), J99 (Alm et al., 1999), and Tx30a (ATCC 51932), which have previously been confirmed to bind human CEACAM1 (Javaheri et al., 2016). The HopQ proteins encoded by these strains encompass the two major divisions of HopQ diversity, termed Type I and Type II (Cao and Cover, 2002; Javaheri et al., 2016). Strains G27 and J99 both encode a single copy of a Type I HopQ adhesin, while Tx30a encodes a Type II HopQ adhesin. All strains include extensive divergence in the CEACAM1-binding region (Bonsor et al., 2018; Moonens, 2018).", "Opa proteins are a highly diverse class of adhesins encoded by Neisseria species that are structurally distinct from the HopQ adhesin (Bonsor et al., 2018; Fox et al., 2014; Moonens, 2018; Sadarangani et al., 2011). For our study we tested CEACAM1 binding to Opa52 and Opa74, which despite their limited sequence identity are both known to bind human CEACAM1. While Opa74 is only known to recognize human CEACAM1, Opa52 also binds CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 (Roth et al., 2013). Because Neisseria species typically encode multiple unique phase-variable Opa variants, individual Opa genes from Neisseria gonorrhoeae were cloned and expressed heterologously in K12 Escherichia coli, which does not bind to CEACAM proteins.", "To assess pairwise interactions between primate CEACAMs and bacterial adhesins, we incubated recombinant CEACAM1 N-domain proteins with individual bacterial strains. Bacterial cells were washed, pelleted, and the presence of bound CEACAM1 protein was assessed by western blot. We observe that all bacterial strains tested bind to the human CEACAM1 N-domain, consistent with previous studies (Figure 3A). Incubation of H. pylori strain G27 with GFP alone fails to yield detectable signal, confirming that binding is CEACAM-dependent (Figure 3B). Furthermore, a \u0394hopq mutant of strain G27 does not exhibit significant CEACAM1 binding, consistent with previous reports that HopQ is the sole CEACAM-binding adhesin present in these strains (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1).", "Figure 3.Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) divergence in great apes restricts bacterial adhesin recognition.(A) Binding between primate GFP-tagged CEACAM1 N-domain orthologs and bacteria determined by pulldown assays and visualized by western blotting.

Gorilla CEACAM1, which differs from the human N-domain at five sites (three non-overlapping with chimpanzee), is also unable to bind Opa74 but does bind H. pylori strains and Opa52. Orangutan CEACAM1 is unable to interact with any bacterial strain tested, nor do baboon and squirrel monkey. We noted that despite the limited species divergence between bonobos and chimpanzees, bonobo CEACAM1 does not bind any of the tested bacterial strains (Figure 3A). Previous studies have found the results of CEACAM-binding assays to be consistent between western blotting and by flow cytometry (Adrian et al., 2019; Javaheri et al., 2016; K\u00f6niger et al., 2016; Kuespert et al., 2007). We confirmed this for our system with H. pylori strain G27, using flow cytometry to detect specific binding of GFP-tagged CEACAMs on the bacterial cell surface (Figure 3B). These results demonstrate that CEACAM1 N-domain divergence between closely related primate species, even within the great apes, determines bacterial recognition in an adhesin-specific manner.", "Recurrent gene conversion of primate CEACAM N-domains", "The inability of H. pylori strains or N. gonorrhoeae adhesins to bind bonobo CEACAM1 was surprising given bonobo\u2019s close phylogenetic relationship to both humans and chimpanzees. While archaic humans are believed to have diverged from our primate relatives at least 5 million years ago, the major divergence between chimpanzees and bonobos occurred only 1\u20132 million years ago (Prado-Martinez et al., 2013). Closer inspection revealed that the bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain sequence is unusually divergent from that of both humans and chimpanzees, while other regions of the coding sequence show higher degrees of identity (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A). To investigate bonobo CEACAM1 evolution further, we first validated the bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain sequence present in our bonobo reference genome through comparison of assemblies and sequencing reads from multiple bonobo individuals as well as through direct Sanger sequencing of the CEACAM1 N-domain from bonobo genomic DNA (see Materials and methods). Having confirmed the identity of the bonobo CEACAM1 reference sequence, we compared this gene to sequences from other hominids. Relative to its orthologs in humans and chimpanzees, bonobo CEACAM1 differs at nearly 20% of sites in the N-domain whereas humans and chimpanzees differ at only about 4% of sites. In contrast, outside of the N-domain bonobo CEACAM1 diverges from humans and chimpanzees at approximately 2% of sites, while human and chimpanzee CEACAM1 differ at around 1% of sites. We also noted that the number of divergent sites between bonobo and human in the N-domain (18 residues) is nearly identical to the number of divergent sites between bonobo and chimpanzee (20 residues), despite the closer phylogenetic relationship between bonobos and chimpanzees. In fact, the divergence between the bonobo and chimpanzee CEACAM1 N-domains is greater than that between chimpanzee and the earliest diverging member of the hominid clade, orangutan (81% versus 83% amino acid identity, respectively). A comparison of N-domain sequences for CEACAM5, another rapidly evolving CEACAM, further highlights the extreme divergence of bonobo CEACAM1. Between human CEACAM5 and the bonobo and chimpanzee CEACAM5 sequences, there are only ten and nine amino acid changes respectively, while bonobo and chimpanzee differ at only five sites along the entire length of the N-domain (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B).", "The degree of divergence within the N-domain of bonobo CEACAM1 suggests processes other than sequential accumulation of single nucleotide mutations could be responsible. One mechanism by which this could occur is through gene conversion, a form of homologous recombination in which genetic material from one location replaces sequence in a non-homologous location, often with substantial sequence similarity (Chen et al., 2007). Gene conversion can provide an important source of genetic novelty and a mechanism that can accelerate adaptation (Bittihn and Tsimring, 2017; Daugherty and Zanders, 2019; Gendreau et al., 2021). To determine if inter-locus recombination has shaped the evolution of CEACAM genes in primates, we looked for evidence of discordance between species and gene trees. Gene-species tree discordance can be an indication of multiple evolutionary processes, including a history of gene conversion between paralogs. In a maximum likelihood-based phylogeny of full-length CEACAM-coding sequences, clades containing single CEACAM paralogs were inferred with robust statistical support (Figure 4A, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). In general, the relationships between CEACAM homologs are inferred with high confidence and reflected species relationships as expected for the divergence of orthologous-coding sequences. To determine if there have been domain-specific instances of gene conversion, we constructed phylogenetic trees of individual CEACAM domains. Typically, we expect paralogs to form clearly defined clades reflecting species divergence. This is the pattern we observe for full-length CEACAM-coding sequences, indicating that overall the paralogs have remained distinct since their initial duplication and have steadily diverged between species. Specific CEACAM domain sequences generally follow this pattern (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3\u20136). However, the N-domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 deviate strikingly from this norm and form a single monophyletic group (hereafter called CCM1356), albeit one with low bootstrap support (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4). Within the CCM1356 clade we observe that rather than clustering by paralog, N-domains are split into subclades representing the three major primate lineages (Figure 4C, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4). In general, the close phylogenetic relationship of sequences within these clades is well supported. This topology suggests that these CEACAM N-domains are more similar to paralogous domains within the same species or primate lineage than they are to their respective orthologs across species. Several well-supported nodes provide further evidence that gene conversion is driving concerted evolution within the CCM1356 clade (Figure 4C). Certain pairs of N-domains, such as CEACAM3 and CEACAM1 in gorilla and CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 in orangutan, form monophyletic groups with strong bootstrap support. As these relationships are not observed for the other domains of these CEACAM proteins, this suggests conversion events affecting only the N-domains of these CEACAMs occurred in these species. New World monkeys provide the most striking phylogenetic evidence of gene conversion among primates. For each of the four New World monkey species examined, the N-domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 are all more closely related within species than to their orthologs in other species, suggesting gene conversion has independently acted on the N-domains of these three CEACAMs at least four times within this single clade (Figure 4C). These findings are consistent with N-domains of CEACAMs 1, 3, 5, and 6 undergoing widespread concerted evolution, likely facilitated by gene conversion.", "Figure 4.Recurrent episodes of gene conversion among adhesin-binding carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs).(A) Maximum likelihood-based phylogeny of full-length primate CEACAM protein-coding sequences.

GARD detects topological changes between trees inferred from segments of a gene alignment, assesses the likelihood they are consistent with recombination, and identifies potential breakpoints. Consistent with our phylogenetic examination of CEACAM homologs, GARD detects strong evidence of recombination for CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 (Figure 4D, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A). In all cases, breakpoints were identified at the C-terminus of the N-domain or in immediately adjacent IgC domains. This pattern is consistent with repeated N-domain gene conversion between CCM1356 paralogs and is also in line with our phylogenetic reconstructions of CEACAM IgC domains (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5). In addition to CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6, GARD also indicates a recombination breakpoint for CEACAM7 that would encompass the N-domain. While we do not detect discordance in our N-domain gene tree that implicates gene conversion involving CEACAM7, there is a single instance in the IgC domain tree of a gorilla CEACAM5 IgC domain grouping more closely with homologs of the IgC domain of CEACAM7 (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5). A breakpoint in this region is also consistent with CEACAMs with rapid N-domain evolution being involved in gene conversion events as well as previous analyses (Zid and Drouin, 2013). Together these results support a model in which gene conversion between rapidly diverging CEACAMs has contributed to N-domain diversification during primate evolution.", "Rapidly evolving regions of CEACAM1 are sufficient to block bacterial adhesin recognition", "Phylogenetic analyses confirm that the bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain is not closely related to other primate CEACAM1 sequences but fail to strongly support its relationship to any other single CEACAM N-domain. Reasoning that the extant bonobo CEACAM1 gene may have arisen from multiple iterative recombination events, we performed a BLAST search of genomes on the NCBI database using base pairs 103\u2013303 of the bonobo CEACAM1 sequence (corresponding to resides 1\u201367 of the N-domain) as our query. Human and chimpanzee are roughly 86% identical to bonobo CEACAM1 in this region versus 99% identical (a single nucleotide change) in the remaining 120 base pairs (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1). This search identifies orangutan CEACAM3 as the closest match. While the similarity between the first 120 bp of bonobo CEACAM1 and orangutan CEACAM3 is striking and the final third of the nucleotide sequence is nearly identical to human and chimpanzee CEACAM1, other segments of bonobo CEACAM1 are still quite divergent from all other N-domain sequences (Figure 5A). A BLAST search of this region in bonobo CEACAM1 (base pairs 221\u2013380) indicates the greatest similarity is with the analogous region from rhesus macaque CEACAM6. However, the increased similarity of macaque CEACAM6 in this region compared to other CEACAMs is marginal (Figure 5A).", "Figure 5.Rapid divergence of the bonobo carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) N-domain impairs bacterial adhesin recognition.(A) Graph shows a fifty base pair sliding window plotting identity between bonobo CEACAM1 N-domain sequence and other CEACAM sequences.

This has been observed for other genes involved in host-pathogen conflicts, most notably major histocompatibility complex alleles (Meyer et al., 2018). In this case, we might expect to identify alleles similar to bonobo CEACAM1 currently circulating in other hominid populations, and likewise alleles similar to CEACAM1 sequences observed in humans and chimpanzees may be found in the larger bonobo population. In a search of human genetic variation data available through the International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) accessed through the Ensembl webserver (https://www.ensembl.org), there is no evidence for any alleles with similarity to bonobo CEACAM1 circulating within human populations. Searching population data from the Great Apes Genome Project (Prado-Martinez et al., 2013), alleles similar to bonobo CEACAM1 are not found for chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. Likewise, CEACAM1 alleles similar to those found in humans and chimpanzees are not observed in any of the bonobo genomes from the same dataset. Given the information at hand, it is difficult to precisely determine the series of mutational events that produced the bonobo CEACAM1 allele or determine the likely origin point of this allele in the diversification of hominids. However, these results are consistent with multiple independent instances of gene conversion giving rise to bonobo CEACAM1, with subsequent fixation of this haplotype in bonobo populations since their divergence from chimpanzees over the last million years.", "Given the large number of residue changes between human and bonobo CEACAM1, we next sought to determine if a subset of rapidly evolving sites are sufficient to either impair or restore recognition by bacterial adhesins. To test this, we generated CEACAM1 N-domain proteins in which a subset of residues between humans and bonobos were swapped. We focused on sites that are identical in humans and chimpanzees but differ in bonobos and which exhibit high \u03c9 across primates, resulting in a total of five tested sites (Figure 5A and B). Of these residues we chose to mutate adjacent amino acids 27\u201329 as a single group. This patch of sites is highly variable among the rapidly evolving CEACAMs, particularly CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM5 (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1). None of the \u2018humanized\u2019 mutants in the bonobo CEACAM1 background were sufficient to confer binding (Figure 5C). In contrast, introduction of bonobo residue 44 into human CEACAM1 (mutation Q44L) prevents binding by H. pylori and Opa-expressing strains, while introduction of bonobo variable sites 27\u201329 abolishes binding to Opa74 (Figure 5C). Mutation G51Q has no appreciable impact on binding by H. pylori strain G27 or Neisseria Opa74, but blocks binding by H. pylori strain Tx30a and reduces binding to J99 and Opa52. Collectively these results reveal that multiple single positions in human CEACAM1 exhibiting signatures of positive selection are sufficient to impair recognition by multiple bacterial adhesins. Moreover, these findings also demonstrate how instances of gene conversion between CEACAM paralogs could serve as large-effect adaptive mutations mediating microbial evasion.", "Abundant human CEACAM1 polymorphisms impair bacterial recognition", "Pervasive evidence of positive selection acting on CEACAMs in primates raises the question as to whether CEACAM variants that evade pathogen recognition are currently segregating in human populations. To explore the existence of human CEACAM variants and their consequences for bacterial interactions, we queried human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and haplotype data for rapidly evolving CEACAM paralogs available from the IGSR accessed through the Ensembl genome browser (see Materials and methods). We found that variation in the N-domains of CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 predominantly consists of polymorphisms not shared with other CEACAM proteins and found on isolated haplotypes. In contrast, CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM5 N-domain variation is composed primarily of extended haplotypes (Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134). Furthermore, these extended haplotypes increase similarity between CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM5, consistent with possible gene conversion events. Indeed, some haplotypes not only have changes at nonsynonymous sites that increase similarity with these CEACAMs, but also include shared synonymous changes. These observations suggest that gene conversion among CEACAMs has occurred relatively recently and may be ongoing in human populations.", "A search of polymorphisms for CEACAM1 in human populations reveals three high-frequency nonsynonymous variants within the N-domain: Q1K (rs8111171), A49V (rs8110904), and Q89H (rs8111468) (Figure 6A). The haplotype containing all three alternative alleles is the most frequent non-reference CEACAM1 haplotype annotated, occurring in 14% of the human population overall and in up to 43% of individuals in African populations (Figure 6A). In total, nearly 17% of all sequenced individuals carry at least one of these high-frequency SNPs (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2). Of the three variants, A49V and Q89H both lie within regions of CEACAM1 known to interact with bacterial adhesins suggesting they may alter bacterial adherence (Figure 6B). To determine if these high-frequency CEACAM1 polymorphisms affect bacterial recognition, we generated recombinant CEACAM1 N-domain variant proteins for use in our adhesin-binding assays. None of the variants are able to abolish CEACAM1 binding to our panel of H. pylori strains (Figure 6C). In contrast, Neisseria Opa-expressing strains exhibit highly variable recognition of multiple human CEACAM1 variants. The Q1K mutation alone has no impact on binding, while A49V abolishes recognition by Opa74, and variant Q89H abrogates binding to both Opa52 and Opa74 (Figure 6C). Combinatorial CEACAM1 variants reveal that these mutations behave in a dominant manner, with Q89H dominant over A49V (Figure 6C). Together these results demonstrate that high-frequency human polymorphisms in CEACAM1 are sufficient to impair binding by specific classes of bacterial adhesins present in human pathogens. These findings further suggest that high-frequency CEACAM variants could alter human colonization or infection by pathogenic Neisseria, including causative agents of gonorrhea and meningitis.", "Figure 6.Abundant human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) variants restrict pathogen binding.(A) Frequency of haplotypes containing variants Q1K, A49V, and Q89H across human populations (map from BioRender.com).
