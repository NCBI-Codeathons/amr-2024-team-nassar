["Results", "DNA cytosine methylation varies during development of Streptomycetes", "Genomic DNA was extracted from different developmental stages of S. coelicolor M145, S. avermitilis ATCC 31267, S. griseus NBRC 102592 and S. lividans 1326 and analyzed by dot blot assay using the antibody against 5-MeC (Fig.\u00a01). To our surprise, this analysis showed that cytosine methylation is higher at the MI stage than at the MII stages in all the conditions (solid GYM cultures and sucrose-free R5A liquid medium) and species analysed (Fig.\u00a01). Aerial hyphae (MII48h) showed to have the lowest levels of methylated DNA in S. coelicolor development in solid GYM cultures (Fig.\u00a01a), while MII hyphae (MII55h) showed the lowest methylation levels in liquid sucrose-free R5A cultures (Fig.\u00a01b).Figure 1Methylation levels along the different growth phases of S. coelicolor, S. lividans, S. griseus and S. avermitilis.

S. lividans 1326 and S. coelicolor M145 are different in accepting methylated DNA, but they have a very similar genome and a similar development40. Despite of that, DNA cytosine methylation during development is comparable in all the Streptomyces species in all the growth phases analyzed (higher at the MI stage), indicating that (i) the cytosine methylation is conserved in the Streptomycetaceae family, (ii) has a broader role on Streptomyces differentiation and (iii) is not only a tag to recognize and degrade exogenous DNA.", "Effect of cytosine demethylation using 5-aza-dC on S. coelicolor M145 differentiation", "Thus, to assess whether the modulation of cytosine methylation could have a role on morphological and physiological differentiation, a treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5\u2032-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was performed. Experiments for the set-up of the cytosine DNA demethylation treatment were carried out, as described in the methods. Streptomyces coelicolor M145 cultures were treated with 5\u2009\u00b5M of the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-dC every 12\u2009h.", "Analysis under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) after SYTO 9 and PI staining demonstrated that 5-aza-dC reduced spore germination up to 65% in respect to the 95% of the untreated culture after 9\u2009h of growth. After 12\u2009h, the spores of the treated culture were germinated as those of the untreated culture (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c). Growth curves on solid medium of the untreated and the 5-aza-dC treated S. coelicolor M145 cultures revealed that there was little effect of 5-aza-dC on bacterial growth for the first 63\u2009h; after 63\u2009h, the treated culture grew very slowly and remained in stationary phase (Fig.\u00a02d). At 72\u2009h and 96\u2009h the 5-aza-dC treated samples showed the multinucleated secondary mycelium (MII) characterized by non-septate branching non-sporulating hyphae (Fig.\u00a02f), while the untreated culture presented spore chains and single spores (Fig.\u00a02e). In the 5-aza-dC treated culture, the undecylprodigiosin (red pigment) and actinorhodin (blue pigment) production was decreased compared to the untreated culture (Fig.\u00a02g,h).Figure 2Effect of 5-aza-dC treatment on S. coelicolor morphological and physiological differentiation on solid GYM.
