["RESULTS", "Identification of the mechanism conferring self-resistance.", "To determine the self-resistance mechanism of Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 to dityromycin, we set up a simple experiment evaluating whether the resistance mechanism relied on possible modifications/secretion of the drug (prodrug or efflux pumps) or was based on mutations/methylations/modifications of the target.", "A translational test programmed with poly(U) was used to compare cell extracts prepared from either E. coli (S30E.coli) or Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 cells (S30Str) in the presence or absence of the antibiotic. Dityromycin, an antibiotic targeting the translation elongation phase, completely inhibited protein synthesis with S30E.coli at concentrations ranging between 1 and 10\u2009\u03bcM, whereas it did not show any effect on the poly(U) translation carried out with S30Str (Fig.\u00a02A). The lack of inhibition with the S30Str extract clearly excluded prodrug or efflux pumps as a possible self-resistance mechanism.", "FIG\u00a02Identification of the self-resistance mechanism.

After centrifugation of increasing amounts of E. coli 30S (black) and Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 30S (red), the residual inhibition activity of the supernatants was determined in a poly(U) translation test (further details are provided in Materials and Methods).", "To test whether this self-resistance mechanism was caused by protective mutations in the ribosomes or by an enzymatic activity able to modify/deactivate the antibiotic, 70S ribosomes were separated by ultracentrifugation from the post-ribosomal supernatant (S100) and the fractions were tested by crossed in vitro poly(U) translation assays. In particular, the effect of dityromycin on Streptomyces 70S ribosomes (70SStr) was assayed in the presence of E. coli S100 (S100E.coli). Vice versa, Streptomyces S100 extract (S100Str) was tested with E. coli 70S ribosomes (70SE.coli). The results of this experiment (Fig.\u00a02B) show that the reaction mixtures consisting of S100Str plus 70SE.coli and S100E.coli plus 70SE.coli were totally inhibited by dityromycin, whereas those formed by S100E.coli plus 70SStr and S100Str plus 70SStr were not. These results strongly indicate that the modifications causing the self-resistance of the producer strain lie on the ribosome.", "Since the target of dityromycin is the ribosomal protein S12 (9), 30S ribosomal subunits from both E. coli and Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 were purified. Increasing concentrations of these isolated particles were used in a pulldown assay conducted in the presence of a fixed concentration of the antibiotic. After ultracentrifugation at 300,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, the supernatants were tested in a translational system based on E. coli cell extracts programmed with poly(U) to detect the residual presence of unbound dityromycin (see Materials and Methods). As reported in Fig.\u00a02C, the supernatant resulting from the pulldown of E. coli 30S subunits incubated with dityromycin did not interfere with poly(Phe) synthesis. Conversely, the supernatant obtained after centrifugation of Streptomyces 30S subunits incubated with dityromycin inhibited the reaction. This result indicates that dityromycin is not bound by the Streptomyces 30S subunits and is not pulled down during ultracentrifugation, even at high concentrations of ribosomes. In contrast, dityromycin stably interacts with the E. coli 30S subunits and is thus removed from the supernatant during the centrifugation step (Fig.\u00a02C). In conclusion, the present results point to a self-resistance mechanism based on a mutation/modification residing in the small ribosomal subunit.", "Sequencing of the S12 gene reveals three amino acid substitutions in the dityromycin binding site.", "As shown in the crystallographic structure of Fig.\u00a01, dityromycin binds the 30S subunit by interacting exclusively with five critical positions of the ribosomal protein S12, namely, Arg30, Val32, Arg55, His76, and Val78 (Fig.\u00a01C). To clarify the role played by S12 in reducing the binding affinity of dityromycin to the 30SStr subunit (Fig.\u00a02), we sequenced the rpsL gene, encoding the S12 protein of Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504. In addition, we sequenced the entire genome of the producer strain, thus obtaining its first annotated draft genome sequence (22). The comparison of Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 genome with the sequences available in the NCBI genome data bank allowed us to verify that the strain named AM-2504 described in this study exhibits 98.6% nucleotide identity with Streptomyces kasugaensis. Therefore, it is conceivable that Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504 can be classified as S. kasugaensis.", "DNA sequence data demonstrate that three out of five amino acids located in the dityromycin binding site of S12, namely, Val32Thr, Arg55Lys, and Val78Ile, are different from those found in the model organism E. coli (Fig.\u00a03). These substitutions are likely the molecular determinants of the self-resistance mechanism to the antibiotic, preventing dityromycin binding to the ribosome (Fig.\u00a02C).", "FIG\u00a03Sequence of the rpsL gene of Streptomyces sp. strain AM-2504.

The experimental system was based on gene expression from the high-copy-number plasmid pET11a, which contained the rpsL gene isolated from E. coli MC4100 carrying the original mutation Lys42Arg, which confers resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin. As shown in Fig.\u00a04A, E. coli cells expressing a wild-type copy of S12, in the absence of the plasmid, are sensitive to streptomycin, but they become resistant once transformed. Moreover, the presence of either Val32Thr, Arg55Lys or Val78Ile substitutions did not affect the streptomycin-resistant phenotype. This demonstrates that the ribosomes effectively incorporate the S12 protein encoded by the plasmid and respond to the mutant genetic background supplied in trans. Furthermore, the results shown in Fig.\u00a04B demonstrate that the ribosomal protein S12 carrying the Val32Thr or Arg55Lys substitution confer dityromycin resistance to E. coli, whereas the cells expressing the point mutation Val78Ile proved to be susceptible to this antibiotic.", "FIG\u00a04Mutations in ribosomal protein S12 confer resistance to dityromycin in E. coli.
