["Results", "Unequal distribution of dfrB gene variants in river and wastewater", "A principal component analysis suggests the separation of the data into two major subsets based on the abundance of distinct dfrB variants (Fig.\u00a01). In particular, the established gene variants with smaller numeric indices (dfrB1 to dfrB7), that were the first to be identified, appear to be associated with wastewater while the recently discovered variants rather cluster with river samples. However, the underlying data structure appears to be more complex since only about 25% of the total variance is resolved by the first two principal components.Fig. 1Principal component analysis of the relative abundance of dfrB gene variants.Dots indicate individual samples colored by their origin. Integers represent gene variants (e.g., \u201810\u2019 denotes dfrB10).

See Fig. S1 for the corresponding scree plot.", "Another graphical representation of the distribution of dfrB gene variants across different groups of samples exhibit a number of characteristic patterns (Fig.\u00a02). Whereas some variants were primarily detected in wastewater-borne samples (e.g., dfrB1, dfrB2, dfrB4, dfrB7) others were found primarily or even exclusively in surface water and sediment samples (dfrB9, dfrB10, dfrB13, and dfrB19). Four out of the 20 known variants (dfrB6, dfrB11, dfrB12, dfrB18) could not be recovered from any of the screened metagenomic DNA reads based on the criterion of 95% sequence identity. For the recovered gene variants, estimated relative abundances frequently exceeded 10\u22125 copies\u2009\u00d7\u2009(16\u2009S rRNA gene copies)\u22121 and four variants (dfrB3, dfrB9, dfrB10, dfrB14) occurred in relative abundances >10\u22124.Fig. 2Relative abundance of dfrB gene variants (copies/16\u2009S rRNA gene copies) in distinct subsets of samples.Dot size encodes the width of the 95% confidence interval around empirical estimates according to a binomial model (high: <0.5\u2009log units, moderate: <1\u2009log unit, low & very low: >1 and >2\u2009log units, respectively).

In particular, the failure to detect any dfrB gene copies in some individual small-sized data sets is most likely a result of undersampling given the limited sensitivity of shotgun metagenomics as compared to quantitative PCR-based approaches. Nevertheless, for all of the groups of samples distinguished in Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a02, the number of 16\u2009S rRNA gene copies used as a reference exceeds 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 such that reported relative abundances are unlikely to suffer from systematic bias (see Fig. S2 for details).", "When the data are broadly divided by compartments into just two subsets (wastewater vs. river) many of the contrasts visible in Figs.\u00a01 and 2 pass the threshold of statistical significance (Table\u00a02). This applies to all gene variants which were more frequently found in wastewater communities, that is, dfrB1 to dfrB7. Likewise, the elevated prevalence in environmental samples was confirmed for dfrB9, dfrB10, and dfrB13. To exclude the possibility that the statistics are generally flawed due to global undersampling, we performed significance tests also for split samples. For all but two gene variants (dfrB5, dfrB13), the reported contrasts in relative abundance between wastewater and river-borne samples were consistently detected in data subsets, each representing 50% of the total analyzed material (Table\u00a02).Table 2Comparison of the relative abundance of dfrB gene variants (copies per 16\u2009S rRNA gene copies) in WWTP effluents and river samples.Gene variantWastewater samplesRiver samplesHigher inadj. p valueSignif. codeConfirmed by split sampling indfrB13.7e\u2212051.8e\u221206Wastewater1.9e\u221217***2/2 subsetsdfrB23.9e\u2212061.2e\u221206Wastewater6.3e\u221204***2/2 subsetsdfrB36.6e\u2212055.9e\u221206Wastewater1.5e\u221205***2/2 subsetsdfrB41.9e\u2212054.7e\u221206Wastewater2.4e\u221207***2/2 subsetsdfrB51.6e\u2212060e+00Wastewater0.0064**1/2 subsetsdfrB74.7e\u2212060e+00Wastewater8.8e\u221206***2/2 subsetsdfrB90e+004.6e\u221205River samples3.5e\u221206***2/2 subsetsdfrB102.4e\u2212062e\u221204River samples1.3e\u221217***2/2 subsetsdfrB130e+002.2e\u221205River samples0.0011**1/2 subsetsdfrB143.5e\u2212061.7e\u221205River samples0.26n.s.dfrB157.8e\u2212072.3e\u221206River samples1n.s.dfrB163.9e\u2212071.2e\u221206River samples0.65n.s.dfrB170e+001.2e\u221206River samples0.44n.s.dfrB190e+003.5e\u221206River samples0.14n.s.dfrB200e+005.9e\u221207River samples0.57n.s.dfrB210e+005.9e\u221207River samples0.57n.s.Reported p values refer to a Wilcoxon rank sum test with the null hypothesis being that the relative abundances of dfrB gene variants are equal in both groups.

The analysis was carried out separately for river-borne samples and for samples of treated and untreated wastewater. For the river-borne samples, no statistically significant association between the abundance of the predominant gene variants dfrB9 or dfrB10 and the abundance of bacterial orders could be identified (Spearman\u2019s rho rarely exceeding 0.15; all p values\u2009>\u20090.1). In wastewater samples, however, the abundance of dfrB3 was found to be most closely associated with five orders of Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonadales, Chromatiales, Pseudomonadales, Enterobacterales, Campylobacterales) all but the last belonging to the class of \u03b3-Proteobacteria. The corresponding rank correlation coefficients (Spearman\u2019s rho) reached values in range 0.5\u20130.8 (p\u2009<\u20090.05 each).", "Physical association of dfr genes with other genetic markers", "Analysis of the original short reads", "The prospects of full metagenome assembly are limited in the case of short-read environmental samples subject to high microbial diversity [40] while the computational effort is very high. In particular, the probability of detecting ARGs and species markers (such as variable regions of the 16\u2009S rRNA gene) on the same contig are very low and the possibility of assembly errors may limit the confidence in the validity of metagenome-assembled genomes [45]. Consequently, in a first step, we analyzed the immediate genetic neighborhood of the dfr fragments on the original (merged) reads. In particular, we scanned all reads containing signatures of dfr for the presence of other ARGs which would indicate embedding of the former in resistance gene cassette arrays.", "The vast majority of reads where dfrB occurred in direct proximity of other ARGs originated from wastewater samples (61 out of 65; Table\u00a03). By contrast, only a minor fraction (4/65) of the reads containing dfrB and another ARG was attributed to river-borne samples. Considering the total number of dfrB gene copies in both groups (wastewater: 357, river: 550), the likelihood of dfrB being found in neighborship with other ARGs was significantly higher in wastewater samples as compared to river samples (OR 0.036 [0.0093\u20130.097], p\u2009<\u200910\u221215, Fisher\u2019s exact test, see Table S3). The majority of such co-occurrences (16 of the 21) was due to the variants dfrB1, dfrB3, and dfrB4 being found in direct proximity of ant genes coding for aminoglycoside resistance.Table 3Co-occurrence of dfrB and dfrA gene fragments with signatures of other antibiotic resistance genes on one and the same read (see Table\u00a01 for average read lengths).dfrB gene variantTargetLinked ARGOrigin1345710Aminoglyc.aacWWTP infl.8/52/2Aminoglyc.aacWWTP effl.1/1Aminoglyc.antWWTP infl.8/77/23/32/1Aminoglyc.antWWTP effl.16/7Aminoglyc.antRiver water3/1AnsamycinARRWWTP infl.2/2?AnsamycinARRWWTP effl.?Beta-lactamblaGESWWTP infl.?Beta-lactamblaOXAWWTP infl.2/2?1/1Beta-lactamblaOXAWWTP effl.?PhenicolcatBWWTP infl.1/1PhenicolcatBWWTP effl.?2/1PhenicolcatBRiver water1/1dfrA gene variantTargetLinked ARGOrigin15712131415161721222732Aminoglyc.aacWWTP infl.2/25/4?2/2?Aminoglyc.aacRiver water1/13/2?Aminoglyc.aacRiver sedim.1/1Aminoglyc.aadAWWTP infl.5/52/248/31?3/3Aminoglyc.aadAWWTP effl.1/1108/9Aminoglyc.aadARiver water1/1Aminoglyc.antWWTP infl.32/1410/74/48/7?38/235/43/32/2Aminoglyc.antWWTP effl.14/51/11/12/24/35/41/1Aminoglyc.antRiver water2/21/12/11/11/1?5/5Aminoglyc.aphWWTP infl.4/3AnsamycinARRWWTP infl.14/82/2AnsamycinARRWWTP effl.6/4Beta-lactamblaGESWWTP infl.??Beta-lactamblaOXAWWTP infl.??Beta-lactamblaOXARiver water2/2MacrolideereWWTP infl.??PhenicolcmlAWWTP infl.4/2QuinoloneqnrVCWWTP infl.3/2Both dfr and the linked gene(s) fulfilled the criterion of at least 95% sequence identity.

The overall results were very similar to those obtained for dfrB (Table\u00a03, Table S4). Specifically, dfrA was way more likely to be found in neighborship with other ARGs in samples of wastewater as compared to river samples (OR 0.11 [0.070\u20130.18, p\u2009<\u200910\u221215). Likewise, dfrA was most commonly associated with genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, namely aadA and ant.", "The alignment of dfrB-positive short reads against databases of mobile genetic elements yielded a similar outcome as the analysis of resistance gene co-occurrences. In total, six short reads were identified which harbored both a sequence of dfrB and a cluster of attC recombination sites lacking an integron-integrase. The latter are commonly referred to as CALINs [46] representing degraded or incompletely sequenced integrons [30]. All of these reads originate from samples of treated or untreated wastewater and five out of six cases are attributable to the variants dfrB2 and dfrB3 (Table S5).", "According to insertion sequence analysis, dfrB signatures were almost exclusively found in proximity to a single type of transposable element, TnAs3 (Table S6), originally discovered in the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida. The apparent primary association of dfrB with this element is of particular relevance with regard to mobility. According to a recent study [47], an estimated proportion of 70% of TnAs3 have integrons within their genetic context of 10 ORF and they belong to the most abundant insertion sequences found on plasmids. In our dataset, most of the reads giving a simultaneous hit for both dfrB and TnAs3 originated from wastewater samples (85 out of 90 cases; Table S6) with dfrB3 again being predominant.

In 27 of 33 cases (80%), significant BLASTX alignments were obtained for either integron integrases (8 cases) or resistance determinants (19 cases), including beta-lactamases, enzymes mediating aminoglycoside resistance, and multi-drug efflux pumps.

All but one of these assemblies were recovered from river-borne samples. If conserved domains were detectable at all, they were generally indicative of enzymes not directly related to antimicrobial resistance or ARG mobility. For dfrB10, our assemblies suggest a number of typical genetic framings as flanks with similar contents were recovered from multiple independent samples (Table S7). Namely xanthine dehydrogenases, phosphotransferases, carboxymethyltransferases, as well as two different components of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems were observed in multiple contigs originating from distinct samples.", "The observed differences in potential mobility of dfrB genes as inferred from the detection of integron integrases or ARG in the assembled flanking regions are highly significant. The fact that dfrB genes being strongly associated with wastewater metagenomes (dfrB1 to dfrB7) frequently showed indications of mobility (27 of 33 cases) while other dfrB variants associated with river metagenomes did not (0 of 30 cases) is very unlikely to be by chance (OR\u2009>\u200923, p\u2009<\u200910\u221211; Fisher\u2019s exact test). Strong significance (OR\u2009>\u20095.3, p\u2009<\u200910\u22126) remains even if the presence of TA systems in five of the flanking regions of dfrB10 is generally counted as an indication of mobility, based on the historical notion that TA systems are often plasmid-encoded, which is not necessarily the case [48, 49]."]
