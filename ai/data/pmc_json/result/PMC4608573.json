["Results", "Identification of genes encoding hypothetical proteins and domain analysis", "To identify genes encoding resistance to the toxin cercosporin and to 1O2, we have been characterizing genes in a subtractive library [7] between the C. nicotianae cercosporin-resistant wt and the sensitive crg1 mutant deficient for the CRG1 transcription factor [6]. In previous studies we characterized genes encoding membrane transporters [12,13] as well as enzymes that generate reducing power [17], as both toxin transport and toxin reduction have been identified as important mechanisms of cercosporin resistance [2]. Our focus in this study is on genes encoding hypothetical proteins, as resistance to 1O2 is poorly understood. We screened 13 ESTs from the library that are homologous to genes encoding hypothetical proteins. A genome sequence for C. nicotianae is not available. Therefore, tBLASTx searches of the EST sequences were performed against NCBI\u2019s protein database to identify the closest orthologs. Functional domains of these orthologs were then identified using NCBI\u2019s conserved domain database [39]. With the exception of 56cR, 40cR, and 200sF EST sequences, all EST sequences were aligned with their orthologs with high similarity (p-value of e-10 or lower).", "The functional domains of the orthologs of the hypothetical EST sequences are listed in Table 3. No functional domains were found for the orthologs of 40cR or 77sR3 EST sequences with the p-value threshold of e-5. Orthologs of the remaining 11 hypothetical proteins had domains with characterized functions, some of which are consistent with previously identified mechanisms of resistance to cercosporin or ROS damage including reducing activity, amino acid turn-over, and transporters [2, 8, 12, 13, 14]. ESTs with these functions include 56cR, which has a hydrolase domain, 1cF and 200sF with domains involved, respectively, in tryptophan and tyrosine biosynthesis, and 15cF that has a permease transporter domain. Other identified domains include a phospholipid methyltransferase domain (24cR and 84cR), a peptidoglycan binding domain (11sf), domains for proteins triggering apoptosis (55cR), and ones involved in signal transduction (207sF).", "Conserved domains of the orthologs of hypothetical proteins in the subtractive library.", "EST\n1 Domain Name\n2 Accession\n3 Description\n4 Interval\n5 E-value\n6.", "11sF LysM cd00118 Lysine Motif 130\u2013258 6.18E-11.", "LytE COG1388 FOG: LysM repeat (found in outer membranes) 382\u2013657 1.11E-08.", "FAM53 super family cl21101 Family of FAM53 170\u2013514 4.44E-05.", "1cF RHOD cd00158 Rhodanese Homology Domain 1057\u20131404 3.08E-09.", "Trp-synth-beta_II super family cl00342 Tryptophan synthase beta superfamily (fold type II) 85\u2013969 9.42E-40.", "56cR Abhydrolase_6 pfam12697 Alpha/beta hydrolase family 241\u20131038 4.14E-16.", "TT_ORF1 super family cl20238 Torque teno viral orf 1 797\u2013916 2.67E-05.", "15cF RhaT COG0697 Permeases of the drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) superfamily 461\u20131243 2.35E-14.", "24cF PEMT super family cl21511 Phospholipid methyltransferase 85\u2013675 6.50E-38.", "55cR EI24 pfam07264 Etoposide-induced protein 2.4 247\u2013807 3.53E-10.", "71cR NTF2_like super family cl09109 Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2-like) superfamily 90\u2013455 2.19E-54.", "84cR PEMT super family cl21511 Phospholipid methyltransferase 163\u20131020 1.05E-44.", "200sF Tyrosinase pfam00264 Common central domain of tyrosinase 295\u2013984 2.98E-71.", "207sF LDB19 super family cl15231 Arrestin N terminal like family 578\u20131117 9.96E-39.", "214sR3 R3H-assoc pfam13902 R3H-associated N-terminal domain 247\u2013582 1.63E-34.", "40cR no domains.", "77sR3 no domains.", "1 The library names of the EST sequences in the subtractive library [7]; F = forward library (down-regulated in crg1 mutant); R = reverse library (upregulated in crg1 mutant)", "2 The domain name given in The Conserved Domain Database in the NCBI website [39]", "3 Accession numbers of the conserved domains", "4 A brief description of the domains", "5 The positions within the C. nicotianae genes that the domains are aligning.", "6 E-value indicates statistical significance for the similarity between the hypothetical protein sequence and the sequence of the characterized domain.", "Expression of hypothetical genes under conditions of cercosporin toxicity", "In order to define a possible role in cercosporin resistance, the 13 genes encoding hypothetical proteins were assayed for changes in expression under conditions of cercosporin toxicity.

Previous studies to test the role of each of the 8 biosynthetic pathway (CTB) gene products did not document a role in resistance [2], however we previously documented up-regulation of two of the CTB genes in response to cercosporin toxicity in C. nicotianae mutants deficient for a membrane transporter (ATR2) shown to play a role in cercosporin resistance [13].

A search on the Conserved Domain Database in the NCBI website [39] showed that a 131 amino acid portion of the 71cR protein aligns with a Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2-like) super-family domain. This result was confirmed using Pfam software [41] (version 2014_07), and the sequence was further identified as being in the DUF (domain of unknown function) 1348 family, one of the 24 families in the NTF2-like super-family. Of the 24 families in the NTF2-like super-family, 16 have known functions, and the remaining eight families, including DUF1348, are not characterized [41].

Some of the NTF2 families formed monophyletic clades. For example, the four scytalone dehydratase (SDH) sequences formed a monophyletic clade with a bootstrap value of 53%. However, sequences for most of the NTF2 families were polyphyletic, with little or no bootstrap support to cluster families within clades (S2 Fig). 71cR formed a clade with two other DUF1348 proteins from Talaromyces and Pseudomonas (S2 Fig) with a bootstrap value of 68%. The next closest domain was from a SnoaL-like polyketide cyclase from Methylomicrobium album from the NTF2 SnoaL1 domain family.

The secondary and tertiary structure of the 71cR amino acid sequence was analyzed using Raptor software [35]. The secondary structure of 71cR is predicted to have 7 beta sheets and 4 alpha helices (Fig 8A). For the tertiary structure predictions, Raptor software predicted the best template to be Protein PFL_3262 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (2imj:A). The predicted model has a p-value of 2.96e-11. The predicted structure of 71cR protein is a half barrel structure with 7 beta sheets enclosing the alpha helix (Fig 8B). The two other alpha helices are positioned near beta sheets #4, 5, and 6 (Fig 8B). The predicted model also states that this protein forms a dimer. The Raptor server predicted that 71cR binds steroids, and identified 12 ligand binding sites for steroid binding (A19, W23, N43, K61, Y68, F86, Y88, Y90, C102, E106, R119, M121). The pocket multiplicity value predicted for steroid binding is 74, and we compared it to the pocket multiplicity of a known steroid delta-isomerase (Accession number: P07445); its pocket multiplicity was also 74, providing high support for 71cR binding to steroids. To determine whether the predicted ligand binding sites are conserved in 71cR, 130 of its closest orthologs (S1 Table) were aligned to identify conserved residues within the sequence (Fig 9).

The crystal structure of the 71cR is not available. Thus we aligned the crystal structure of the closest ortholog with a crystal structure, protein PFL_3262 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PDB ID: 2IMJ). This analysis predicts that the PFL_3262 tertiary structure aligns most closely with steroid delta-isomerase proteins, with z values of 14.1\u201315.4. This finding suggests that 71cR orthologs are most similar to steroid delta-isomerase proteins, a finding consistent with the Raptor software\u2019s prediction of steroid binding. To further investigate this association, we re-ran the analysis with a known steroid delta-isomerase protein (Accession number: 3t8n). Z-scores between the steroid delta-isomerase protein (3t8n) and other steroid delta-isomerase proteins were higher, in the range of 20.4\u201325.7. We conclude that 71cR is similar to steroid delta-isomerase proteins, but is not this precise enzyme. In agreement with the similarity to steroid delta-isomerase proteins, which are localized in the cytosol, the Predict Protein server [37] identified no transmembrane helices or disulphide bridges in 71cR and predicted localization in the cytosol.", "Analysis of 71cR effect on cercosporin", "Steroid delta-isomerase proteins catalyze isomerization reactions of steroids. We thus decided to test if 71cR may be catalyzing a reaction to degrade or modify the structure of cercosporin. We tested possible degradation by treating cultures of resistant N. crassa 71cR transformants (#379 and 380) and wt with cercosporin, harvesting the mycelium, and extracting and quantifying cercosporin from the mycelium and from the medium. We found no detectable differences in the amount of cercosporin recovered from the resistant transformants as compared to wt (data not shown), suggesting no degradation of cercosporin. In addition, we used confocal microscopy to generate \u03bb-stacks to compare fluorescence emission spectra of the treated hyphae. We were unable to detect a difference between wild-type and resistant N. crassa 71cR transformants (data not shown). Thus we do not have evidence for degradation or modification of cercosporin by the 71cR transformants."]
