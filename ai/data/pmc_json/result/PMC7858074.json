["RESULTS", "Phosphonate metabolism in P. ananatis isolates.", "Although previous studies correlating the hvr gene cluster and onion pathogenicity examined 30 P. ananatis strains via PCR, only a few these had fully sequenced genomes at the time of the study (18). To expand our understanding of phosphonate metabolism in this species, we searched the currently available set of 65 P. ananatis genomes, which includes 6 from the previous study, for the presence of genes associated with phosphonate biosynthesis and catabolism (Data Set S1). Based on the presence of the pepM gene, 33 (51%) of these strains have the genetic capacity to produce phosphonate metabolites, with 26 strains encoding a single pepM and 7 containing two copies. Four different phosphonate biosynthetic gene clusters were identified, with the hvr operon being the most common (28 strains). Eight strains carry a seven-gene phosphonate biosynthetic locus that is unrelated to characterized pepM gene clusters (Fig.\u00a0S1, cluster A). Four of these strains also possess the hvr locus at a distal site on the chromosome. Three strains, all of which also carry the hvr locus, carry a gene cluster that resembles the phosphonoglycan biosynthetic locus in Glyomyces sp. strain NRRL B-16210 (Fig.\u00a0S1, pgb gene cluster) (29). Lastly, a single strain, which lacks the hvr operon, carries a novel nine-gene pepM-encoding cluster (Fig.\u00a0S1, cluster B). In addition to the putative phosphonate biosynthetic loci, all strains carry a copy of the phn operon, which encodes the carbon-phosphorus lyase system used for phosphonate catabolism (Fig.\u00a0S1, phn gene cluster) (36). Genes encoding alternative phosphonate catabolic pathways were not observed.", "Phosphonate-related gene clusters in P. ananatis.

Because the pathogenicity of these strains has not been established, initial experiments were conducted to assess their ability to cause onion rot. Consistent with the previously observed correlation between the presence of the hvr locus and pathogenesis, we observed onion center rot in bulbs inoculated with strain LMG 5342, but not in bulbs inoculated with B-14773 (Fig.\u00a01).", "FIG\u00a01Onion center rot phenotype of P. ananatis strains used in the study.

The center rot phenotype was observed in all mutants that retained the hvr locus and absent in all strains with the \u0394hvr mutation. Therefore, as observed in P. ananatis OC5a (18), the hvr locus is necessary for onion pathogenicity in strain LMG 5342. In contrast, the pgb locus does not significantly contribute to pathogenicity, because the onion rot phenotype for mutants lacking these genes was identical to each of the otherwise isogenic strains. Interestingly, strains with intact hvr and phn loci were attenuated relative to those with the \u0394phn mutation, suggesting that endogenous phosphonate catabolism minimizes virulence (Fig.\u00a01).", "Production of phosphonic acids in P. ananatis LMG 5342.", "To examine whether phosphonates are actually produced by P. ananatis LMG 5342, we grew the wild-type strains in a variety of liquid and solid media. Spent media were then concentrated and screened for the presence of phosphonates using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which allows relatively sensitive detection of molecules containing a carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond, even in complex mixtures containing phosphate and phosphate esters (37). In no case did we observe signals consistent with the presence of phosphonates. We suspected that our inability to detect phosphonates in spent media was due to poor expression of the hvr operon in the media we employed. Thus, we conducted similar experiments in media supplemented with onion extract, with the idea that a plant metabolite was required to induce expression of the hvr locus; however, we failed to detect phosphonates in these media as well.", "To circumvent issues arising from native gene regulation, we constructed a strain that expresses the hvr operon from a strong, isopropyl-\u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter (Fig.\u00a0S2). To avoid complications caused by the other phosphonate metabolic genes, this strain also carried the \u0394phn and \u0394pgb mutations. After growth of this recombinant strain in media with IPTG, three distinct 31P NMR peaks were observed (Fig.\u00a02). The chemical shifts of these peaks (\u03b4 17.6, \u03b4 15.0, and \u03b4 10.4\u2009ppm) are consistent with the presence of molecules containing C-P bonds. These peaks were not observed after growth in media without IPTG. Thus, putative phosphonates are produced only when the hvr operon is expressed. After optimization of the medium and growth conditions, the IPTG-inducible strain catalyzed nearly complete conversion of phosphate to biomass and phosphonates, with final concentrations of approximately 0.653, 0.080, and 0.039\u2009mM for compounds 1 (\u03b4 17.6), 2 (\u03b4 15.0), and 3 (\u03b4 10.4\u2009ppm), respectively (Fig.\u00a0S3).", "FIG\u00a02Production of phosphonates is correlated with expression of the hvr operon.

As with most phosphonate natural products, the pathway begins with the rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) catalyzed by the enzyme PEP mutase (39). In P. ananatis, this reaction would be catalyzed by the HvrA protein, which is highly homologous to known PEP mutases. Because the PEP mutase reaction is highly endergonic (\u0394G \u223c125\u2009kJ/mol), subsequent steps must be highly favorable to drive net phosphonate synthesis (40). In the proposed pathway, this thermodynamic driving force is provided by the exergonic condensation of acetyl-CoA and phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) catalyzed by the HvrC protein, which is a homolog of the biochemically characterized phosphonomethylmalate (PMM) synthase involved in FR-900098 biosynthesis (41). PMM would then be dehydrated to form 2-phosphonomethylmaleate by HvrD and HvrE. These proteins are homologs of the small and large subunits of isopropylmalate dehydratase, respectively, which catalyze the isomerization of 3-isopropylmalate to 2-isopropylmalate via a dehydrated intermediate (2-isopropylmaleate) during leucine biosynthesis. We expect that HvrDE will not catalyze the full reaction but, rather, will stop at the dehydrated intermediate. Precedent for this partial reaction is found in the propionate catabolic pathway of some bacteria, which catalyze the dehydration of 2-methylcitrate to 2-methyl-cis-aconitate using a member of the isopropylmalate dehydratase family (42). Conversion of 2-phosphonomethylmaleate to pantaphos is likely to be catalyzed by HvrB, a homolog of the flavin-dependent monooxygenases, NtaA and ScmK (48% and 47% identity, respectively) (43, 44). Consistent with the idea that this is an oxygen-dependent reaction, we have observed that poorly aerated cultures accumulate 2-phosphonomethylmaleate instead of pantaphos (data not shown). Flavin-dependent monooxygenases often require a separate flavin reductase to provide the electrons needed for reduction of oxygen to water. We propose that this function is provided by HvrK, a member of the flavin reductase family that is 30% identical to NtaB, which serves this function in the analogous NtaA-catalyzed reaction (45). Finally, we suggest that the HvrI protein, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily, is responsible for export of the phosphonate products (46, 47).", "FIG\u00a06Hvr biosynthetic gene cluster in P. ananatis LMG 5342 and the proposed biosynthetic pathway.

Based on homology to proteins of known function, three of remaining genes are predicted to encode an O-methyltransferase (HvrF), an N-acetyltransferase (HvrG), and an ATP-Grasp family protein (HvrH). The final unassigned protein (HvrJ) has no characterized homologs, and thus, we cannot predict a function. A 12th protein that may, or may not, be part of the hvr operon also encodes an ATP-Grasp family protein (HvrL). Members of the ATP-Grasp family of enzymes often catalyze peptide bond formation (48). Accordingly, we suspect that peptidic derivatives of pantaphos may be produced by P. ananatis. Considering the absence of nitrogen in pantaphos, a peptidic derivative could also help explain the presence of the putative N-acetyltransferase HvrG, which might act as a self-resistance gene similar to the pat gene that confers self-resistance during biosynthesis of phosphinothricin tripeptide (49). Finally, the putative O-methyltransferase HvrF is highly homologous to trans-acontitate methyltransferase, which is thought to be involved in resistance to the spontaneously formed trans isomer of this tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate (50). An analogous role can be envisioned for HvrF if similar trans isomer side products are produced during pantaphos biosynthesis.", "Homologs of the hvr operon in other bacteria.", "Asselin et al. noted the presence of gene clusters similar to the hvr operon in a number of bacterial genome sequences (18). We felt it was worth revisiting this analysis in the light of the structures identified above. A total of 33 related gene clusters were identified in the NCBI genomic sequence databases using a combination of bioinformatics approaches. Based on the arrangement and the presence or absence of orthologous genes, nine types of Hvr-like biosynthetic gene clusters were observed (Fig.\u00a0S6) Putative orthologs of HvrA-F are conserved in all of these groups, with the exception of type VIII, which replaces the HvrDE proteins with a putative aconitase. As shown in Fig.\u00a06, aconitase catalyzes a reaction that is essentially identical to the putative HvrDE reaction. Thus, we predict that the biosynthetic pathway encoded by the type VIII hvr-like gene cluster has identical intermediates produced by paralogous enzymes. A feature that differentiates the nine types of hvr-like clusters is the presence or absence of one or more ATP-Grasp proteins, suggesting that a variety of peptidic derivatives of pantaphos might be produced in nature. However, type IX, which lacks ATP-Grasp family proteins, likely has very different structural modifications compared to the other types, based on the presence of homologs to several additional enzyme families. Finally, the clusters also differ with respect to their putative export proteins and the presence/absence of a putative flavin reductase. The latter is not unexpected, as many flavin-dependent enzymes can utilize generic reductases encoded by unlinked genes (51, 52).
