A phylogenetical analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a) shows that the operon disseminates predominantly in Gram-positive firmicutes (mostly Streptococci) and in some Gram-negative proteobacteria (such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Escherichia coli). The gene msrD shares ~62 % identity with its closest homolog msrE7, both factors exhibiting the canonical ABC-F domains organization (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b).", "The model bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) presents undeniable advantages for genetic and molecular biology, but the presence of multidrug efflux systems greatly limits its use in antibiotic research39,40. To circumvent this limitation, we took advantage of the E. coli DB10 strain, which exhibits exacerbated sensitivity to macrolide antibiotics41,42. Heterologous expression of the wild-type (WT) gene msrD from an arabinose-inducible promoter conferred macrolide and ketolide resistance phenotype to the strain (Table\u00a01), demonstrating the functionality of the factor in this organism. Expression of msrDWT resulted in eightfold minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) increase for the 14-membered macrolide ERY, 8-fold for the 15-membered macrolide azithromycin (AZI) and 2-fold for telithromycin (TEL, a ketolide antibiotic derived from the 14-membered macrolides). Similar results were reported for Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates23. However, no change in MIC was observed for the 16-membered macrolides tylosin (TYL) and spiramycin (SPI), or the non-macrolide antibiotics lincomycin (LNC), linezolid (LNZ) and retapamulin (RTP) (Table\u00a01).Table 1Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of E. coli DB10 expressing msrDWT in the presence of ribosome-targeting antibioticspBAD-ControlpBAD-msrDWTAntibioticMIC (\u00b5M)IC50 (\u00b5M)MIC (\u00b5M)IC50 (\u00b5M)Erythromycin20,179\u2009\u00b1\u20090,007164,592\u2009\u00b1\u20090,582Azithromycin0.250,046\u2009\u00b1\u20090,00220,953\u2009\u00b1\u20090,053Telithromycin10,086\u2009\u00b1\u20090,00820,714\u2009\u00b1\u20090,066Tylosin41,649\u2009\u00b1\u20090,15141,672\u2009\u00b1\u20090,103Spiramycin20,758\u2009\u00b1\u20090,06320,81\u2009\u00b1\u20090,078Lincomycin3212,61\u2009\u00b1\u20092,1543212,62\u2009\u00b1\u20091,27Linezolid3213,62\u2009\u00b1\u20092,0643213,41\u2009\u00b1\u20091,137Retapamulin10,071\u2009\u00b1\u20090,00410,075\u2009\u00b1\u20090,007See Methods for experimental details.

This mutation strongly reduces the ATP hydrolysis while preserving the local stereochemistry of the active site and has been extensively used to trap ABC-F factors on the ribosome in ATP-bound conformation1\u20133,5,9. Protein expression levels have been assessed by western blot for each tested variants (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c).", "We evaluated the influence of E-to-Q mutations of MsrD on bacterial growth and antibiotic resistance phenotypes and showed that all the mutations impair both phenotypes (Fig.\u00a01c). While MsrDE125Q and MsrDEQ2 mutations had a similar effect on bacterial growth in the absence or at low ERY concentration, the MsrDE434Q mutant was more toxic. However, MsrDE125Q maintained some resistance (MIC\u2009=\u20094\u2009\u00b5M) compared to control (MIC\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00b5M). This observation was supported by the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) measurement of the MsrDE125Q strain which was ~8 times higher than Control (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Table\u00a01). The two ATP hydrolysis sites (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b) were therefore concluded to perform different tasks and are functionally asymmetric, as previously reported for the ARE ABC-F Vga(A)43.", "We also evaluated the importance of other MsrD residues. The truncation of the PtIM (replaced by three glycines) or just the Loop (\u2206PtIM, \u2206Loop respectively) completely abolished the resistance phenotype in vivo (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e). This has been previously reported in vitro for the MsrE7. Punctual mutations in the Loop (Fig.\u00a01c) affected the resistance phenotype to a different extent. Mutation of residue R241 to alanine had almost no effect on the phenotype, but equivalent mutation for residues L242 or H244 reduced the IC50 by ~3 fold (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Table\u00a01). This demonstrated that these residues are important, but are not essential for MsrD function despite being predicted to be located at the vicinity of the antibiotic (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d) in the MsrE-ribosome complex7. Interestingly, this finding contrasts with the mutagenesis assays for MsrE, showing that the mutation R241A reduced the resistance by more than 50%7. Replacement of residue H244 by the larger residue tryptophan should displace the drug by steric occlusion, but the variant lost most of its antibiotic resistance phenotype (Fig.\u00a01c). Similarly, MsrDWT does not provide resistance to TYL nor SPI (Table\u00a01), despite predicted clash of both antibiotics with MsrD according to the MsrE structure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d). The same observation was made with LNC, LNZ and RTP (Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d). Therefore, MsrD\u2019s action on the antibiotic is indirect, and direct steric occlusion to displace the antibiotic seems unlikely.", "Ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation regulates msrD expression", "Analysis of the mefA/msrD operon sequence indicates a stringent ribosome binding site (RBS) only 8\u2009bp downstream of the gene mefA stop codon. This sequence was proposed to be required for the translation of the downstream putative small ORF, msrDL (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a). In order to test the influence of msrDL on msrD expression, a fluorescent reporter with the sequence spanning from the first nucleotide downstream mefA stop codon to msrD first three codons fused to the Yellow Fluorescent Protein gene (YFP) was cloned in the low copy pMMB plasmid44 under the control of an IPTG-inducible PLlacO-1 promoter45.

This indicated an ERY-dependent induction of msrD. Optimal induction was found at 100\u2009nM ERY, however, 6.25\u2009nM was sufficient to significantly induce msrD(1-3):yfp expression, demonstrating high sensitivity of the system toward its inducer. A reduced, but significant fluorescence signal was detected at 0\u2009nM ERY indicating an imperfect repression of the regulation. Inactivation of the ORF msrDL by replacing the start codon with an amber stop codon (pMMB-msrDL(no_ORF)-msrD(1-3):yfp) resulted in the elimination of the fluorescence induction (Fig.\u00a02a).

To determine if msrDL prompts a transcriptional or translational attenuation, northern blot analysis with a probe located in msrD(1-3):yfp 3\u2019 UTR was performed on total RNA extracted from bacteria with or without ERY and/or IPTG exposure. A 1.2-kb band corresponding to the msrDL-msrD(1-3):yfp mRNA was detected in the presence of IPTG and started to increase incrementally 5\u2009min after exposure to 100\u2009nM ERY (Fig.\u00a02b). Consistent with this ERY-dependent transcript accumulation, we concluded that msrD regulation by msrDL occurs at the transcription level.", "Transcription attenuation employs premature transcription termination via: (i) Rho-dependent terminator (RDT) by binding of Rho factor, a RecA-type ATPase, to a C-rich and G-poor sequence known as Rho utilization site48; (ii) Rho-independent terminator (RIT) where a stable GC-rich stem-loop followed by a poly-uridine sequence causes RNAP to drop off49. Treatment with bicyclomycin, a Rho inhibitor, did not result in constitutive expression of the reporter, thus excluding the possibility of a RDT attenuation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c). Search for secondary structures in the intergenic region between the genes msrDL and msrD using ARNold server50 revealed the presence of a RIT with a \u2206G of \u22127.9\u2009kcal.mol\u22121.

In order to test possible transcription termination activity, we generated a msrDL-msrD construct that lacks the putative terminator (referred as pMMB-msrDL(no_term)-msrD(1-3):yfp). The deletion of the terminator resulted in a constitutive expression of the fluorescent reporter in the absence of ERY, indicating that the terminator is a necessary cis-acting regulatory feature that terminates transcription (Fig.\u00a02c).

We showed that in presence of 50\u2009\u00b5M RTP, a clear toeprint can be observed (Fig.\u00a03c). This toeprint corresponds to a stalled ribosome displaying the initiation codon in its ribosomal P site, which confirms that these ribosomes can initiate msrDL translation. The toeprint observed at positions +31, +32 and +33 relative to msrDL 5\u2019 end (Fig.\u00a03a, c) in presence of ERY and AZI indicates SRC formation located at the termination step of MsrDL synthesis with the C-terminal methionine (M6) codon in the P site and an UAA stop codon in the A site. In accordance with this, reactions that are depleted of release factors (RF1, RF2, RF3) (Fig.\u00a03c) showed the same toeprint results. Moreover, the addition of puromycin led to the loss of this toeprint signal, while preserving it in the presence of ERY (Fig.\u00a03c). Puromycin is an aminonucleoside antibiotic mimicking an A site substrate tyrosyl-tRNA and causing premature chain termination. While actively translating ribosomes are sensitive to this antibiotic, stalled ones tend to be refractory15,16,20,56,57. The resistance of MsrDL-SRC to puromycin is consistent with an ERY-sensing NC that leads to PTC silencing and stalling. In consequence, the stalled ribosome on msrDL covers the first half of the hairpin of the RIT and therefore prevents its formation and transcription termination (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c).", "The main dissimilarity between tested macrolides resides in the presence or absence of a cladinose moiety on C3 of the macrocyclic lactone ring which appeared to be critical for MsrDL-SRC formation (Fig.\u00a03a) similarly to ErmCL20. Absence of significant toeprint in the presence of TEL (whose C3 cladinose sugar is replaced by a keto group) suggested that msrDL is translated efficiently without stalling. TYL and SPI differ from the other macrolides by the presence of disaccharide mycaminose-mycarose in place of the C5 monosaccharide desosamine. When bound to the ribosome, this extended sugar moiety protrudes into the PTC of the ribosome58. Absence of intermediate toeprint and increase of the toeprint corresponding to initiation complex in the presence of these two drugs imply that these antibiotics stabilize the initiation complex. Previous results58\u201360 have shown that they inhibit the formation of the peptide bond, our results suggest that it occurs mainly for the first peptide bond formation (Fig.\u00a03a).", "We replace individually each amino acid of MsrDL sequence by an alanine to investigate the importance of each residue and its ability to induce the msrD(1-3):yfp reporter, which indirectly reports the formation of an ERY-dependent SRC (Fig.\u00a03d). The scan showed a strong reduction of inducibility for all the mutated residues with the exception of residue Y2 (Fig.\u00a03d). Since MsrDL is a short hexapeptide, it is very likely that most of the residues would have certain importance in maintain the conformation that is able to sense ERY. A complete loss of inducibility was observed when the residues L3 and I4 were replaced by alanine, suggesting that these two residues are directly involved in drug-sensing. Toeprinting assays conducted on these two constructs showed that both have less MsrDL-SRC formation in the presence of ERY and the stalled complexes were not resistant to puromycin (Fig.\u00a03e). The importance of these two residues were structurally confirmed and is detailed in the next section.", "Considering that MsrDL inhibits the action of both RF1 and RF2 in the presence of ERY, we mutated UAA stop codon into RF1-specific UAG and RF2-specific UGA stop codons to investigate a putative preferential inhibition as previously shown for TnaC61. Mutation of UAA into UAG or UGA reduced the level of inducibility of the reporter gene (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d) demonstrating the importance of the stop codon. This observation was corroborated by our phylogenetic analysis, which revealed a large prevalence of UAA stop codon among the different msrDL variants (Supplementary fig.\u00a02a). Most likely the UAA stop codon has been selected by evolution to maximize msrD expression in the presence of an inducer. We designed a construct of MsrDLWT reporter where the codons of msrDL were replaced by synonymous codons, as described in the Methods section. This construct, MsrDLWT-iso, showed a reduction of the yfp expression, possibly due to the lack of NusG pausing site, but the regulation is mostly preserved (Fig.\u00a03d). Therefore, the amino acid composition of the peptide is responsible for the translational stalling. Addition of an extra alanine before the stop codon in the MsrDL7A-iso construct reduced the regulatory potential of the leader peptide (Fig.\u00a03d). Toeprinting assay revealed that this construct has two stalling positions: one occurs with the additional A7 codon in the ribosomal A site and the second with the stop codon in the A site (Fig.\u00a03f). Thus, MsrDL peptide seems to induce efficient ribosomal stalling by preventing elongation and termination. The MsrDL7A-iso construct showed less induction of the yfp reporter by ERY compared to MsrDLWT-iso construct (Fig.\u00a03d) suggesting that when inhibition of elongation and termination does not occur at the same location, the regulation is less efficient.", "Molecular mechanism of ribosome stalling by MsrDL", "To understand how MsrDL inhibits translation termination in the presence of ERY, a synthetic mRNA containing a single msrDL copy was translated in vitro with purified E. coli DB10 ribosomes in the presence of ERY (as described in Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a) and the resulting sample was subjected to cryo-EM. After image processing and particle images sorting two nearly identical subclasses were obtained and refined, one containing only a P-site tRNAs and one containing P- and E-site tRNAs (11% and 28.1% of total particles, respectively), as described in Methods and in Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b. However, the ribosome (observed in the non-rotated state) and the MsrDL peptide conformations in both classes are identical, therefore they were merged together in order to improve the final resolution. The resulting initial map of the 70\u2009S ribosome (EMD-13805) with an average resolution of 3.0\u2009\u00c5 that was subjected to multibody refinement, generating reconstructions for the body and the head of the small subunit (EMD-13807 and EMD-13808) and the large subunit (EMD-13806), presenting average resolutions of 3.08, 3.3 and 2.97\u2009\u00c5, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b, 4c and Supplementary Table\u00a02). The resolutions of the derived reconstructions were consistent with unambiguous assignment of ribosomal proteins side chains, rRNA nucleotides and some post-transcriptional modifications (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d\u20134f). The local resolution of the codon-anticodon allowed unambiguous identification of the P-site tRNA as an elongator MettRNAMet (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e), which was also confirmed by the presence of distinctive elements such as N4-acetylcytidine at position 34 (ac4C34) and N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (t6A37) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e, f)62,63, consistent with the toeprint results which assigned the M6 codon in the P site and the UAA stop codon in the A site (Fig.\u00a03c).", "A clear density corresponding to an ERY molecule bound in its canonical position was found at the entrance of the NPET (Fig.\u00a04a, b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d), allowing attribution of macrocyclic lactone ring, cladinose and desosamine sugars. A continuous density at the 3\u2019 end of the P-site tRNA extending within the entrance of the ribosome tunnel was identified as MsrDL-NC and the local resolution of ~3\u2009\u00c5 allowed modeling of the peptide de novo (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d). The leader peptide adopted a hook-like shape with its N-terminal extremity protruding into a cavity at the entrance of the tunnel delimited by 23\u2009S rRNA nucleotides U2584, U2586, G2608 and C2610 (Fig.\u00a04b). One noticeable feature of MsrDL interaction with the ribosome is its residue Y2 that forces the base U2584 to bulge out and Y2 forms a \u03c0-stacking with the base G2583 (Fig.\u00a04c, d) in place of U2584. This unique interaction should stabilize the peptide conformation, while it appears structurally significant, it is not strictly essential, since replacement of the Y2 by an alanine reduces the induction of the reporter gene by less than 50% (Fig.\u00a03d). In addition, this residue is substituted in some MsrDL variants (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a). MsrDL did not show numerous significant electrostatic interactions with the ribosome, since it is mostly composed of hydrophobic amino acids. It is likely stabilized by hydrophobic interactions.Fig. 4Structure of MsrDL-SRC.a Transverse section of the cryo-EM map showing the 30\u2009S (gray) and 50\u2009S (white) ribosomal subunits, mRNA (purple), ERY (red) and MsrDL-NC (gold) bound to P-site tRNAMet (beige). b Close-up of MsrDL-NC within ribosomal tunnel showing experimental density and modeled structure, colored as Fig.\u00a04a while 23\u2009S rRNA nucleotides are shown in light gray. c, d Presence of MsrDL residue Y2 displace nucleotide U2584 out of its position when compared to RF1- (PDB 5J30, light blue) and RF2-containing (PDB 5CZP, blue) termination complex, thus forming a \u03c0-stacking with G258364. e Conformation of U2584 and U2585 prevented productive accommodation of RF1 (PDB 5J30, light blue) and RF2 (PDB 5CZP, blue) while catalytic methylated glutamine clashed with MsrDL residue F564. f PTC in MsrDL-SRC (light gray) is stabilized in an uninduced state (PDB 1VQ6, pink) rather than in an induced state (PDB 1VQN, green) as U2585 is pushed back by MsrDL residue Y265. g\u2013i Molecular basis for C3 cladinose sugar recognition by MsrDL.

This stop codon is recognized by both RF1 and RF2, which subsequently catalyze peptide hydrolysis via their conserved GGQ motif protruding within the PTC. Structural alignment of our atomic model to RF1- and RF2-containing ribosome structures64 revealed that proper accommodation of the RFs is prevented by steric clashes of the methylated glutamine and the glycines of the GGQ motif against the residue F5 of MsrDL and 23\u2009S rRNA bases U2584 and U2585, respectively (Fig.\u00a04e). The conformation of MsrDL peptide stabilized the PTC in an uninduced conformation65 which prevents the opening of the active site necessary for peptide bond formation and hydrolysis (Fig.\u00a04f). This observation suggests that the MsrDL-SRC cannot catalyze peptide bond formation, as confirmed by the toeprinting performed on the MsrDL7A-iso construct (Fig.\u00a03e). Structural alignment of the MsrDL-SRC with ErmBL- and ErmCL-SRCs demonstrated that 23\u2009S rRNA nucleotides U2506 and U2585 are not in the same conformation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a, b). These bases in MsrDL-SRC adapt a conformation similar to ErmDL-, SpeFL- and TnaC(R23F)-SRCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c\u2013e)12\u201316. However, the unusual position of base U2584 seems to be a unique feature of MsrDL-SRC.", "Our in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that the MsrDL monitors the presence of cladinose-containing drugs. Residues L3 and I4 being critical for drug recognition and/or conformation of the peptide (Fig.\u00a03d, e). Accordingly, in our atomic model we identified residue L3 as the closest amino acid to the cladinose moiety and residue I4 as the closest to the desosamine moiety of the ERY molecule (Fig.\u00a04b, g). However, similarly to ErmBL, no close contact between the nascent chain and the drug was observed13,66. The residue L3 being ~3.8\u2009\u00c5 away from cladinose sugar and the residue I4 being ~3.9\u2009\u00c5 away from desosamine sugar, consistent with a hydrophobic interaction between MsrDL and the drug (Fig.\u00a04g\u2013i). This observation is also in accordance with previous descriptions of pentapeptides conferring ERY resistance in which the presence of a leucine or isoleucine at position 3 was critical for drug recognition67,68. Moreover, the importance of 23\u2009S rRNA residue A2062 acting as an ERY-sensor and contributing in silencing the PTC, has been demonstrated for some regulatory leader peptides69,70. In the case of ErmCL, the critical feature for macrolide-dependent stalling is the rotation of the base A2062 that forms an Hoogsteen base pairing with m2A250312,69,70. The structure of the MsrDL-SRC showed that residue I4 restrains rotation of base A2062 (Fig.\u00a04j). Therefore, MsrDL induces an A2062/m2A2503-independent ribosome stalling70.", "The path of MsrDL-NC within the ribosomal tunnel contrasts with all previous descriptions of elongating polypeptides (Figs.\u00a04b and 5). Indeed, ERY-sensing ErmBL, ErmCL and ErmDL leader peptides12\u201314 engage in the NPET and bypass the tunnel-bound drug, while MsrDL curves before encountering it and then engages into a dead-end crevice at the entrance of the NPET (Figs.\u00a04b and 5b). The same observation (Fig.\u00a05c) can be made with metabolite-sensing SpeFL/TnaC(R23F) leader peptides15,16, which avoid the crevice and enter the NPET. The first methionine of MsrDL-NC latches into the dead-end crevice, which is delimited by 23\u2009S rRNA nucleotides U2584, U2586, G2608 and C2610 (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c). This crevice located at the base of helix 93 (h93) is part of domain V of 23\u2009S rRNA and is conserved from bacteria to human (mitoribosome and cytosolic ribosome) (Fig.\u00a05d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a05f and 5g).

If MsrD is also able to rescue this SRC, it will repress its own expression and form a feedback loop similar to the ARE ABC-F Vga(A)71. We tested this hypothesis by using an E. coli DB10 strain double transformed with pMMB-msrDL-msrD(1-3):yfp and the compatible pBAD plasmid expressing various msrD variants. Strains were grown in the presence of 300\u2009nM of ERY with their optical density and fluorescence monitored (Fig.\u00a06a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). The strain carrying the pBAD-Control showed a high fluorescence and a low OD600 as observed in Fig.\u00a02a, reflecting an induction of the reporter and a susceptibility to ERY. On the contrary, expression of msrDWT led to a higher cell growth and a stronger reduction of fluorescence, which correspond respectively to antibiotic resistance and a repression of the expression of the reporter. These results support a model where MsrDWT can rescue MsrDL-SRC and therefore alleviate the RIT-mediated repression on the msrD transcription.Fig. 6MsrD negatively regulates its own synthesis upon erythromycin exposure.a Effects of MsrD variants on MsrDL.

When it was co-transformed with the pMMB-msrDL-msrD(1-3):yfp plasmid, no resistance was observed, possibly because the presence of the two plasmids created some toxicity. Overall, the results showed that MsrD variants which lost the ability to provide antibiotic resistance (\u2206PtIM, \u2206Loop and ATPase deficient mutants) also lost the ability to rescue MsrDL-SRC (Fig.\u00a06a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). Point mutations in the Loop of the PtIM indicated some discrepancy between antibiotic resistance phenotype and MsrDL-SRC rescue. All the mutants showed an intermediary phenotype with less antibiotic resistance and less repression of the reporter compared to MsrD. The mutant MsrDH244w had the same repression effect on the reporter as MsrDH244A for an equivalent OD600, but it provided more than 3 times less antibiotic resistance (Figs.\u00a01c and 6a). The mutant MsrDR241A provides a resistance close to MsrD, but does not rescue the MsrDL-SRC as efficiently as the latter one (Figs.\u00a01c and 6a). Mutants MsrDL242A and MsrDH244A provided similar resistance, but MsrDH244A conferred a stronger repression of the reporter (Figs.\u00a01c and 6a).
