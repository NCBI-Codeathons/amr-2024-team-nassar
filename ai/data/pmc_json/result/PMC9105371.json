["2. Results and Discussion", "To determine whether the extracts inhibited or interfered with the development of other plant species, dose\u2013response assays were performed for the plant extracts against Lolium perenne L. ssp. multiflorum and Lactuca sativa L., and the concentration that produced 50% growth inhibition (GI50) was calculated. The antileukemic activity of extracts and compounds was measured using MV4-11 (AML) cells, and the concentration that produced a 50% reduction in cell viability (LD50) was calculated.", "Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) bioautography has been used extensively in the literature for isolating antibiotic or antifungal compounds from plant extracts [49,50,51,52]. The TLC bioautography assay works well with bacteria and fungi, since very little material is needed for activity and the resolution is high, with the organism covering the entire plate like a lawn. Plant seeds are larger than bacteria and fungi, which limits the number of seeds that can be used. Additionally, seedlings may shift the positions of their roots into other zones when growing. To address these issues, we developed a stainless-steel plant grid with symmetrical rows that was inserted into the agar after contact bioautography. The plant grid limited the diffusion of extracts in the agar and confined seeds to rows. This allowed for easy identification of the active fractions on the TLC plate since the position of the active row of the plant grid could be accurately translated into a measured zone on the TLC plate.", "Magnolia grandiflora L. is a common evergreen tree that is native to the southeastern United States [53]. M. grandiflora contains compounds that have plant inhibitory activity and anticancer activity and was used as a positive control when developing the method.", "Plants have difficulty growing under the canopy of Magnolia grandiflora, and the chipped mulch of these trees has been shown to reduce the germination and growth of Lactuca. sativa [54]. M. grandiflora has been reported to contain inhibitory sesquiterpene lactones in its leaves that contribute to its ability to suppress the growth of competing plants [55,56]. Marin and Mansilla [57] reported that M. grandiflora extracts had antileukemic activity. Parthenolide, a constituent of M. grandiflora, has been reported to have strong antileukemic effects on both leukemia stem and progenitor cells [37,58].", "The aerial parts of Magnolia grandiflora were extracted with 70% methanol/water (MGME) or ethyl acetate (MGEA). These extracts were tested against Lolium perenne and Lactuca sativa to measure their effects on the germination and growth inhibition of seedlings, roots, and shoots (Figure 2A,C and Figure S2). MGEA extract displayed GI50 values for the germination and growth of L. perenne and L. sativa seedlings, roots, and shoots at concentrations under 3 mg/mL (Figure 2A and Figure S2). The MGME extract was only effective at reducing the growth of L. perenne roots (Figure S2). The antileukemic activity of the extracts was tested against MV4-11 leukemia cells at concentrations of 0 to 40 \u00b5g/mL. MGEA was found to be more potent against MV4-11 leukemia cells than the MGME extract (Figure 2B,C).", "TLC bioautography assays were carried out with Lactuca sativa seeds (Figure 2D). The reason for this was that the seeds of L. sativa are smaller, have less size variability, and grow faster than the seeds of Lolium perenne. The overall effect on the seedling was used to determine the positions of the active compounds in the TLC plate. Data in different rows had unequal variances when the F test was employed. Thus, the Welch correction was applied to the t-test to analyze the data. The results are presented as percentage differences from the control. Zero represents the control, positive values represent stimulation, and negative values represent inhibition.", "Magnolia grandiflora extracts were tested with 13.5 mg MGEA and 30 mg MGME for each assay (Figure 2C and Figure S2). These amounts were determined by running small TLC plates with different concentrations of extract to identify the maximum amount that produced distinct bands under UV inspection at both 254 and 365 nm. Compound 1, which was identified as parthenolide, was the major inhibitory component in both the MGEA extract (Figure 2D) and the MGME extract (Figure S3).", "The amount of compound 1 in the extracts was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis using the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine (DHL) as an internal standard. The MGEA and MGME extracts contained 157 and 46 mg of compound 1 per gram of dry extract, respectively, indicating an increase of approximately 3.4-fold in the amount of compound 1 in the ethyl acetate extract (Figure 2C). These results showed that the activity level of the extracts on the plant seeds and on the MV4-11 cells paralleled the concentration of compound 1 in the corresponding extracts (Figure 2A\u2013C).", "To test the validity and scope of the method, it was applied to Gynoxys verrucosa V.M. Badillo and Hedyosmum racemosum (Ruiz & Pav.) G. Don. These plant species were collected in the province of Loja in Ecuador, and we did not observe, nor have there been reports, of them having plant inhibitory activities. However, they have been reported to contain antileukemic compounds [43,44]. The method was also applied to Picradeniopsis oppositifolia (Nutt) Rydb. Ex Britt. This plant species was collected in the state of Montana in the United States. There are no reports of this species having plant inhibitory effects. However, we observed that in the hot and arid regions where the plant was collected, it grows in populations that are clearly separated from neighboring vegetation. P. oppositifolia has been reported to contain antileukemic compounds [45].", "Gynoxis verrucosa was extracted with ethyl acetate (GVEA), Hedyosmum racemosum was extracted with ethyl acetate (HREA), and Picradeniopsis oppositifolia was extracted with 70% methanol/water (POME) or ethyl acetate (POEA). These extracts were tested against Lolium perenne and Latuca sativa to identify germination or growth inhibition of seedlings, roots, and shoots (Figure 3 and Figure S3). The GI50 of all extracts against seedlings of L. perenne was under 2 mg/mL. Apart from POME, the GI50 of the extracts against the seedling L. sativa was less than 4 mg/mL. Overall, L. perenne was found to be more sensitive than L. sativa. POEA was found to be more potent against both test seeds than POME.", "Bioautography assays of Picradeniopsis oppositifolia with 70% methanol/H2O (POME) and ethyl acetate (POEA) extract, Gynoxys\nverrucosa ethyl acetate (GVEA) aerial extract, and Hedyosmum racemosum aerial extract were carried out with Lactuca sativa seeds (Figure 4). The Gynoxys\nverrucosa extract (6.5 mg of GVEA) was submitted to the bioautography assay. Row 11 significantly inhibited seedling length (Figure 4A). This inhibition was due to a reduction in the length of the shoot but not the root. Row 11 was separated and analyzed and shown to contain two compounds. These compounds were purified and recrystallized from ethyl acetate, and their structures were established to be dehydroleucodine (2) and leucodine (3) [43]. The Hedyosmum\nracemosum extract (HREA, 13.5 mg) was submitted to bioautography assays. Rows 9 to 16 significantly inhibited seedling, root, and shoot lengths (Figure 4B). The inhibition was centered around row 13, with a broad band potentially indicating diffusion. Row 13 was separated, analyzed, and found to consist of a single compound. This compound was purified and recrystallized from a mixture of methanol:chloroform by the slow evaporation method, and its structure was established to be onoseriolide (4) by X-ray crystallography (Figure 5).", "The extracts of Picradeniopsis oppositifolia (POEA 15 mg; POME 36 mg) were submitted for the bioautography assay (Figure 4C and Figure S4). The POEA extract inhibited seedling growth on rows 5 to 8 (Figure 4C). Both the roots and shoots of the seedling showed significant growth inhibition in rows 5 to 8. The POME extract was shown to stimulate seedling growth in rows 5, 6, and 10 (Figure S4). For both extracts, row 6 was separated and analyzed, and was found to consist of one compound. This compound was purified as an amorphous solid that was identified by NMR and LC/MS as eucannabinolide (5).", "The effects of compounds 1\u20135 on the germination and seedling, root, and shoot growth of Lactuca sativa were tested in a Petri dish assay. Concentration\u2013response curves were generated for all compounds (Figure 6). All compounds except compound 3 were shown to inhibit 50% of the growth of L. sativa seedlings at concentrations of 1.52 mM or lower (Figure 7). The roots were more sensitive to pure compounds, with 50% of the growth being inhibited at concentrations of 1.11 mM or lower (Figure 7). The shoots were less sensitive. They were not inhibited by compound 2 at concentrations of 20 mM. Compound 1, being the third most active growth inhibitor, inhibited 50% of the growth of seedlings and roots at 0.52 and 0.35 mM, but was much less effective against shoots, inhibiting 50% of their growth at 3.28 mM.", "The growth inhibitory activity of the purified compounds showed a significant correlation with their antileukemic activity. The compounds were tested for antileukemic activity against MV4-11 leukemia cells. The GI50 values for Lactuca sativa were converted into Log (1/GI50) values, and the LD50 values for MV4-11 were converted into Log (1/LD50) values. These values were compared in a scatterplot, and correlations between seedling inhibition, antileukemic activity (Figure 7), and root leukemic activity (Figure S5) were discovered.", "Compounds 1, 4, and 5 were tested against normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy adult volunteers (Figure 8). At the highest concentration tested, 20 \u03bcM, which was 6 times higher than their LD50s against leukemia cells (Figure 7), the percentage of relative viability (treated cells/untreated cells \u00b1 SEM) for compounds 1, 4, 5 was 86.0 \u00b1 1.53%, 89.0 \u00b1 2.54%, and 99.8 \u00b1 0.50%, respectively. Compound 3 has been reported to show significantly less toxicity against normal cells than against leukemia cell lines [43]. These results supported the notion that the proposed approach was capable of discovering compounds that target tumor cells without causing significant harm to noncancerous cells."]
