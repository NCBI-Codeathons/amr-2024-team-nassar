["3. Results", "3.1. Characterization of A. fumigatus Strains: Phenotype and Ability to Produce and Tolerate Fumagillin", "To monitor any potential effect of loss of fumagillin synthesis in A. fumigatus, a phenotypic characterization following the spot dilution protocol was performed. Our results did not show any significant difference between the Wt, \u2206fmaA, and \u2206fmaA::fmaA strains under the different structural, osmotic, and oxidative stresses tested (Figure S1).", "The fungal strains\u2019 ability to secrete fumagillin was also studied by UHPLC using a fixed concentration of toxin (0.2 \u00b5g/mL) as an internal control (Figure 1A). Consistent with previous results, the \u2206fmaA strain was unable to produce fumagillin in vitro. In contrast, the Wt strain produced an average concentration of 0.43 \u00b5g/mL fumagillin (Figure 1B). The strain \u2206fmaA::fmaA secreted an average concentration of 0.25 \u00b5g/mL fumagillin, although the concentration of fumagillin secreted was higher than that produced by the Wt in 25% of the assays. These results suggested great variability in fumagillin production by the WT and \u2206fmaA::fmaA strains during growth.", "In order to study any effect of exogenous fumagillin on A. fumigatus, a growth and germination assay of the Wt, \u2206fmaA, and \u2206fmaA::fmaA in the presence of 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5g/mL of fumagillin was performed. The results showed that fumagillin did not inhibit fungal growth (Figure S2) and that germination of the three strains was similar, being increased in the presence of the toxin (Figure 1B\u2013D). Moreover, the addition of fumagillin was statistically correlated with the emergence of two germination tubes/conidium at 8 h of incubation. This effect was more pronounced on the fumagillin non-producer strain than on the Wt and \u2206fmaA::fmaA strains (Figure 1B\u2013D).", "3.2. Different Fumagillin Uptake Ability in Cell Lines", "Since toxins need to be in contact with their target to fulfill their function, we measured fumagillin concentration dynamics by UHPLC in the culture medium when macrophages (RAW 264.7) or lung epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to the toxin for 24 h (Figure 2). Our data showed that about 10% of the fumagillin disappeared from the culture medium even in the absence of any of the cell lines, likely due to degradation processes. On the other hand, in the wells with macrophages, a higher progressive reduction in fumagillin concentration in the culture medium was detected, being 23.5% less after 24 h of exposition. More surprising were the results obtained in wells with epithelial cells, where a 93.5% of the initially added fumagillin was lost in the same period. Furthermore, we were able to recover fumagillin, 30 \u00b1 14 \u00b5g/L and 21 \u00b1 4 \u00b5g/L from the pellet of cells treated with RIPA buffer of A549 and RAW 264.7 culture, respectively, after exposure to 2 mg/L of fumagillin (Figure S3). No degradation forms of this molecule were detected either in the culture supernatant or in extractions of lysed cells.", "3.3. Fumagillin Induces a Decrease in Cellular Activity and a Delay in Proliferation in Lung Epithelial Cells", "To evaluate the effect of fumagillin on the electron transport chain (ETC) activity of A549 epithelial cells, MTT reduction assays were performed (Figure 3A). ETC activity was lower in cells growing for 24 h in the presence of fumagillin at any of the concentrations tested in comparison with those growing without fumagillin. In contrast, the staining with propidium iodide showed no changes in cell viability, with about 75% of cells being viable after 24 h of incubation in all conditions tested (Figure 3B).", "The proliferation and migration abilities of A549 cells in the presence of the toxin were also studied using the wound healing assay. Notably, fumagillin inhibited the ability of epithelial cells to close the gap caused in the monolayer by a pipette tip after 24 h of incubation with all the fumagillin concentrations tested. The results were even more pronounced after 48 h of incubation (Figure 3C), where only a wound closure of around 20% was measured in the cultures with the mycotoxin, while in control cells, it was completely closed.", "Finally, cell proliferation was studied by flow cytometry in cells exposed to fumagillin, showing a similar delay after 48 h of exposition to all the fumagillin concentrations tested (Figure 3D). In contrast, after 72 h, a marked fumagillin concentration-dependent effect was detected. At this time, in both control and treated cells, two peaks of fluorescence were observed, corresponding to two different cell generations. The overlay graph with the different concentrations of fumagillin (Figure 3E) demonstrates that exposure to the toxin was critical for the development of the second generation of cells. In fact, the number of cells detected in this phase when they were incubated with 2 \u00b5g/mL of fumagillin was 8% less than with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL. Finally, it is important to highlight that the differences shown in the cell proliferation panel (both after 48 and 72 h of treatment) (Figure 3D) were statistically significant when the average fluorescence of each condition was compared (Figure 3F).", "3.4. Fumagillin Reduces Cellular Activity and Viability of Macrophages", "Similar to what we observed in epithelial cells, the ETC activity of RAW 264.7 macrophages were significantly lower after 24 h of incubation with 1 and 2 \u00b5g/mL of fumagillin in comparison with those without mycotoxin and even with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 4A). Moreover, the propidium iodide assay showed a significant reduction in cell viability in the presence of all the fumagillin concentrations used (Figure 4B).", "The proliferation analysis also showed a slight delay in cell proliferation after 48 and 72 h of toxin exposition in comparison with the control cells without fumagillin (Figure 4C), but this effect was not concentration-dependent (Figure 4D). As happened with A549 cells, the differences shown in the cell proliferation panel (Figure 4C)) were statistically significant when the average fluorescence of each condition was compared (Figure 4E).", "3.5. The Loss of the Ability to Produce Fumagillin Is Associated with a Transient Higher Rate of Phagocytosis of A. fumigatus Conidia", "In order to understand whether fumagillin secretion can alter the interaction between the fungus and macrophages, we performed co-cultures using the three fungal strains and either BMMs or RAW 264.7 cells and we analyzed the fungal germination and branching rates, as well as the phagocytosis index. Concerning germination, no differences between strains were found neither in control nor when the fungus was in contact with RAW 264.7 cells. However, in the presence of BMMs, the germination rates of \u2206fmaA and \u2206fmaA::fmaA strains were significantly higher than those of Wt at 6 h, reaching the same value at 8 h in all the strains (Figure 5A\u2013C). Moreover, the development of the second branch of the hyphae of the fumagillin non-producer strain was significantly higher than those observed for Wt and \u2206fmaA::fmaA when exposed to macrophages (Figure 5D\u2013F) as observed previously in fumagillin contact studies.", "Regarding hyphal length, the \u2206fmaA and \u2206fmaA::fmaA strains grew significantly longer hyphae than the Wt when the fungus grew alone or in co-culture with BMMs (Figure 5G,H). On the other hand, no differences in hyphal length were found between strains when they grew in the presence of RAW 264.7 macrophages (Figure 5I).", "Finally, we analyzed the macrophage phagocytosis of fungal cells for 8 h and observed that the \u2206fmaA strain was phagocytosed at a significantly higher rate during the first 4 h of contact with both RAW 264.7 and BMMs cells (Figure 6A,D, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the phagocytosis at 6 and 8 h. The pre-treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with fumagillin before the co-incubation with the fungal strains only showed a significant increase in phagocytosis of the non-fumagillin producer strain (Figure 6B). Comparing the untreated assay (Figure 6A) with the pre-treated assay (Figure 6B), we found that the pre-treated cells showed significantly lower phagocytosis rates after 6 and 8 h of co-incubation (solid triangles). This may imply that macrophages were affected by the pre-treatment, showing lower phagocytic ability. The phagocytosis study performed using heat-inactivated conidia of the three strains did not show differences between these fungal strains (Figure 6C). As the phagocytosis rate of the \u2206fmaA strain by BMMs was the most efficient during the first 6 h (Figure 6D), we studied TNF production in these co-cultures. Overall, there was a trend showing that the \u2206fmaA strain stimulated a lower TNF release by BMMs in all the time points analyzed, although a great biological variability between replicates was observed. Specifically, at 4 h, \u2206fmaA and \u2206fmaA::fmaA showed a significantly lower capacity to induce TNF production by BMMs than the Wt. The significantly higher production of TNF by the BMMs in contact with \u2206fmaA::fmaA compared to the Wt and \u2206fmaA strain after 8 h of co-incubation (Figure 6E) was surprising.", "3.6. Fumagillin Synthesis Increases Fungal Load during Infection", "To evaluate the importance of fumagillin production for A. fumigatus virulence in vivo, we used a mouse model of pulmonary aspergillosis already established in our lab [23]. Figure 7A shows that the \u2206fmaA strain induced a 50% mortality in the first 4 days post-infection, but mice that survived after this day remained alive throughout the experiment. In contrast, the mice infected with the Wt showed a more progressive increase in mortality rate reaching 60% at the end of the experiment. Finally, it is important to highlight that the \u2206fmaA::fmaA strain was significantly more lethal than the Wt and \u2206fmaA strain. Considering the biological variability observed in the concentration of fumagillin secreted by the strains, the conidia suspensions used for the infections were for their specific ability to produce fumagillin by UHPLC at the same time. This revealed that the \u2206fmaA::fmaA cells used in these in vivo experiments were able to produce more fumagillin than the Wt strain, but the differences were not statistically significant. The \u2206fmaA strain used did not produce fumagillin, as expected.", "The fungal burden was slightly higher in mice infected with the \u2206fmaA than in the others (Figure 7B). However, the average fungal burden of the mice infected with \u2206fmaA was measured from the 50% of mice died during the first four days, which presented high CFUs values because, surprisingly, in the lungs of almost all the mice (4 out of 5) that survived the experiment, CFUs were not found. In contrast, mice infected with the Wt and the \u2206fmaA::fmaA strains presented variable CFUs counts without a clear relationship between the day of the death and the fungal burden, and even survivor mice presented high CFUs values, except for one.", "Finally, the symptoms of the infected mice were monitored using a scale of 0 to 10, showing that mice infected with the \u2206fmaA::fmaA strain presented significantly more severe symptomatology than those infected with the Wt and the \u2206fmaA strain (Figure 7C). From day 16 to the end of the experiment, the clinical score values were similar between all the groups. In contrast to the clinical score, mice weight (Figure 7D) was the same regardless of the fungal strain used to infect the mice."]
