["2. Results", "2.1. Identification of the ahb Biosynthesis Gene Cluster", "The S. argillaceus genome has been previously sequenced and mined using the antiSMASH bioinformatics tool version 3.0.2 [6,8], which has allowed identifying 31 BGCs [17]. The newest version of that program (version 6.0) [7] identified the same number of BGCs, although with some differences (see Table S1 in Supplementary Materials): version 3.0.2 predicted two unknown BGCs (cluster three and four), while version 6.0 predicted the existence of only one BGC at those positions (cluster four; NRPS-like). In addition, version 6.0 predicted the existence of a BGC (cluster 21) that had not been identified before. In an attempt to identify additional BGCs in S. argillaceus genome undetected with any antiSMASH version, we have mined its genome looking for SARP encoding genes using Curated Blast software [21]. Eleven SARP genes were identified, four located at BGCs (mtm, arp, and BGC 28), and seven outside any BGC previously identified by antiSMASH. Analysis of the DNA region surrounding two of these SARP-encoding genes closely located at the chromosome allowed us to identify a new BGC (named ahb, see below) not uncovered in previous analyses (Figure 1). This new cluster was located between clusters 17 and 18 (Table S1) detected by antiSMASH, at the right arm of the chromosome. To determine if similar gene clusters were present in other Streptomyces strains and to propose limits to ahb BGC, each ahb gene product was compared with others in databases using BlastP analyses [22] to identify similar proteins. Then, those coding genes were located in the corresponding Streptomyces genomes, and their positions were identified to determine if they were clustered in the same DNA region. In this way, five BGCs were identified (named as rah, oah, dah, pah, and tah, in Table S2 and Figure 1) in different Streptomyces strains, which showed high similarity to the ahb BGC: rah from Streptomyces sp. AC555_RSS877 (NZ_JAGMUK010000018.1: nucleotides 10109 to 46535); oah from S. roseolus JCM 4411 (NZ_BMTV01000035.1: nucleotides 66046 to 66695; NZ_BMTV01000014.1: nucleotides 1 to 30426); dah from S. adustus NBRC 109810 (NZ_VJZD01000001.1: nucleotides 222 to 14383; NZ_VJZD01000132.1: nucleotides 5002 to 25986); pah from S. prasinopilosus CGMCC 4.3504 (NZ_FMZK01000002.1: nucleotides 53452 to 89451); and tah from Streptomyces sp. T\u00fc 3180 (NZ_WOXS01000002.1: nucleotides 6715158 to 6753232). All these clusters showed high synteny to cluster ahb, displaying the same gene organization, and only showing few differences: the absence of one or two genes in some BGCs (ahbP1 homologous gene was absent in oah and pah; ahbS in dah) or the presence of an additional gene in tah BGC (WP_159536573). Based on these comparisons, ahbO1 and ahbT3 are proposed as the limits of the ahb cluster. A phylogenetic analysis of the above-mentioned Streptomyces strains was carried out based on 82 housekeeping genes [23] (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials). This analysis indicated that those strains were not closely related among them.", "The ahb cluster would span 36.48 kb and contain 31 open reading frames (orfs) (Figure 1 and Table S2). It would include genes for the biosynthesis of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) (ahbH and ahbI); acyl-CoA ligases (ahbL1 and ahbL2); oxygenases (ahbO1 to ahbO4); reductases (ahbK1 to ahbK5); methyltransferases (ahbM1 to ahbM4); carbohydrate kinases (ahbP1 and ahbP2); a cupin domain-containing protein (ahbC); a lyase (ahbS); proteins related to an activated methyl-cycle (ahbA and ahbF); regulatory proteins (ahbR1 to ahbR5); and transport proteins (ahbT1 to ahbT3). The presence of ahbH and ahbI suggested that compounds encoded by these ahb BGCs contained a 3,4-AHBA moiety [24] (Figure 2; see Section 3).", "2.2. Identification of Compounds Encoded by the ahb Cluster", "To identify compounds encoded by ahb, several approaches were tried. The first was the generation of two independent deleted mutants in which a DNA region from the ahb BGC was replaced by an apramycin resistance gene (Figure 1): (i) S. argillaceus \u0394AHBA. Using pHZ\u0394asu (Table 1) genes ahbH and ahbI were deleted and replaced by an apramycin resistance cassette; and (ii) S. argillaceus \u0394R2K3 in which genes from ahbR2 to ahbK3 were deleted by using pHZ\u0394asu1705 (Table 1). The genotypes of these two mutant strains were confirmed by PCR (see Figures S2 and S3 in Supplementary Materials). Comparison of UPLC chromatograms of broth extracts from the wild type strain and from these two mutants did not show any differential peak, suggesting that cluster ahb was silent.", "Secondly, three genes (ahbI, ahbH, and ahbL2) were overexpressed in S. argillaceus wild type strain using pEM4T-AHBA (Table 1). These genes would encode enzymes for the biosynthesis of 3,4-AHBA (AhbH and AhbI) and for its activation by adenylation (AhbL2). UPLC analyses of metabolite profiles of cultures from S. argillaceus (pEM4T-AHBA) and S. argillaceus pEM4T (as control) extracted with n-butanol or ethyl acetate, revealed several peaks that were present in the former and absent in the latter (Figure 3A). Some of these compounds were also produced when cultures of S. argillaceus wild type strain were fed with 3,4-AHBA, while those that were absent in cultures of S. argillaceus \u0394R2K3 were fed with the same compound (Figure 3B). This suggested that those differential peaks contained compounds derived from 3,4-AHBA, whose biosynthesis would require the genes deleted in S. argillaceus \u0394R2K3. The major compound 1 detected in n-butanol extracts at 360 nm was purified from cultures of S. argillaceus (pEM4T-AHBA) grown in R5A, and structurally characterized (see below). It corresponded to a hybrid new compound constituted by two moieties, a 3,4-AHBA and an ARP compound [17,25,26], and it was given the name ahbamycin 18 (AHBA18) (Figure 4).", "The third approach was overexpression of regulatory genes from the ahb cluster. Individual overexpression of ahbR2 and ahbR3 that encode AfsR/SARP putative transcriptional activators did not result in production of any differential compound. Then, we jointly co-expressed both SARP-encoding genes, and ahbR4 that encodes a protein with Ada_Zn_binding and HTH_ARAC domains and is located downstream of the 3,4-AHBA encoding genes. These three regulatory genes were cloned under the control of the erythromycin resistance promoter, and the resultant plasmid pREGT (Table 1) was introduced in S. argillaceus WT, S. argillaceus \u0394AHBA, and S. argillaceus \u0394R2K3. The resultant recombinant strains (S. argillaceus WT-pREGT; S. argillaceus \u0394AHBA-pREGT; and S. argillaceus \u0394R2K3-pREGT) were cultivated in R5A and SM10 media, and cultures were extracted with different organic solvents.", "In all culture and extraction conditions, several peaks were detected in extracts from S. argillaceus WT-pREGT that were absent in those from S. argillaceus \u0394R2K3-pREGT and/or S. argillaceus \u0394AHBA-pREGT (Figure 5). Production of those peaks was recovered in S. argillaceus \u0394AHBA-pREGT when the deleted genes in this strain were expressed in trans using plasmid pSETeAHBAHyg (Table 1; see Figure S4). This confirmed the involvement of ahb BGC in the production of those differential peaks. These new compounds were produced better in SM10 cultures, and best extracted with ethyl acetate containing 1% formic acid. Consequently, these conditions were used thereafter. Compounds from peaks 2\u20138 were purified from S. argillaceus WT-pREGT and were named AHB74 to AHB77 (peaks 5 to 8), and AHB118 to AHB120 (peaks 2 to 4) (Figure 4 and Figure 5).", "2.3. Structural Elucidation and Bioactivity of Ahbamycins", "The structure of the isolated ahbamycins was established by UV/vis (DAD), MS, and NMR spectroscopic analyses (see Supplementary Materials).", "AHB18 was assigned the molecular formula C19H18N2O3 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 323.1396 (calcd. for C19H19N2O3+ = 323.1390, \u0394 = 1.9 ppm), indicating twelve degrees of unsaturation. Its UV/vis (DAD) spectrum suggested the presence of an aromatic or conjugated \u03c0 system. Analysis of the 1H and HSQC NMR spectra indicated a total of fifteen non-exchangeable hydrogens. The HSQC spectrum revealed the presence of one aliphatic methyl group, two methylenes (one likely bound to nitrogen), and eight sp2 methines. Such structural features are not compatible with any of the compounds included in the Dictionary of Natural Products [27] having the same molecular formula, confirming the novelty of the compound. Additional 2D NMR spectra, including COSY, NOESY, HMBC (the standard 1H-13C), and 1H-15N HMBC, were acquired to determine the compound structure. The key correlations observed in the COSY spectrum identified the different spin systems, which were connected via the long-range correlations observed in both the 1H-13C HMBC and 1H-15N HMBC spectra (Figure 6), which likewise unambiguously determined the position of the enolic oxygen and amino groups to finally establish the connectivity of the compound. Key NOESY correlations (Figure 6) allowed determining an E stereochemistry for both bonds in the exocyclic chain (\u03945,8 and \u03949,10) and further supported the proposed connectivity. The compound contains a 3,4-AHBA moiety interestingly conjugated with an ARP subunit, confirming the proposed existence of crosstalk between their two biosynthetic pathways.", "AHB74 was assigned the molecular formula C11H13NO4 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 224.0918 (calcd. for C11H14NO4+ = 224.0917, \u0394 = 0.4 ppm), indicating six degrees of unsaturation. Its UV/vis (DAD) spectrum suggested the presence of an aromatic or conjugated \u03c0 system. 1D 1H and 2D NMR spectra (including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) were acquired to determine the structure of the purified compound. Surprisingly, the 1H and HSQC revealed more than a single component in the sample. A possible equilibrium in solution between different interconverting species (in slow exchange on the NMR time scale) would account for such observation. Detailed analysis of the NMR spectra revealed this hypothesis to be correct. To sort out the chemical structure of such equilibrating species, the elucidation started from the aliphatic methine observed at \u03b4H 4.12, \u03b4C 58.1 ppm. Observed key COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 6) indicated that such methine is directly bound to a methyl group, a carbonyl (from a methyl ketone) and, based on its 13C chemical shift, a nitrogen. This nitrogen corresponds to the amino functionality of a 3,4-AHBA moiety according to the key 2D NMR correlations observed in the 2D spectra (Figure 6). The determined connectivity of the first component possesses one chiral center whose stereochemistry remained undetermined. Once we established the structure of this component, it was easier to determine that the other sets of signals correspond to the two possible epimers that originate in the cyclization via nucleophilic attack of the phenol group of the 3,4-AHBA subunit to the ketone carbonyl, rendering two diastereomeric hemiketals whose connectivity was unambiguously corroborated by the observed key COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 6). The presence of a hemiketal functionality in the molecules is additionally corroborated by the existence of 13C signals at 96.4 and 98.5 ppm corresponding to both stereoisomers at C-2\u2032. A stereospecific assignment of the signals of each epimer was not carried out.", "AHB75 was assigned the molecular formula C15H10N2O5 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 299.0662 (calcd. for C15H11N2O5+ = 299.0662, \u0394 = 0 ppm), indicating twelve degrees of unsaturation. Its UV/vis (DAD) spectrum alongside the molecular formula suggested a high degree of conjugation. A search of the molecular formula in the Dictionary of Natural Products [27] retrieved just four possible candidates, all of them compatible with the UV/vis spectrum obtained. To ensure successful dereplication, a set of NMR spectra (1H, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) was acquired. Analysis of the 1H and HSQC NMR spectra indicated a total of eight non-exchangeable hydrogens corresponding to five sp2 methines and one aliphatic methyl group from an acetyl substituent according to its chemical shift. These features are compatible with the structure of carboxyexfoliazone [28], also known as umicyn A [29], which interestingly contains a 3,4-AHBA substructural moiety. Analysis of the key correlations observed in the COSY and HMBC spectra (Figure 6) and comparison with the reported NMR data for carboxyexfoliazone [28] unambiguously confirmed its identity.", "AHB76 was assigned the molecular formula C12H15NO4 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 238.1075 (calcd. for C12H16NO4+ = 238.1074, \u0394 = 0.4 ppm), indicating six degrees of unsaturation. The UV/vis (DAD) spectrum was identical to that of AHBA74, anticipating a homologous chemical structure containing one additional CH2 unit, according to the determined molecular formula. The NMR spectra (1H, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) confirmed the expected structural relationship and showed the same pattern of signals for interconverting species at equilibrium. Analysis of the NMR information, especially key COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 6), and comparison with the NMR spectra of AHBA74 revealed that in this case the molecules are identical by just replacing the methyl ketone in AHB74 by an ethyl ketone in AHB76. Regarding the equilibrating hemiketals, a stereospecific assignment of the signals of each epimer was not carried out.", "AHB77 was assigned the molecular formula C17H12N2O4 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 309.0875 (calcd. for C17H13N2O4+ = 309.0870, \u0394 = 1.6 ppm), indicating thirteen degrees of unsaturation. Its UV/vis (DAD) spectrum suggested the presence of conjugated \u03c0 systems. A search of the molecular formula in the Dictionary of Natural Products [27] retrieved 6 possible candidates which could account for the UV/vis spectrum obtained. As none of them contained a 3,4-AHBA substructural moiety, 1D 1H and 2D NMR spectra (including COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC) were acquired to determine the structure of the purified compound. Analysis of the 1H and HSQC NMR spectra indicated the target compound contains three exchangeable hydrogens. The HSQC spectrum revealed the presence of nine methine groups, one aliphatic and eight of aromatic nature. Detailed analysis of COSY and HMBC key correlations (Figure 6) determined the compound\u2019s connectivity, showing on the one hand the presence of one aromatic (benzene) ring with a 1,3,4 substitution pattern that turned out to correspond to the expected 3,4-AHBA substructural moiety, and on the other hand an indole unit moiety which is connected to an imine carbon contained in a heterocyclic ring fused to the 3,4-AHBA moiety. Such heterocycle is closed via a hemiacetal (according to a \u03b4C of 85.7 for C-8), resembling the ketal closure found in AHB74 and AHB76. Key NOESY correlations further corroborated the established connectivity. The stereochemistry of the hemiacetal chiral center remained unassigned.", "AHB118 was assigned the molecular formula C10H11NO5 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 226.0707 (calcd. for C12H12NO5+ = 226.0710, \u0394 = 1.3 ppm), indicating six degrees of unsaturation. The UV/vis (DAD) spectrum was identical to those of AHB74 and AHB76, anticipating a closely related chemical structure. None of the ten compounds listed in the Dictionary of Natural Products [27] with such a molecular formula contain a 3,4-AHBA substructural moiety. A set of NMR spectra (1H, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) was acquired to elucidate the structure of the purified compound. Interestingly, the 1H and HSQC revealed two sets of signals, very close in resonance frequency. Detailed analysis of the NMR spectra confirmed it. To determine the structure of the equilibrating species, the elucidation started from each of the aliphatic methine observed in the region at \u03b4H 5.25\u20135.46, \u03b4C 89.05\u201391.0 ppm (C-1\u2032). Their chemical shift indicated that such methine signals belong to each of two epimeric hemiacetals in equilibrium, analogous to the epimeric hemiketals found for AHB74 and AHB76. As expected, the determined connectivity of the hemiacetals contains a 3,4-AHBA moiety. Interestingly, in this case the signals of the open aldehyde from which those hemiacetals would be originated are not detected, indicating an equilibrium completely shifted towards the hemiacetalic forms. COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 6) additionally confirmed the fragment C-1\u2032/C-2\u2032/C-3\u2032 and the linkage of C-1\u2032 to C4 via an oxygen and of C-2\u2032 to C-3 via a nitrogen bridge. The stereochemistry remained undetermined and a stereospecific assignment of the signals of each epimer was not carried out.", "AHB119 was assigned the molecular formula C9H9NO4 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 196.0604 (calcd. for C9H10NO4+ = 196.0604, \u0394 = 0 ppm), indicating six degrees of unsaturation. Its UV/vis (DAD) spectrum suggested the presence of an aromatic or conjugated \u03c0 system. The molecular formula matches that of an acetylated derivative of 3,4-AHBA. To determine the structure a set of NMR spectra (1H, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) was acquired. The 1H and HSQC spectra revealed the presence in the molecule of three sp2 methines and one methyl group with the characteristic chemical shift of an acetyl group. Straightforward analysis of the key COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 6) rendered the structure of the compound, which corresponded to the N-acetyl derivative of 3,4-AHBA.", "AHB120 was assigned the molecular formula C10H11NO4 based on the observed [M + H]+ ion at m/z = 210.0760 (calcd. for C10H12NO4+ = 210.0761, \u0394 = 0.5 ppm), indicating six degrees of unsaturation. Its UV/vis (DAD) spectrum was identical to that of AHB119 and the molecular formula also suggested a possible homologous derivative of AHB119. Analysis of the set of NMR spectra (1H, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) acquired revealed identical aromatic signals, corresponding to the 3,4-AHBA moiety. The key COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 6) indicated that the compound corresponds to the N-propionyl derivative of 3,4-AHBA.", "The structure of all AHBs confirms that they all derive from 3,4-AHBA. This is a building block present in different metabolites such as grixazone, bagremycin and ferroverdin, the manumycin family of compounds, cremeomycin, or platensimycin and platencin [30,31,32,33,34,35]. Many of these compounds show antibiotic and antitumour activities, such as platensimycin and platencin that are inhibitors of bacterial type II fatty acid synthases [35]. The antibiotic activity of all AHB compounds was tested by bioassay. Among all compounds, only AHB75 (also known as carboxyexfoliazone or umicyn A) showed some antibiotic activity."]
