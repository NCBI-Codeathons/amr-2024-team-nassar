["2. Results and Discussion", "2.1. Isolation and Characterization of 8,8\u2032-Bijuglone (1)", "Zasmidium pseudotsugae isolated from the needles of P. menziesii var. menziesii was grown on 2% malt-based agar for six months. The plate was then extracted with ethyl acetate and the agar culture extract was analyzed by LC/MS which revealed only one dominant metabolite eluting at a retention time of 21 min (Figure S1). Negative ionization mode gave an m/z value of 345.0 for [M \u2212 H]\u2212 and 712.9 m/z for [2M \u2212 2H + Na]\u2212, while positive ionization mode detected an m/z value of 347.1 for [M + H]+. The compound was purified by semipreparative HPLC using an isocratic elution of 50% ACN/50% H2O both with 0.05% formic acid. The compound was identified as 8,8\u2032-bijuglone (1) by 1D and 2D NMR (Table 1 and Figures S3\u2013S7) and referenced to existing NMR data from synthesized 8,8\u2032-bijugone [26].", "The 13C NMR spectrum displayed two quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 190.83 ppm and 184.89 ppm) corresponding to the two ketones, a phenol carbon (\u03b4C 161.91 ppm) corresponding to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl, three quaternary aromatic carbons, and four aryl hydrocarbons. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited an intramolecular hydrogen bonding proton singlet (\u03b4H 12.49 ppm) and four aryl hydrocarbon doublets. Determination of the structure of 1 required 2D NMR correlation experiments including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. Utilizing COSY, two distinct spin systems were observed corresponding to two separate sets of aryl hydrocarbons coupling to each other. The doublet of 3-H (\u03b4H 6.92 ppm) correlated with the doublet of 2-H (\u03b4H 6.71 ppm) and the doublet of 7-H (\u03b4H 7.24 ppm) correlated with the doublet of 6-H (\u03b4H 7.31 ppm). The COSY correlations were connected with key HMBC correlations. The aryl hydrocarbons of 3-H (\u03b4H 6.92 ppm) and 2-H (\u03b4H 6.71 ppm) exhibited HMBC correlations with the two aryl ketones 1-C and 4-C (\u03b4C 190.8 ppm and 184.9 ppm), respectively. HMBC correlations between the hydroxyl 5-OH (\u03b4H 12.49 ppm) and the quaternary aromatic carbon atoms (\u03b4C 115.5 ppm and \u03b4C 124.8 ppm) supported the intramolecular hydrogen bonding next to the aryl ketone carbon atom 4-C (\u03b4C 190.8 ppm). The last two aryl hydrocarbons 6-H and 7-H (\u03b4H 7.31 ppm and \u03b4H 7.24 ppm) showed HMBC correlations with the quaternary aromatic carbon atoms 5-C and 8-C (\u03b4C 161.9 ppm and \u03b4C 135.2 ppm) establishing these two aryl hydrocarbons next to the phenol carbon (\u03b4C 161.9 ppm) versus next to the aryl ketone carbons. Since the LC/MS analysis indicted a molecular mass of 346 g/mol, the NMR spectra of 1 suggested that the quinone is a symmetrical dimer, each half containing a hydrogen bonded hydroxyl and two pairs of o-coupled aryl hydrocarbons. Thus, the connectivity of the two halves must be either a 6,6\u2032- or 8,8\u2032-linkage. Based on the HMBC correlations, \u03b4H 7.24 (H-7,7\u2032) and 6.71 ppm (H-2,2\u2032) with \u03b4C 128.3 ppm (C-8a,8a\u2019) as well as \u03b4H 12.49 (OH-5,5\u2032), 7.31 (H-6,6\u2032) and 6.92 ppm (H-3,3\u2032) with \u03b4C 115.5 ppm (C-4a,4a\u2019), the 8,8\u2032-linkage was suggested. Previous work by H. Laatsch showed differences in the UV absorption maxima for synthetic 8,8\u2032-bijuglone (437 nm) versus 6,6\u2032-bijuglone (445 nm) as well as a larger downfield shifts of the OH-signal from monomer (\u03b4H 10.83) to the dimer of \u2206\u03b4H of 0.7 ppm for 8,8\u2032-linkage as observed here [26,27]. The 8,8\u2032-dimeric naphthoquinone represents a unique case where the proton and carbon environments are chemically and magnetically equivalent. Other fungal 1,4-naphthoquinone dimers are known that demonstrate chemical and magnetically equivalent environments in NMR experiments, including maritinone and mamegakinone [28]. Biosynthetically, biaryl natural products can be constructed from an oxidative coupling of polyketide originated monomers catalyzed by a laccase, peroxidase, or cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) [29]. In plants, however, most axially connected naphthoquinones are derived from the shikimate pathway, as shown for maritinone and mamegakinone, isolated from persimmon fruit tree Diospyros maritima [30,31]. Naphthoquinone biosynthesis is common in microorganism and plants and can hint to either parallel chemical evolution or gene transfer events. For many plant metabolites, the producing organism might be found in endophytes [32]. Following the established structure of 1, we wanted to determine if the fungus produced and retained 1 in its cells or if the compound was secreted. Extracts derived from fungal cells and supernatant of a liquid culture were analyzed by LC/MS. The [M-H]- ion (extract-ion chromatogram at 345 m/z) was only observed in the cell extract and not in the supernatant, suggesting that 1 is kept intracellularly and not secreted into the medium.", "2.2. Genome Analysis of Z. pseudotsugae", "A 43.4 Mb draft genome for Z. pseudotsugae was submitted to the genome mining software antiSMASH to generate and identify BGCs (Figure 1) [33]. A total of 36 BGCs were predicted, including 17 type 1 polyketide synthases (TIPKS), 14 non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like), two terpenes, one ribosomally synthesized peptide (fungal-RiPP) and two hybrid pathways. Of these, a few BGCs showed a match for published small molecules when searched against the Minimum Information of the Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) database against characterized gene clusters [34]. Some matches exhibited 100% similarity to known compounds, including (-)-mellein (T1PKS), cercosporin (NRPS), aureobasidin A1 (NRPS), phomopsins (fungal-RiPP), and elsinochrome A (T1PKS) (Figure 1). Interestingly, cercosporin and elsinochrome, resemble key features of 8,8\u2032-bijuglone (1) (highlighted in blue in Figure 1) suggesting that 1 could possibly be a precursor or shunt metabolite related to these biosynthetic pathways. Cercosporin and elsinochrome A are both light-dependent, toxic pigments from fungi. Perylenequinones are believed to play key roles as virulence factors in the chemical interactions between plant-pathogenic fungi and their hosts. Both metabolites are able to absorb light energy and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). A high amount of these toxins is reported to induce necrotic lesions on citrus and tobacco leaves [35,36,37]. 8,8\u2032-bijuglone might exhibit similar functions in planta.", "2.3. Antimicrobial Activity", "The compound 1 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) BAA-41, Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 49343), and Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 14468), two Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442), and a fungal human pathogen Candida albicans (ATCC 90027) (Table 2). Since quinones like p-quinones and 1,4-naphthoquinones are known to be unstable in DMSO stock solutions due to their apparent redox sensitivity [38,39,40,41], compound 1 was solubilized in ethanol for antimicrobial activity tests. Against MRSA and B. subtilis, treatments with 1 at 125 \u03bcg/mL [360 \u00b5M] were moderately antimicrobial, yielding in 29.3% and 32.6% bacterial cell survival respectively, compared to 100% cell survival for vehicle control wells (Table 2). Other compounds similar to 1 have been reported to have antibacterial activity, including 8,8\u2032-biplumbaign (also called maritinone) [30,42], chitranone [30] and diospyrin [43].", "2.4. Cytotoxicity Activity", "The fungal extract of Z. pseudotsugae was tested against the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116 (ATCC\u00ae CCL-247TM) in a single dose MTT based cell viability assay. The extract showed potent activity with 16% cell survival when tested at 10 \u00b5g/mL. Since the extract was highly enriched with 1, we next purified 8,8\u2032-bijuglone and established the IC50 value against HCT-116 to be 130 \u00b5M (0.13 mM) [45 \u00b5g/mL], exhibiting only weak cytotoxicity (Figure 2). Compound 1 was submitted to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for evaluation against their NCI-60 cancer cell line panel [44]. The compound showed selective, lethal activity against all six leukemia cancer cell lines when tested at 10 \u00b5M (Figure 3). In order to obtain an IC50 value against a panel of leukemia cancer cell lines, Dr. Tom O\u2019Hare and his team at Huntsman Cancer Institute, Utah tested the compound against eight acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines different from the ones used by the NCI. Here, purified 8,8\u2032-bijuglone had no effect against the tested cell lines, most likely due to its redox sensitivity and limited solubility in ethanol when tested from a 10 mM stock solution. We cannot rule out that a highly potent compound in minute quantities is causing the activity in the extract. However, compound content on the extract was assessed by measuring the area under the curve of the UV absorbance at 210 nm, which exhibited 84% 8,8\u2032-bijuglone with the remaining 20% being derived from solvent and media peaks, and 90% purity was detected at 254 and 280 nm. No other metabolites were detected using light scattering detection nor via the mass detector, but this does not rule out another bioactive metabolite. Noteworthy, fungal cultures extracted with ethyl acetate (pH = 5.5) and kept neat retained potent cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity over time."]
