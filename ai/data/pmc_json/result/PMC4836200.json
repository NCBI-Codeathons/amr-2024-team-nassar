["Results", "Rare codons are present in the antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters of P. protegens Pf-5", "The arginine (Arg) codon AGA is the rarest codon in the annotated coding sequences (CDSs) of the Pf-5 genome, occurring at the level of 9.9 per 1000 Arg codons and 0.6 per 1000 codons (Table 2; Paulsen et al., 2005). AGA is present in 917 genes, which comprise approximately 15% of the 6144 annotated genes in the Pf-5 genome (Table 2). Six of the seven antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters of Pf-5 include at least one AGA codon and 40% of the genes present in the seven gene clusters have an AGA codon (Table 2). The usage frequency of the AGA codon within four antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters exceeds the average usage frequency of this rare codon in the genome of Pf-5 (Figure 1). Further, analysis revealed that each of the top six rarest codons in the Pf-5 genome is present in the six or more of the seven antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters (Table 2). Fifty five of the 60 genes (92%) in the seven gene clusters have at least one of the six rarest codons of the Pf-5 genome (Table 2).

The plt cluster consists of genes with regulatory, biosynthetic, and transport functions (Figure 2A; Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999). It has been noted that pltR, which encodes a LysR family regulator required for transcriptional activation of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes, has a higher frequency of rare codons than do the other genes in the plt gene cluster (Figure 2C; Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999). pltR contains all 61 amino acid-encoding codons except CGT, a preferred Arg codon with a usage frequency of 9.2 codons per 1000 codons (Table 3). To determine if the rare codons in pltR influence pyoluteorin production, we made a derivative of Pf-5 having a modified pltR in which 35 different types of rare codons were substituted with preferred synonymous codons, resulting in alterations to 126 of the 343 codons in pltR (Figure 3A). Among the 35 optimized codons, 23 were completely substituted (Table 3). 12 codons were partially substituted (Table 3) because complete codon modification was predicted to result in complex secondary structures of DNA oligonucleotides that were difficult to synthesize. The resultant codon-modified strain, LK298, produced 15 times more pyoluteorin than did the wild-type strain Pf-5 (Figure 3B). The final cell density of the 24 h culture of LK298 was slightly lower than the wild-type (Figure 3B), which is consistent with our previous observation of an inverse relationship between the amount of pyoluteorin produced in a Pf-5 culture and the culture's final cell density (Kidarsa et al., 2011). However, the slight growth difference did not affect the result that codon optimization in pltR promoted pyoluteorin production.", "Figure 2Distribution of rare codons in the pyoluteorin gene cluster of P. protegens Pf-5.

Collectively, the four derivative strains (LK361, LK362, LK363, and LK364) had substitutions in all 23 codons that were completely substituted in LK298. Quantification of pyoluteorin by HPLC indicated that all four derivative strains produced significantly higher amounts of pyoluteorin relative to wild-type Pf-5 (Figure 3B).", "Among the modified codons of the pltR-derivative strains, the AGA codon drew our interest because AGA is the rarest codon in strain Pf-5, is overrepresented in pltR (Figure 2D), and was substituted with preferred synonymous codons in both LK298 and LK364, which overproduce pyoluteorin (Figure 3B). Therefore, we made a Pf-5 derivative strain (LK365) in which only the AGA rare codon (six copies) was substituted with preferred synonymous codons in pltR. Quantification of pyoluteorin showed that LK365 produced more pyoluteorin than the wild-type (Figure 3B). Thus, our result indicated that substituting the AGA rare codon of pltR with a synonymous preferred codon increased pyoluteorin production in Pf-5.", "Overexpression of the gene encoding tRNAUCUArg increases pyoluteorin production", "We have shown that the codon AGA in pltR is involved in pyoluteorin production, so it is reasonable to propose that the abundance of the cognate tRNA deciphering the AGA codon will influence the pltR-mediated regulation of pyoluteorin production. Of the five genes encoding tRNAArg in Pf-5, PFL_3991 encodes the tRNAUCUArg deciphering the AGA rare codon. Our repeated efforts to delete PFL_3991 from the chromosome of Pf-5 failed (data not shown), possibly due to an essential role of the encoded tRNA in this bacterium. As an alternative approach, we overexpressed PFL_3991 by cloning it downstream of a constitutive promoter in plasmid pME6010. Overexpression of PFL_3991 significantly increased pyoluteorin production by Pf-5 (Figure 4). These data, in line with the result that optimizing Arg codons in pltR promoted the pyoluteorin production (Figure 3B), indicated that biased Arg codon usage regulates pyoluteorin biosynthesis.", "Figure 4Overexpression of the tRNAUCUArg encoding gene PFL_3991 increased pyoluteorin production by P. protegens Pf-5.

Both the wild-type gfp and the AGA-codon modified gfp genes were fused with the promoter of the pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis gene prnA (Figure 5A). The GFP activities expressed from the resultant transcriptional fusions prnA::gfp(CGC) and prnA::gfp(AGA) in wild-type Pf-5 were assayed in 24 h cultures grown in NBGly. As shown in Figure 5B, Pf-5 harboring prnA::gfp(CGC) expressed significantly higher levels of GFP fluorescence than the strain harboring prnA::gfp(AGA), although both transcriptional fusions were expressed from the same promoter. These results indicated that optimizing the AGA rare codon of gfp promoted GFP expression, thereby providing a second line of evidence for the importance of the AGA rare codon in gene expression in P. protegens Pf-5.", "Figure 5Substitution of the AGA rare codon of gfp with a synonymous preferred codon increased GFP activity in Pf-5.

Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the AGA codon optimization increases PltR levels in the bacterial cell, which in turn enhances the transcription of pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes and the production of pyoluteorin. We attempted to test this proposed mechanism directly by quantifying the PltR levels in the bacterial cell but our repeated attempts were not successful due to degradation of PltR in our experiments (data not shown). As an alternative, we evaluated the expression of pltL (Figure 2A), which is regulated by the transcriptional regulator PltR (Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999; Yan et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012), as an indirect indicator of PltR activity. To this end, we constructed a plasmid-borne transcriptional fusion of gfp to the promoter of pltL (pltL::gfp) (Figure 3C, inside diagram), and introduced it into Pf-5 as well as derivative strains having codon substitutions in pltR. GFP fluorescence level expressed from pltL::gfp was significantly higher in LK298, LK364, and LK365, in which AGA rare codons were optimized, than in wild-type Pf-5 (Figure 3C). Similarly, LK362 and LK363 had a higher level of GFP fluorescence from pltL::gfp than did wild-type Pf-5. The difference in GFP fluorescence levels of LK361, which has a pltR with AGA codons, and Pf-5 was not significant (Figure 3C) although LK361 did produce more pyoluteorin than the wild-type strain (Figure 3A). The increased promoter activity of pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene pltL in five of the codon-modified Pf-5 strains is consistent with the higher pyoluteorin production of these strains compared to the wild-type (Figure 3B). These data support the hypothesis that the presence of the rare AGA codon in pltR results in reduced levels of PltR, which in turn regulates pyoluteorin production by controlling the transcription of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes.", "The rare AGA codon is present in genes with diverse predicted functions in the genome of Pf-5", "The observation that the AGA rare codon regulates pyoluteorin production prompted us to investigate the distribution of the AGA codon in the genome of Pf-5. Strain Pf-5 has 917 AGA-containing genes, which comprise ca. 15% of the protein-coding genes in the genome (Table 2). These 917 AGA-containing genes fall into all of the JCVI functional role categories (Figure 6, Supplemental file 2), indicating that AGA-containing genes collectively have broad functions in the physiology of the bacterial cell. In the genome of Pf-5, the functional groups \u201cRegulatory functions\u201d and \u201cTranscription\u201d have 91 and 14 AGA-containing genes, respectively. Many genes predicted to encode sigma factors, sigma factor-associated regulators, and other regulatory proteins were among the AGA-containing genes within these two functional groups. Examples include rpoN (sigma-54, \u03c354) and genes predicted to encode four sigma-54 dependent transcriptional regulators (PFL_1636, 5041, 5309, 5468), five sigma-70 factors (PFL_1373, 2746, 3156, 4041, 5720), and seven GGDEF-containing proteins (PFL_0087, 2458, 3325, 3596, 4322, 4715, 5054). The \u201cCell envelope\u201d functional group contains 86 AGA-containing genes. This functional group contains large numbers of genes encoding proteins involved in type I or IV pilus formation and polysaccharide synthesis. For example, three AGA-containing genes (PFL_3592, 3593, 3594) encode type I pilus proteins, and six AGA-containing genes (pilCLNOV, PFL_5311) encode type IV pilus proteins. In addition, at least 14 AGA-containing genes (pslDJC, wbpML, lptC, PFL_0526, 3082, 5099, 5100, 5101, 5102, 5103, 5104) are involved in polysaccharide synthesis. Representatives of the \u201cCellular processes\u201d functional group include genes encoding catalase KatE and KatG, and the multidrug resistance protein PmpM.
