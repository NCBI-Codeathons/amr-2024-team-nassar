["RESULTS", "BER and NER provide limited resistance to YTM", "We previously showed that AlkD provides Bacillus anthracis cells with a small degree of protection from YTM toxicity9. Because NER has been shown to provide resistance to CC-1065 and analogs of the duocarmycins24\u201326, we wanted to compare the relative efficiencies of AlkD-mediated BER and UvrA-mediated NER in YTM resistance. Using a series of B. anthracis deletion strains that lacked either alkD, uvrA, or both, we monitored growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of YTM. In the absence of YTM, none of the deletion strains displayed a growth defect (Fig. 2a,b). However, in the presence of YTM, all deletion strains exhibited varying degrees of increased sensitivity (Fig. 2a,b). The \u0394uvrA\u0394alkD strain was the most sensitive, and showed a pronounced growth defect at 2 nM YTM, a concentration at which the other deletion strains showed normal growth. At 5\u20139 nM YTM, growth of the \u0394uvrA and \u0394alkD strains was inhibited beyond that of the wild-type strain, with \u0394uvrA cells showing greater sensitivity than \u0394alkD cells. Strikingly, all strains, including wild-type B. anthracis, were markedly inhibited at 20 nM YTM. These results indicate that NER and AlkD-mediated BER provide similarly weak levels of protection against YTM toxicity.", "YTMA lesions dramatically stabilize duplex DNA", "To understand the molecular basis for the extreme toxicity of YTM and the resistance of YTMA lesions to repair by both BER and NER in cells, we characterized yatakemycinylated DNA using a combination of crystallographic and biophysical methods. The circular dichroism spectrum of YTMA-DNA showed negative and positive bands at ~240 and 280 nm, respectively, characteristic of B-form DNA27 (Fig. 3a). The two additional bands present above 300 nm in the spectrum of YTMA-DNA are likely caused by dichroism of the YTM moiety itself, which produces a broad peak centered at ~360 nm in the YTMA-DNA absorbance spectrum (Fig. 3b). However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the spectral differences between yatakemycinylated and unmodified DNA, at least in part, reflect structural changes in the DNA induced by the YTMA lesion. Efforts to determine the structure of YTMA-DNA by X-ray crystallography generated crystals that produced smeared reflections, indicative of the partial lateral and angular disorder present in fibers (Fig. 3c). The fiber diffraction pattern from YTMA-DNA is unmistakably representative of B-form DNA, which can be identified by a repeating diamond pattern and layer lines that form a distinct central cross (lines 1\u20133 and 5) and intense meridian arcs (line 10)28\u201330. Thus, the circular dichroism spectrum and the fiber diffraction pattern of YTMA-DNA are both consistent with a B-DNA structure.", "Based on our crystallographic and biophysical data, we constructed a model of YTMA-DNA by manually docking the YTM moiety of yatakemycinyladenine (YTMAde) nucleobase from a crystallographic AlkD/AP-DNA product complex (described below) into ideal B-form DNA (Fig. 3d\u2013f). Despite the lesion and the DNA being maintained as rigid bodies, the conformation of the YTM moiety seemed to be well suited to fit into the minor groove, leaving only the hydrophilic edge exposed to solvent. In this predominantly buried arrangement, the \u03c0-faces of all three YTM subunits form an extensive network of CH/\u03c0 interactions with deoxyribose groups in both DNA strands (Fig. 3e). Individually, CH/\u03c0 interactions are often fairly weak (~1 kcal mol\u22121)31. However, the combined strength of the 24 CH/\u03c0 interactions present in our YTMA-DNA model would create a significant energetic barrier to base-pair opening or thermal denaturation. Consistent with this prediction, we found that a single YTMA lesion in a GC-rich dodecamer increased the melting temperature (Tm) of the duplex by 36\u00b0C (Fig. 3g). Our YTMA-DNA model also predicts that without the unlikely dissociation of YTMAde, C1\u2032 will be sterically occluded from nucleophilic attack by a water molecule, rendering YTMA resistant to hydrolysis (Fig. 3f). Indeed, we found that at 25\u00b0C the spontaneous rate of YTMA depurination [knon = (1.8 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22128 s\u22121] (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1) is 61-fold slower than that of 3-methyl-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine (3mA) [knon = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 s\u22121] (interpolated from published rates at 22 and 39\u00b0C)32. This difference corresponds to a half-life of 1.1 weeks for 3mA versus 1.2 years for YTMA. Taken together, these data suggest that YTMA lesions substantially increase the energetic barrier to duplex denaturation and YTMA depurination by preventing separation of the DNA strands surrounding the adduct. Moreover, previous characterization of DNA modified by CC-1065 and the duocarmycins17,18,22 suggests these properties may extend to lesions produced by all members of this family of natural products.", "AlkD excises YTMA lesions by prying open the minor groove", "We previously showed that AlkD is capable of excising YTMA lesions in vitro9. In order to assess the enzymatic rate enhancement and the relative activity of AlkD for YTMA versus other cationic alkylpurine lesions, we measured the rate of YTMA excision under single-turnover conditions. With a 50-fold molar excess of enzyme to DNA, both AlkD and YtkR2 converted all substrate to product within 30 s (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 1), the first time point in the assay, corresponding to the maximum measureable rate of excision under these conditions. As such, the catalytic rate constant determined for excision of YTMA [kst = (1.6 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22121 s\u22121] is a lower limit. Despite being underestimated, this rate equates to a 107-fold enhancement over the rate of non-enzymatic YTMA depurination under the same conditions (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1). By contrast, the rate of excision of 7-methyl-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (7mG) [kcat = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121] by AlkD corresponds to a rate enhancement of only 104-fold33.", "To ascertain the structural basis for the preferential and apparently facile excision of YTMA lesions by AlkD, we determined a crystal structure of AlkD in the presence of YTMA-DNA. X-ray diffraction data extending to 1.6 \u00c5 revealed a ternary AlkD/AP-DNA/YTMAde product complex in which the glycosidic bond of YTMA had been cleaved (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Table 2). Overall, the structure is remarkably similar to those of previously determined product complexes containing much smaller 3-methyladenine (3mAde) and 3-deaza-3-methyladenine (3d3mAde) nucleobases9 (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). In all structures, a common set of DNA binding residues remodels the duplex, bending the helical axis by ~30\u00b0 away from the protein and widening the minor groove by 4\u20135 \u00c5 around the lesion (Fig. 4e\u2013h). In stark contrast to the products of base-flipping DNA glycosylases6\u20138, the excised nucleobases in these complexes are stacked between flanking nucleotides and paired with an opposing thymidine. In the complex containing YTMAde, the YTM moiety is bound in a cleft that follows the minor groove. Contacts between AlkD and this bulky group significantly extend the protein\u2013ligand binding interface, providing an additional 43% of buried surface area compared to the complex containing 3d3mAde (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interestingly, the only hydrogen bonds between AlkD and YTMAde are provided by Gln38 and Lys156, which contact the four hydroxyl and methoxy substituents on the left and right subunits (Fig. 4h). All other hydrogen bonds with YTMAde are mediated by water (Supplementary Fig. 5). The most prominent binding contacts with the YTMAde nucleobase occur through CH/\u03c0 interactions provided by Tyr27, Trp109, and Trp187 (Fig. 4h). Together, these residues form an aromatic shelf below the YTM group, with Tyr27 acting as a CH/\u03c0 acceptor for the pyrrolidine moiety in the left subunit, and Trp109 and Trp187 serving as CH/\u03c0 donors for the indole moieties in the middle and right subunits.", "DNA remodeling of this kind by DNA glycosylases is generally associated with inducing strain that allows for detection of DNA damage and reducing the energetic barrier to base-pair opening, which facilitates base flipping34\u201336. DNA remodeling by AlkD, however, likely plays a different, or additional, role. By asymmetrically widening the minor groove around the YTMAde nucleobase, AlkD leaves intact all CH/\u03c0 interactions between the YTM moiety and the unmodified strand, while prying apart the YTM moiety and the modified strand (Fig. 4g,h). This separation allows Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187 to form the same contacts with the AP site in the complex containing YTMAde as in the complex containing 3d3mAde (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). In both structures, Asp113 forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with O1\u2032, while Trp109 and Trp187 form CH/\u03c0 interactions with C2\u2032, C4\u2032, and C5\u2032 (Fig. 4h). For methylpurine lesions, these residues have been shown to catalyze excision by stabilizing the development of positive charge on the deoxyribose ring in the transition state9,33,37. Asp113 has also been proposed to catalyze excision by positioning and deprotonating the nucleophilic water.", "We mutated the three putative catalytic residues that contact the AP site, as well as three residues that contact the YTMAde nucleobase, to assess the role that each plays in YTMA excision. As noted above, the rate of excision measured for wild-type AlkD is a lower limit. The same maximum measurable rate was observed with the AlkD-Y27A, -Q38A, and -K156A mutants, masking any possible differences above this threshold (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 1). However, the AlkD-W109A, -D113A, and -W187A mutants were substantially impaired, exhibiting at least 76-fold, 760-fold, and 25-fold reductions, respectively (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 1). These reduced rates were not significantly altered by increasing the concentration of the enzymes [kst,W109A = (2.4 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121, kst,D113A = (1.9 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121, and kst,W187A = (7.2 \u00b1 2.0) \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121] (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating the mutants were present at a saturating concentration but have a diminished ability to stabilize the cationic transition state. These rates are nonetheless at least 104-fold greater than the rate of spontaneous depurination (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 1). Such high residual activity is consistent with the redundant roles of Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187 in stabilizing the development of positive charge on the deoxyribose ring, but may also be indicative of the importance of widening the minor groove around the YTMA lesion. Even with diminished stabilization of the transition state, eliminating the steric hindrance that prevents a water nucleophile from accessing the glycosidic bond may significantly enhance the rate of hydrolysis.", "Fluorinated YTMA is not refractory to excision by AlkD", "The high excision activity retained by the AlkD mutants hindered our efforts to crystallize an AlkD/YTMA-DNA substrate complex. Alternatively, we created a fluorinated YTMA (YTMAF)-DNA substrate analog by yatakemycinylating DNA containing 2\u2032-fluoroarabinoadenosine (Fig. 5a). Addition of electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., hydroxyl and fluoro groups) to C2\u2032 is a common strategy employed to stabilize the glycosidic bond of deoxynucleotides. In all reported cases, 2\u2032-fluoro groups have inhibited base excision and enabled crystallization of enzyme\u2013substrate complexes38\u201340. However, our attempts to crystallize an AlkD/YTMAF-DNA complex were unsuccessful. While we were able to grow crystals that diffracted beyond 1.6 \u00c5, the corresponding electron density maps revealed that the \u201cstable\u201d substrate analog had been converted to a fluorinated AP (APF) site and a YTMAde nucleobase (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 2). Relative to a product complex containing the same AP-DNA construct without the 2\u2032-fluoro substituent, the overall structures are virtually identical [r.m.s.d. = 0.47 \u00c5 for all non-hydrogen atoms], including all catalytic contacts with the AP and APF sites (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2).", "Our crystallographic finding was corroborated by the observation that AlkD excises YTMAF lesions in solution. Under the single-turnover conditions used with the non-fluorinated YTMA-DNA substrate, AlkD fully removed YTMAF in less than 10 min [kst = (2.4 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121] (Fig. 5c). To our knowledge, only uracil DNA glycosylase has been observed to excise a fluorinated lesion 41, albeit at a rate 103-fold slower than that catalyzed by AlkD. The addition of electron-withdrawing substituents to C2\u2032 increases the activation barrier to depurination by destabilizing the cationic transition state42. Seemingly, this heightened barrier is insurmountable for most DNA glycosylases that use a traditional base-flipping mechanism and rely upon a single catalytic residue to stabilize the development of positive charge on the deoxyribose ring. Conversely, the non-base-flipping mechanism employed by AlkD allows for charge stabilization by three residues\u2014Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187\u2014which seem to provide sufficient electron donation to largely offset the effects of electron withdrawal by the 2\u2032-fluoro group.", "Persistence of the product complex impedes repair", "The proficiency with which AlkD excised YTMA and YTMAF lesions in vitro seemed at odds with the weak protection that AlkD provided to cells challenged with YTM. We examined two possible explanations for this paradox. First, we determined if AlkD could efficiently excise YTMA lesions under multiple-turnover conditions, which may be more relevant to repair in vivo. With 0.1 molar equivalents of AlkD, the first enzymatic turnover of YTMA-DNA was complete within 30 s (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7). However, subsequent turnovers required far more time, and the time required for each successive turnover progressively increased as the fraction product increased. Both observations are consistent with product inhibition. Moreover, the addition of Exonuclease III (ExoIII) and Endonuclease IV (EndoIV), the two bacterial AP endonucleases that perform the next step in the BER pathway43 (Fig. 6b), only modestly increased the rate of YTMA excision (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7). Second, we ascertained if ExoIII and EndoIV could readily incise DNA at AP sites produced from YTMA, or if AlkD and/or YTMAde nucleobase would hinder incision. Using AP-DNA and YTMAde generated with 0.1 and 1 molar equivalents of AlkD, we observed two rates of incision in each reaction (Fig. 6c,d, Supplementary Fig. 7, and Supplementary Table 3). We attributed the first, faster rate to incision of unbound DNA, and the second, much slower rate to incision of DNA bound by AlkD. For each AP endonuclease, the first rates of incision were similar at both concentrations of AlkD, as were the second rates (Supplementary Table 3). However, the fraction product formed at each rate differed substantially, presumably as a function of the proportion of unbound to bound AP-DNA (Fig. 6c,d). To determine if inhibition of AP endonuclease activity resulted from the presence of AlkD, YTMAde, or both, we repeated the incision assays with 0.1 molar equivalents of AlkD but replaced YTMAde and AP-DNA with 3mAde and tetrahydrofuran (THF)-DNA. Again, we observed two rates, both of which were comparable to the rates of incision of AP-DNA with YTMAde (Fig. 6c,d, Supplementary Fig. 7, and Supplementary Table 3). Together, these data indicate that AlkD tightly and preferentially binds abasic sites, either with or without YTMAde. This is consistent with our current and previous crystal structures of AlkD bound to abasic DNA9,10, and with our previous biochemical data showing that AlkD binds THF-DNA with 104-fold higher affinity [Kd = 1.5 nM] than unmodified DNA44. Tight, preferential binding of AP sites by AlkD would inhibit both multiple turnover of YTMA lesions and further repair by the BER pathway, explaining the weak level of protection that AlkD provides against YTM toxicity in vivo."]
