["Results", "An overview of XP BGCs", "We began by using antiSMASH 5.0 (antibiotics & secondary metabolite analysis shell23) to predict and annotate the natural-product BGCs in 29 Xenorhabdus and 16 Photorhabdus strains (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 1,000 BGCs were detected and categorized into eight classes (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2), corresponding to an average of 22 BGCs per species, which is two- to tenfold higher than the average BGC levels of any other Enterobacteria24. Most species show a linear relationship between the number of BGCs and the size of their genome (Supplementary Fig. 2). Compared to Xenorhabdus, Photorhabdus tends to harbour a larger genome size with more BGCs. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the most abundant BGC class in XP, accounting for 59% of the total BGCs, with ~13 BGCs per species. Owing to the abundance of NRPS BGCs, it seems likely that their products play essential ecological roles. The \u2018Others\u2019 group of BGCs composed of various minor classes and hybrid clusters is the second-largest class, the products of which might facilitate bacteria to fulfil specific ecological functions. The polyketide synthase (PKS)/NRPS hybrid class is modestly enriched and broadly distributed. PKS (type I and other PKSs), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP), terpene and saccharide BGCs are scant in XP compared with the other classes (Supplementary Fig. 3). The biosynthetic gene cluster families (BiG-FAM) database25 for gene cluster family (GCF) explorations suggests that 58% of the XP GCFs are exclusive (Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, XP could be a distinct source for experimental natural product discovery.Fig. 1Pangenomic analysis and BGC overview of 45 XP genomes by anvi\u2019o.The central plot of the interface represents a hierarchical clustering dendrogram based on gene presence/absence.

Core genes shared by all species in a pangenome are essential for basic biological aspects, whereas accessory and singleton genes presented in some and one species, respectively, are regarded as \u2018dispensable\u2019. These \u2018dispensable\u2019 genes are still allied to complementary biochemical pathways and functions that might endow bacteria with unique advantages for ecological adaptation27. Therefore, we asked a question here, \u2018among all predicted BGCs, are there any highly conserved BGCs across XP genomes?\u2019 Towards answering this, we performed a pangenome analysis with the anvi\u2019o platform28,29 to characterize the gene content of 45 XP strains. With the integration of BGC annotations into the pangenome, we could monitor the distributions of genes with natural-product biosynthetic annotations (that is, biosynthetic genes, BGs) in the core, accessory and singleton regions26 (Fig. 1). We then set out to filter widespread, consecutive BGs that possibly make up the most prevalent BGCs among different chemical classes. The reasons why we present the most prevalent BGCs by chemical classes are as follows: (1) BGC classes with various biosynthetic logic recruit distinct building blocks (except RiPPs and NRPSs, recruiting identical building blocks) and thereby yield compound classes spanning an enormous range of molecular composition and molecular weight; (2) different compound classes might be biosynthesized and secreted by the XP bacteria in different stages of the symbiotic nematode life cycle. Therefore, covering various BGC classes could provide a more comprehensive view of compound classes with distinct biological/physiological functions that would engage in different stages of the life cycle.", "Surprisingly, although NRPS BGCs are prolific in XP, all of their BGs scatter in the accessory and singleton regions (Fig. 1). Almost all BGs that are located in the core region belong to an unknown ioc/leu BGC, which is a putative \u03b2-lactone cluster (Fig. 2a). The gxpS (Fig. 2a) responsible for GameXPeptide biosynthesis30, located in the accessory region, is the most broadly distributed NRPS GCF across Xenorhabdus (72%) and Photorhabdus (93%), followed by the antiprotozoal rhabdopeptide/xenortide-like peptides31 (Supplementary Fig. 4) that are found in 51% of Xenorhabdus and 87% of Photorhabdus. A set of five consecutive BGs (pxbF\u2013J) in the accessory region composes an unknown cluster (pxb; Fig. 2a) representing the most prevalent PKS/NRPS hybrid GCF across Xenorhabdus (58%) and Photorhabdus (81%).Fig. 2The most widely distributed gene clusters among eight BGC classes in Xenorhabdus and/or Photorhabdus.a, The most conserved BGCs across XP, including the previously unidentified ioc/leu and pxb. b, The most widely distributed X-specific BGCs, including the previously unidentified lpc. c, The most widely distributed P-specific BGCs, including the unknown plu0082\u20130077. d, Comparison of the transcriptional and translational levels of genes in the conserved BGCs (ioc/leu, gxp, pxb, stl/bkd, plu3123, glb, plu0082\u20130077 and plu4334\u20134343) in P. luminescens subsp. laumondii TT01 with the housekeeping genes (rfbA and rpoS).

NRPS BGs related to the xenoamicin (xab) BGC32 and eight unknown BGCs are located in the core region of the Xenorhabdus pangenome. Among them, an unknown NRPS (lpcS; Fig. 2b) stands out because it exists in 96% (28 out of 29) of strains as the most widespread Xenorhabdus-specific (X-specific) GCF. In the accessory region of the Xenorhabdus pangenome, multiple consecutive BGs making up the broad-spectrum antimicrobial fabclavine33 BGC (fcl; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4) are found in 44% of Xenorhabdus strains as the most prevalent genus-specific PKS/NRPS hybrid GCF. Sequential consecutive BGs that compose the ape BGC (Fig. 2b) are found exclusively in 76% of Xenorhabdus strains. The ape BGC synthesizing the aryl-polyene lipids34 (Supplementary Fig. 4) that protect the bacteria from oxidative stress and promote biofilm formation34,35 is the most prominent GCF among Gram-negative bacteria34,36. Isopropylstilbene (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4) is a multipotent compound and an essential growth factor of dauer-stage nematodes37, whose BGs (stl/bkd) located in the core region are highly conserved across all Photorhabdus strains. In the accessory region of the Photorhabdus pangenome, BGs of glidobactin (glb; a potent eukaryotic proteasome inhibitor38), ririwpeptide39 (plu3123; Supplementary Fig. 4) and carotenoid (plu4334\u20134343), as well as an unknown bacteriocin (plu0082\u20130077) make up BGCs that represent the most widespread Photorhabdus-specific (P-specific) PKS/NRPS hybrid (93%, 15 out of 16), NRPS (87%), terpene (81%) and RiPP (93%) GCFs, respectively (Fig. 2c).", "Although these BGCs (Fig. 2a\u2013c) are widespread in XP, some of the chemical structures accounting for the biosynthetic pathways remain cryptic. Two major reasons for this might be the BGC being silent in wild-type strains under laboratory conditions, and/or product(s) being undetectable or difficult to isolate. We therefore leveraged our previous transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TT01 wild-type strain40 to obtain information about the transcription and translation of the conserved BGCs. The transcriptomic data showed that all conserved BGCs are actively transcribed at different levels (Fig. 2d). However, BGCs encoded by pxb, plu3123, glb, plu0082\u20130077 and plu4334\u20134343 are partly or completely untranslated, whereas almost all genes belonging to the putative \u03b2-lactone (ioc/leu), GameXPeptide (gxp) and isopropylstilbene (stl/bkd) BGCs are expressed with high protein abundance, comparable to the levels of housekeeping genes (Fig. 2d). The proteomic data, except for the case of the putative \u03b2-lactone BGC (ioc/leu), are in line with the previous metabolic analysis15, in which GameXPeptides and isopropylstilbene are the chemotypes in Photorhabdus wild-type strains. These findings hint that, among the conserved BGCs yielding previously unidentified natural products, the pxb, plu0082\u20130077 and plu4334\u20134343 are silent clusters due to unknown regulation mechanisms, while the product(s) of \u03b2-lactone BGC (ioc/leu) should be present in the wild-type strain but has yet to be detected and characterized by means of standard spectroscopic methods.", "Unique XP BGCs", "With the unidentified, conserved BGCs in hand, we set out to assess their biosynthetic novelty as well as the thorough biosynthetic capacity of XP. We subsequently compared XP BGCs against the reference BGCs in the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) database41 by the biosynthetic gene similarity clustering and prospecting engine (BiG-SCAPE) based on distance metrics42. The BiG-SCAPE analysis suggested biosynthetic uniqueness of 535 BGCs (53%) that were found to be unrelated to the MIBiG BGCs and our in-house BGC data. Overall, 46% of NRPS, 61% of PKS/NRPS hybrid, 73% of PKSI, 97% of RiPP, 100% of saccharide and 58% of \u2018Other\u2019 BGCs have yet to be identified. The previously unidentified X-specific lpc BGC, as well as 87% of the known XP BGCs (312 entries), including the aforementioned prevalent NRPSs (encoding the biosyntheses of GameXPeptide30, rhabdopeptide/xenortide-like peptides31 and ririwpeptide39) and PKS/NRPS hybrids (encoding the biosyntheses of fabclavine33 and glidobactin38), are concentrated in the main network (Fig. 3). This indicates they are very similar in terms of domain sequences. Seventy percent of the unknown BGCs (378 entries) distantly related to the known BGCs are mostly on the periphery of the main network (Fig. 3), exemplified by the previously unidentified PKS/NRPS hybrid BGC (pxb) that prevails across XP. The remaining 30% of the unknown BGCs (157 entries), including the XP highly conserved \u03b2-lactone (ioc/leu) and P-specific bacteriocin (plu0082\u20130077) BGCs, are classified into 55 GCFs (as 26 isolated clades and 29 singletons) without connections with MIBiG references or the main network, suggesting their underlying biosynthetic novelty.Fig. 3Sequence similarity network of BGCs identified in 45 XP genomes by BiG-SCAPE.Previously unidentified BGCs involved in this study and selected known BGCs are annotated and highlighted.

The BGC features six genes (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 4). leuABCD are involved in l-leucine biosynthesis. leuO is positioned next to leuA and encodes a global transcription factor involved in regulating natural-product biosynthesis43 and other physiological traits44. iocS encodes an enzyme belonging to the ANL (acyl-CoA synthetases, NRPS adenylation domains and luciferase enzymes) superfamily. Such a gene architecture is reminiscent of the biosynthesis of cystargolides45, during which 3-isopropylmalate as an intermediate in the leucine pathway is the precursor for one-step lactonization to afford 3-isopropyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanecarboxylic acid (IOC, 1) with a \u03b2-lactone moiety (Supplementary Fig. 6). Although the enzyme responsible for \u03b2-lactonization remains uncharacterized in the cystargolide biosynthesis45, a recent report demonstrates the acyl-AMP ligase, OleC, to be a \u03b2-lactone synthetase during the biosynthesis of long-chain olefinic hydrocarbons46. Therefore, we speculated that IocS might be responsible for adenylating the 4-carboxyl group and then triggering lactonization to give IOC (1).Fig. 4BGCs, chemical structures and bioactivities of IOC and piscibactins/photoxenobactins.a, Genetic architecture of the ioc/leu BGC. b, Chemical structure of IOC (1). c, IC50 determination of 1 against the ChT-L activity of the yeast 20S proteasome using the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009\u00b5M).

The active-site nucleophile of each proteolytic centre is an N-terminal threonine (Thr1) located at subunits \u03b21 (caspase-like activity), \u03b22 (trypsin-like activity) and \u03b25 (chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L) activity)50. Natural products featuring a \u03b2-lactone moiety, such as omuralide, belactosins and cystargolides, have been proven to suppress the proteolytic activity of the core particle46,51. Their uniform mode of proteasome inhibition relies on opening of the \u03b2-lactone and transesterification upon nucleophilic attack by the catalytic N-terminal threonine (Thr1O\u03b3)52. Nevertheless, \u03b2-lactone natural products differ substantially in their chemical structures and thus in their mode of binding. Inspired by cystargolides and belactosins containing an IOC moiety as the reactive head group51,53, we assumed that IOC (1) might represent the smallest \u03b2-lactone that still blocks the activity of the proteasome. Indeed, 1 inhibits the yeast 20S proteasome with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 6.2\u2009\u00b5M for the \u03b25 subunit (Fig. 4c), whereas it has low binding affinities for \u03b21 (625\u2009\u00b5M) and \u03b22 (60\u2009\u00b5M). We thus solved the crystal structure of 1 in complex with the yeast 20S proteasome at 3.0\u2009\u00c5 (PDB 7O2L). The electron density map displayed 1 covalently bound to Thr1O\u03b3 of all active sites due to the high ligand concentrations used for crystal soaking (Fig. 4d). However, because 1 lacks strong interactions with protein residues in the caspase- and trypsin-like binding channels, the 2FO\u2013FC map for the ligand is diffuse at \u03b21 and \u03b22. By contrast, 1 is well defined in the \u03b25 subunit (Fig. 4e). Superposition of 1 with known complex structures reveals a similar conformation as observed for the class of belactosins51,54 (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 8). The acyl-oxygen atom of 1 derived from \u03b2-lactone ring-opening is stabilized by the oxyanion hole (Gly47NH), whereas the generated hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 19. Similar to NH6 in belactosin products52, the carboxylate group of 1 interacts with the threonine N terminus and displaces the nucleophilic water molecule (Fig. 4e), thereby preventing hydrolysis of the acyl enzyme complex, and explaining its inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the isopropyl moiety of 1 at the P1 site is stabilized by Ala20, Met45 and Ala49 in the ChT-L channel. Although these interactions are present in other \u03b2-lactone-containing compounds, they adopt a diverse and unpredictable mode of binding. Without nitrogen atoms and extension units, 1 might feature the minimal scaffold for proteasome inhibition. Therefore, 1 could be an XP universal virulence factor against insects, as well as soil-living food competitors like protozoa, that disturbs the ubiquitin-proteasome system and thereby causes cell-cycle disturbance and immunodeficiency.", "The most prevalent PK/NRP hybrid in XP is insecticidal", "The prevalent PKS/NRPS hybrid GCF containing 32 pxb (photoxenobactin) BGCs is shown to have weak similarity to micacocidin55 and yersiniabactin56 BGCs in the BiG-SCAPE network (Fig. 3). Notably, compared with HMWP1 encoded by the yersiniabactin BGC in Yersinia pestis56, its homologue (PxbG) lacks one carbon-methyltransferase domain (cMT1) involved in the bismethylation of a C2 polyketide moiety in yersiniabactin. Moreover, PxbG embeds an additional module comprising a heterocyclization domain, an adenylation domain and a thiolation domain (Cy4\u2013A2\u2013T6; Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 9).", "To unveil the underlying biosynthetic theme of pxb BGC, we overexpressed the cluster in X. szentirmaii DSM 16338 by using a promoter exchange strategy19 to insert a PBAD promoter in front of pxbF. Besides prepiscibactin (2) and piscibactin (3)57, the X. szentirmaii PBAD\npxbF mutant yielded four additional compounds, termed photoxenobactins A\u2013D (4\u20137; Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 10). From a 20-l fermentation broth of the X. szentirmaii PBAD\npxbF \u2206hfq mutant, which produced the desired compounds with a reduced background of other natural products19, we obtained 4\u20136, as well as photoxenobactin E (8; Supplementary Fig. 10). The chemical structures of 4, 5 and 8 were readily elucidated by HRMS and NMR spectroscopic methods, and that of 7 was confirmed by tandem MS and isotope labelling experiments (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 and Supplementary Table 6), revealing that, unexpectedly, 4, 5, 7 and 8 have various chain lengths and termini such as thiocarboxylic acid (4 and 8) and carboxamide (5 and 7). Although the production titre of photoxenobactin C (6) in the X. szentirmaii PBAD\npxbF mutant appeared to be sufficient for isolation, we only obtained a trace amount of the pure compound. Photophobia and thermo-instability in any kind of organic solvents are the culprits, leading to conversion into an array of rearranged products, such as methyl ester piscibactin (9) in methanol (Supplementary Fig. 13). Finally, combining extensive labelling experiments (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15), and 2D NMR data (Supplementary Fig. 12), we proved that 6 bears a unique dithioperoxoate moiety.", "Inspired by piscibactin being able to chelate gallium and ferric ions57, we set out to explore whether photoxenobactins are metallophores, because metallophores are essential for bacteria to acquire trace elements from environments and can have additional functions (for example, toxicity, signalling, protection and antibiotics)58. A fraction mainly containing pxb BGC products was incubated with different inorganic metal salts (for example, GaIII, FeIII, CuII, ZnII, MoVI and VV), and only piscibactin-GaIII/FeIII/CuII (10\u201312) and photoxenobactin D-GaIII/FeIII/CuII (13\u201315) were detected (Supplementary Fig. 16). An earlier report describes killing of Galleria mellonella upon injection of Escherichia coli carrying a pxb BGC from Photorhabdus asymbiotica. Ulbactin E and a compound with the sum formula C20H25O4N3S3, which was a putative desmethyl yersiniabactin, were found in the methanol extract of insect carcasses, suggesting both compounds as virulence factors against insects59. Indeed, C20H25O4N3S3 coincides with methyl ester piscibactin (9), a rearranged product of 6 that occurs in methanol, as observed herein (Supplementary Fig. 13). We thus reasoned that 6 should be one of the authentic insecticidal compounds. Next, we attempted to re-examine the toxicity of pxb BGC products during the insect infection process by comparing it with that of aerobactin, an identified virulence-related siderophore in X. szentirmaii60. Because the X. szentirmaii PBAD\npxbF mutant synthesizes 2\u20137 only upon the induction of l-arabinose, none of the compounds can be produced by the mutant inside insects due to the absence of the l-arabinose inducer. Hence, a non-induced promoter exchange mutant is equal to a BGC knockout strain. We then injected X. szentirmaii wild-type strain, which produces 2\u20137 and toxic aerobactin encoded by the iuc BGC60, as well as the non-induced X. szentirmaii PBAD\niucA and non-induced X. szentirmaii PBAD\npxbF mutants into G. mellonella larvae (Fig. 4i). The wild-type strain killed insects 3.4\u2009h faster than the non-induced PBAD\npxbF mutant. Furthermore, the pxb BGC products exerted a greater impact on insect virulence than aerobactin in that the non-induced PBAD\niucA mutant killed insects 1.7\u2009h faster than the non-induced PBAD\npxbF mutant.", "The most widespread NRP in XP suppresses insect immunity", "GxpS, an NRPS with five modules (Fig. 5a), is responsible for the biosynthesis of GameXPeptides, a class of cyclic pentapeptides composed of valine, leucine and phenylalanine (Fig. 5b). Although GameXPeptides are one of the diagnostic chemotypes with high production titres in almost all XP15, their function has remained cryptic over the past decade. Our recent bioactivity screening for crude extracts produced by specifically overexpressed mutants19 indicated that GameXPeptides might be one of the bioactive contributors of wild-type strains inhibiting in vitro production of prostaglandin E2 without cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity. With the synthetic GameXPeptide A (16) in hand, we therefore pursued its possible suppression of insect immune responses. Insects rely on innate immunity consisting of cellular and humoral immune responses to overcome infections61. Cellular immune responses mediated by eicosanoids involve encapsulation that is performed by immune haemocytes along with morphological changes, melanization activated by phenoloxidase, nodulation and phagocytosis62. The cytoplasmic extension observed in the haemocytes of the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera exigua, as an immune response to the E. coli challenge, was remarkably inhibited by 16 (Fig. 5c) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5d), with an IC50 value of 17.2\u2009ng per larva (Supplementary Table 7). Although 16 exerted no suppression against the phenoloxidase activation (Fig. 5e), it remarkably decreased the number of nodules formed (Fig. 5f) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5g) with an IC50 value of 25.8\u2009ng per larva (Supplementary Table 8). These results suggest that 16 specifically suppresses insect haemocyte spreading and nodule formation upon insects being challenged by E. coli, and thereby defeats the insect cellular immune response. It is worth mentioning that the inhibitions of phenoloxidase activity and the proteolytic cascade leading to active phenoloxidase are accomplished by two known widespread compound classes, rhabduscin63 and rhabdopeptide/xenortide-like peptides7, respectively. Consequently, the functional characterization of ubiquitous GameXPeptides is a substantial advance toward deconstructing XP to suppress insect immune systems during symbiotic nematode invasion.Fig. 5BGCs, chemical structures and bioactivities of GameXPeptide A and lipocitides.a, Domain organization of GxpS. b, Chemical structure of GameXPeptide A (16). c, In vivo observation of haemocytes-spreading behaviour in different time intervals upon injection of 16\u201318 (1,000\u2009ng per larva) in S. exigua larvae.

We designated this X-specific cluster as lpc, which encodes a tetramodular NRPS with an unusual terminal thiolation\u2013condensation/epimerization\u2013thiolation (T3\u2013C/E4\u2013T4) domain architecture (Fig. 5h). This BGC is silent under laboratory conditions, consistent with the transcriptional level of lpcS in X. szentirmaii US wild-type strain40 being about 16-fold lower than those of the housekeeping genes (Supplementary Fig. 17). We were able to activate the BGC in Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004 by the promoter exchange strategy. The X. bovienii PBAD\nlpcS mutant produced an array of N-terminal acylated linear tripeptides (Supplementary Fig. 18). Two major products, lipocitides A and B (17 and 18; Fig. 5i), were purified, and their structures were identified by NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 9), Marfey\u2019s method (Supplementary Fig. 19) and chemical synthesis, revealing that 17 and 18 bear a myristoyl and a consecutive amino-acid sequence of d-leucine/l-alanine/d-citrulline, as well as a carboxamide and carboxylic acid in their respective C termini. Comparison of the tandem MS of the other lipocitides in X. bovienii SS-2004 with 17 and 18 revealed that lipocitides feature either d-leucine/l-alanine/d-citrulline-OH or d-leucine/l-alanine/d-citrulline-NH2 as a backbone and differ in the N-acyl substitutions (Supplementary Fig. 20). Identical compounds, termed bovienimides, as well as a recognition of the BGC conservativeness, were reported by the Crawford laboratory65 during revision of this manuscript.", "Nitric oxide (NO) converted from l-arginine by NO synthases is an upstream component of the eicosanoid signalling pathway to trigger insect innate immune responses against exogenous challenges62. Inspired by l-citrulline and arginine-derived compounds being inhibitors of NO synthesis66, we examined whether the major lipocitides, 17 and 18, could inhibit NO production to defeat insect immune responses. The elevated NO level measured by the nitrate concentration in the haemolymph of S. exigua larvae caused by E. coli infection was suppressed by both compounds (Fig. 5j) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5k), with IC50 values of 2.37 and 0.42\u2009\u03bcg per larva, respectively (Supplementary Table 10). Earlier reports showed that NO activates phospholipases A2 for producing downstream eicosanoid signalling molecules67, thereby mediating cellular immune responses. Both 17 and 18 suppressed cytoplasmic extension in the haemocytes of S. exigua following E. coli challenge (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Table 7). In addition, 18 significantly suppressed phenoloxidase activation (Fig. 5e) and decreased the number of nodules formed (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Table 8). These results indicate that lipocitides suppress insect NO production, which leads to sequential inhibitions of cellular immune responses and thus might cause fatal immunosuppressive conditions for the insects under infection by the Xenorhabdus symbiotic nematode. In contrast, GameXPeptide A (16) displayed no suppression of NO production (Fig. 5j,k), which indicates that GameXPeptides have a different upstream target from lipocitides or mediate other signalling transduction pathways.", "T-shape PK/NRP hybrid with prodrug activation mechanism", "The above survey of previously unidentified conserved BGCs has showcased the abilities of XP to produce pervasive and structurally unique natural products. We then set out to examine the uncharacterized BGCs that only exist in specific species to assess the biosynthetic potential of XP. In the BiG-SCAPE main network (Fig. 3), eight unknown PKS/NRPS hybrid BGCs from seven Xenorhabdus and one Photorhabdus strains (Fig. 6a) compose a GCF, termed rdb (rhabdobranin). The rdb BGCs feature a peptidase encoded gene, suggesting a prodrug activation mechanism similar to the biosyntheses of xenocoumacin and amicoumacin, which are potent antibiotics inhibiting messenger RNA translation7 and colibactin, which is a genotoxin alkylating DNA10. Although the nodes of the rdb GCF are adjacent to those of the rhabdopeptide/xenortide-like BGCs, the rdb BGCs connect neither to amicoumacin and xenocoumacin64 BGCs nor to any MIBiG entries. We classified these eight highly similar BGCs into three types, rdb1\u20133, based on the presence or absence of the first adenylation domain in RdbH and the thioesterase domain in RdbI (Supplementary Fig. 21), which might lead to products with distinct numbers of amino-acid residues and nonlinear biosynthetic assembly line logic, respectively.Fig. 6Representative BGCs of uniqueness and chemical structures thereof in XP.a, Phylogeny and gene organization of the rdb BGCs.

The X. budapestensis PBAD\nrdb1A mutant yielded four N-myristoyl-d-asparagine congeners (19\u201322), as well as a non-XAD-resin-bound hydrophilic compound with a low production level (23; Supplementary Fig. 22). Because an acylated d-asparaginyl capping the N terminus of xenocoumacin, zwittermicin and colibactin has been found to be a self-resistance mechanism68, the detection of N-myristoyl-d-asparagine analogues was consistent with our hypothesis that a prodrug strategy was involved in the rdb biosynthesis. To accumulate the inactive prodrugs for structural identification, we deleted the peptidase encoded gene rdb1P, and the X. budapestensis PBAD\nrdb1A \u2206rdb1P mutant led to loss of 19\u201322 and high production of four new peaks with larger masses, designated as pre-rhabdobranins A\u2013D (24\u201327; Fig. 6b) with differences in the N-acylated moiety. Pre-rhabdobranin D (27) was purified from the X. budapestensis PBAD\nrdb1A \u2206rdb1P \u2206hfq, and its structure was determined by HRMS and NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Tables 5, 11 and 12 and Supplementary Fig. 12). Intriguingly, pre-rhabdobranins are characterized by a proline-serine dipeptidyl side chain that branches off at the N atom of an aminomalonyl building block. To the best of our knowledge, this represents an uncommon T-shape peptide, in contrast to the canonical linear-chain-elongation on thiotemplated assembly lines.", "Orphan assembly line recruits non-canonical building blocks", "BGCs as singletons in the BiG-SCAPE network could be ideal test cases for genome mining for novel natural product discovery. We selected an NRPS BGC termed xvb (X.vietnamensis DSM 22392 benzobactins) for characterization (Fig. 6c). The BGC encodes adenylation domains with unpredictable substrate specificity and specialized tailoring enzymes for substrate modification (for example, a putative serine hydroxymethyltransferase encoded by xvbB), as well as synthases for non-amino-acid substrates (two putative anthranilate synthases encoded by xvbF and xvbG). These indicate the xbv product(s) might contain non-canonical building blocks. To determine the product(s) derived from this orphan BGC, we inserted a PBAD promoter to express the xvb BGC that yielded benzobactin A (28) and its methyl ester (29; Supplementary Fig. 23). Their structures were confirmed by HRMS and NMR spectroscopy methods (Supplementary Tables 5 and 13 and Supplementary Fig. 12), revealing that 28 and 29 feature a rare benzoxazolinate moiety that has only been found in C-102769 and ashimides70 from Streptomyces, as well as a non-proteinogenic amino-acid residue, 2-hydroxymethylserine, which is a rare building block in natural products (Fig. 6d). 28 showed cytotoxic activity against the HepG2 cell line with an IC50 value of 19.0\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121."]
