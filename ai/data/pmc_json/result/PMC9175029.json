Quantification was made using optical density (OD) values from microbial viability assays (cf. plots in Figures 1d,h for Clades II and III, respectively). Statistically significant differences in the viability plots proved the candidacidal efficacy of both drugs. However, the highest drug efficacy was found for AmB in both clades. An important feature that could be noticed from comparing optical micrographs before and after drug treatments was a clear filamentous growth into hyphae in the case of 5-FC treatment.

In (c) and (f), the C. auris detector kit provided a clear visual indicator of hyphal morphogenesis upon 5-FC treatment, independent of clade. Of note, a direct cell counting showed a ~4-log10 reduction in pathogen viability (99.99%) upon AmB treatment in both clades.

Before observation, samples were treated with fluorescent Filipin blue stain, which specifically links to membrane ergosterol molecules. Quantitative data based on pixel counting (not shown) gave results consistent with those obtained by OD and violet staining (in Figures 1, 2, respectively). Enlarged areas shown in inset to each micrograph again clearly revealed that hyphal morphogenesis only occurred in the 5-FC-treated samples. As mentioned before, the Filipin blue stain directly links to ergosterol, which is an important plasma membrane lipid in Candida species and regulates its fluidity, permeability, and integrity. Enrichment in ergosterol has been associated with both susceptibility and reactions of Candida species to a variety of stresses, such as ionic, osmotic, oxidative pressure, and treatment by antifungal drugs (Rodrigues, 2018). However, the present Filipin-blue staining could not reveal any clear difference neither in the tone of blue nor in its location as recorded on fluorescence micrographs taken before and after treatments with different drugs. The only morphological hint to a reaction of the C. auris cells of both clades to a stress source was their conversion into filamentous morphologies upon exposure to the 5-FC drug. Hyphal differentiation in Candida species has indeed been correlated to subtoxic oxidative stress (Nasution et al., 2008), although their ability to adapt to the host's blood, including resistance to oxidative stress, proved independent of hyphal length (Maza et al., 2017).

Auris Before and After Drug Treatments", "Figures 4, 5 show average Raman spectra of C. auris Clades II and III, respectively, as collected in the wavenumber interval 300~1,800 cm\u22121.

All spectra are shown after normalization to the glucose ring band at 478 cm\u22121 and deconvolution into a series of Lorentzian/Gaussian sub-bands by means of the machine-learning algorithm described in Section Spectral Treatments and Deconvolution. General descriptions of the spectral bands for Clades II and III (in Figures 4, 5, respectively) have been given in a previous study (Pezzotti et al., 2021). The salient points of the Raman analyses of as-cultured and drug-treated cells are detailed in the following sections. In applying the machine-learning algorithm, the initial choice of molecular components included: \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans, \u03b1-1, 3\u2013glucans, chitin, ergosterol, D-arabitol, trehalose, adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine. Statistical (chemometric) validations of the shown average spectra and a comparison between spectra from as-cultured Clades II and III were given and discussed in Pezzotti et al., 2021.

Auris", "Structures and reference Raman spectra of ergosterol, chitin, and cytidine/thymidine pure compounds are given in Figures 6A\u2013C, respectively. The spectra were taken from a library of Raman spectra collected on elementary molecules. The machine-learning algorithm in Eq. (1) located two low-frequency bands (at 594 and 620 cm\u22121), both related to ring vibrations, as mainly (>95%) contributed by steroid ergosterol (cf. spectrum of pure ergosterol in Figure 6A together with selected vibrational markers) (Zivanovic et al., 2018). On the other hand, the main C=C stretching bands at 1,602 and 1,666 cm\u22121 could not serve as ergosterol markers in C. auris spectra because of their strong overlap with signals from other biomolecules (e.g., amino acid residues and DNA bases). The relatively intense and isolate band at ~713 cm\u22121 was contributed by ergosterol (cumulative of C-H bending and ring deformation) (Zivanovic et al., 2018), but it also contained non-negligible contributions from D-arabitol, chitin, and adenine. Upon comparing the sum of the relative intensities of the 594/620 cm\u22121 doublet in the spectra of different C. auris clades (cf. Figures 4A, 5A), the fraction of ergosterol appeared to be higher in Clade II (0.50) as compared to Clade III (0.34). We anticipate that the trend of ergosterol bands is important because its depletion or enhancement, and its structural alteration reflect the response of C. auris clades to different drugs with impact on their antifungal resistance (Kean and Ramage, 2019). This point will be discussed later in more details.", "Figure 6Structures, main vibrational modes, and reference Raman spectra of (A) ergosterol, (B) chitin, (C) cytidine/thymidine, (D) AmB, (E) 5-FU, and (F) 5-FU pure compounds.", "Structures, main vibrational modes, and reference Raman spectra of (A) ergosterol, (B) chitin, (C) cytidine/thymidine, (D) AmB, (E) 5-FU, and (F) 5-FU pure compounds.", "As discussed in a previous report on the same C. auris clades studied here (Pezzotti et al., 2021), machine-learning examination of band contributions from biomolecules included in the yeast structure indicated the sub-band at ~890 cm\u22121 as marker for \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans, while the antisymmetric ring vibration at 932 cm\u22121 was a fingerprint for \u03b1-1, 3\u2013glucans (cf. Figures 4A, 5A for Clade II and III, respectively). The above choice of the 932 cm\u22121 marker was in line with previously published studies of \u03b1-1, 3\u2013glucans (Synytsya et al., 2009; Mikkelsen et al., 2010). The fractional ratio of \u03b1- to \u03b2-glucans of the yeast wall structure, calculated as the intensity ratio of the 932 to the 890 cm\u22121 bands, was very similar in both clades (i.e., 1.09 and 1.03 for Clades II and III, respectively).", "A spectral region representative of C-C-C and C-O-C stretching in polysaccharides corresponds to the wavenumber interval between 950 and 1,200 cm\u22121. Despite structural similarities, giving almost identical spectroscopic features, distinctions among different polysaccharides can yet be made upon using bands in this peculiar region. In the case of chitin (Figure 6B), besides C-O-C bonds between rings, another main structural difference resides in the presence of an amide group (to replace an OH group) as a structural sub-unit in the polymeric chain (Gussem et al., 2005). Structural peculiarities confer distinctive vibrational characteristics as compared to other polysaccharides (cf. Figure 6B). The triplet at 1,054, 1,107, and 1,147 cm\u22121 and the low-frequency band at 645 cm\u22121 stands conspicuously free from overlap with other signals in the spectrum of C. auris, and thus could serve as fingerprints for chitin. Other bands (e.g., the one at ~1,004 cm\u22121 from C-C ring breathing) are contributed by chitin, but also non-negligibly by other polysaccharides (Gussem et al., 2005); therefore, they cannot univocally be selected as markers for the chitin molecule. Upon comparing the relative intensities of the above chitin-marker bands (i.e., with respect to the 478 cm\u22121 glucose ring band) between as-cultured clades, one finds that Clade III is ~20% richer in chitin as compared to Clade II. Since the chitin structure adds rigidity and structural support to the yeast cell walls, Raman data prove that Clade II possesses a membrane with higher flexibility.", "An important detail regarding chitin-related bands lies in the distinction between signals from C-O-C groups within and between rings. The ether C-O-C band between rings is seen at 1,107 cm\u22121, while C-O-C bonds within rings scatter at 1,054 cm\u22121 (cf. Figures 4A, 5A). The band intensity ratio, I1107/I1054, can thus be taken to represent the ratio between ether and ring C-O-C bonds in chitin, the higher the ratio the longer the chitin chains. As-cultured Clade III showed an I1107/I1054 ratio 25% higher than Clade II (~1.5 vs. 1.2); thus, its chitin structure incorporated longer chains. Degradation of the chitin structure, namely, the decomposition of oxygen bridges between rings is expected to display as a lowering of the ether C-O-C signal at 1,107 cm\u22121 with respect to that of ring C-O-C bonds at 1,054 cm\u22121 (labeled with an asterisk in Figures 4, 5).", "Amides I, II, and III signals (i.e., in the wavenumber intervals 1,600~1,700 cm\u22121, 1,400~1,500 cm\u22121, and at around 1,300 cm\u22121, respectively) are peculiar to the N-acetyl group of chitin (cf. labels Figures 4A, 5A). The intensities of these signals are thus related to levels of acetylation/deacetylation in the membrane structure of Candida clades. However, there were no significant differences regarding amide signals between as-cultured Clades II and III. Additional discussions on amide bands will be given later in the context of clade response to drug treatments. Finally, note that chitin deacetylation might induce variations in the I1107/I1054 chitin ratio, the higher the degree of deacetylation the lower the ratio (Binias et al., 2016).", "We also looked into the possibility to resolve individual band components from DNA and RNA. Unfortunately, the majority of prominent bands from DNA nucleosides appeared in the low-wavenumber interval below 900 cm\u22121 and could not be univocally assigned to individual nucleosides because of a strong overlap with signals from other biomolecules. However, machine-learning examination indicated a relatively strong sub-band at ~1,194 cm\u22121 (C-CH3 stretching) (D'Amico et al., 2015) and a minor band at 1,542 cm\u22121 (NH2 scissoring) (Barboza et al., 2017) as mainly contributed (>95%) by thymidine and cytidine nucleosides, respectively (cf. spectra of elementary molecules and related Raman markers in Figure 6C). These bands were then selected as markers for these two nucleosides (cf. labels in Figures 4, 5).", "In an attempt to search for additional Raman markers, spectra were also collected in the high-frequency zone between 2,800 and 3,100 cm\u22121 (cf. spectra normalized to the strongest band at 2,935 cm\u22121 in Figures 7A,B for Clades II and III, respectively). It should be noted at the outset that it is difficult to assign peaks in this region to specific chemical groups. However, the predominant vibrational contributions of CH3, CH2, and CH groups can be distinguished, which gives hints for identifying structural features in specific structural context, as discussed later. Deconvolution into Lorentzian-Gaussian sub-bands in the high-frequency zone was made according to Borchman et al. (1999) and Kolijenovic et al. (2005). This spectral zone is basically comprehensive of eight sub-bands: at 2,820 cm\u22121 (CH2 symmetric stretching in fatty lipids) at ~2,850 cm\u22121 (CH2 symmetric stretching in fatty acids) and its Fermi resonance at ~2,886 cm\u22121, at 2,900 cm\u22121 (CH stretching), at ~2,935 cm\u22121 (chain-end CH3 symmetric stretching), at ~2,960 cm\u22121 (out-of-plane chain end and anti-symmetric CH3 stretching), at 2,995 cm\u22121 (=CH stretching), and at 3,010 cm\u22121 (unsaturated =CH stretching). Two additional weak bands could be seen at ~3,056 and 3,100 cm\u22121, which can be assigned to OH and NH stretching vibrations. Small fluctuations in frequency for the above band components might arise from differences in the molecular structures in which the bonds are comprised. In the zone 2,800~3,100 cm\u22121, the deconvoluted sub-bands in the spectra of Clades II and III before exposure to drugs appeared very similar (cf. Figures 7A,B).", "Figure 7Average Raman spectra in the spectral interval 2,800~3,100 cm\u22121 for Clade II/Clade III as-cultured cells (A,B), cells treated with AmB (C,D), and 5-FC (E,F).

Spectra are normalized to the CH3 band at 2,935 cm\u22121 and deconvoluted into Lorentzian/Gaussian sub-bands.", "Structures and Raman Spectra of AmB and 5-FC Drug Compounds", "AmB and 5-FC represent two main treatments in current therapies for invasive candidiasis (Vermes et al., 2000; Mesa-Arango et al., 2012); they can also be used in combined therapies to achieve synergistic effects in severe cases of cryptococcal pneumonia (Dromer et al., 2008). Despite its severe acute and chronic toxicities (Miller and Bates, 1969; Al-Dhaheri and Douglas, 2010; Grela et al., 2018), AmB is still considered the gold standard for severe mycoses treatment (Ostrosky-Zeichner et al., 2003; Lemke et al., 2005). On the other hand, 5-FC is one of the oldest antifungal drugs and has a wide spectrum of activity despite a reported drawback in monotherapy due to a rapid frequency resistance in cryptococci (Chang et al., 2021).", "From a chemical point of view, AmB is a compound constructed with a hydrophobic polyene chain included in a macrolide ring closed by a lactone and linked to a mycosamine group. On the other hand, 5-FC is an organofluorine compound structurally similar to cytosine, but presenting a fluorine atom at ring position 5 (fluorinated pyrimidine). These peculiar structures reflect into intense specific features in the respective Raman spectra of these drugs. Figures 6D,E show structures, Raman spectra and principal vibrational modes of AmB and 5-FC pure compounds, respectively. AmB presents two main bands at 1,556 and 1,167 cm\u22121; the former band, which is the most intense in the AmB spectrum, is a cumulative signal from \u2013NH3+ symmetric bending and C=C stretching, while the latter and its low-frequency shoulder at 1,136 cm\u22121 can be assigned to stretching in C-O-C and C-C-C bonds, respectively (Gagos and Arczewska, 2012). On the other hand, 5-FC presents several distinctive Raman bands, the most intense being found at 1,352 cm\u22121 (C-N-H2 symmetric bending), 1,240 cm\u22121 (C-F stretching), and 783 cm\u22121 (N-C=O bending) (Gunasekaran et al., 2006).", "Alterations of Clades II and III Spectra Upon Drug Treatment", "The most striking feature in the spectra of both Clades II and III treated for 24 h with AmB was the presence of the two main bands of the drug molecule at 1,553 cm\u22121 and 1,156 cm\u22121 with a sharp shoulder at 1,136 cm\u22121 (cf. Figures 4B, 5B). Note that the Raman bands of AmB found in the spectra of both clades cultures maintained the same relative intensities and band morphologies as those observed in the spectrum of the pure AmB compound (cf. Figure 6D). Conversely, in both clade samples treated with 5-FC, significant intensity increases were found at 767, 1,225, and 1,352 cm\u22121 (cf. Figures 4C, 5C). These bands, which arise from vibrational modes similar to those described for 5-FC, do not precisely match the wavenumbers of 5-FC, and could be assigned to another fluorinated pyrimidine, namely, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; cf. 5-FC and 5-FU structures, spectra, and main vibrational modes in Figures 6E,F, respectively) (Pavel et al., 2005). The formation of 5-FU to replace the original 5-FC structure will be detailed later in this section.", "Regarding spectral characteristics other than those directly related to drug molecules, bold vibrational alterations could be found for both Clades II and III upon exposure to drugs in comparison with unexposed samples. These characteristics, which greatly differed for exposures to different drugs, are summarized hereafter.

Figures 4B, 5B, respectively):", "The relative intensity (with respect to glucose ring band at 478 cm\u22121) of the ergosterol-related band at 713 cm\u22121 showed a decreasing trend (54 and 20% for Clades II and III, respectively; cf. Figure 8A). However, this band is also contributed by biomolecules belonging to other lipids, polysaccharides, and DNA bases. Therefore, its decreasing trend cannot be taken as a marker for ergosterol only. As a matter of fact, no decreasing trend could be found for the other ergosterol band markers at 594 and 620 cm\u22121 (cf. Figure 8A) Clade II, which was initially richer by ~32% in ergosterol (cf. Section Selection of Molecular Markers in the Raman Spectrum of C. auris), showed a 620 cm\u22121 band with neither intensity reduction nor wavenumber shift upon AmB treatment. On the other hand, a slight increase and a shift by ~4 cm\u22121 toward higher frequencies was recorded for Clade III. An important feature for both clades was the split of the 594 cm\u22121 band into two sub-bands at lower and higher wavenumbers (cf. broken lines in Figures 4B, 5B, 8A). Band split could find its rationale in the so-called AmB/ergosterol binding effect (i.e., leading to membrane permeability) (Bolard et al., 2008), and in the altered expression of sterol biosynthesis genes upon AmB treatments (Munoz et al., 2018). This point will be further discussed in the forthcoming Section Raman Insights Into Yeast Responses to AmB Exposure.", "Upon treating Clade II with AmB, the intensity of all selected chitin Raman markers (at 642, 1,056, 1,107, and 1,148 cm\u22121) increased, with the band at 1,107 cm\u22121 becoming strongly intensified by ~61% and shifting to 1,112 cm\u22121 (cf. Figure 8B). A similar increase was seen in the spectrum of Clade III but only for the band centered at 1,055 cm\u22121. On the other hand, the band at 1,107 cm\u22121 preserved the same intensity, but became a shoulder of a stronger component at ~1,100 cm\u22121. Also, the band at ~1,004 cm\u22121, which was not selected as a marker by machine learning algorithm (but yet contained strong contributions from chitin), appeared strengthened in both clades upon exposure to AmB. However, the increasing trend of this latter band was less pronounced for Clade II (cf. Figures 4B, 5B). Regarding the shift of the 1,107 cm\u22121 band to 1,112 cm\u22121 observed in Clade II, it could originate from the elimination of acetyl groups replaced by NH2 groups (Schenzel and Fischer, 2001). The ratio between ether C-O-C bonds and C-O-C bonds within rings, I1107/I1056, increased by ~25% in Clade II, while it could not obviously be computed for Clade III due to split into two new components of the band originally centered at 1,007 cm\u22121. The increase of the ratio, I1107/I1090, in Clade II can be interpreted as a fingerprint for increased chitin chain length. These points will be discussed in detail in Section Raman Insights Into Yeast Responses to AmB Exposure.", "The main difference in the structure of chitin with respect to other polysaccharides resides in the presence of an amide group at carbon 2 to replace an OH group (cf. Figure 6B). Bands characteristic of the N-acetyl group have been reported at around 1,300 cm\u22121 (Amide III), 1,528 cm\u22121 (Amide II), and 1,621/1,656 cm\u22121 (Amide I) (Focher et al., 1992; Rinaudo, 2006; Zhang et al., 2012). In both clades, all amide bands increased [consistently with other chitin markers as described in (ii)] upon treatment with AmB, thus confirming that amide signals are mainly arising from chitin (cf. Figures 4B, 5B, 8C). The occurrence of a doublet for the Amide I, which we see at 1,625 and 1,650 cm\u22121 in both clades, has been attributed to the existence of two different types of hydrogen bonds in \u03b1-chitin crystals, namely, intermolecular (C=O\u2026HN) and intramolecular (C=O\u2026HO(C6); C=O\u2026HN) hydrogen bonds (Minke and Blackwell, 1978; Focher et al., 1992). Additional Amide I band components, seen as shoulders at 1,615~1,620 and 1,687 cm\u22121, are believed to arise from different chitin secondary structures or defects in small crystalline chitin fibrils (Focher et al., 1992). Using the relative intensities of the Amide III (C-N stretching and N-H bending) or 956 cm\u22121 (C-CH3 deformation) bands (the latter labeled with an asterisk in Figures 4, 5), it is possible to estimate the degree of chitin acetylation, the higher the intensity the higher the fraction of acetylated chitin chains (Zhang et al., 2012). Moreover, as mentioned above, the Amide I doublet represent vibrations from C=O bonds linked by hydrogen bonds to either NH or C-OH groups (Minke and Blackwell, 1978). Therefore, the relative amount of hydrogen bonds linked to C=O groups is represented by the areas under the respective Amide I bands. Based on the above structural interpretation of amide-related vibrations, it becomes clear that the treatment with AmB enhanced the presence of chitin structures with a higher degree of acetylation as compared to untreated clades. However, while an almost constant intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio (0.34 vs.0.32) was preserved in Clade II, such ratio dropped by ~30% in Clade III upon drug exposure. An additional feature in the high-frequency zone was a clear increase in relative intensity of the C=O and O-C=O ester bands at ~1,730 and 1,750 cm\u22121, respectively, in both clades (cf. Figures 4, 5). Spectral characteristics related to chitin will be discussed in the forthcoming Section Raman Insights into Yeast Responses to AmB Exposure.", "The \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of glucan structures, as calculated from the intensity ratio of sub-bands at 932 cm\u22121 (from \u03b1-1, 3\u2013glucans) and 890 cm\u22121 (from \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans), changed from a common value of ~1 before AmB exposure to a common value of 0.75 in both clades after AmB exposure. Of note, it is also the strong increase relative intensity of both glucans bands in both AmB-doped clades. The increase in glucan contents and the relative enrichment in \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans upon AmB exposure represents a major change in cell-wall structure and could be the result of a regulatory mechanism to compensate for an abnormal fluidity of the membrane due to the drug-induced structural modifications of ergosterol (Mesa-Arango et al., 2016). However, the evident formation of biofilm suggests that \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans belong to an extracellular matrix network built by the cells to bind to AmB thus reducing the drug susceptibility of the clades (Nett et al., 2007).", "In the spectral zone 2,800~3,100 cm\u22121, the intensity ratio of the sub-band at 2,850 cm\u22121 to that at 2,935 cm\u22121 can be taken as a marker of the ratio of the groups CH2 to CH3, from which the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids could be predicted (Borchman et al., 1999; Jamieson et al., 2018). After exposure to AmB, increases by 1.7 and 1.5 times were observed for the intensity ratio 2,850/2,935 cm\u22121 for Clades II and III, respectively (cf. Figures 7C,D, respectively). This ratio represents the ratio between C-H(CH2) and C-H(CH3) stretching bands, which is directly proportional to the chain length of (saturated and unsaturated) fatty acids (Jamieson et al., 2018). Its increase could be interpreted as a metabolic reaction (common to both clades) against AmB. In addition, the intensity increase of the saturation sensitive peak at ~3,005 cm\u22121 (=C-H stretching in unsaturated fatty acids) with respect to the C-H(CH2) stretching peak at 2,850 cm\u22121 is in linear correlation with number of H-C= relative to number of CH2 groups for unsaturated fatty acids (Jamieson et al., 2018). A common value of ~0.22 was found for this ratio for both unexposed clades. This value remained conspicuously constant in AmB exposed Clade II, while it increased by ~23% in Clade III (cf. Figures 7C,D). Such increase, which directly represents an increase in the fraction of unsaturated fatty acids, could be interpreted as an attempt of the clade to increase its membrane fluidity to compensate for the disruptive effect of the drug.", "Candida species have developed many strategies (or survival factors), to deal with different drugs, which include modifications of plasma membrane composition by increasing the content of fatty acids (Vanegas et al., 2012). This is indeed what our present Raman data show. The Raman results support the hypothesis that yeast cells modify the content of lipids in order to prevent and counteract AmB-induced interdigitation of the plasma membrane. In other words, changes in plasma membrane composition of yeast cells in response to AmB toxicity could represent the final attempt of yeasts to increase membrane fluidity to compensate for the disruption caused by the drug.", "It was not possible to monitor the cytidine nucleoside marker band at 1,542 cm\u22121, because of overlap by the much stronger signal from AmB molecules. However, the thymidine band at 1,194 cm\u22121 could yet be detected after drug exposure. It showed a fivefold increase in Clade II but a 25% reduction in Clade III.", "Raman spectra of Clades II and III exposed for 24 h to 5-FC (cf. Figures 4C, 5C, respectively):", "A significant increase could be noted for any of the marker bands of ergosterol in both clades, with no band split and negligible band shifts. Therefore, both clades similarly reacted to the effect of 5-FC by enhancing their relative and absolute content of ergosterol. In agreement with general notions on yeast membranes and similar to the effect of quaternary ammonium salts (Siau and Kerridge, 1999; Xu et al., 2017), the present Raman data suggest that ergosterol abundance, which is key in reducing membrane permeability, was one main factor in stress adaptation for both clades.", "All marker bands of chitin significantly increased in both clades, including the band at 1,004 cm\u22121 contributed by chitin and other polysaccharides. However, clear differences could be recorded between clades in the relative intensities of different marker bands before and after drug exposure. In Clade II, both bands at 1,056 and 1,107 cm\u22121 showed a twofold intensity increase after drug exposure, while the most remarkable increase (by a factor 4) was found in the band at 1,148 cm\u22121, which also experienced a 9 cm\u22121 shift toward lower wavenumbers. In Clade III, bands at 1,055, 1,107, and 1,148 cm\u22121 showed increased intensities by factors 2.4, 2.9, and 2.5, respectively. The band at 1,055 cm\u22121 showed a clear shift of ~6 cm\u22121 toward lower frequencies. Moreover, a strong band component was newly recorded at 1,100 cm\u22121, a characteristic similar to that observed upon exposure to AmB (cf. Figure 8B). These spectral characteristics point to both fractional and at structural changes in chitin, and represent fingerprints of the metabolic changes occurring in different clades in reaction to the effect of 5-FC. In Clade II, the I1107/I1056 ratio between ether and ring C-O-C bonds, which increased by ~14%, is fingerprint for an increased length in chitin chains. The appearance of a relatively strong signal at 1,100 cm\u22121 in Clade III instead reflects the formation of chitin allomorphs (discussed further in the forthcoming Section Discussion). Both the above characteristics were substantially the same as those respectively observed in clades exposed to AmB, suggesting the existence of specific metabolic patterns for each clade in response to stress.", "Minor variations in the relative intensities of bands belonging to both Amides I and II were observed in Clade II upon 5-FC treatment, while significant increases were recorded for the same vibrations in Clade III (with the maximum intensity increase of 140% observed for the Amide II band at 1,452 cm\u22121). Consistently, exposure to 5-FC led to a significant increase of the Amide III band (at ~1,300 cm\u22121) and the C-CH3 deformation band (at 956 cm\u22121; labeled with an asterisk in Figures 4, 5), but only in Clade III. Following the same reasoning given for interpreting the spectroscopic behavior of amide bands in clades treated with AmB, it appears that exposure to 5-FC enhanced the fraction of chitin structures with a high degree of acetylation only in Clade III. An analysis of the Amide I doublet at 1,625 (intermolecular C=O\u2026HN chitin bonds) and 1,650 cm\u22121 (intramolecular C=O\u2026HO(C6) and C=O\u2026HN chitin bonds) revealed that both clades experienced a clear increase in the intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio upon drug exposure. A clear increase in relative intensity of the C=O ester band (at 1,745 cm\u22121) upon 5-FC treatment could only be recorded in Clade III (cf. Figures 4C, 5C).", "Similar to the case of treatment with AmB, the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of glucan structures switched from the value of ~1 characteristic of both unexposed clades to a common value of 0.66 after 5-FC exposure. The enrichment in \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans together with the increased content of chitin could yet be interpreted as a physiological reaction of both clades to drug exposure, in the attempt to stiffen the membrane. Note, however, that the observed change in glucan structure could also be partly related to yeast-to-hyphae morphogenesis (cf. Figures 1c,g for Clades II and III, respectively). Other authors reported an enhanced \u03b2-glucan content in hyphae when cells were treated with a sub-inhibitory concentration of caspofungin (Wheeler et al., 2008).", "In the spectral zone 2,800~3,100 cm\u22121, the intensity ratio of the sub-band at 2,850 cm\u22121 to that at 2,935 cm\u22121showed a slight decrease (~10%) in Clade II, while it increased abruptly by ~1.8 times in Clade III upon exposure to 5-FC (cf. Figures 7E,F, respectively). As stated in the previous section, this ratio represents the intensity of C-H(CH2) to C-H(CH3) stretching bands; therefore, it is directly related to the chain length of (saturated and unsaturated) fatty acids, the higher the ratio the longer the chain (Jamieson et al., 2018). Moreover, the ratio between the intensity of the saturation sensitive peak at ~3,005 cm\u22121 (=C-H stretching, peculiar to unsaturated fatty acids) and the C-H(CH2) stretching peak at 2,850 cm\u22121 is in linear correlation with number of H-C= relative to number of CH2 groups for unsaturated fatty acids (Jamieson et al., 2018). This ratio remained conspicuously unchanged for both 5-FC exposed clades with respect to unexposed clades (cf. Figures 7E,F), thus showing that the above-mentioned elongation in fatty acid chains for Clade III did not involve any correspondent increase in fatty acid content.", "The Raman markers of thymidine and cytidine nucleosides (at ~1,194 cm\u22121 and 1,542 cm\u22121, respectively) completely disappeared in Clade II and appeared significantly weakened in Clade III upon exposure to 5-FC (cf. labels in Figures 4C, 5C).", "The spectroscopic characteristics obtained on average spectra for both clades/treatments were then subjected to confirmation by means of further characterizations based on Raman mapping and imaging, according to protocols described in previous works (Pezzotti, 2021; Pezzotti et al., 2021).", "Raman Imaging of C. Auris Metabolic Reactions to Drug", "The data shown in the previous section revealed fundamental differences between Raman spectra collected on Clades II and III before and after drug treatments and for different drugs as well. The detected differences included cell wall lipids and polysaccharides, specifically ergosterol and chitin, respectively, as well as DNA thymidine and cytidine nucleosides. In order to confirm the above findings, Raman mapping was performed with micrometric spatial resolution in order to image compositional differences in Clades II and III before and after exposure to AmB and 5-FC. The total number of Raman spectra collected in each map/image per each clade/drug was in the order of 106 over an area of ~103 \u03bcm2. The acquisition of a large number of space-resolved Raman spectra enabled statistical validation of the findings obtained on the average spectra shown in Figures 4, 5, as discussed elsewhere (Pezzotti et al., 2021).", "Figure 9 summarizes the findings of Raman mapping for different clades through a series of hyperspectral images for selected molecular markers. Sections (a) and (b), which refer to Clades II and III, respectively, shows (from top to bottom) optical micrographs of the cultures, and spatially resolved Raman maps (taken at fixed locations) of signals at 1,107 cm\u22121, 620 cm\u22121, 1,542 cm\u22121, 1,194 cm\u22121, and 1,650 cm\u22121 as representative markers for membrane chitin, ergosterol, DNA cytidine and thymidine nucleosides, and Amide I, respectively. Raman mapping experiments basically confirmed the trends observed in average spectra, namely, ~15% higher and ~20% lower fractions of ergosterol and chitin, respectively, in Clade II as compared to Clade III. On the other hand, no difference could be noticed in mapping nucleoside markers. In Section (c) and (d), optical images and Raman hyperspectral images of chitin, ergosterol, amphotericin B molecules, and Amide I (cf. monitored wavenumbers in inset) are shown (from top to bottom) for Clades II and III, respectively. As seen, AmB molecules, which were represented by the strong Raman marker at 1,556 cm\u22121, were clearly located inside cells for both clades, with the intense signals mainly localized around the cell membrane. On the other hand, signals from both chitin and Amide I (at 1,650 cm\u22121) were stronger and more spatially diffuse as compared to as-cultured cells for both Clades II and III. Also, the spatial distribution of ergosterol signals appeared more diffuse but similar in intensity to those of the as-cultured clades.", "Figure 9Optical micrographs and spatially resolved Raman data collected on different clades before and after treatments with different drugs; the latter are given as a series of hyperspectral maps for selected molecular markers: (A,B) control, (C,D) AmB-treated, and (E,F) 5-FC-treated Clades II and III, respectively; the targeted molecules (including those of the respective drugs) and the corresponding fingerprint wavenumbers are given by labels in inset to each section.

Optical images, and maps of chitin, ergosterol, 5-FU, cytidine, and thymidine markers are given from top to bottom in each section. The penetration of the drug inside the cells is seen in both clades as a strong signal at 1,532 cm\u22121, which is the main marker for 5-FU (cf. Figure 6F). The chitin marker produced highly intense images in both clades, while maps for the chitin marker appeared to be substantially the same as those recorded for as-cultured cells. On the other hand, marker signals from both cytidine and thymidine nucleosides almost disappeared at any location for both clades. Trends in physiological responses of different clades to different drug treatments, as represented by Raman sub-bands of molecular markers, were averaged over the entire maps of Figure 9. As a general output, Raman mapping experiments conducted with microscopic spatial resolution matched with high precision the spectroscopic assessments made on larger areas with lower spatial resolution for both investigated clades (i.e., as summarized in Figure 8)."]
