All three phototrophic model species tested, namely the cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. WH7803, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, showed a strong decline in the presence of S.\u00a0tropica, being especially remarkable for the two former strains (Fig.\u00a01A). While also affected, the diatom P.\u00a0tricornutum was not killed by S.\u00a0tropica but, instead, its cells densities were significantly maintained one order of magnitude lower than when incubated axenically. While we were able to monitor the inhibition of the phototroph, we were unable to assess the growth profile of S.\u00a0tropica in the co\u2010culture due to its growth in dense cell aggregates preventing traditional monitoring techniques (e.g. optical density, colony\u2010forming unit or flow cytometry).", "Fig. 1\nSalinispora tropica inhibits the growth of marine phototrophs via the secretion of an antimicrobial molecule (A) S.\u00a0tropica inhibits marine phototrophs growth in co\u2010culture.

While members of other Salinispora species, such as Salinispora arenicola, are known to biosynthesize antibiotic molecules (Asolkar et al., 2010), no antimicrobial compound has yet been characterized in S.\u00a0tropica CNB\u2010440. Previous studies have shown, however, that S.\u00a0tropica is able to outcompete other heterotrophs in co\u2010culture by secreting siderophores leading to iron depletion (Patin et al., 2016). To evaluate whether iron sequestration could explain the negative interactions observed in the present phototroph\u2010Salinispora system, we supplemented the co\u2010cultures with increasing concentrations of iron (Fig.\u00a0S1). The results obtained suggest that the antimicrobial phenotype was not due to siderophore activity, as saturating amounts of iron could not rescue the growth of the phototrophs.", "We then hypothesized that a yet unknown antimicrobial compound, to which our photosynthetic microorganisms are sensitive to, could be produced by S.\u00a0tropica. To test this assumption, we set up co\u2010cultures in which the S.\u00a0tropica and Synechococcus strains were physically separated by a porous filter, preventing direct cell to cell interactions while allowing the diffusion of small molecules (Fig.\u00a01B). S.\u00a0tropica was still able to impair Synechococcus proliferation in these experimental conditions, confirming that a secreted molecule was causing the death of the phototroph.", "Phototrophs elicit the production of novel cryptic metabolites in S.\u00a0tropica", "We analysed the co\u2010culture supernatants using non\u2010targeted metabolomics to identify the pool of secondary metabolites secreted by S.\u00a0tropica in response to the different phototrophs.

These molecules were further characterized by high\u2010resolution MS/MS analysis, from which we generated empirical chemical formulae, allowing us to assign most of them to two subgroups of related compounds being: (i) ions 1, 2, 5 and 8; and (ii) ions 4, 6 and 7 (Fig.\u00a02A; Table\u00a0S1).", "Fig. 2Marine phototrophs trigger the production of cryptic molecules in S.\u00a0tropica (A) S.\u00a0tropica produces detectable small molecules in co\u2010culture with Synechococcus.

Molecules 5 and 8 are consistent with known degradation products of salinosporamide A and B, respectively (Denora et al., 2007; Fig.\u00a0S2), while molecules 1 and 2 are proposed to result from the nucleophilic addition of Tris (the buffering agent used in the ASW culture medium) to the lactone ring of salinosporamide A and B, respectively (Fig.\u00a0S2). These salinosporamide sub\u2010products were further confirmed by their absence when (i) Tris was not added (Fig.\u00a0S3), or (ii) salinosporamide mutants that no longer produced these metabolites, that is salA\u2010 and salL\u2010 (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2009), were used (Fig.\u00a0S4). In order to test the activity of salinosporamide and its derivatives on the phototrophs, we co\u2010cultured Synechococcus with both salinosporamide mutants. Salinosporamide and its derivatives were not responsible for the antimicrobial activity as both deficient mutants were still able to inhibit the phototroph (Fig.\u00a0S5).", "The second group of ions, that is peaks 4, 6 and 7, were also related. Molecule 6 gave a m/z value of 435.2609 [M\u00a0+\u00a0H]+; based on the accuracy of this value and the isotopic pattern the empirical chemical formula C22H35N4O5 was predicted by the DataAnalysis software (Table\u00a02). The predicted formula for molecule 4 suggests that, with a 28.9900\u00a0Da mass difference when compared to 6, the compound had lost one hydrogen and gained an atom of nitrogen and oxygen. MS/MS analyses confirmed that both molecules 4 and 6 had an identical molecular fragment (i.e. m/z 276.1600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0001 [M\u00a0+\u00a0H]+, with the empirical chemical formula C16H22NO3), indicating that the two molecules share a core backbone (Table\u00a02; Fig.\u00a0S6, S7). Similarly, molecule 7 had the same chemical formula as 6 but with the addition of a methyl group (14.0155\u00a0Da mass difference; Table\u00a02). Finally, MS/MS fragmentation of the three molecules 4, 6 and 7 resulted in the related molecular fragments m/z 171.088, 142.0979 and 156.1135, respectively, which showed differences in masses and empirical formulae identical to that observed between their corresponding parent ions (Table\u00a02; Fig.\u00a0S6, S7). Molecule 3 did not share an obvious link to any other metabolites and, therefore, was considered a new biosynthesized product of S.tropica (Table\u00a02).

Furthermore, we confirmed that the supernatant of a phototroph culture \u2013 containing the photosynthate \u2013 was enough to induce such metabolite production (Fig.\u00a02D).", "Photosynthate triggers the expression of orphan gene clusters in S.\u00a0tropica", "Having detected novel secondary metabolites produced by S.\u00a0tropica in response to phototroph\u2010released photosynthate, we set out to investigate how it affected the induction of its BGCs. To this end, we analysed and compared the proteome of S.\u00a0tropica when grown in presence of the phytoplankton photosynthate \u2013 that is in conditioned Synechococcus supernatant (SUPSYN) where the cryptic molecules are produced \u2013 and in nutrient\u2010rich broth \u2013 that is marine broth (MB) where the cryptic molecules are not detected. Considering that the medium SUPSYN is effectively artificial seawater with some phototroph\u2010released nutrients, we also incubated S.\u00a0tropica in fresh artificial seawater (ASW) as a control. The rationale behind using the SUPSYN medium rather than co\u2010inoculating S.\u00a0tropica with Synechococcus was twofold. First, it had the advantage to avoid Synechococcus proteins that may interfere with the correct detection of Salinispora proteins. Second, we reasoned that it would reduce potential variations in protein expression caused by Synechococcus\u2010Salinispora cell to cell interactions and/or the limitation in carbon availability that would occur early in the co\u2010culture in ASW.", "Overall, the datasets obtained contain close to 1,900 proteins (i.e. 1869, 1797 and 1831 detected proteins for the MB, ASW and SUPSYN conditions, respectively) representing about 40 % of the total expected proteome of S.\u00a0tropica (Table\u00a0S2; File\u00a0S1). We found that 10 % of those detected proteins could be linked to BGCs (Table\u00a0S2), a figure consistent with the estimated percentage of the S.\u00a0tropica genome to be devoted to natural product assembly (Udwary et al., 2007). Interestingly, while the actual numbers of BGC\u2010related proteins were similar in all three conditions tested, we found that their cumulative abundances accounted for a significantly higher proportion of the proteomes when cells were grown in presence of the phytoplankton\u2019s photosynthate compared to both MB and ASW (Table\u00a0S2). As we believed this observation suggests that phototrophic cells prompt an increase of S.\u00a0tropica secondary metabolism, we were interested in identifying which BGCs were expressed and influenced by photosynthate. Surprisingly, we were able to detect proteins encoded by almost all of S.\u00a0tropica\u2019s BGCs regardless of the incubation medium, including 10 of its 11 orphans BGCs (Fig.\u00a03, File\u00a0S1).", "Fig. 3Photosynthate allows the expression of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters in S.\u00a0tropica.

Moreover, the pks3 BGC was noticeably highly detected as eight of its detected proteins showed a relative abundance above 0.1% (Fig.\u00a03; Table\u00a0S3). While it has been previously suggested that pks3 may produce a spore pigment polyketide, very little experimental evidence is available in the literature, and the product of pks3 had not been confirmed (Kersten et al., 2013). On the other hand, the non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster nrps1 has only been predicted to produce a non\u2010ribosomal dipeptide (Penn et al., 2009). Intriguingly, the most abundant proteins detected from this nrps1 BGC were the non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase (A4X2Q0), an adenylation domain\u2010containing protein (A4X2R4), a condensation domain\u2010containing protein (A4X2R5) and an ATP\u2010dependent Clp protease subunit (A4X2S2), with a relative abundance of 0.004%, 0.004%, 0.001% and 0.121% respectively (Table\u00a03).

However, this metabolite previously showed no antimicrobial activity on co\u2010cultured heterotrophic organisms (Patin et al., 2018) and, hence, it is unlikely to cause the antimicrobial phenotype observed on the phototrophs in this study. The high abundance of the sal cluster, producing the salinosporamide compound, is not surprising given the high detection of this metabolite by LC\u2010MS (Fig.\u00a02A).", "Interestingly, although all BGCs appeared to be similarly active between conditions with regards to the detection of their proteins (i.e. the same proteins were generally present in the different proteomes, rather than being conditional to one growth medium), a thorough comparative analysis of their expression levels revealed that phototroph\u2010released nutrients could specifically trigger several proteins within the BGC nrps1 (Fig.\u00a04). For instance, the orphan pks3 BGC showed an up\u2010regulation of pivotal enzymes for polyketide biosynthesis when cells were grown in the SUPSYN medium compared to MB. Namely, an acyl\u2010CoA ligase (A4X7T8), a 3\u2010ketoacyl\u2010ACP synthase (A4X7U0) and a long\u2010chain fatty acid\u2010CoA ligase (A4X7U3) were up\u2010regulated 3.1, 2.6 and 4.1\u2010fold, respectively (Fig.\u00a04A). These variations in protein detection could not, however, be confidently attributed solely to the presence of photosynthate because they were also observed at similar levels in the ASW condition. This could indicate that the orphan pks3 cluster\u2019s expression is regulated by nutrient availability as it is less active in a nutrient\u2010rich broth like MB. On the other hand, the activity of the BGC nrps1 was more clearly up\u2010regulated by the presence of photosynthate (Fig.\u00a04B and C). This included three core biosynthetic enzymes, namely a non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase (12.5\u2010fold change increase in the SUPSYN condition compared to the MB treatment; A4X2Q0), a ketoreductase domain\u2010containing protein (1.6\u2010fold change; A4X2Q2) and an adenylation domain\u2010containing protein (3.4\u2010fold change; A4X2R4). Unlike the pks3 BGC, photosynthate did specifically trigger an increase in the expression of the BGC nrps1, as it exhibited a similar up\u2010regulation in the SUPSYN condition compared to the two other treatments, that is ASW and MB (Fig.\u00a04C).", "Fig. 4Photosynthate increases the expression of the orphan nrps1 BGC in S.\u00a0tropica.
