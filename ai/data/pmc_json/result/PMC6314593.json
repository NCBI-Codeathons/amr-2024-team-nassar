["Results", "Identification and cloning of putative microbial enzymes via a synthetic metagenomic pipeline", "We used a metagenomic sequencing pipeline (Fig 1A) to identify four microbial genes from porcupine fecal samples predicted to encode putative cellulose- or hemicellulose-degrading enzymes; a \u03b2-glucosidase, an \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase, a \u03b2-xylosidase, and an endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase (Figs 1B and 2A). In brief, shotgun sequences were trimmed and assembled into contigs (Fig 1A). Open reading frames (ORFs) with upstream bacterial ribosome binding sites were identified on the compiled contigs. ORFs were translated in silico and identified by similarity of predicted primary amino acid sequences to conserved domains from known enzymes found in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (Fig 1B). We specifically queried \u03b2-glucosidase enzymes that catalyze the final step in cellulose degradation by converting cellobiose disaccharides to glucose monomers (Fig 2B), and \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase, \u03b2-xylosidase, and endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase enzymes that catalyze sequential steps in the degradation of hemicellulose to xylose monomers (Fig 2C). This collection of putative enzymes is insufficient to achieve full degradation of complex lignocellulose substrates, but their synthesis and characterization served as an important test of our synthetic metagenomic pipeline.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0209221.g001Fig 1Identification of four genes from the porcupine microbiome with putative cellulose- and/or hemicellulose-degrading activity using a metagenomic sequencing pipeline.The bioinformatic pipeline (A) began with Illumina MiSeq data previously collected from a porcupine fecal DNA sequencing project [14].

To determine the genetic origin of the genes of interest, the predicted primary amino acid sequence of each candidate gene was queried against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [18]. Each of the four putative enzymes from the porcupine microbiome were most closely related to enzymes encoded by anaerobic bacteria, which was expected because the gut is an anaerobic environment. Specifically, the putative \u03b2-xylosidase was 75% identical (100% coverage) to a \u03b2-xylosidase from Butyrivibrio sp. CAG:318. The putative \u03b2-glucosidase was 73% identical (99% coverage) to a \u03b2-glucosidase encoded by Bacteroides faecis MAJ27. The putative \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase was 63% identical (92% coverage) to a glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 43 protein encoded by Prevotella sp. CAG:732. The putative endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase was 55% identical (99% coverage) to a hypothetical protein BHV73_02415 encoded by Bacteroides sp. 44_46 and predicted to contain GH10 and GH43 domains. We concluded that the four genes we selected for study were novel but nevertheless closely related to previously identified genes from anaerobic bacteria encoding known cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes.", "Phylogenetic analysis of all four putative gene products was performed using the 22 closest homologs for each (S1 Table). The putative endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase and \u03b2-glucosidase enzymes clustered closely with their homologs in a clade (Fig 3). These clades were strongly supported by high bootstrap values (100 and 100, respectively) on each node, generated from compiling 100 separate trees. The putative \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase did not fall into a clade, but did cluster with its closest homologs, whereas \u03b2-xylosidase clustered poorly. Next, predicted amino acid sequences of all four putative enzymes were aligned with closest homologs to determine conservation of key catalytic residues (S1A\u2013S1D Fig). A key aspartic acid is conserved in the catalytic domain of the putative \u03b2-glucosidase; this residue was conserved across all 22 proteins analyzed, with 4 examples aligned to the putative enzyme in S1A Fig By contrast, the catalytic domain of endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase consists of two conserved aspartic acids and a glutamic acid; all three residues were perfectly conserved amongst all 22 proteins analyzed and 4 example sequences were aligned to the putative endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase in S1B Fig \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase similarly has two conserved aspartic acids and a single glutamic acid in the active site that is perfectly conserved amongst all proteins analyzed (S1B Fig). The putative \u03b2-xylosidase showed low conservation from amino acids 190\u2013230, but the conserved catalytic domain requiring the two conserved aspartic acids and a single glutamic acid were also found to be conserved amongst all analyzed sequences.

Because directed secretion of enzymes provides access to extracellular lignocellulosic substrates, each candidate gene was cloned as a fusion protein bearing an amino-terminal PelB motif required for periplasmic localization and subsequent secretion. A hexahistidine (6xHIS) tag was added to carboxy-termini of each fusion protein to enable affinity purification. Log-phase E. coli cultures were treated with IPTG to induce transgene expression, followed by harvest of cell supernatant, periplasm and total cell fractions. Specifically, proteins in the supernatant were harvested by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation and periplasmic proteins were harvested by cold osmotic extraction as previously described [19]. These fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to detect 6XHIS fusion proteins (Fig 4). All four putative enzymes accumulated in the total cell fraction at the predicted molecular weight: \u03b2-xylosidase at ~51 kDa, endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase at ~81 kDa, \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase at ~61 kDa, and \u03b2-glucosidase at ~84 kDa (Fig 4A).

Consistent with published reports, purified DesR efficiently cleaved a p-Nitrophenyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG) substrate in vitro at pH 7 (Fig 5B). By contrast, our putative \u03b2-glucosidase failed to cleave p-NPG over a broad pH range. Moreover, expression of the putative \u03b2-glucosidase in E. coli did not enable growth on cellobiose as a sole carbon source. Taken together, these findings indicate that our putative \u03b2-glucosidase does not function in conventional \u03b2-glucosidase assays. Because proteins with glycosyl hydrolase family 3 (GH3) domains can also have N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase activity, we tested our putative \u03b2-glucosidase and the DesR control for cleavage of p-Nitrophenyl \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (p-NPNAG). As expected, DesR did not cleave p-NPNAG. However, the putative \u03b2-glucosidase also failed to cleave p-NPNAG over a broad pH range (pH 5, 6, and 7) (Fig 5C). Taken together, these findings indicate that while the DesR control functioned as expected, the putative \u03b2-glucosidase from the porcupine microbiome did not display \u03b2-glucosidase or N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase activity.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0209221.g005Fig 5Purification and characterization of \u03b2-glucosidase.A) Putative \u03b2-glucosidase and positive control \u03b2-glucosidase DesR (marked with red arrows) were affinity purified by 6xHis purification.
