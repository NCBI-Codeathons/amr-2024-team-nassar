["RESULTS", "Sxph crystal structure reveals a modified transferrin fold", "The 2.5-\u00c5 resolution x-ray crystal structure of American bullfrog (R. catesbeiana) Sxph (Fig. 1A, fig. S1, A and B, and table S1) revealed a bilobal organization similar to transferrins (30, 31), consisting of an N-lobe (residues 1 to 88 and 232 to 465) and a C-lobe (residues 470 to 825) connected by a linker. Both lobes contain two subdomains, designated N1 (residues 1 to 88 and 389 to 465), N2 (residues 232 to 388), C1 (residues 470 to 557 and 726 to 825), and C2 (residues 558 to 725). The N1 and C1 subdomains comprise discontinuous polypeptides into which N2 and C2 are inserted, respectively (fig. S2). Unlike other transferrin family members, Sxph has a 143-residue (residues 89 to 231) insertion between N1 and N2 that encodes two Thy1 repeats (fig. S2) (18, 23). The two Sxph protomers in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical except for a displacement of the first thyroglobulin repeat by ~24\u00b0 (fig. S1B).

Colors and labels are the same as in (A).", "The organization of the Sxph core architecture (N1, N2, C1, and C2) is conserved with transferrin (Fig. 1B). Sxph has 21 disulfides. Fourteen are conserved in the transferrin family. Seven are unique (Fig. 1C), of which five are in the Thy1 repeats (SS4 to SS8). The other two connect the \u03b11N1 and \u03b14N1 C-terminal ends (SS3) and the interdomain linker at the start of N2 to the C2 C-terminal tail (SS9) (Fig. 1C and fig. S2). The two Sxph lobes are related by a rigid body motion around the intersubdomain hinge that involves both a closure (~30\u00b0) and a twist (~60\u00b0) between the relatively closed (N-lobe) and open (C-lobe) conformations, respectively, (fig. S1C) that resembles the lobe conformations defined by apo- and Fe3+-bound transferrin (32). Similar to other transferrin family structures, there is a small (558 \u00c52) mainly hydrophobic interface between N-lobe and C-lobe.", "Consistent with the inability of Sxph to bind Fe3+ (18, 31), almost all of the residues in each lobe required to coordinate Fe3+ and an associated carbonate (33) differ substantially from the conserved transferrin ligands (Fig. 1B and fig. S3). There are also no interlobe \u03b3-turns, a feature of all avian and mammalian transferrins that is thought to aid interlobe cleft opening for Fe3+ binding (32, 34). Together, the structural data establish that Sxph has a transferrin-like fold having numerous modifications and demonstrate why Sxph lacks the classic transferrin Fe3+-binding function (35).", "Sxph Thy1 repeats resemble Thy1 protease inhibitors", "The ~60 residue thyroglobulin motif occurs in diverse proteins such as thyroglobulin, insulin-like growth factor\u2013binding proteins, and the p41 invariant (Ii) chain involved in major histocompatibility complex class II maturation (36\u201339). The Sxph thyroglobulin domain forms an independent structure protruding from the N-lobe core (Fig. 1A). The two Thy1 repeats, Thy1-1 and Thy1-2 (Fig. 2A), adopt similar folds containing an \u03b1-helix and two antiparallel \u03b2-strands. Thy1-1 conforms to the Thy1 type 1A motif stabilized by three disulfides (40), whereas Thy1-2 lacks the inter\u2013\u03b2-strand disulfide and conforms to the Thy1 type 1B motif (40). Both Sxph Thy1 repeats have a wedge shape presenting three loops from one end and bear strong structural similarity to each other and the p41 Ii Thy1 repeat (Fig. 2B) (38).", "Fig. 2Comparison of Sxph Thy1-1 and Thy1-2 with p41 Ii.(A) Sequence comparison.

(E) Superposition of Sxph Thy1-1 (light orange), Thy1-2 (marine), and p41 Ii (magenta) in the context of the p41 Ii:cathepsin L interface.", "Similar to p41 Ii, Sxph is a potent cysteine protease inhibitor, affecting cathepsin L, cathepsin B, and papain with nanomolar potency (23). The two Thy1 repeats appear to enable Sxph to engage these targets with different stoichiometries (1:1 for cathepsin L and cathepsin B and 1:2 for papain) (23). Superposition of the p41:cathepsin L complex on the Thy1-1 and Thy1-2 domains (Fig. 2, C and D) indicates that the Thy1-1 repeat can bind the protease unhindered, whereas binding to Thy1-2 incurs clashes (Fig. 2D and fig. S4A). Superposition of papain, an enzyme very similar to cathepsin L but that Sxph binds with a 1:2 stoichiometry (23), shows similar clashes (fig. S4, A and B). Hence, it seems likely that local rearrangements mitigate these clashes. Comparison of the Sxph Thy1 domains with the p41:cathepsin L complex (38) highlights the features that likely contribute to Sxph Thy1 domain:protease interaction specificity (Fig. 2E). The conserved central Loop 2 (Fig. 2A) can be well positioned over the cathepsin L active site cysteine (Fig. 2E). Loop 3 of both repeats is longer than in p41 Ii (Fig. 2, A and B). However, this difference would not interfere with enzyme binding, as the p41 Loop 3 interactions between Arg250 and the cathepsin L pocket lined by Trp189 and Trp193 are replaced by similar Sxph loop 3 tight turns in Thy1-1 and Thy1-2 (Fig. 2E). Loop 1 has the most varied conformations among Thy1 domains (fig. S4, C and D) and, in Thy1-1 and Thy1-2, has different mobilities, as Thy1-2 Loop 1 lacks visible electron density that indicates disorder. Comparison with the p41:cathepsin L complex shows that Thy1-1 Loop 1 occupies the protease S2 pocket in a manner in which any observed clashes could be relieved by modest reorganization. Loop 1, the point of highest sequence divergence between Thy1-1 and Thy1-2 (Fig. 2A), is likely responsible for binding specificity differences. Together, these analyses indicate how variations in Thy1 Loop 3 can recognize a common target, support the role of Loop 1 in protease recognition specificity (40), and suggest why Sxph binds similar proteases with different stoichiometries.", "Structure of the Sxph:STX complex reveals a novel STX-binding site", "Sxph binds STX with high affinity (Kd, 0.2 nM) and a 1:1 stoichiometry (20). Crystals made by soaking apo-Sxph crystals with STX or by cocrystallization diffracted x-rays to 2.50- and 2.12-\u00c5 resolutions, respectively (table S1). The asymmetric units in both contained two essentially identical Sxph:STX complexes (root mean square deviation of C\u03b1 position, 0.5 \u00c5) that provide a high-resolution view of the Sxph:STX interaction (table S1). Because of its superior resolution and completeness, our description focuses on molecule B of the Sxph:STX cocrystallization complex.", "Sxph and STX interact with a 1:1 stoichiometry matching biochemical studies (16, 21). However, contrary to the idea that the STX-binding site is made by a remodeled Fe3+-binding cavity in the C1-C2 Sxph interdomain cleft (20), the Sxph:STX structure shows that a novel, solvent-exposed surface C1 pocket of ~14 \u00c5 away from the C1-C2 cleft forms the STX-binding site (Fig. 1A and figs. S1A and S5A) comprising C1 domain elements \u03b13C1, \u03b24C1, \u03b16C1, and the \u03b26C1-\u03b16C1 loop (Fig. 3A). Counter to previous proposals (20, 22), there are no large-scale conformational changes between apo-Sxph and Sxph:STX (fig. S5A). Hence, the Sxph:STX interaction occurs in an entirely unanticipated manner.", "Fig. 3Sxph STX-binding site.(A) Apo-Sxph (olive) and STX-bound Sxph (slate) superposition cartoon diagram.

S5B). The STX pocket uses a set of charged side chains that directly engage the toxin together with contributions from backbone hydrogen bonding groups, van der Waals interactions, and a cation-\u03c0 interaction (Fig. 3, A to C). A set of side chain carboxyls coordinate the five- and six-membered guanidinium rings engaging all available STX guanidinium nitrogen atoms. Asp785 and Asp794 form a network that encompasses the three nitrogen atoms of the guanidinium group on the five-membered ring (Fig. 3, A to C), whereas the Glu540 side chain interacts with both available six-membered ring guanidinium nitrogens (Fig. 3, A to C). This intimate involvement of acidic side chains agrees with the observation that Sxph treatment with trimethyloxonium tetrafluorborate, a reagent that methylates aspartate and glutamate carboxylates, inhibits STX binding (20). Backbone carbonyl interactions from Asp785 with the five-membered ring N16 atom and Tyr795 with the six-membered ring N13 atom augment the side chain networks (Fig. 3C). Phe784 forms the STX-binding pocket base and makes a cation-\u03c0 interaction with the STX five-membered ring guanidinium (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, rather than hydrophobic interactions as proposed (22), multiple sets of complimentary charged-based interactions comprise the Sxph:STX complex.", "Although there are no large-scale changes between apo-Sxph and Sxph:STX (fig. S5A), some local rearrangements in the STX-binding pocket are evident from the initial difference maps (fig. S1A) and structure refinement. Asp785 shows the largest change and acts like a latch that faces away from the apo-Sxph pocket and that closes to interact with the STX N7 atom (Fig. 3, A and B, fig. S1A, and movie S1). The remaining changes involve a small movement of the Glu540 away from the pocket and a ~15\u00b0 rotation of the Tyr558 ring (Fig. 3B and movie S1). Hence, Sxph:STX high-affinity interaction results from capture of the rigid toxin by an essentially preformed binding site.", "Radioligand competitive displacement studies of STX derivatives (fig. S5B) (19) match the observed binding pose and side chain interactions. In line with the observation that STX carbamoyl moiety does not interact with Sxph, removal of this group (decarbamoyl STX; fig. S5B) or its modification with a sulfate (gonyautoxin V; fig. S5B) had only a ~2-fold and no impact on affinity, respectively (19). By contrast, hydroxylation of the six-membered ring N1 atom (neosaxitoxin; fig. S5B) reduced affinity by ~550-fold, supporting the importance of the interaction between N1 and Glu540. Further, sulfation of the C11 atom in the STX C1 derivative (fig. S5B) reduced binding relative to the STX B1 parent by ~150-fold, consistent with a clash between the sulfate and \u03b16C1. The excellent agreement of these biochemical studies validates the observed binding pose and outlines how Sxph recognizes diverse naturally occurring STX derivatives.", "STX-binding site elements are absent from transferrins and Sxph N-lobe", "Transferrins do not bind STX (35), and the STX-binding pocket resides in a region that has not been reported to bind small molecules in other transferrin family members. How then did nature sculpt the STX-binding pocket from a na\u00efve transferrin scaffold? Comparison of Sxph with two exemplar transferrins, Fe3+-bound rabbit serum transferrin [Protein Data Bank (PDB): 1JNF] (41) (Fig. 4A) and apo-human serum transferrin (PDB: 2HAU) (32) (Fig. 4B), reveals a shallow \u201cproto-pocket\u201d on the transferrin C1 subdomain surface at the location of the STX-binding site. Notably, the structural homologs of the residues that form Sxph:STX interactions differ considerably (fig. S3). In the transferrins, positively charged and small hydrophobic residues are found at the positions of the Sxph acidic residues that coordinate the STX five-membered (Asp785 and Asp794) and six-membered (Glu540) rings, respectively. Further, residues corresponding to Phe784, the amino acid responsible for the cation-\u03c0 interaction, are all branched, hydrophobic residues incapable of making this type of interaction.", "Fig. 4Sxph STX-binding site and transferrin proto-pocket.(A and B) Superposition of the Sxph (marine) STX-binding site with (A) Fe3+-bound rabbit serum transferrin (PDB: 1JNF) (41) (pink) and (B) apo-human serum transferrin (PDB: 2HAU) (32) (gray).

Structural comparisons highlight changes in Spxh elements on opposite sides of the pocket that expand its size (Fig. 4, C to E). Namely, the Sxph \u03b16C1 helix position differs from the corresponding transferrin helices (residues 643 to 648 and 646 to 650 in rabbit and human transferrin, respectively; Fig. 4, A and B), and the loop adjacent to the STX carbamate (residues 555 to 561) differs relative to the corresponding transferrin structure (residues 418 to 423 and 419 to 424 in rabbit and human transferrin, respectively; Fig. 4, A and B). This Sxph loop is buttressed by the \u03b14C1 helix, which is absent in transferrin (Fig. 4, A and B, and fig. S3). Collectively, these changes create a site ringed by a set of negatively charged atoms that complement the dicationic STX (Fig. 4E).", "Sxph N1 and C1 are structurally similar (fig. S6A), and N1 has a proto-pocket that corresponds to the C1 STX-binding site. This proto-pocket is more open than in the transferrins and is framed on one side by two helices, \u03b15N1 and \u03b16N1, that match the C1 domain \u03b16C1 and \u03b17C1 (fig. S6B). However, \u03b16N1 and Tyr82 on the opposite side of the narrow N1 proto-pocket would clash with the toxin near the C12 hemiketal and C13 carbamate, respectively (fig. S6A). Most importantly, Sxph N1 lacks residues that could coordinate STX. The C1 residues that engage the two guanidinium rings, Glu540, Asp794, Asp785, and Phe784, are replaced in N1 by Ala79, Leu448, Ser441, and Leu440, respectively, rendering the site incapable of making the necessary electrostatic and cation-\u03c0 interactions (fig. S6A). Further, the N1 proto-pocket is occluded by \u03b18C1, \u03b27C1, and \u03b25T (fig. S6C). Hence, a multitude of factors prevents Sxph from using the N1 subdomain proto-pocket as a second STX-binding site.", "A frog Sxph homolog has the STX-binding motif", "Although other STX-binding proteins have been reported (24\u201327), none are related to Sxph. We identified Sxph-like sequences in an invertebrate, springtail (Folsomia candida); two fish, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Northern pike (Esox lucius); and the High Himalaya frog (Nanorana parkeri) (fig. S7). All share the transferrin fold core with Sxph and carry mutations that would prevent Fe3+ binding. The springtail and High Himalaya frog sequences also have two Thy1 repeat insertions between the N1 and N2, making them closer homologs to Sxph than the fish sequences. Notably, the High Himalaya frog sequence has the key features for STX recognition, namely, C1 equivalents of Glu540, Asp785, Asp794, and Phe784 that match the STX recognition fingerprint. Hence, bullfrog Sxph is not unique and has a counterpart in a frog from a distantly related family (Dicroglossidae) that we name SxphNP.", "Sxph and NaVs recognize STX using a similar molecular logic", "NaVs are the primary target for the paralytic effects of STX and bind STX with nanomolar affinity, similar to Sxph (1, 20). To ask whether NaVs and Sxph use a common STX recognition strategy, we compared structures of the STX-binding sites of Sxph and the cockroach NaV NaVPaS:STX complex determined at 3.2-\u00c5 resolution by single-particle cryo-electronmicroscopy (cryo-EM; Fig. 5, A and B) (29). Although the two proteins are unrelated and some recognition details appear to differ, namely, at the site of the hydrated C12 ketone (29, 42, 43), there are remarkably common STX molecular recognition themes. The channel and Sxph both engage the five- and six-membered guanidinium rings using side chain carboxylates. NaVPaS Glu378 recognizes the five-membered ring similar to Sxph Asp794, and NaVPaS Glu704 coordinates the two available nitrogens of the six-membered guanidinium similar to Sxph Glu540 (Fig. 5, C and D, and fig. S8A). Both glutamates are important for the NaV:STX interaction (44, 45). The two proteins also use an aromatic ring to engage the STX concave face through a cation-\u03c0 interaction; however, the recognized STX ring differs. NaVPaS Tyr376, a residue important for STX binding (45, 46), engages the STX six-membered ring, whereas Sxph Phe784 interacts with the five-membered ring (fig. S8B). Similar interactions are found in the recent 3.2-\u00c5 cryo-EM structure of a human NaV1.7:STX complex (Fig. 5E and fig. S8, B to D) (47). Although the resolutions of the NaVPaS:STX and NaV1.7:STX structures and issues regarding acidic side chain definition by cryo-EM relative to x-ray studies (48\u201350) place limits on a very detailed comparison of STX binding, it is obvious that the two completely unrelated proteins, Sxph and NaVs, share general STX recognition rules (Fig. 5E).", "Fig. 5Sxph and NaVs share STX recognition strategies.(A) NaVPaS:STX (PDB: 6a91) (29) and Sxph:STX STX-binding site superposition.
