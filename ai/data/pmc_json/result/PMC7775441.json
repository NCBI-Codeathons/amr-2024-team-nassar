To investigate the capacity of O. pumila hairy roots to produce camptothecin at different growth stages, ~0.2\u2009g of fresh hairy roots with uniform growth were inoculated in B5 liquid medium and cultured for 60 days. As shown in Fig. 2a, b, the color and biomass of the hairy roots changed at different growth stages over time. The color of the hairy roots gradually intensified, changing from yellow to dark yellow, and the color of the medium changed from colorless to yellow (Fig. 2a). The biomass of the hairy roots gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 0.89\u2009g dry weight at 40 days (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2The growth phenotype and camptothecin biosynthesis ability of O. pumila hairy roots at different growth stages.a The growth phenotype of O. pumila hairy roots at different growth stages (scale bars: 1\u2009cm). b The biomass of O. pumila hairy roots at different growth stages.

The total yield of camptothecin increased over time and reached a maximum of 2.48\u2009mg/flask at 50 days (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the content of camptothecin in the culture medium increased throughout the growth period and reached 0.87\u2009mg/flask at 60 days. In contrast, the content of camptothecin extracted from hairy roots peaked at 40 days at ~1.93\u2009mg/flask (Fig. 2c).", "In parallel to the metabolite analyses, the expression levels of camptothecin biosynthetic genes (OpG10H, OpSLS, OpCPR, OpTDC, and OpSTR) were determined by qRT-PCR analyses. As shown in Fig. 2d, the relative transcript levels of all camptothecin biosynthetic genes increased over time. The highest upregulation was detected for the biosynthesis genes OpTDC and OpSTR, reaching maximum expression levels after 40 days (Fig. 2d). After 50 days, the relative expression levels of OpG10H, OpSLS, OpTDC, and OpSTR decreased (Fig. 2d). Expression of the OpCPR gene peaked at 50 days and decreased slightly at the final time point (Fig. 2d). Altogether, these data suggested that camptothecin biosynthesis in O. pumila hairy roots changes dynamically over time.", "Identification of expressed WRKY TFs in O. pumila hairy roots", "Previously, it has been reported that WRKY TFs are involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism in medicinal plants. To systematically investigate the importance of OpWRKYs in the positive regulation of camptothecin biosynthesis, an available O. pumila hairy-root transcriptome dataset was analyzed for expressed WRKY domain-encoding genes. Thirty-four putative WRKY transcription factor genes encoding either one or two WRKY domains were identified (Fig. 3a, b). Phylogenetic analysis based on the protein sequences divided the putative OpWRKY TFs into three groups (Fig. 3a, b). Protein alignments showed that 8 OpWRKYs fell into WRKY TF group I, 22 OpWRKYs to WRKY TF group II, and 4 OpWRKYs to WRKY TF group III (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3Sequence and expression analysis of OpWRKYs.a Protein sequence alignment of OpWRKYs.

Variable expression trends were observed for the OpWRKY TF genes. The expression levels of a number of OpWRKY genes increased over time, while the expression levels of others gradually decreased. The expression pattern of only one OpWRKY TF gene, OpWRKY2, closely mirrored the pattern observed for camptothecin biosynthetic genes. OpWRKY2 expression gradually increased until it reached a peak at 40 days, slightly decreased at 50 days and dropped to a very low level at 60 days (Fig. 3c). Taken together, these results indicated that OpWRKY2 might be a candidate gene involved in the positive regulation of camptothecin biosynthesis.", "Expression profiling and subcellular localization of OpWRKY2", "To further investigate the expression pattern of OpWRKY2, we collected materials from three different tissues (root, stem and leaf) of 2-month-old O. pumila plants and analyzed camptothecin biosynthesis and the relative transcript levels of OpWRKY2. First, we investigated the content of camptothecin in different tissues and found that the accumulation level of camptothecin in the roots, stems and leaves of O. pumila was quite high, with the highest content observed in roots (Fig. 4a). Then, we detected the expression of the camptothecin biosynthetic gene OpTDC in different tissues and found that it was expressed in roots, stems and leaves, and the expression level was relatively high in roots (Fig. 4b). In addition, the highest transcript levels of OpWRKY2 were detected in leaves, intermediate levels in roots and low levels in stems (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that OpWRKY2 might not only be involved in the regulation of camptothecin biosynthesis but also regulate other processes in plant growth and development.Fig. 4Expression patterns of OpWRKY2.a The production of camptothecin in the roots, stems, and leaves of O. pumila was detected by HPLC.

The results presented in Fig. 4d show that application of each hormone led to rapid and significant upregulation of OpWRKY2 transcript levels (Fig. 4d). In response to SA and ABA, OpWRKY2 expression increased 14-fold after 1\u2009h and was maintained at high levels for at least 3\u2009h. In contrast, in response to GA and MeJA, OpWRKY2 expression peaked within 1\u2009h and returned to near basal levels at 3\u2009h. These results indicate an important role of hormones in the transcriptional regulation of OpWRKY2.", "To analyze the subcellular localization of OpWRKY2, we carried out transient transformation assays in N. benthamiana leaves. As shown in Fig. 4e, fluorescent OpWRKY2-reporter signals were specifically detected in the nucleus of N. benthamiana leaf cells, while the YFP control protein was distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 4e). This nuclear localization is in accordance with the expected role of OpWRKY2 as a transcription factor.", "Generation of the OpWRKY2-OE and OpWRKY2-SRDX hairy-root lines", "To establish a role for OpWRKY2 in camptothecin biosynthesis, OpWRKY2 overexpression and silencing lines were generated. For O. pumila hairy roots, the recombinant overexpression and silencing constructs were introduced to O. pumila explant stems by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Fig. 5a\u2013e). Positive transgenic hairy-root lines carrying OpWRKY2 were identified by PCR on genomic DNA of O. pumila using gene-specific primers (Table S2). The results showed that 17 out of 48 tested OpWRKY2-OE hairy roots were successfully transformed (35.4% positive rate) (Fig. S2). In addition, 15 out of 32 candidate OpWRKY2-SRDX hairy roots were successfully transformed (46.9% positive rate) (Fig. S3). Expression analysis of OpWRKY2 in OpWRKY2-OE lines showed a 1.03- to 36.55-fold increase in relative transcript levels compared to the wild-type control (Fig. 5f). In OpWRKY2-SRDX hairy-root lines, relative transcript levels of OpWRKY2 were increased 1.26- to 25.12-fold compared to the wild-type control (Fig. 5g).

The relative transcript levels of OpTDC were increased almost 10-fold in OpWRKY2-OE hairy-root lines compared to the control. Accordingly, OpTDC expression levels were significantly decreased in the OpWRKY2-SRDX hairy-root lines, suggesting a positive regulatory role of OpWRKY2 in OpTDC expression. The relative expression of OpG10H and OpSLS, two CYP450 family genes in the iridoid pathway, did not change significantly in the OpWRKY2-OE and OpWRKY2-SRDX hairy-root lines. In addition, the expression levels of OpCPR and OpSTR were increased slightly in the OpWRKY2-OE hairy-root lines compared to the control, but there was no obvious change in the OpWRKY2-SRDX hairy-root lines.

Neither overexpression nor silencing of OpWRKY2 significantly affected the dry weight of the analyzed hairy roots compared to the wild-type control (Fig. 6b). HPLC analysis of camptothecin levels in OpWRKY2-OE lines showed a 1.7\u20133.4-fold increase compared to the control (Fig. 6c), indicating that overexpression of OpWRKY2 is effective in promoting the accumulation of camptothecin in O. pumila. Accordingly, the average content of camptothecin in the OpWRKY2-SRDX lines decreased slightly in comparison to the control lines (Fig. 6c). The levels of tryptamine, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of camptothecin, increased 1.83-fold in OpWRKY2-overexpressing lines and decreased by approximately half in SRDX lines (Fig. 6d). In contrast, the levels of loganin and secologanin, which are pathway intermediates in the iridoid branch of camptothecin biosynthesis, showed high variability and no obvious trend in the OpWRKY2-OE and OpWRKY2-SRDX lines (Fig. S4). Altogether, these results suggest a positive regulatory role of OpWRKY2 in camptothecin biosynthesis.", "OpWRKY2 activates the transcription of OpTDC in vitro and in vivo", "To further investigate the putative role of OpWRKY2 in the regulation of OpTDC, the 3090\u2009bp OpTDC promoter region was analyzed for potential binding sites of WRKY TFs (Fig. 7a). Indeed, a conserved W-box (TTGACT) was found in the analyzed OpTDC promoter region (\u22122561 bp to \u22122556 bp relative to the ATG). Next, the ability of OpWRKY2 to bind and activate the OpTDC promoter was analyzed in vivo and in vitro. First, the binding affinity of OpWRKY2 to the OpTDC promoter was determined by an EMSA. A 14\u2009bp probe (\u22122565 to \u22122552 relative to the ATG) containing the native W-box element was used for EMSA experiments. As shown in Fig. 7b, coincubation of recombinant OpWRKY2 with the native W-box probe resulted in DNA mobility shifts, while coincubation with the control protein did not alter DNA separation. To further corroborate the binding affinity of OpWRKY2 to the W-box element in the OpTDC promoter, yeast one-hybrid assays were performed. OpWRKY2 fused to the yeast GAL4 activation domain served as prey, and three tandem repeats of the W-box-containing region (CTTCAGTCAAGGCC) of the OpTDC promoter (\u22122565 to \u22122552 relative to the ATG) served as bait. The mutant-W-box and an empty vector without a W-box served as the control.
