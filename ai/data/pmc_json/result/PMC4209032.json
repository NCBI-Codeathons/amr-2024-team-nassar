["Results", "Deletion of gliTresults in altered expression of over 200 genes involved in many functions in A. fumigatus", "As deletion of A. fumigatus gliT renders the strain sensitive to exogenous gliotoxin\n[2, 15], to achieve a better understanding of the self-protection against gliotoxin provided by A. fumigatus gliT, high throughput RNA sequencing analysis was carried out. An average of 9312 transcripts were expressed in A. fumigatus wild-type and \u2206gliT (available from the European Nucleotide Archive under accession ERP001382), which is in accordance with other RNA-seq investigations of the A. fumigatus transcriptome\n[18, 22]. A comparison of A. fumigatus wild-type and \u2206gliT revealed that the deletion of gliT resulted in the significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) dysregulated expression of 208 genes, consisting of 175 up-regulated genes while 33 genes were significantly down-regulated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Figure\u00a0\n1A, Additional file\n1). The differentially regulated genes were classified according to the Functional Catalogue (FunCat)\n[23] and KEGG pathways\n[24] to identify the functions of these genes. Following deletion of gliT, 13 2nd level, 19 3rd level and 12 4th level FunCat categories were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set, compared to 3 2nd level, 10 3rd level and 3 4th level FunCat categories enriched in the down-regulated gene set (Additional file\n2: Tables S1 and S2). Categories over-represented in the up-regulated gene set include; secondary metabolism, transport and detoxification, while genes involved in C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in the down-regulated gene set (Figure\u00a0\n2). Additionally, 11 KEGG pathways were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set, while genes involved in 13 KEGG pathways were enriched in the down-regulated gene set (Additional file\n2: Tables S3 and S4). Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set, while amino acid metabolism was enriched in the down-regulated gene set. Genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis were enriched in both the up- and down-regulated gene sets.Figure 1\nOverall impact of\ngliT\nloss and gliotoxin on\nA. fumigatus\ngene expression.

A. fumigatus wild-type exposure to exogenous gliotoxin results in an over-representation of up-regulated expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism, transport (particularly siderophore-iron transport), detoxification processes and homeostasis processes as well as others (Figure\u00a0\n3). Of the down-regulated genes, some of the categories which were enriched included amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and complex cofactor/cosubstrate/vitamin binding (Figure\u00a0\n3).

Specifically, brevianamide F levels were significantly increased in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT compared to wild-type (p =0.0243), while the levels of both tryprostatin A and tryprostatin B were significantly decreased (p =0.008 and p =0.0453) in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT compared to wild-type (Figure\u00a0\n7).

However, when A. fumigatus \u2206gliT was exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, expression of 12 fumagillin biosynthetic genes in the cluster was significantly down-regulated (p <0.05) (Table\u00a0\n2). Some of the down-regulated genes include a polyketide synthase (PKS) (A. fumigatus fma-PKS)\n[30] and a putative PKS (AFUA_8G00490)\n[27] which were down-regulated log2 7.20- and log2 5.65-fold, respectively, A. fumigatus metAP/fpaII expression was down-regulated log2 5.20-fold and fma-TC/fmaA was down-regulated log2 8.37-fold. The decreased expression of A. fumigatus fma-PKS in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Figure\u00a0\n5). As was the case for fumitremorgin B and fumagillin, none of the pseurotin A biosynthetic genes were differentially regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence (Table\u00a0\n2). However, in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, with the exception of AFUA_8G00570, expression of all of the pseurotin A biosynthetic genes was significantly down-regulated (Table\u00a0\n2). Expression of AFUA_8G00530 and A. fumigatus psoA/nrps14, the PKS-NRPS hybrid\n[28], were down-regulated log2 7.45- and log2 5.79-fold respectively, while A. fumigatus psoC, psoD and elfB\n[31] expression was down-regulated log2 7.41-, log2 6.78- and log2 8.21-fold respectively. qRT-PCR confirmed the decreased expression of A. fumigatus psoA/nrps14 in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure (Figure\u00a0\n5). Relevantly, under secondary metabolite inducing growth conditions, production of fumagillin and pseurotin A was significantly reduced (p =0.0471 and p =0.0297, respectively) in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT compared to wild-type (Figure\u00a0\n7).", "The methyltransferase, laeA, is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in A. fumigatus, which fully or partially regulates expression of multiple secondary metabolite gene clusters, including those encoding gliotoxin, helvolic acid, pseurotin A, fumagillin and fumitremorgin biosynthesis\n[26, 27, 32, 33]. Although dysregulation of secondary metabolite gene expression in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT compared to A. fumigatus was observed after exposure to gliotoxin, laeA expression was not differentially regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence, but was significantly down-regulated (p =0.015; log21.31-fold) in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT under identical conditions. Although significantly down-regulated, it was outside the cut-off of log21.5-fold change. qRT-PCR analysis for A. fumigatus laeA did not show any differential regulation in either A. fumigatus wild-type or A. fumigatus \u2206gliT when challenged with exogenous gliotoxin (Figure\u00a0\n5). This suggests that laeA expression is not solely responsible for the altered expression of secondary metabolite genes, particularly in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT when it is exposed to exogenous gliotoxin. Expression of A. fumigatus gliT in \u2206laeA\n[32] exposed to exogenous gliotoxin for 3\u00a0h was analysed. A. fumigatus gliT expression increased following exogenous gliotoxin exposure in \u2206laeA (Figure\u00a0\n8) indicating that loss of laeA does not affect gliT expression in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin. Recently, the global regulatory velvet gene, A. fumigatus veA, has been implicated in secondary metabolite biosynthesis regulation, particularly with respect to gliotoxin\n[20] and fumagillin\n[22]. However, from the data presented here, A. fumigatus veA is not differentially regulated in either A. fumigatus wild-type or A. fumigatus \u2206gliT in exogenous gliotoxin presence. A. fumigatus gliT expression in A. fumigatus \u2206veA\n[34] was assessed following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin and was increased in \u2206veA in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin (Figure\u00a0\n8). A. fumigatus gliT expression was higher in the methanol control (Figure\u00a0\n8) compared to the other mutants under the same conditions. Expression of A. fumigatus gliT in \u2206veA grown in media only was lower than the methanol control (data not shown), suggesting that methanol induced increased gliT expression in A. fumigatus \u2206veA. The increased gliT expression in A. fumigatus \u2206veA following methanol addition was only observed in this strain, and was not observed in other deletion strains generated in this background (e.g. \u2206laeA).Figure 8\nqRT-PCR analysis of\nA. fumigatus gliT\nexpression in\nA. fumigatus\n\u2206\nfmaA\n(A), \u2206\npsoA\n(B), \u2206\nlaeA\n(C), \u2206\nfapR\n(D) and \u2206\nveA\n(E) exposed to exogenous gliotoxin.", "Figure 8\nqRT-PCR analysis of\nA. fumigatus gliT\nexpression in\nA. fumigatus\n\u2206\nfmaA\n(A), \u2206\npsoA\n(B), \u2206\nlaeA\n(C), \u2206\nfapR\n(D) and \u2206\nveA\n(E) exposed to exogenous gliotoxin.", "qRT-PCR analysis of\nA. fumigatus gliT\nexpression in\nA. fumigatus\n\u2206\nfmaA\n(A), \u2206\npsoA\n(B), \u2206\nlaeA\n(C), \u2206\nfapR\n(D) and \u2206\nveA\n(E) exposed to exogenous gliotoxin.", "The expression of A. fumigatus gliT was also investigated in deletion mutants with abrogated fumitremorgin B, fumagillin and pseurotin A production namely, A. fumigatus \u2206fapR, \u2206fmaA and \u2206psoA, respectively\n[27].

AFUA_3G13670 and AFUA_3G13700, significantly up-regulated log2 7.03- and log2 7.62-fold respectively, in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence, were significantly down-regulated upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure log2 7.06- and log2 7.82-fold in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT. Expression of AFUA_3G13700 in both A. fumigatus wild-type and \u2206gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure\u00a0\n5).Table 3\nLog\n2\n(fold change) in siderophore-iron transport gene and siderophore biosynthetic gene expression in\nA. fumigatus\nwild-type and \u2206\ngliT\nexposed to exogenous gliotoxin\nWild-type_Glio v Wild-type_MeOH\u2206gliT_Glio v \u2206gliT_MeOH\u2003\u2003 GeneGene nameLog2(fold change)q valueLog2(fold change)q value\nSiderophore biosynthesis genes\nAFUA_1G17190\nsidI\n2.3931.0000.8591.000AFUA_1G04450\nsidL\n\u22120.1560.969\u22120.1480.798AFUA_1G17200\nsidC\n1.2470.105\u22120.2320.694AFUA_2G07680\nsidA\n1.0660.1552.1570.0005AFUA_2G08590\npptA\n0.5340.7380.8540.143AFUA_3G03400\nsidF\nPresenta\n0.0054.9680.227AFUA_3G03410\nsidH\n3.0130.172Presentb\n0.0005AFUA_3G03420\nsidD\n4.6571.0002.8151.000AFUA_3G03650\nsidG\nPresenta\n1.000Presentb\n1.000AFUA_3G03660\nestB\n1.1131.0005.8520.308AFUA_5G11260\nsreA\n\u22120.7400.510\u22121.1520.014\nSiderophore-iron transport genes\nAFUA_1G01430-\u22121.3710.080\u22122.5610.0005AFUA_1G14340-0.2060.957\u22123.1970.0005AFUA_1G16040-0.0810.990\u22122.1150.004AFUA_2G01270-0.0110.997\u22121.6050.031AFUA_3G01360-0.2510.969\u22122.7780.045AFUA_3G02670-\u22121.5060.054\u22122.5140.0005AFUA_3G03400\nsidF\nPresenta\n0.0054.9680.227AFUA_3G03440\nmirD\n2.5690.0053.0750.0005AFUA_3G13670\n-\n7.0330.005\u22127.0580.0005AFUA_3G13700\n-\n7.6190.005\u22127.8240.0005AFUA_4G03940\nfre7\n2.8030.005\u22122.7650.005AFUA_6G02170-\u22121.0260.189\u22123.8200.0005AFUA_6G02820-0.2900.926\u22122.3960.0005AFUA_6G13750-2.2560.005\u22120.9980.146AFUA_7G06060\nsit1\n0.9270.3062.7850.0005AFUA_8G06210-Presenta\n1.000Absentc\n0.0005\na Switched on in ATCC46645_Glio, b switched on in \u2206gliT_Glio, cGene expression absent in \u2206gliT_Glio.", "Log\n2\n(fold change) in siderophore-iron transport gene and siderophore biosynthetic gene expression in\nA. fumigatus\nwild-type and \u2206\ngliT\nexposed to exogenous gliotoxin", "Wild-type_Glio v Wild-type_MeOH \u2206gliT_Glio v \u2206gliT_MeOH.", "Gene Gene name Log2(fold change) q value Log2(fold change) q value.", "Siderophore biosynthesis genes.", "AFUA_1G17190 sidI 2.393 1.000 0.859 1.000.", "AFUA_1G04450 sidL \u22120.156 0.969 \u22120.148 0.798.", "AFUA_1G17200 sidC 1.247 0.105 \u22120.232 0.694.", "AFUA_2G07680 sidA 1.066 0.155 2.157 0.0005.", "AFUA_2G08590 pptA 0.534 0.738 0.854 0.143.", "AFUA_3G03400 sidF Presenta 0.005 4.968 0.227.", "AFUA_3G03410 sidH 3.013 0.172 Presentb 0.0005.", "AFUA_3G03420 sidD 4.657 1.000 2.815 1.000.", "AFUA_3G03650 sidG Presenta 1.000 Presentb 1.000.", "AFUA_3G03660 estB 1.113 1.000 5.852 0.308.", "AFUA_5G11260 sreA \u22120.740 0.510 \u22121.152 0.014.", "Siderophore-iron transport genes.", "AFUA_1G01430 - \u22121.371 0.080 \u22122.561 0.0005.", "AFUA_1G14340 - 0.206 0.957 \u22123.197 0.0005.", "AFUA_1G16040 - 0.081 0.990 \u22122.115 0.004.", "AFUA_2G01270 - 0.011 0.997 \u22121.605 0.031.", "AFUA_3G01360 - 0.251 0.969 \u22122.778 0.045.", "AFUA_3G02670 - \u22121.506 0.054 \u22122.514 0.0005.", "AFUA_3G03400 sidF Presenta 0.005 4.968 0.227.", "AFUA_3G03440 mirD 2.569 0.005 3.075 0.0005.", "AFUA_3G13670 - 7.033 0.005 \u22127.058 0.0005.", "AFUA_3G13700 - 7.619 0.005 \u22127.824 0.0005.", "AFUA_4G03940 fre7 2.803 0.005 \u22122.765 0.005.", "AFUA_6G02170 - \u22121.026 0.189 \u22123.820 0.0005.", "AFUA_6G02820 - 0.290 0.926 \u22122.396 0.0005.", "AFUA_6G13750 - 2.256 0.005 \u22120.998 0.146.", "AFUA_7G06060 sit1 0.927 0.306 2.785 0.0005.", "AFUA_8G06210 - Presenta 1.000 Absentc 0.0005.", "a Switched on in ATCC46645_Glio, b switched on in \u2206gliT_Glio, cGene expression absent in \u2206gliT_Glio.", "The observed differential regulation of genes involved in siderophore-iron transport prompted us to review whether expression of siderophore biosynthetic genes\n[35] was affected by exogenous gliotoxin in A. fumigatus wild-type and A. fumigatus \u2206gliT. Indeed we have already noted that sidF expression, a transacylase that transfers anhydromevalonyl to hydroxyornithine during extracellular siderophore biosynthesis\n[36], was activated in A. fumigatus wild-type following exogenous gliotoxin exposure. In A. fumigatus \u2206gliT, expression of two genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis was differentially regulated in response to exogenous gliotoxin (Table\u00a0\n3). A. fumigatus sidH, involved in providing the anhydromevalonyl-CoA moiety for extracellular siderophore biosynthesis\n[37], was de novo expressed while A. fumigatus sidA, which is required for the first step of siderophore biosynthesis\n[38], was significantly up-regulated log2 2.16-fold (p =0.0005). qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of A. fumigatus sidH confirmed the increased expression in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT following exogenous gliotoxin exposure (Figure\u00a0\n5).", "Nitrogen metabolism is down-regulated in A. fumigatus\u2206gliTin response to exogenous gliotoxin", "In A. fumigatus \u2206gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, expression of 55 genes involved in nitrogen metabolism was down-regulated, while expression of 4 genes was up-regulated (Table\u00a0\n4). In contrast, 3 genes were up-regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type and 8 genes were down-regulated in response to exogenous gliotoxin (Table\u00a0\n4). In A. fumigatus \u2206gliT, expression of two genes, cyp5081B1, a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase already mentioned in helvolic acid biosynthesis\n[25], and AFUA_6G00412, predicted to have amino acid transmembrane transporter activity\n[39] was completely abrogated in response to exogenous gliotoxin. Expression of A. fumigatus optB and cpsI, which are induced when BSA is the sole nitrogen source\n[40], was down-regulated log2 5.399- and log2 3.98-fold, respectively, in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin. The decreased expression of A. fumigatus optB in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure\u00a0\n5). When utilising complex nitrogen sources, A. fumigatus secretes proteases, and increases expression of amidase, aminotransferase, and amino acid and peptide transporter genes\n[40, 41]. These secreted proteases are regulated by a conserved regulatory factor, prtT\n[40, 41], which is decreased log2 3.66-fold in expression in \u2206gliT but unchanged in wild-type following exogenous gliotoxin exposure. Indeed, further examination revealed decreased expression of 14 proteases, 3 amidases and 7 amino acid and peptide transporters in \u2206gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, while expression of one amidase, AFUA_5G09140, was increased log2 3.37-fold (Table\u00a0\n4). Expression of both nitrate transporters, crnA and nrtB, which are predicted gene pairs\n[42], was significantly down-regulated (log2 2.689- and log2 4.504-fold) in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure. Expression of a number of genes with predicted involvement in the oxidation-reduction process was down-regulated in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT only following exogenous gliotoxin exposure. Among these genes were nitronate monooxygenases (AFUA_2G17430 and AFUA_4G07940 down-regulated log2 4.444- and log2 2.304-fold) and copper ion binding domain genes (AFUA_1G13440, AFUA_5G01470 and AFUA_5G07360; down-regulated log21.692-, log2 4.125- and log2 3.948-fold, respectively). In A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, two predicted carbon-nitrogen ligases, AFUA_4G04160 and AFUA_4G04170, were down-regulated log2 1.926- and log2 2.622-fold, respectively. These carbon-nitrogen ligases are not differentially regulated in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure, suggesting that loss of gliT may hinder the down-regulation of these genes in response to gliotoxin.Table 4\nLog\n2\n(fold change) in nitrogen metabolic gene, protease gene, amidase gene and animo acid transporter gene expression in\nA. fumigatus\nwild-type and

down-regulated", "Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and translation was observed in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT following exogenous gliotoxin exposure, whereby expression of 20 genes was up-regulated and two genes down-regulated (Table\u00a0\n5). Of the 20 genes up-regulated in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT in response to exogenous gliotoxin, 7 genes encode 60S ribosomal proteins and two encode 40S ribosomal proteins, all of which are increased log21.5-1.7-fold in expression (Table\u00a0\n5). The two genes down-regulated in response to exogenous gliotoxin in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT have already been mentioned as secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes. A. fumigatus metAP in the fumagillin biosynthetic gene cluster\n[30] was down-regulated log2 4.340-fold and A. fumigatus elfB in the pseurotin A biosynthetic gene cluster was down-regulated log2 7.265-fold\n[27, 31]. In contrast to A. fumigatus \u2206gliT, only two genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation were up-regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Table\u00a0\n5). AFUA_5G07340 was up-regulated log2 1.909-fold while AFUA_2G12150 was up-regulated log2 2.417-fold. In addition to the dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and translation, 44 genes involved in transcription were also down-regulated in A. fumigatus \u2206gliT in response to exogenous gliotoxin, compared to 3 down-regulated genes in wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Table\u00a0\n6). A proteomic investigation of A. fumigatus \u2206gliTATCC26933 reflected this alteration in translation whereby 6 proteins were uniquely expressed or increased in abundance and 15 proteins were absent or decreased in abundance when exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Tables\u00a0\n7 and\n8). Loss of GliT negatively impacts expression of genes involved in transcription processes and results in significantly decreased transcription of genes in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin, culminating in disruption of translation.Table 5\nLog\n2\n(fold change) in ribosome biogenesis and translation gene expression in\nA. fumigatus\nwild-type and \u2206\ngliT\nexposed to exogenous gliotoxin\nWild-type_Glio v Wild-type_MeOH\u2206gliT_Glio v \u2206gliT_MeOHGeneGene nameLog2(fold_change)q_valueLog2(fold_change)q_valueAFUA_3G05600\n-\n1.1220.2281.6470.004AFUA_3G06760\n-\n1.2490.0751.7630.001AFUA_5G07340\n-\n1.9090.0120.2680.728AFUA_6G05200\n-\n1.0610.2271.5900.008AFUA_6G13250\n-\n1.2030.1171.6090.003AFUA_8G00410\nmetAP\n\u22120.1130.987\u22124.3400.001AFUA_8G00580\nelfB\n0.3060.964\u22127.2650.003AFUA_2G09200\n-\n1.1000.1431.5100.003AFUA_3G07360\n-\n0.4920.7391.5060.004AFUA_1G12890\n-\n1.1910.2121.5950.006AFUA_1G15020\n-\n1.0360.2771.5450.008AFUA_2G10300\n-\n1.3530.0601.5370.004AFUA_2G12150\n-\n2.4170.0050.5610.422AFUA_3G08080\n-\n0.2140.9521.6550.001AFUA_4G07250\n-\n0.5990.5891.5720.002AFUA_4G07730\n-\n1.1900.1631.5920.004AFUA_4G11990\n-\n0.3090.8911.6820.001AFUA_5G05630\n-\n1.2220.1221.6610.002AFUA_5G06430\n-\n0.5590.6491.5010.002AFUA_6G02440\n-\n1.0060.2721.6580.002AFUA_6G02450\n-\n0.7140.4931.5640.003AFUA_6G11260\n-\n1.1050.2321.5320.008AFUA_6G12960\n-\n0.5210.6861.7210.001AFUA_2G10100\naspf8\n1.2950.1381.5800.007Table 6\nLog\n2\n(fold change) in transcription gene expression in\nA. fumigatus\nwild-type and \u2206\ngliT\nexposed to exogenous gliotoxin\nWild-type_Glio v Wild-type_MeOH\u2206gliT_Glio v \u2206gliT_MeOHGeneGene nameLog2(fold_change)q_valueLog2(fold_change)q_valueAFUA_4G11480\n-\n\u22120.7660.446\u22121.5320.003AFUA_6G05160\nazf1\n\u22121.5410.043\u22120.2510.753AFUA_6G12150\n-\n0.5020.913\u22126.2330.001AFUA_7G01340\n-\n0.0820.990\u22122.9820.001AFUA_4G02930\n-\n0.4500.796\u22121.9710.001AFUA_3G10120\n-\n\u22120.8190.488\u22121.6690.003AFUA_4G10110\nhtfA\n0.1050.986\u22121.5650.012AFUA_1G10080\nzafA\n\u22120.4340.843\u22121.5350.001AFUA_1G01240\n-\n\u22120.5610.770\u22121.7020.025AFUA_1G14945\n-\n\u22120.8390.505\u22121.7540.026AFUA_2G04262\n-\n\u22121.6440.012\u22120.7590.171AFUA_2G11180\nflbA\n\u22120.1260.977\u22121.5110.003AFUA_3G03330\n-\n\u22122.1320.021\u22120.7390.221AFUA_5G03780\n-\n1.2770.320\u22122.8640.001AFUA_5G09720\n-\n\u22121.7800.086\u22121.5860.033AFUA_5G14530\n-\n0.1200.987\u22122.1660.010AFUA_8G01150\n-\n0.0370.997\u22123.3450.001AFUA_8G01940\n-\n\u22121.2480.221\u22121.8460.027AFUA_8G02720\n-\n\u22120.0320.997\u22121.8480.001AFUA_8G04130\nfarB1\n\u22120.4960.798\u22121.8980.001AFUA_8G06460\n-\n\u22120.0050.998\u22121.7410.009AFUA_6G11740\n-\n\u22120.9190.475\u22127.1450.004AFUA_2G05180\n-\n\u22120.3610.891\u22123.8190.001AFUA_1G16600\n-\n\u22120.3430.964\u22124.4810.001AFUA_8G00280\n-\n\u22120.7200.574\u22121.8130.007Table 7\nProteins with increased abundance in, or unique to,\nA. fumigatus\n\u2206\ngliT\nATCC26933\nwith gliotoxin compared to the methanol control\nProtein IDsLog2(fold increase)\npvaluePeptidesSequence coverage [%]AFUA_6G06470UniqueN/A658.5AFUA_1G09510UniqueN/A234.5AFUA_4G03140UniqueN/A412.5AFUA_3G145402.2791.52E-02638.3AFUA_1G152701.1352.05E-023343.1AFUA_7G00350*1.1191.49E-02623.2*Gene expression also significantly up-regulated in RNA-seq analysis.Table 8\nProteins with decreased abundance in, or absent from, \u2206\ngliT\nATCC26933\nwith gliotoxin compared to the methanol control\nProtein IDsLog2(fold decrease)\npvaluePeptidesSequence coverage [%]AFUA_3G00330*UniqueN/A636.2AFUA_5G14000*UniqueN/A761.3AFUA_1G10960UniqueN/A218.2AFUA_8G00540*3.0321.72E-023718.7AFUA_2G152902.7886.36E-04681.6AFUA_8G00440*2.4617.89E-041221.2AFUA_7G064202.4513.18E-031863.5AFUA_8G00550*2.0161.03E-021263.8AFUA_2G04060*1.7995.53E-031258.7AFUA_3G03350*1.6032.31E-035038.6AFUA_5G07170*1.3613.93E-02744.9AFUB_0449101.2341.02E-021661.3AFUA_1G010101.1284.74E-023326.4AFUA_8G055801.0911.12E-021143.2AFUA_6G101201.0722.60E-02946.4*Gene expression also significantly down-regulated in RNA-seq analysis.", "Log\n2\n(fold change) in ribosome biogenesis and translation gene expression in\nA. fumigatus\nwild-type and \u2206\ngliT\nexposed to exogenous gliotoxin", "Wild-type_Glio v Wild-type_MeOH \u2206gliT_Glio v \u2206gliT_MeOH.", "Gene Gene name Log2(fold_change) q_value Log2(fold_change) q_value.", "AFUA_3G05600 -
