["Discussion", "Over recent years, it has become evident that the eukaryotic regulatory machinery linking cause (for instance, stress) to effect (stress response) is very complex. It usually involves the interplay of several regulatory layers such as transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome that might be subject to independent regulatory mechanisms. To understand these interactions as a whole, integrated studies are required.", "We found that about 30% of the A. fumigatus genome expressed is located in assigned intergenic and intronic regions. This is most likely due to the presence of untranslated regions (UTRs) and transcripts that have not been classified so far. We investigated the potential of RNA deep-sequencing data to identify these genes by combining gene prediction (using the Augustus platform) and paired-end reads. This pioneer methodology helped us find almost 200 new transcripts with coding potential. Blast analysis revealed that more than half of these new transcripts harbour at least one ortholog in other Aspergillus species. This indicates the great potential of this methodology to find new genes and to improve gene annotations.", "We tested RNA deep-sequencing to further investigate the role of MpkA in A. fumigatus. Previous studies demonstrated that this kinase is decisive for cell wall integrity signalling pathway regulation ([7]; 2010). Further studies revealed that MpkA is also involved in the regulation of the oxidative stress response, secondary metabolite production and siderophore biosynthesis during iron starvation [8]. Concerning the role of MpkA in A. fumigatus, mRNA-Seq data confirmed previous findings. Additionally, many genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism were affected by MpkA. In particular, genes putatively involved in amino acid biosynthesis were differentially expressed in the \u0394mpkA mutant strain. This finding explained the strong difference found in the soluble amino acid pool composition for this strain [8]. Moreover, almost 10% of genes differentially expressed in the \u0394mpkA mutant are putatively involved in primary metabolism (e.g. fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism). These results confirmed that one of the functions carried out by MpkA is to fine-tune the balance between stress response and energy consuming cellular processes. Considering the genes involved in the iron-deficiency stress response, it was found that different techniques gave opposite results. It was previously reported that MpkA is important for regulating siderophore production by measuring an increased amount of siderophores in the \u0394mpkA mutant strain during iron starvation [8]. This illustrates that mRNA-Seq is more reliable than other transcriptome techniques. However, the differences found between mRNA-Seq and qRT-PCR showed that it would be good practice if results obtained by sequencing were confirmed by applying ad hoc experiments.", "Microarray data showed that genes belonging to several A. fumigatus secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters were differentially expressed in the \u0394mpkA mutant (e.g. gliotoxin and pseurotin A). Secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters are normally characterised by the presence of polyketide synthases (PKSs) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Analysis of the A. fumigatus A1163 genome revealed the presence of 17 NRPSs, 13 PKSs and three hybrid NRPS/PKS enzymes [23].", "Among them, 11 gene clusters have been found to be differentially regulated in the \u0394mpkA mutant. Furthermore, in comparison with the microarray studies, the higher sensitivity of the mRNA-Seq technique led to the identification of almost all genes of a cluster to be differentially regulated. The mRNA-Seq approach is therefore superior to microarrays for studies on the global regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis.", "The second question that we addressed concerned the comparability of mRNA-Seq data with published transcriptome data. We compared different technologies to investigate the A. fumigatus transcriptome (microarrays, mRNA-Seq and qRT-PCR). Information obtained by analysing these technologies were compared with a comprehensive set of proteome data obtained by 2D DIGE analysis followed by MALDI-TOF-MS / MS-based protein detection. The comprehensive dataset compiled in this study constitutes a basis for future studies with the aim of shedding light on the relationship between proteome and transcriptome data, in order, for example, to understand better post-transcriptional regulation on a global scale.", "With regard to A. fumigatus, the results of whole genome transcriptome analyses based on microarrays were highly dependent on the platform used. Low consistency of microarray gene expression data can have multiple reasons, such as platform effects [24], different media, RNA extraction protocols, or biological variability. However, hybridisation seems to have the most significant impact. Hybridisation strongly depends on the probes, which were used to develop the microarrays. In the case of A. fumigatus, they have been designed independently from each other for the different platforms. The hybridisation bias seems to be highly conserved within the same platform, as shown by the high level of agreement between the studies of Jain et al.[8] and Gehrke et al.[25]. When considering the comparison between Jain et al.[8] microarray data with the mRNA-Seq data produced in this study, the correlation is relatively low (r\u2009=\u20090.35). Moreover, comparing the two datasets obtained with the same experimental proceeding by Bruns et al.[17] using microarrays and by Gibbons et al.[12] using mRNA-Seq, once again showed quite a low correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.22). The global comparison demonstrated that a higher correlation was found between the two mRNA-Seq datasets. This finding demonstrates that mRNA-Seq gives the highest level of comparability in terms of gene expression levels in A. fumigatus.", "Comparative analysis of the A. fumigatus intracellular 2D proteome map from V\u00f6disch et al.[21] revealed that protein abundances correlated well with transcriptome abundances measured with both microarray (r\u2009=\u20090.34-0.50) and mRNA-Seq techniques (r\u2009=\u20090.36-0.50). These values were higher than the ones observed by Albrecht et al.[26], who compared changes in A. fumigatus microarray and proteome data after heat shock induction. Previously, Foss et al.[27] calculated a correlation between proteome and transcriptome of r\u2009=\u20090.186 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on 278 proteins detected by LC-MS / MS analysis. Another study performed by Ghazalpour et al.[19] using LC-MS / MS-based quantifications of 486 mouse proteins, resulted in an average correlation of r\u2009=\u20090.27 (using Affymetrix microarray). However, although the results showed a better correlation between A. fumigatus proteome and transcriptome data, there was still a relatively low correlation between the two different datasets. This is most likely caused by a combination of several biases based on technological and biological effects."]
