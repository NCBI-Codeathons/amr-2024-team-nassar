["Discussion", "Resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining provides a means of identifying bioactive metabolites and linking them to their protein target without the extensive time, labor, and cost associated with traditional \u201cgrind-and-find\u201d natural products discovery. As demonstrated here, this approach can also provide an advanced starting point for drug discovery as the metabolites have already been evolutionarily engineered to interact with their target. Additional structure\u2013activity relationship information can be obtained by screening precursor metabolites and shunt products for binding and bioactivity, resulting in a well-developed data package prior to initiating any additional work (i.e., a medicinal chemistry campaign).", "The availability of large numbers of microbial genomes presents opportunities for resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining. The number of BGCs is large: up to 100 per genome, across thousands of genomes. Here, we apply this technique to reveal the molecular targets of the known compound 1; demonstrating that it is a potent and specific inhibitor of the CDKs.", "To identify natural product inhibitors of human CDK2, we looked for BGCs containing a putative resistance gene with homology to human CDKs, ultimately identifying the roseopurpurin BGC in the genomes of A. uvarum, Phaeosphaeria sp. TTI001159 and five additional publicly available fungal genomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). In order to identify the products of these clusters, we first characterized this BGC by in situ engineering, generating mutants with the core NR-PKS knocked out and the BGC-specific transcription factor overexpressed. The results from these in situ engineering studies facilitated the identification of a series of BGC products and provided insights into the possible regulation of this BGC. The titers of early pathway intermediates 6 and 7 are detectable across all conditions tested and are influenced to a relatively small extent by transcription factor overexpression. 1, the most bioactive cluster product, is produced by the wild-type strain at significant levels in only a few growth conditions and its titer is increased significantly, in some cases several orders of magnitude, upon transcription factor overexpression (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). These results suggest that the regulation of this BGC is not as simple as it being \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d, as transcriptional control appears much tighter for those enzymes responsible for the later steps in the pathway.", "Further characterization of this cluster by heterologous expression in A. nidulans yielded additional insights. In addition to establishing a series of transformations ultimately leading to the formation of 1, we found glyoxalase RosD leads to the conversion of 1 to 11. 11 proved significantly less potent than 1 in both biochemical and cellular assays (Figs. 3B and 4A), leading us to hypothesize that the primary role of RosD is detoxification. This BGC also contains rosJ, a gene encoding a MFS drug pump; a feature common in fungal BGCs and that has been shown to be a mechanism of self-protection (41) in addition to the putative resistance gene rosG.", "While this work was in progress, a report emerged of human CDK2 inhibition by 1 and 12 isolated from cultures of A. fumigatus, a species whose genome contains the rosepurpurin gene cluster (42), corroborating our observations that these metabolites are inhibitors of human CDK2. By profiling the activity of 1 against a panel of human kinases, we demonstrate that it is both potent and quite specific for the CDK1/2/3, CDK5, and CDK4/6 kinase subfamilies. That we see good selectivity for these CDK subfamilies, but only modest selectivity within them is likely caused by the significant divergence in the evolution of the CDKs between fungi and humans and the ATP-competitive mechanism of inhibition. Most fungal species have only 6 CDK paralogs, while the human genome has 20. Indeed, the entire CDK1/2/3/4/6 and CDK5 subfamilies can each be traced back to a single homolog in fungi, represented by CDC28 and Pho85 in S. cerevisiae, respectively (15). Outside of the CDK branch of the CMGC kinase family, nanomolar inhibition of two CAMK family Ser/Thr kinases, AMPK\u03b11 and CAMK4 was observed (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S9 and S10). This potent inhibition can likely be explained based on alignments of the 1-CDK2 structure with published AMPK\u03b11 (PDB 4CFF) and CAMK4 structures (PDB 2W4O), which reveal that the key 1-CDK2 binding interactions are maintained with both proteins despite significant sequence divergence in the ATP-binding pockets (SI Appendix, Figs. S12\u2013S14).", "The structure of 1-bound CDK2 revealed that ATP-competitive inhibition was achieved through binding to the ATP pocket of CDK2 and provided a structural rationale for the preliminary structure\u2013activity relationships obtained through profiling precursor metabolites and shunt products in the 1 maturation pathway. Three key hydrogen-bonding interactions were identified in the structure. First, the 3\u2032-OH group of 1 interacts with the amide backbone of Glu81 and Leu83 in the hinge region of CDK2. Similar hinge-region interactions are observed for structurally diverse natural products with ATP-competitive kinase inhibitory activity (43) and synthetic kinase inhibitors, including dinaciclib (39). Second, the 4-OH group of 1 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp86. Epimerization of the 4-OH in 1 to afford 12 results in a 50-fold reduction in potency (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, comparison of the potency of 8 (which lacks the 4-OH) and 7, reveals that the addition of this critical hydrogen-bond donor improves potency by approximately ninefold (Fig. 3B). Third, the 9\u2032-carbonyl of 1, forms a hydrogen bond with Asp145. The coordination of this central ring potentially helps orient the metabolite in the binding site. Consistent with this prediction, 11 is approximately 900-fold less active than 1.", "1 represents a new scaffold for type 1 kinase inhibitors of CDK proteins. The potency and specificity of its activity demonstrate the utility of resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining to identify metabolites with bioactivities relevant to human disease. Combined with the initial SAR that arises from profiling intermediate metabolites in the biosynthetic pathway, this work demonstrates the ability of this approach to yield advanced starting points for drug discovery campaigns. Furthermore, fungi and humans share thousands of genes with significant homology (44, 45), giving resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining of fungal genomes the potential to generate inhibitors of promising targets across a wide range of disease areas."]
