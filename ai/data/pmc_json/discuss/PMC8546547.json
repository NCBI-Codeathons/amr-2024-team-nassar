["DISCUSSION", "Antibiotic resistance proteins associated with BGCs have traditionally been perceived as a means of self-protecting mechanisms. It has been proposed that the expression of multiple resistance genes within the same BGC is regulated to optimize the self-protective resistance levels at different stages of growth or biosynthesis to minimize the fitness cost of the resistance expression (42) or to synchronize the resistance in sibling cells (43, 44).", "In this study, we characterized an LSAP antibiotic-driven signaling cascade for the activation of the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis, in which an antibiotic resistance protein, LmrC, from the ARE5 subfamily of ABCF proteins is the key signal-transducing element (Fig.\u00a06a). The mechanism lies in the induction of lmrC transcription by ribosome-mediated attenuation, which means that lmrC, specifically its attenuator-forming upstream 5\u2032UTR transcript, is a sensor of LSAP antibiotics. Ribosome-mediated attenuation is a common mechanism of regulation of antibiotic resistance ABCF genes in Firmicutes (38\u201340, 45). However, we describe here for the first time its function as a sensor of the signaling cascade. The major novelty of this cascade lies in the dual antibiotic resistance and regulatory function of the ABCF protein LmrC, which transduces the antibiotic signal to the expression of LmbU and promotes lincomycin biosynthesis. In addition, we show that another two lincomycin BGC-encoded resistance proteins, LmrB and LmrA, affect the cascade by dampening the LSAP antibiotic-induced expression of lmrC. We assume that LmrB, due to its position in the lmbUXY-lmrB operon with two biosynthetic genes, mediates a direct negative feedback loop of the cascade. The LmrA transporter links lincomycin biosynthesis to the primary metabolic pathways since it is regulated by the GlnR global regulator (37). LmrA seems to be the most important component for lincomycin production because lincomycin biosynthesis is remarkably suppressed when LmrA is not present. Furthermore, LmrA, as a lincomycin-specific transporter, desensitizes the cascade specifically to lincomycin, which may prevent the products from reactivation the biosynthesis when it is no longer desirable. In addition, the active export of lincomycin contributes to the propagation of antibiotics within the population.", "FIG\u00a06ABCF proteins encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters are putative regulators of antibiotic production in response to antibiotics that share a ribosomal binding site. (a) Scheme of the antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade identified in this study. The production of the LmrC protein is induced by ribosome-bound LSAP antibiotics via a ribosome-mediated attenuation mechanism, and it is coordinated with the LmrB and LmrA resistance proteins, which individually reduce the amount of ribosome-bound antibiotic. LmrC then transduces the antibiotic signal from the ribosome to the transcription of lmbU. The LmbU transcriptional regulator activates the expression of subordinate biosynthetic genes (24).

The ARD domain is significantly longer than PtIM, allowing direct interaction with PTC.", "The last component of the regulation cascade, LmbU, is a transcriptional regulator of the newly proposed LmbU family (24). The lmbU gene has been evolutionarily accepted along with genes encoding the biosynthesis of the unusual precursor 4-alkyl-l-proline (27), which is a building block of lincomycin and other natural products from Streptomyces (46\u201348). On the other hand, the LmbU homolog is missing in the closely related BGC for the lincosamide celesticetin, which contains proteinogenic l-proline instead of 4-alkyl-l-proline in its structure.", "The regulatory pair of LmbU and LmrC is unique to lincomycin BGC; no other known BGC encodes a LmbU-family regulator together with an ABCF protein. On the other hand, BGC-associated ABCF proteins were almost exclusively present in the BGCs for PTC-targeting antibiotics (Fig.\u00a06b; see also Table\u00a0S1). Most of these BGCs encode additional resistance determinants and pathway-specific transcriptional regulators; however, none are homologous to LmbU (see Table\u00a0S1). We hypothesize that BGC-encoded ABCF proteins employ transcriptional regulators of various families to form a signaling cascade to activate the biosynthesis of ribosome-binding antimicrobials.", "It was previously shown that LmbU directly activates only the 4-alkyl-l-proline biosynthesis-encoding part of lincomycin BGC (24), which is also evident from our proteomic data (Fig.\u00a03a). In contrast, the recently described regulator of lincomycin BGC, AdpAlin, activates the entire lincomycin BGC independently of the external lincosamide and thus appears to be the principal regulator of lincomycin biosynthesis (28). What would then be the purpose of the LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade discovered here? This signaling cascade may, in response to the extracellular lincomycin secreted by neighboring cells, induce a premature onset of lincomycin production to ensure its synchronous biosynthesis in a wider population, thereby achieving an ecologically efficient lincomycin concentration similar to that proposed for the biosynthesis of the cell wall inhibiting lantibiotic planosporicin (49) or actinorhodin (50). In addition, we have also shown that the LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade and thus lincomycin production might be activated by functionally similar LSAP antibiotics produced by other organisms. Thus, analogous ABCF signaling cascades (Fig.\u00a06b) could coordinate the production of the same types of antibiotics across different organisms sharing a single niche and so mediate cooperative interspecies interactions (51). In support of this concept, a recent study showed that antibiotic production is more likely to be induced by closely related strains or strains sharing BGCs (5). These observations also imply that the ability of antibiotics to induce their own synthesis is a relatively widespread but mostly undetected phenomenon because antibiotic production in the presence of cognate or similar antibiotics is not usually examined.", "The induction of specialized metabolism by antibiotics targeting the 50S subunit of the ribosome has been described previously (6, 7, 52), but this is the first time the mechanism of antibiotic sensing and signal transduction has been revealed. The detection of antibiotics by a ribosome via a 5\u2032UTR attenuator upstream of the ABCF-encoding gene differs fundamentally from known antibiotic signaling cascades, in which antibiotic or biosynthetic intermediates are detected regardless of their mode of action, typically by direct binding to a transcription factor or its cognate receptor (53). In addition, several examples of resistance systems consisting of antibiotic efflux and cognate, TetR-like transcriptional repressors, such as in the biosynthesis of simocyclinone (54), actinorhodin (50), or landomycin A (55), have been described to promote antibiotic production by sensing a final product or intermediate. The regulatory effect in these examples is facilitated by the export of antibiotics, which is required for high production (50, 54), or is mediated by a cognate antibiotic-recognizing repressor that, in addition to the regulation of transporter, also regulates biosynthetic genes (55). In contrast, LmrC appears to directly transduce the antibiotic signal to lmbU transcription while conferring low antibiotic resistance. However, the exact mechanism of LmrC-driven signal transduction remains to be elucidated. Thus, LmrC has a dual function: resistance and regulation, but it is also possible that the low LmrC-mediated resistance is only an indirect consequence of the primary antibiotic signal transduction function and that its biological significance is minor. Notably, LmrC, as well as other ABCF proteins implicated in antibiotic resistance in streptomycetes, shares the antibiotic resistance domain ARD with structurally characterized antibiotic resistance ABCF proteins, VmlR, MsrE, VgaALC, VgaL, and LsaA from Firmicutes. The ARD interacts with PTC to dislodge the antibiotic from the ribosome (34, 35, 56, 57) (Fig.\u00a06c), and it is present in the majority of antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins but not in EttA and other putative regulatory ABCFs (22). In addition to ARD, LmrC also has the arm domain, which is absent in antibiotic-resistance ABCFs but is present in the EttA translation regulator (20). In EttA, the arm domain restricts ribosome dynamics in response to a lack of available ATP (21). However, further research will be needed to determine whether all the ABCF proteins structurally similar to LmrC, i.e., having both the ARD and the arm domain, have regulatory rather than resistance functions. In addition to LmrC, another two ABCF proteins were induced by clindamycin in S. lincolnensis (Fig.\u00a03a), which is a strong indication that ABCF proteins not associated with BGCs for PTC-targeting antibiotics may also have an antibiotic-responsive regulatory function.", "The signaling pathway described here, in which the antibiotic signal is sensed and transduced by the dual, resistance, and regulatory ABCF proteins and tuned by two other resistance proteins, points out the need to reconsider the role of antibiotic resistance ABCF proteins as purely protective mechanisms. This discovery also brings together two functionally inconsistent groups of ABCF proteins, antibiotic resistance and regulatory proteins (22, 58), which fundamentally changes the view of these translational ATPases. In addition, given the number of small molecules targeting the 50S ribosomal subunit and the number of bacterial ABCFs encoded by soil bacteria from the Terrabacteria group, which includes Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with the highest number of ABCFs per genome, ABCF-mediated signaling could be one of the most important tools of chemical communication in general."]
