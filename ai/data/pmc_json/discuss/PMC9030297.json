["4. Discussion", "GT is a toxin and virulence factor of A. fumigatus that has been reported to be produced by other Aspergillus spp. and other fungal genus with relevance for human and animal health due to their ability to produce infections or to contaminate human and animal food. Here, based on the presence of described protein clusters involved in GT biosynthesis, we have developed a bioinformatics analysis of fungal genus and species that potentially can produce GT, which has been further validated at the lab by analyzing GT production by selected fungal species.", "Phylogenetic analysis is essential for the comparative study of protein sequences. Their results have many applications in the study of the evolution and functions of proteins, as well as in the prediction of the function of the genes that encode them, the identification, construction, and discovery of gene families and the annotation of the genome [75]. For these reasons, it is more appropriate to use protein sequences to analyze the phylogeny of species than to use DNA sequences [76,77,78]. Proteins with high sequence identity tend to have evolutionary relationships and similarities in function, indicating conserved biological function [79]. Phylogenetic analysis provides results represented by a phylogenetic tree, in which sequences are grouped based on sequence similarities.", "The fact that the proteins of the strains of the Aspergillus and Penicillium genera are located evolutionarily close in the phylogenetic tree corroborates the similarity of sequences that we already obtained with the BLAST analysis. For the rest of the proteins there is also coherence between the percentage of query coverage, identity obtained from BLAST and the taxonomy of the inferred phylogenetic tree.", "The conserved domains (A1-T1-C1-A2-T2-C2-T3) in A. fumigatus GliP registered in NCBI [80] are also found in most of the other NRPS of the studied strains. It was previously described that A1-T1-C1-A2-T2 are essential for the L-Phe-L-Ser diketopiperazine (DKP) formation and C2 and T3 domains were apparently not necessary for the DKP formation given that under the reaction conditions that Balibar and Walsh performed, the release of the DKP happened spontaneously [33]. However, it was recently described that in vivo C2 and T3 deletions disrupt in vivo GT biosynthesis since only small amounts of GT were discovered in truncated A. fumigatus cultures [73]. In agreement with these results, here we were unable to detect GT or bmGT in C. cylindrospora and C. fructicola cultures. Their NRPSs lacks certain domains, such as T3 and T1, which could suggest the in vivo absence of production of cyclo-L-Phe-L-Ser and thus the disruption of GT biosynthesis. However, the module domains analysis of antiSMASH was also unable to detect T1 and T3 domains in T. virens Gv29-8 GliP, although this enzyme is known to be functional. We have found that T. virens CBS 249.59 is able to produce GT in cell cultures, suggesting the presence of alternative domains with a similar function.", "Assuming that homologous P genes in all species studied here were functional, another reason for not having detected GT and bmGT in their cultures could be differences in the specificity of their adenylation domains. First adenylation domain of GliP can accommodate either L-Phe or L-Trp [35], so substrate specificity might have changed enough for the enzymes studied in this work as to produce different ETPs. Further research on this field is needed to confirm these hypotheses.", "As expected, almost all species of section Fumigati were able to produce GT and bmGT since they preserve the entire cluster. As an exception, A. turcosus HMR Af 1038 genome lacks gliZ transcription factor, which would indicate that it is not capable of producing GT [15] or that its production is greatly diminished [81]. However, culture supernatants of A. turcosus CBS 140371 contained significant amounts of GT. Pending experimental validation, we speculate that GT production could be due to possible differences between the gli cluster of the strains, the presence of an unidentified copy of gliZ outside the gli cluster or the absorption of the function by other transcription factor.", "On the other hand, A. lentulus apparently owns all the machinery needed for GT biosynthesis when compared with A. fumigatus, although we could not detect any trace of GT or bmGT under our experimental conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that a very low frequency of A. lentulus strains and isolates are capable to generate these secondary metabolites [53]. It must be mentioned that other studies were not able to detect these toxins in other A. lentulus strains [52,82]. Although it is clear that A. lentulus genome contains the entire gli cluster, further research is needed to elucidate why the secondary metabolite profiles of A. lentulus are very different from those of A. fumigatus as previously shown [52,82] despite being species closely related to A. fumigatus. Probably, some species that apparently owns all the machinery needed for GT biosynthesis failed to produce GT in the research due to culture conditions, since it is well-known that cryptic genes are repressed in normal culture conditions.", "Although the non-pathogenic fungus A. fischeri had been described as not capable of producing GT [51,83], recent work shows that it does [84]. While Knowles et al. discovered that culturing conditions that induce GT synthesis in A. fumigatus also induce similar amounts of GT in A. fischeri cultures, our results for A. fischeri CBS 420.96 cultures suggest that very low amounts of GT are obtained when compared with A. fumigatus.", "Outside the section Fumigati, we have only found GT and bmGT in culture filtrates of T. virens CBS 249.59. However, it has been referred for a long time that some Penicillium species can produce GT [85,86,87,88,89]. It is possible that our culture conditions would not be the most optimal ones, but in this study, we have not obtained GT or bmGT in the two Penicillium species which own the most similar gli cluster compared to the gli cluster of A. fumigatus. It is true that P. lilacinoechinulatum possesses a similar gli cluster uploaded on the NCBI, but the absence of a complete genome on this web led us not to include it in our study. In the same way, the absence of a complete genome uploaded on NCBI of all Penicillium species referenced above that can produce some type of GT impede a complete understanding about the ability to produce GT in the genus Penicillium.", "The gli cluster of T. virens Gv29-8 was previously reported to contain only 8 of 13 genes [72], here we report the possible candidates for gliJ, gliA, and gliT in T. virens genome. Since a part of the gli cluster of T. virens Gv29-8 resides at the end of a scaffold, the rest of the genes should be located at one or more scaffolds. We found that these three missed genes could be located inside other little scaffolds which also contain just a few more genes. Nevertheless, a genome sequencing of more T. virens strains would clarify the complete structure of the gli cluster of T. virens."]
