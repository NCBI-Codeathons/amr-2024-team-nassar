["Discussion", "A variety of chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of OSCC have emerged, and these chemotherapy drugs have achieved good results in the treatment of OSCC (11). However, the prognosis and survival of patients with OSCC are still not optimistic. On the one hand, early lymph node metastasis of tumor cells is difficult to detect, and on the other hand, there is OSCC resistance (12). In the early 1980s, cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil were first used to treat OSCC, and the initial reported cancer cell response rate was only 30\u201340% (13). Currently, cisplatin-based chemotherapy drugs can be used to treat a variety of malignant tumors including OSCC. In vitro OSCC resistance experiments have revealed that cancer cells can fight against chemotherapeutic drugs with a highly complex phenotypic defense mechanism, such as reducing apoptosis, enhancing repair after DNA damage, changing cell cycle checkpoints and destroying cytoskeleton assembly to increase self-resistance (14,15). Changes in the cytoskeleton can disrupt the transport of cellular proteins and redistribute transporters on the cell membrane surface, even making cancer cells permanently resistant to cisplatin (16).", "Studies have shown that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is abnormally activated in various human tumors and is closely related to cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis (17). The classical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascade can be activated through the binding of Wnt ligand and the seven-pass transmembrane FZD7 receptor protein and co-receptors of Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6), and this interaction can lead to the stable transfer of intracellular \u03b2-catenin into the nucleus, thereby regulating the expression of related genes (18,19). FZD7 is located on human chromosome 2q33 and is one of the most abundant proteins in the frizzled protein family (19). FZD7 is highly expressed in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer, thus promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion by activating Wnt signaling pathway (20). Recent studies have found that FZD7 can increase the resistance of cancer cells by activating Wnt signaling. For example, FZD7 silencing can promote the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to 5-fluorouracil by blocking Wnt signaling and downregulation of P-gp expression. Quercetin can reverse the resistance of hepatoma cells to 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting the activation of the FZD7/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway (21). This study first examined the mRNA expression of miR-27b and FDZ7 in clinically cisplatin-resistant OSCC patients and cisplatin-sensitive OSCC patients. It was found that cisplatin-sensitive OSCC patients had a higher expression of miR-27b in cancer tissues, but the level of FDZ7 expression was lower. Therefore, we further stimulated the cisplatin-resistant OSCC cell line by gradient concentration of cisplatin, and added miR-27b to upregulate the expression level of miR-27b. It was found that when the expression level of miR-27b was increased, the sensitivity of OSCC cells to cisplatin drugs was significantly increased, mainly manifestations were significantly inhibited in cell proliferation ability, significantly promoted apoptosis, and significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration ability. These results suggested that miR-27b can improve the resistance of OSCC cells to cisplatin drugs to a certain extent. Finally, by detecting the relevant protein signaling pathways affecting drug-resistant cells, we found that the expression levels of FDZ7 and \u03b2-catenin were inhibited by miR-27b, which partially explained the inhibitory effect of miR-27b on cell resistance. However, there are still some limitations in this study: i) Only one cell line was used in this study; ii) Only the expression of FDZ7/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway was detected in this study, but the mechanism of cisplatin resistance in OSCC cells is complex with many signaling pathways. Further experiments are needed to verify whether high expression of miR-27b also affects other drug-resistance-related pathways.", "In conclusion, this study reveals for the first time that miR-27b can increase the sensitivity of OSCC cells to cisplatin drugs, significantly inhibit OSCC cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit cell invasion and migration, which may be related to the inhibition of FDZ7/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by miR-27b."]
