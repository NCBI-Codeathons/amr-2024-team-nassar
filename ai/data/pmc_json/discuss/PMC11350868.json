["3. Discussion", "Antimicrobial resistance is a global issue that healthcare providers, governments, and private sectors are spotlighting. MRSA poses an infection risk that the WHO is concerned about and created an action plan to solve [18]. In all ages of patients, especially the elderly and children, who are vulnerable to infection, this requires intensive treatment to cure [19,20]. Mangrove sediments provide various nutrients and abundant organic matter, creating a favorable environment for microbial growth despite the high-salt and low-oxygen conditions. There are natural resources for organism diversity, including microbes, such as actinobacteria, proteobacteria, firmicutes, planctomycetes, bacteroidetes, and gamma-proteobacteria [21]. Mangrove areas in Thailand are commonly found in the southern part of the country. The report showed that microbial isolation provided 519 natural products. Of these, 210 compounds were from bacteria (mostly from streptomyces) and 309 compounds were from fungi (mostly from Aspergillus and Penicillium) [22]. Another report showed that firmicutes have the potential for bioactive discoveries.", "Firmicutes microbes, particularly Bacillus species, have been found to produce potent antimicrobial compounds as secondary metabolites with broad-spectrum activity against harmful bacteria, including MRSA [23]. A total of 1286 Bacillus strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity have been reported, such as Bacillus subtilis (n = 348), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (n = 214), Bacillus licheniformis (n = 114), Bacillus circulans (n = 89), Bacillus thuringiensis (n = 73), Bacillus pumilus (n = 61), Bacillus velezensis (n = 60), Bacillus megaterium (n = 17), Bacillus mojavensis (n = 17), and unidentified bacillus species (n = 293) [24]. The reports on antimicrobial production by Bacillus paralicheniformis are relatively low in number. The phylogenetic relation of NNS4-3 showed the closest relation to Bacillus paralicheniformis KJ-16 based on genome comparison. Bacillus paralicheniformis has been formerly identified as Bacillus licheniformis. Molecular genetics has confirmed the difference between both species since 2015. The difference between the two species relies on distinct operons that contribute to the BGC of secondary metabolites. A previous study has described the colony morphology of Bacillus paralicheniformis MDJK30 cultured in a casein medium. The colonies were beige in color with a dry-textured surface and irregularly shaped borders. It was a Gram-positive rod capable of forming endospores [25]. SEM imaging of Bacillus paralicheniformis RP01 cultured in Luria Bertani medium displayed rod-shaped cells with endospore formation and the vegetative cells had a diameter of 2\u20133 \u03bcm [26]. The colony and cell morphology of Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 were similar to those of the aforementioned strains. Nonetheless, Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 exhibited a distinct characteristic of brick-red pigment production in its colonies, which could suggest a different phenotypic expression.", "Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 presented BGCs responsible for the production of antimicrobial compounds, such as lasso peptide, bacillibactin, lichenysin, bacitracin, and fengycin, which was consistent with Bacillus paralicheniformis strains MDJK30 and ATCC9945a [25,27]. Bacillus paralicheniformis has the capability to produce fengycin, paralichenicidin, and bacitracin, whereas Bacillus licheniformis is unable to produce these compounds [28]. Bacillus species have different operons with the homology identity of biosynthesis enzymes of fengycin ranging from 62% to 74%. This supports the evidence of divergence from the same ancestor. The bacillibactin BGC was predicted to have 100% similarity ortholog. Bacillibactin is synthesized by the dhb gene cluster. The detected operon, dhbACEBF, was involved in the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (dhb) biosynthesis pathway with a multi-enzyme complex that has been reported in Bacillus paralicheniformis strain BP9 [29]. Lichenysin has been reported in a previous study. Genome sequence analysis of several strains of Bacillus licheniformis revealed the presence of licA, licB, licC, and licTE, which were responsible for lichenysin biosynthesis. The differences in the DNA sequence of these genes contributed to the difference in the carbon chain length of lichenysin [30]. Fengycin was a non-ribosomal synthesized peptide that exhibited antifungal activity. The cluster contributing to the fengycin synthesis was composed of fenA-E genes, which have been found in the genomes of Bacillus paralicheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus velezensis [31]. The BGC of bacitracin found in the NNS4-3 genome has also been identified in Bacillus paralicheniformis, Bacillus sonorensis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus cereus. This BGC contained bacA, bacB, bacC (bacitracin synthetase), bacT (thioesterase), bacR and bacS (two-component regulatory system), and bacE (ABC transport gene as bcrA, bcrB, and bcrC). The bacitracin synthetase in Bacillus paralicheniformis, Bacillus sonorensis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus cereus showed high similarity to genes for subpeptin synthesis from Bacillus subtilis, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of these genes might have occurred among these species.", "The amino acid sequences of bacitracin synthetase across different strains exhibit sequence divergence but they share conserved substrate domains, indicating functional conservation of these enzymes [25,32]. The self-resistance mechanism to bacitracin has been reported. The bacR and bacS genes regulate the bacitracin resistance along with the ABC transporter genes (bcrA, bcrB, and bcrC), which protect it against bacitracin damage during its production [33]. The other BGCs, such as butirosin, schizokinen, and pulcherriminic acid, show low to moderate similarity in their orthologs (7\u201375% similarity). Further investigation and verification of these BGCs and their functions are needed. The bacitracin-like AMP purified from NNS4-3 revealed a structure related to the familial structure of AMPs derived from Bacillus species. Bacitracin, lichenin, subpeptin, and subpeptin-like AMP have been reported to have similar amino acid sequences in the part of -Ile-Phe-His-Asp-Asn [32,34,35]. NNS4-3 AMP also contained the same conserved amino acid sequence as the aforementioned AMPs. However, mass spectrometry could not discriminate between the isoleucine and leucine amino acids. Therefore, the investigated AMP from NNS4-3 exhibited a 50% similarity to bacitracin. The BGCs for paralichenicidin and amyloliquecidin have been reported to be present in some strains of Bacillus paralicheniformis. However, these BGCs were not found in the genome of Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3. This indicated that the BGCs of secondary metabolites were diverse among subspecies [25].", "The further utilization of bacterial isolate as a component of the products in the healthcare industry requires an antibiotic susceptibility profile for safety data requirements, as regulated by the FDA. Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 still exhibits high susceptibility to many antibiotics. In contrast, 24 strains of Bacillus paralicheniformis and 74 strains of Bacillus licheniformis have been reported to resist erythromycin and clindamycin due to the presence of the ermD gene and speG gene [36]. Conversely, these two genes were not found in the in silico prediction of the NNS4-3 genome and susceptibility tests have confirmed its susceptibility to erythromycin. Regarding bacitracin resistance, almost all Bacillus paralicheniformis strains possess these genes for self-defense during the production of bacitracin as a secondary metabolite for competitive situations in natural environments [33]. Several antibiotic-resistance genes were found in the genome of NNS4-3, including genes encoding resistance to penicillin, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and vancomycin. However, susceptibility testing verified that NNS4-3 was susceptible to those aforementioned antibiotics. The results were supported by previous studies. Nine strains of Bacillus paralicheniformis also exhibited a susceptible profile against the mentioned antibiotics [37,38]. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of NNS4-3 showed similarities with three strains of Bacillus velezensis, which were susceptible to ciprofloxacin but resistant to cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone) [39]. Nevertheless, NNS4-3 demonstrated resistance to ceftriaxone while it was susceptible to other cephalosporins. The antibiotic susceptibility of NNS4-3 was within acceptable limits for conventional treatment, indicating that this strain showed a low risk for pathogenicity. Previous studies have reported different MICs for bacitracin from Bacillus paralicheniformis. In the early stationary phase of the growth curve (48\u201372 h of incubation), many Bacillus species produce the maximum potency of the antimicrobial peptide [23]. The early stationary phase of NNS4-3 growth showed the maximum antimicrobial activity at 48 h. The purification procedures together with the bioassay guide provided the achievement of AMP purification. The antimicrobial peptide-producing Bacillus genus was supported by much of the reported literature [24].", "The MIC value of the purified AMP obtained from Penicillium sclerotiorum was 250 \u03bcg/mL for the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strain SA1911 and 1911B and it was 125 \u03bcg/mL for the MRSA strain ATCC 35139 [40]. In another study, the MIC value of bacitracin was 64 \u03bcg/mL in the MSSA strain RN4420 and 32 \u03bcg/mL in the MRSA strain MW2 [41]. The literature search could support the observed difference in MIC between MSSA and MRSA strains. In our study, the MIC values of NNS4-3 AMP were different against MSSA and MRSA with lower MICs (1 \u00b5g/mL\u201316 \u00b5g/mL) than those reported in previous works. Interestingly, MRSA strains were more susceptible to the NNS4-3 AMP than the MSSA strain.", "The sensitivity of bacitracin derived from Bacillus paralicheniformis UBBLi30 was studied against several conditions for 1 h. The stability result has been reported, showing that bacitracin was stable at up to 100 \u00b0C and across a wide range of pHs (1\u201311) with 100% remaining activity. The activity was lost when the pH reached 14. Autoclaving for 15 min diminished the activity of the AMP to 80%. In addition, the AMP could resist digestion by proteolytic enzymes, such as proteinase K, trypsin, and pepsin [42]. The NNS4-3 AMP showed similar stability against temperature treatment, proteolytic enzyme degradation, surfactant treatment, and pH variation to the reported bacitracin for 1 h of treatment. Moreover, our study extended the treatment duration to 6 and 12 h, which is longer compared to the previously reported study. The NNS4-3 AMP showed thermal resistance up to 80 \u00b0C and maintained robust activity across a wide range of physiological pHs for 12 h. Notably, temperatures above 80 \u00b0C for more than 6 h destroyed the peptide activity in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. Autoclaving reduced the activity of the NNS4-3 AMP by half within 15 min and all activity was diminished after 30 min. These thermal instability phenomena could be attributed to changes in the secondary structure of the AMP from alpha-helix and beta-sheet to a random-coiled structure due to denaturation. This structural change reduced the ability of AMP to destabilize bacterial membranes, resulting in a loss of antimicrobial activity [43]. The NNS4-3 AMP exhibited tolerance to proteinase K, trypsin, and alpha-chymotrypsin. The AMP was composed of one phenylalanine residue as an aromatic amino acid and two lysine residues, which served as specific cleavage sites for proteinase K and alpha-chymotrypsin targeting the aromatic amino acid and trypsin targeting lysine, respectively [44]. However, the activity of the AMP remained above 90% due to the short length of the peptide and its enantiomeric structure containing D-amino acids, which could not be cleaved by the aforementioned enzymes [43]. Nonetheless, the mass spectrometry technique employed in our study was unable to determine the stereochemistry of the amino acid residues. The activity of NNS4-3 AMP could be reduced by SDS, whereas Triton X-100 did not affect the antibacterial activity of the AMP. Surfactants could form micelle structures above a critical micelle concentration and subsequently interact with lipid bilayers, such as bacterial cell membranes. The reduced activity of the NNS4-3 AMP in the presence of SDS could be proposed to occur due to the binding of the positively charged NNS4-3 AMP to the negatively charged micelles formed by SDS, which mimicked the interaction with intact bacterial cell membranes. This interaction was formed by electrostatic forces. Subsequently, hydrophobic interactions played a key role in facilitating the interaction of the hydrophobic part of the AMP with the bacterial cell membranes or SDS micelles. It could be proposed that the ability of the AMP to destabilize bacterial cell membranes caused cell disruption. In the SDS environment, the AMP could bind to SDS micelles instead of bacterial cell membranes; this reduced the availability of AMP molecules to interact with bacterial cells. Consequently, a reduction in AMP activity was observed in the presence of SDS. In contrast, the non-ionic micelles of Triton X-100 forming uncharged micelle surfaces had a lower impact on AMP binding. Therefore, AMP molecules would be able to fully interact with bacterial cells in the presence of Triton X-100 [45].", "The mechanisms by which AMPs inhibit bacterial growth can be categorized into two types. The first is the receptor-mediated mechanism. Well-studied AMPs, like nisin and polymyxin, exert their activity by binding to lipid II and lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial cell wall, respectively [46]. Likewise, bacitracin disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to lipid-P-P during the dephosphorylation of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate [47]. The second mechanism is non-receptor-mediated, which is more commonly reported for AMPs. The physical interaction plays an important role in the binding of cationic AMPs to the negatively charged surface of bacterial cell membranes due to the presence of phospholipids, teichoic acids, and lipopolysaccharides. The surfaces of Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus and MRSA, contain teichoic acids, resulting in negatively charged cell membranes. This leads to an initial electrostatic attraction between the cationic AMPs and the bacterial cell membranes [48]. After the electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interactions between AMPs and bacterial cell membranes occur. This leads to the destabilization of the bacterial cell membrane and subsequent membrane disruption. This is the mechanism by which AMPs exert their antimicrobial activity [11]. The well-defined models of molecular action for AMPs via the non-receptor-mediated mechanism are the barrel-stave, toroidal, and detergent-like carpet models, which have been described for alamethicin, lacticin Q, and aurein, respectively [49]. SEM micrographs revealed that the NNS4-3 AMP contributed to pore formation, cell membrane destabilization, and membrane breakdown, which were similar to the SEM images of vancomycin, which acts as a membrane-disrupting compound. These actions could be attributed to the 10-amino-acid length of the NNS4-3 AMP, which was composed of lysine, aspartic acid, and leucine residues in its structure. This resulted in cationic, anionic, and hydrophobic moieties, respectively. Additionally, the secondary structure of NNS4-3 AMP was confirmed by CD spectra. The beta-sheet conformation with an antiparallel direction plays an important role in pore formation on the bacterial membrane. A previous study reported the beta-sheet conformation with an antiparallel direction of synthetic AMPs facilitated penetration and pore formation on the cell membranes of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by physical interaction [50]. Furthermore, the converted structure conformation from a random coil conformation to an alpha-helix conformation of the NNS4-3 AMP when interacting with SDS micelles supported its action on bacterial cell membranes [51]. Another crucial aspect determining an antibiotic\u2019s effectiveness is its bactericidal rate, which refers to the rate at which it eliminates targeted bacteria. A faster bactericidal action typically leads to a quicker reduction in the bacterial load within the patient. This study suggested that at 4\u00d7 MIC levels, the NNS4-3 AMP completely eradicated the S. aureus TISTR 517 within 16 h, while its bactericidal activity against the MRSA strain 2468 was observed within 8 h.", "Killing kinetics revealed that the NNS4-3 AMP exhibited a mode of action with time- and concentration-dependent killing characteristics against the MSSA and MRSA strains. Most reported AMPs have been defined to exhibit modes of action that are dependent on both concentration and time. For alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as nisin and pleurocidin, their activity exhibits concentration dependence whereby a critical concentration is required to disrupt the cell membrane and cell wall of the treated bacteria via the previously described mechanisms. In addition to the concentration-dependent effect, AMP also exhibited a time-dependent killing effect, which involved slow pore formation on the bacterial cell membrane or the gradual accumulation of AMP to disrupt intracellular targets leading to cell death [52,53,54].", "The suggestion for further study is to determine the mechanisms of action at the molecular level of the NNS4-3 AMP. Verification of the predicted genes is encouraged to confirm the production process of the AMPs that were annotated in the genome, as they might contain low to moderate similarity to known orthologs. This potentially leads to the discovery of new gene products. Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 could be a promising candidate as a source of AMPs against MRSA strains. Further evaluation of the AMP toxicity and safety is also required for clinical use. The insights obtained from its genomic information could support new approaches in synthetic biology to combat antimicrobial resistance."]
