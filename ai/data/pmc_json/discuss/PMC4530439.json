["Discussion", "For pathogens colonization and subsequent symptom development, it is necessary to produce certain amount of virulence factors when P. syringae pv. phaseolicola cells infiltrated into plant tissues34. Phytotoxic compound PHTs conferred pathogens with survival advantages while burdened themselves with self-toxicity, amino acid source and energy expenditure simultaneously. The productivity and production of PHTs must be controlled accurately. Nevertheless, there is no typical transcriptional regulator gene has been identified from PHT biosynthetic gene cluster so far417.", "To the PHT producers, it is a passive strategy to employ PHT resistant ArgK acting as a functional replacement of OTCase ArgF. In this study, we demonstrated that ArgK directly controlled the production of PHTs by carbamylation of Orn-Ala-hArg to produce by-product Cit-Ala-hArg. Cit-Ala-hArg could act as a nontoxic reservoir or be degraded by nonspecific aminopeptidase to provide additional Citrulline source (Fig. 4). It depends on the physiological situation of PHTs producers. This active manner could act as a complementary mechanism to the passive one for PHT producers\u2019 self-defense. The dual roles of ArgK reported here help us to understand how P. syringae pv. phaseolicola kept a nice balance between amino acid fundamental metabolic pathway and the second metabolites PHTs biosynthesis pathway."]
