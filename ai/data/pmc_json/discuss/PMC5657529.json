["DISCUSSION", "This work delineates the molecular basis for an alternative repair pathway for YTMA lesions. The adducts formed by YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins are too large to be excised by traditional DNA glycosylases and too stabilizing to the DNA duplex to be efficiently recognized by the UvrABC complex. Consequently, these compounds have extraordinarily high levels of toxicity, not unlike those of bifunctional alkylating agents that produce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Given the dramatic increase in duplex stability provided by YTMA and related lesions, owing to the extensive network of CH/\u03c0 interactions that they form between opposing DNA strands, these lesions should arguably be regarded as non-covalent ICLs. In prokaryotes, ICLs are repaired through the combined activities of NER and either homologous recombination or translesion synthesis45. Since the adducts generated by YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins neither destabilize nor significantly distort DNA17\u201319,22, reliance on the UvrABC incision complex will likely hinder ICL repair in the same manner that it hinders NER. As such, none of the traditional repair pathways are well suited for these bulky and highly duplex-stabilizing lesions.", "YtkR2 presumably evolved to eliminate this repair deficiency in Streptomyces sp. TP-A0356 by specifically excising YTMA lesions, and thereby providing self-resistance to YTM. While orthologs of YtkR2, including AlkD, are prevalent in non-YTM producing bacteria10,46, they likely have not undergone the same selective pressure. Despite YtkR2 and AlkD sharing thirteen of sixteen DNA binding residues, they share only four of twelve YTMAde binding residues (Supplementary Fig. 8). Notably, these differences seem to create a larger binding cleft in YtkR2, with fewer contacts with YTMAde. While initially surprising, this may serve to destabilize the ternary product complex and promote dissociation of YtkR2, thereby avoiding the inhibition of AP endonuclease activity observed with AlkD. There is also the possibility that YtkR2 functions within a more specialized BER pathway. The gene cluster that encodes YtkR2 and the enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of YTM also encodes proteins with low sequence similarity to Escherichia coli EndoIV and TatD, the latter of which is a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease specific for single-stranded DNA15,47. Since orthologs of EndoIV and TatD with high sequence similarity to the E. coli enzymes exist elsewhere in the genome of Streptomyces sp. TP-A035648, the divergent proteins in the YTM producer may have evolved to specifically process AP sites generated from YTMA.", "The ability of AlkD to excise YTMA lesions, despite its divergent binding surface, as well as 7-pyridyloxobutyl-2\u2032-deoxyguansine and O2-pyridyloxobutyl-2\u2032-deoxycytidine lesions10 suggests that AlkD-mediated BER of bulky lesions may be more general than previously thought. Seemingly the only strict requirement is that the substrate be positively charged, and therefore activated for excision9. There are no protein contacts in the major groove, which could possibly block repair of major groove adducts, and the contacts in the minor groove seem to be largely non-specific. Only two residues\u2014Gln38 and Lys156\u2014form hydrogen-bonding interactions with YTMAde (Supplementary Fig. 8), and the most prominent binding contacts, the CH/\u03c0 interactions formed by Tyr27, Trp109, and Trp187, select only for aromatic groups. Furthermore, since most interactions with the hydrophilic edge of YTMAde are mediated by water (Supplementary Fig. 5), the partially solvent-filled cavity in which the YTM moiety is bound would be able to accommodate a variety of chemically and structurally diverse adducts. Taken together, these characteristics suggest that AlkD is capable of removing a broad spectrum of bulky lesions, both within and outside the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone family.", "Extension of the BER pathway beyond repair of small modifications is not limited to orthologs of AlkD. Two unrelated DNA glycosylases capable of unhooking covalent ICLs have been identified recently in bacteria and vertebrates49,50. Similar to ytkR2, the Streptomyces sahachiroi azi36/orf1 gene provides self-resistance to the natural product azinomycin B, a potent bifunctional alkylating agent, by encoding a DNA glycosylase specific for azinomycin B-derived ICLs. While the cellular utility of BER-mediated removal of bulky and crosslinked adducts remains to be fully elucidated, these studies show that the spectrum of lesions eliminated from the genome by BER is primarily dependent on the DNA glycosylases that initiate the pathway. Moreover, the continued identification of novel DNA glycosylases with non-traditional substrates is likely to further expand the known role of BER in genomic maintenance, including providing self-resistance to genotoxic natural products."]
