["4. Discussion", "CIR injury is an extremely complex pathophysiological process comprising a rapid cascade of intracellular calcium overload, lipid peroxidation, oxygen free radical damage, apoptotic gene activation, excitotoxicity (excitatory amino acids-induced neurotoxicity), and inflammatory cytokine damage [25,26]. The involved mechanisms, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory injury, and cell damage, play different roles in the process of CIR injury. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial damage and dysfunction during CIR are important causes of neuronal cell death [27]. Current studies suggest that a large amount of cytochrome C is released from mitochondria into cells by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in CIR injury, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction [28,29]. Further oxidative damage of mitochondria is induced by ATP synthesis deficiency and new reactive oxygen species in CIR injury [30]. Therefore, timely clearance of damaged mitochondria is essential to mitigate CIR-induced brain damage. Mitophagy is a type of selective autophagy that can maintain homeostasis of the intracellular environment by specifically recognizing and removing abnormal mitochondria [5]. Although many studies have investigated the effect of mitochondrial autophagy in CIR injury, the exact role mitochondrial autophagy plays in this process is unknown. It remains controversial whether mitophagy can play a protective role in ischemic preconditioning and/or exert different effects on how reperfusion injury occurs [24,31]. A recent study suggests that carnosine can improve mitochondrial function and reduce CIR injury by downregulating mitophagy [32]. Another study showed that upregulating mitophagy can protect against CIR injury by promptly removing damaged mitochondria [33]. Accumulating research indicates that mitophagy are activated in a stress-induced pathway to clear damaged mitochondria in CIR injury. Furthermore, mitophagy aggravates brain injury during the ischemia phase, but alleviates brain injury in the reperfusion phase. In addition, the protective role of mitophagy during reperfusion may be attributable to mitochondrial clearance and inhibition of downstream apoptosis. Accordingly, insufficient clearance of damaged mitochondria causes cell death [34]. In this study, we found that the CB2R agonist BCP, a natural sesquiterpene compound, protected against CIR injury both in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with activation of mitophagy after CIR injury, BCP treatment significantly upregulated CIR-induced mitophagy, yielding a neuroprotective effect after CIR injury. In addition, the mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 successfully blocked BCP-induced protection against CIR injury in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models. Therefore, mitophagy may be an important target for the treatment of CIR injury.", "LC3-I is converted to lipidated LC3-II, a classic hallmark of autophagy [35]. p62, a selective substrate protein degraded by autophagy, binds to Atg8/LC3 on autophagy membranes to target autophagosomes for degradation during autophagy. Therefore, ubiquitin-p62-LC3 can perform autophagic degradation on damaged phagocytes and eliminate defective membranous organelles and proteins [36]. TOM20 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein and subunit of the important TOM complex receptor. The level of TOM20 reflects the relative number of mitochondria. Hence, relative expression of TOM20 and p62, as well as the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I proteins, are used to evaluate levels of mitophagy [35]. In this study, when BCP treatment was given, the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio sharply increased while expression of p62 and TOM20 were significantly decreased in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models of CIR injury. These results indicate that mitochondrial autophagy levels were further increased. The process of autophagy/mitophagy occurs sequentially as follows: phagophore formation, fusion of the blind ends of phagophores, autophagosome formation, fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, and transformation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes; during the final step of autophagy, residual bodies can be detected [37]. During this process, various damaged proteins or organelles, including mitochondria, are wrapped by double-layered membrane autophagy vesicles that are then sent to lysosomes (animals) or vacuoles (yeast and plants), which are eventually degraded and recycled [38]. Autophagosomes are characterized by a double-layer or multilayer membrane-like vacuole structure that contains cytoplasmic components, such as mitochondria, and can be observed by electron microscopy [39]. In this study, TEM results revealed the presence of autophagosomes with a typical bilayer membrane structure in the BCP treatment group in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models of CIR injury.", "Pink1-Parkin2-mediated mitophagy is a classic pathway to clear damaged mitochondria [40]. Release of Pink1 from the mitochondrial outer membrane to the inner membrane is blocked by mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, meaning Pink1 cannot be degraded and instead accumulates on the outer membrane of mitochondria. When Pink1 aggregates on the mitochondrial outer membrane, various proteins including Parkin, ubiquitin, and TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) are recruited and activated. Ample studies have investigated the effect of Pink1/Parkin2-mediated mitophagy in CIR injury. Previous reports suggest that mitophagy is activated in CIR-induced brain damage via the PINK1/PARK2/p62 signaling pathway [41]. Another study showed that electroacupuncture ameliorates neuronal injury by Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy clearance in CIR [17]. In the present experiment, we demonstrated that BCP pretreatment can significantly increase expression of Pink1 and Parkin2, suggesting that BCP-induced mitochondrial autophagy is dependent on the Pink1/Parkin2 pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that BCP reduced CIR injury in both OGD/R in vitro and MCAO/R in vivo models by upregulating CIR-induced mitophagy through effects on the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway."]
