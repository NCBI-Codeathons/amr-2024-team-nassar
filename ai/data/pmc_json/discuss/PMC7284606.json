["4. Discussion", "The abundance and diversity of colicin-producing bacteria suggest that colicins could be important factors for successful bacteria survival in complex dynamic microbial communities. Attempts to elucidate the specific role of colicins has mostly been limited to mathematical models, well-defined laboratory settings, or perturbed environmental systems. These studies have been invaluable for deciphering the molecular mechanism of colicins and for providing models that suggest colicin production can impact interactions with the competing microbes and the environment. However, these previous studies have offered more limited insight into the importance of colicin production in the context of a natural, unperturbed environment. The mammalian gut, composed of a high density of competing bacteria interacting with the host, makes for an ideal setting to elucidate the importance of colicin production in a complex microbial environment. In this study, we used a well-established C57BL/6 mouse model to address whether colicins are important for colonization, niche competition, and strain invasion using a natural colicin-producing commensal strain. Significantly, our results demonstrate that colicin production is not essential for sustained colonization of a commensal E. coli strain in a healthy mouse gut with an intact gut microbiome. During solo-colonization experiments, both a colicin-deficient strain and a colicin-sensitive strain sustained colonization levels statistically similar to the wild-type colicin-producing strain. Interestingly, the wild-type strain showed no competition advantage over either a colicin-deficient strain or a colicin-sensitive strain. Further, the ability of a pre-colonized strain to withstand niche invasion by another strain was independent of colicin production and sensitivity. This is the first report demonstrating that colicins are not required for sustained colonization of a commensal E. coli strain inhabiting its natural niche in the healthy murine gut.", "Successful bacteria colonization involves both initiating and sustaining colonization [8]. In order to fully capture both aspects of colonization we took a kinetic approach and monitored bacterial burden across time throughout each experiment. With this approach, we were able to conclude that colicin production is not essential for a commensal to establish itself in its environmental niche nor to maintain itself in that niche. It is possible, however, that if the duration of the colonization experiments had been extended there would have been a reduction in colicin-deficient colony counts. In one prior experimental setup, the benefit of colicin production was revealed only after ~3 months of colonization [28]. However, that experiment was done in the context of an altered microbiome with the mice being continually fed streptomycin for the duration of the experiment, which could be associated with mild inflammation [47]. It is possible that in the setting of mild inflammation colicin production has a more critical role for commensal survival. Further, the colony counts in our experiments stabilized over time, suggesting the duration of our experiments appropriately captured stable colonization.", "For a commensal microbe, the gut is a complex environment with ongoing interactions with surrounding microbes. To examine the importance of colicin production during direct competition over the same niche, we performed two separate competition experiments. In one competition experiment we competed the wild-type strain against a colicin-deficient strain to specifically interrogate the role of colicin production. In the second competition experiment we competed the wild-type strain against a colicin-sensitive strain to examine directly whether colicin sensitivity would result in a fitness disadvantage. In both experiments each strain was recovered in nearly equal numbers throughout the experiment. Our data suggest that for a commensal in its adapted environment, potentially costly defense mechanisms such as colicins are not essential. This conclusion is further supported by the pre-colonization experiments in which either a pre-colonized wild-type strain or pre-colonized strain that is both colicin deficient and sensitive was able to prevent robust colonization of an invading strain. It is possible that maintenance of microbial diversity and fitness in homeostatic environments may rely on alternative mechanisms besides colicin production. Several studies have demonstrated that established commensals can outcompete other microbes via other mechanisms including physical and nutrient exclusion [7,8,50]. Given the complex nature of the gut microbiome, it is probable that multiple mechanisms are involved for a commensal to maintain colonization in its intestinal niche. Further, it is possible that in homeostatic environments, the expression of colicins may in fact come with costs. Colicin machinery can be energetically costly to bacteria and, specifically with pore-forming colicins such as MP1\u2032s colicin, the gene encoding the immunity protein is typically constitutively expressed [12]. Our results could align with this conclusion because when the wild-type strain was competed against the colicin-sensitive strain, the colicin-sensitive strain showed a mild colonization advantage at select time points.", "The results presented here suggests colicin dynamics are closely linked to the surrounding environment. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in a healthy, minimally perturbed gut environment colicins do not contribute to commensal survivability whereas previous reports have clearly demonstrated an important role of colicins for bacterial survival in the setting of gut inflammation [30,51,52]. Specifically, previous work using a streptomycin-treated mouse model revealed that when a mouse is pre-colonized with a colicin sensitive strain, introduction of a colicin-producing strain can displace the sensitive strain [29]. In our parallel experiment, mice were pre-colonized with a colicin-deficient and -sensitive strain and when a colicin-producing strain was introduced, it was unable to invade and displace the existing strain (Figure 5A). Taken together, these results suggest that colicin dynamics depend upon the surrounding gut environment or on the given strain being investigated.", "We also established that MP1 colicin production is SOS-dependent and increased in the presence of genotoxic stress. Genes regulated by the SOS response are induced in a highly organized chronological manner where the first genes to be induced are those involved in error-free repair and the last genes to be induced are those involved in error-prone repair [42,53]. It is hypothesized that induction of error-prone repair is reserved for when there is extensive or sustained DNA damage. Our analysis of the MP1 colicin promoter indicates that it would be likely induced later in the SOS response, suggesting that colicin production is reserved for times of sustained or considerable DNA damage [41]. These results are particularly important to consider in the context of our prior work demonstrating that the SOS response is important for sustained colonization of MP1 in a natural gut environment [22]. In that report, an SOS-off mutant had a colonization defect relative to a wild-type strain. While we speculated that the loss of colicin production might contribute to the reduced fitness of the SOS-off mutant, the results presented here suggest that alternative SOS-associated effectors other than the MP1 colicin are more likely to be responsible for the compromised in vivo fitness of the SOS-off MP1 strain. There are several potential explanations to account for an observed fitness defect with an SOS-off MP1 strain and the absence of a fitness defect with the colicin-deficient strain. From a regulatory perspective, it is possible that the genotoxic stress experienced during colonization is not enough to activate late SOS-induced genes, but enough to activate early SOS-induced genes which account for the phenotype. Additionally, given the IcsR binding site in the promoter, it is possible that despite SOS activation, colicin expression remains repressed by IcsR in the unperturbed host environment. Previous studies have speculated that dual repression of colicins by both LexA and IscR permits colicin expression to be reserved as a last resort mechanism [41]. Lastly, it is conceivable that MP1 colicins are produced, but that given their narrow spectrum they have no major impact on the neighboring microbes that contribute to the success or failure of stable colonization.", "Our model using MP1 colonization of the murine gut has distinctive advantages in that MP1 is a natural colonizer and establishes colonization levels that are close to those observed for E. coli in the unperturbed murine gut. At the same time, there are two aspects of our study which might limit the generalizability of our conclusions. First, our analysis of MP1 colicin indicated that it is active against non-immune MP1 partners, MG1655, and E. coli Nissle, but is not more broadly active. Although our study validates that natural colicin producers are not universally dependent upon their colicins, it is possible that other natural colonizers producing broader-acting colicins may be more dependent upon their production. Second, we utilized a brief, but non-sustained, streptomycin treatment prior to colonization with MP1, in order to open up a niche that can be reliably colonized to reproducible levels. While prior work has established that the normal flora rebounds within five days of treatment [48,54] and that our model best represents the unperturbed gut, it is feasible that our minimal perturbations prior to colonization could alter the microbiome in a manner that impacts our observations.", "Overall, the results of our study combined with previous data exploring the role of colicins in alternative systems suggest a model where the fitness afforded by colicin production may depend upon the environmental condition. MP1 is a natural E. coli isolate of the murine gut and, by extension, when it is colonizing a healthy mouse gut the environmental stressors might be minimally perturbing. In light of our previous study demonstrating a role for the SOS response during MP1 colonization of the murine gut, it is possible that basal genotoxic stress is present, requiring some activation of the SOS response, but the genotoxic stress is not extensive enough to induce or require some of the more potent effectors, such as colicins.", "Importantly, the results of this study may help contribute towards defining the role of colicin-producing bacteria as probiotics that may prevent infection by enteric pathogens. Our data suggest that colicin production might be activated only in the setting of dysbiosis, and thus the therapeutic benefit of colicins might be enhanced if utilized during the initial period of dysbiosis. We speculate that in the absence of exogenous perturbations, competition between bacterial communities is not as fierce as previously imagined, but instead these communities exist in a delicate equilibrium that does not require routine activation of the full arsenal of bacterial defense mechanisms. Our study highlights a role for exploring effectors in various environments, including those most closely mimicking natural systems, when considering the dynamics of the microbiome."]
