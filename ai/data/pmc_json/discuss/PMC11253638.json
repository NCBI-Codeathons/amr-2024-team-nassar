["DISCUSSION", "The mitochondrial machinery facilitating ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation is a promising target for active compounds derived from microbial metabolites (9, 29). The natural compound strobilurin A was discovered in the wood-rotting basidiomycete fungus Strobilurus tenacellus, and synthetic strobilurin fungicides (e.g., azoxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl) were developed from \u03b2-methoxyacrylate through optimization of their photostability and activity (5). Although fungicides targeting mitochondrial respiration are the dominant chemical groups used in the market (30), it has been reported that strobilurin fungicides do not inhibit the respiration of several fungal pathogens, such as Magnaporthe oryzae and Botrytis cinerea, in which an alternative oxidase is activated (31\u201333). Respiration is maintained through an alternative pathway when strobilurin binds to cytochrome bc1 complex in the ETC (31\u201333). Due to issues of resistance and reduced effectiveness for these chemicals in several fungal pathogens, this study aimed to find natural resources exhibiting respiratory inhibitory activity. To this end, numerous microbial CFs were explored using a yeast screening system for their respiratory inhibitory activity. As a result, we found a soil-borne microbe B. brevis HK544 strain, and identified EB1 as an active compound for the respiration inhibition activity.", "Brevibacillus is a genus of bacteria reclassified from Bacillus based on the 16S rRNA sequence analysis (14). This genus has been considered a rich resource for antibacterial and antifungal activity with the isolation and characterization of many active compounds such as gramicidin S, tyrocidines, tauramamide, bogorols, and laterosporulin (14, 34\u201336). Most of the peptides produced by Brevibacillus have been known to damage the cytoplasmic membrane, but edeines exhibit a different mode of action from most Brevibacillus peptides (14). Edeines initially identified in B. brevis Vm4 are linear non-ribosomal peptides with a structurally unusual backbone that includes four non-proteinogenic amino acids and an N-terminal polyamine cap (37). This unique structure of edeines contributes to various biological functions, inhibiting the growth of numerous bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and tumor cells (38, 39). Furthermore, it has been reported that low concentrations of edeines inhibit DNA synthesis (22, 40). In contrast, high concentrations of edeine prevent translation initiation by inhibiting the binding of fMet-tRNA to the P site of the 30S ribosomes in prokaryotes (22, 41). Although significant progress has been made by the docking model between edeine and prokaryotic/eukaryotic ribosomes, relatively little is known mechanistically about the biological function of edeines, particularly against plant pathogenic fungi. In this study, EB1 exhibited a respiratory inhibition activity against the necrotrophic fungus F. graminearum with low ATP production and downregulation of ETC genes. Additionally, the deletion of FgSdhC1, one of the succinate dehydrogenase complex components in ETC, increased the sensitivity of F. graminearum to EB1. With previous reports that edeines inhibit protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes, our results postulated that EB1 inhibits the growth of F. graminearum by inhibiting mitochondrial translation. This hypothesis can be explained by the fact that some ribosome-targeting antibiotics can inhibit mitoribosomes, considering that mitochondria are of prokaryotic origin, and the bacterial and mitochondrial protein translation machinery share similarities (42, 43). Indeed, tetracycline binding to ribosome subunits has been reported to interfere with mitochondrial proteostasis, leading to changes in nuclear gene expression and altered mitochondrial dynamics and function in eukaryotes (44). When we calculated the predicted binding free energies with molecular dynamics simulations to compare the binding affinity of EB1 to mitochondrial ribosome and cytosolic ribosome, our results showed that the EB1 in the mitochondria ribosome exhibited higher binding affinity than cytosolic ribosome although the EB1 can bind to both ribosomes which were located in cytosolic and mitochondria (see Table S2). Therefore, our results cannot exclude the possibility that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by EB1 is a major byproduct of an antibiotic-target interaction.", "Biological control by antagonistic microbes, including yeasts, fungi, and bacteria, can be used to manage fungal diseases, and the BCAs can also solve the resistance and toxicity issues derived from chemical pesticides (10, 45, 46). Although numerous antagonistic strains of Brevibacillus spp. have been identified, most research has focused on in vitro antifungal activity with identifying active compounds, not disease control efficacy. In this study, we showed that the reduction of FHB by HK544 CF and EB1 ranged from 54% to 96% at the tested concentrations. Unlike the chemical fungicides triggering mycotoxins (16, 17), the HK544 CF reduced trichothecene production in the cultures, suggesting that B. brevis HK544 can decrease both fungal growth and trichothecene production. Furthermore, our observation that EB1 inhibited the fungal growth more effectively with the complex I inhibitor fenazaquin suggests that EB1 is a potent chemosensitizer. These findings provide further information for the effectiveness of its in vivo antifungal activity, given that the disease control efficacy of B. brevis HK544 seems to be insufficient when used alone. Considering that antifungal chemosensitization is a novel antifungal intervention strategy in which one drug is used to enhance the efficacy of conventional agents against fungal pathogens (46), our results suggest that B. brevis HK544 could be used in combination with chemical fungicides to enhance the efficacy of antifungal agents. Further research, such as the formulation of HK544, field trials with a mixture of HK544 and chemicals, and HK544 sensitivity analyses against chemical fungicides, will be necessary to prove the feasibility of the B. brevis HK544 as a chemosensitizer for FHB control.", "Regarding in vitro antifungal activity, we observed that EB1 is more effective against conidial germination than mycelial growth. Similarly, it has been reported that chemical fungicides targeting mitochondrial respiration exhibit better fungicidal activity against spore germination than mycelial growth in many filamentous fungi (16). For example, the mycelial growth of B. cinerea was less sensitive to the SDHI fungicides fluopyram and boscalid compared to conidial germination (47, 48). A similar dominant effect on the inhibition of spore germination has also been described from the QoI fungicides (16). This phenomenon can be explained by the differences in the target site sensitivity and physiological processes between spores and mycelia (49). Considering that SDHI and QoI fungicides target energy production in the mitochondria, and fungal spores have a lower metabolic activity with the transient softer cell walls compared to the growing mycelia, mitochondrial respiration inhibitors can lead to the different susceptibility between spores and mycelia (5). Therefore, we speculate that EB1 has a similar action with SDHI and QoI fungicides in inhibiting fungal development.", "In summary, our findings shed light on the in vitro antifungal activity of B. brevis HK544 and its major active compound EB1, with multifaceted evidence of respiratory inhibition. The promising results of the disease control efficacy in wheat heads infected with F. graminearum with the treatment of HK544 CF and EB1 highlight their practical potential in crop protection against pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, the synergistic interactions between EB1 and respiratory inhibitors, particularly complex I inhibitors, reveal novel opportunities for enhancing antifungal activity. Further research into the optimization of formulations and investigation of the activity spectrum could pave the way for the practical applications of HK544 containing EB1 as an effective biofungicide in agriculture."]
