["4. Discussion and Conclusions", "Succinylations as post-translational modification of proteins originating from bacteria, yeasts or animals were described in previous studies [50,51], whereas the modification in microbial secondary metabolite biosynthesis is a rather uncommon tailoring reaction. Examples of microbial natural products featuring succinyl substructures include the subtilin-like lantibiotic S-entianin [52], the lipopeptides cerexins [53] and succilins [54], the tetrahydroisoquinolines perquinolines A\u2013C [55], the nonpeptide hydroxamate siderophores desferrioxamine [8], the fungal macrolides A26771B and berkeleylactone [56], the 24-membered macrolide 7-O-succinyl macrolactin A [57] and succinylated derivatives of the subclass IId bacteriocin BacSp222 (suc-K20-BacSp222 and suc-K11/suc-K20-BacSp222) [47] (Figure 7). The perquinolines A\u2013C biosynthesis highlights a chemically interesting natural product assembly in which the biosynthesis is initiated by the condensation of succinyl-CoA and l-phenylalanine catalyzed by the amino-7-oxononanoate synthase-like enzyme PqrA [55]. In the course of the biosynthesis of the fungal macrolide antibiotic A26771B, the acyltransferase BerkE catalyzes the succinylation of the biosynthetic intermediate berklactone C to the succinylated intermediate berkeleylactone E [56]. The structural decoration of the 7-OH group of macrolactin A to its succinylated derivative O-succinyl macrolactin A is catalyzed by the a \u03b2-lactamase homolog BmmI, which could specifically attach C3\u2013C5 alkyl acid thioesters and also exhibit substrate promiscuity toward acyl acceptors with different scaffolds [57].", "Paralleling those aforementioned biosynthetic examples, the biosynthetic formation of the hydroxamate siderophores desferrioxamines involves the acyl-CoA-dependent acyl transferase DesC, which catalyzes the acylation of N-hydroxypentane-1,5-diamine (N-hydroxycadaverine) with succinyl- and acetyl-CoA to form N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-cadaverine (HAC) and N-hydroxy-N-succinyl-cadaverine (HSC) [58]. While for those natural product classes the catalysis of succinylation was identified by acyl-transferase-like proteins, the underlying succinylation mechanism of other natural product classes such as the subtilin-like lantibiotic S-entianin [52], the lipopeptides cerexins [53] and succilins [54] elusive at present.", "In summary, this study describes the discovery, isolation, full structure elucidation and a possible biosynthetic pathway of 1 which shows in contrast to previous naturally and semi-synthetically produced myxochelins a unique succinylation decoration on the primary amino group. Although the biological and iron-chelation function of the succinyl group of 1 remains elusive, we observed that the succinylation of 2 leads to a significant reduction in antibacterial activity. In silico genome analysis of the myxobacterium MSr12020 revealed the genetic origin of 1\u20133 and in vitro experiments display the possibility that 1 might be biosynthesized by non-enzymatic succinylation of 2 with the highly reactive intracellular metabolite succinyl-CoA. Further confirmation of this finding would hint towards interesting biological implications regarding the purpose of succinylation during the biosynthesis of natural products and as posttranslational modification. It seems that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic succinylations play a central role in living (micro)organisms [59], and future studies might provide a better understanding concerning the imposing consequences of these chemical modifications. Thus, the discovery and proposed biosynthesis of 1 from the myxobacterium MSr12020 provides an intriguing puzzle piece of natural product succinylation."]
