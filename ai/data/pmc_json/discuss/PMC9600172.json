["DISCUSSION", "It is now widely acknowledged that antibiotic resistance genes have most likely originated from antibiotic-producing bacteria, which had to protect themselves from the action of endogenously produced antibiotics (20). In this work, we identified in a Streptomyces sp. a new congener of the known antibiotic desertomycin A, designated desertomycin X, which is antibiotically inactive and only differs from the former by the presence of an N-succinyl group. This suggested that N-succinylation may represent a previously undescribed resistance mechanism. Although resistance genes are in most cases colocalized with the antibiotic biosynthesis genes, no such gene, which would presumably encode an N-succinyltransferase, was found in the desertomycin biosynthesis gene cluster. The search for a possible candidate led us to examine a BGC termed csb that specifies the biosynthesis of a cryptic siderophore. A putative GNAT family acyltransferase encoded by the csbC gene in this cluster distinguished itself from known N-acyltransferases that use acetyl-CoA as acyl group donor to modify and inactivate certain antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides (7). In particular, CsbC had an ca. 80-amino-acid-extended N terminus which contained a polyproline signature, a feature found only in homologous uncharacterized proteins encoded by similar BGCs in 3 Streptomyces spp. CsbC contains domains with similarity to the AAC(6\u2032) protein Rv1347c, which was suggested by Card et al. to be involved in both antibiotic resistance and mycobactin biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (17). However, neither role of the Rv1347c protein was experimentally verified in enzyme assays with acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA. We hypothesized that CsbC may be responsible for the N-succinylation of desertomycin A, which was confirmed via expression of recombinant CsbC in E. coli followed by N-acylation activity testing in vitro. Moreover, CsbC could efficiently N-succinylate structurally distinct antibiotics as well as some primary metabolites. Some of those, in which an amino group important for interaction with the molecular target was blocked via succinylation, lost all or most of their antibiotic activity. Acetyl-CoA, however, could not be used by CsbC as an acyl group donor as efficiently as succinyl-CoA in our experiments.", "Next, we tested the ability of CsbC to confer antibiotic resistance in vivo. Expression of the native, non-codon-optimized csbC in S. lividans did not lead to increased kanamycin resistance in this bacterium. This may be explained either by the lower pool of freely available succinyl-CoA in this bacterium under the conditions tested or by the low expression of the elongation factor P known to be essential for the synthesis of proteins with polyproline motifs (21). However, the fact that antibiotically inactive N-succinylated congener of desertomycin A was isolated from Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 suggests that CsbC is active in vivo and may contribute to the antibiotic resistance in natural environment. Notably, the recombinant CsbC was able to confer kanamycin and ampicillin resistance in E. coli, albeit only to a low level. In the experiment with kanamycin, it was apparent that IPTG-induced CsbC expression detrimentally affected the growth of recombinant E. coli BL21, most likely due to the overexpression of T7 polymerase (22), but maybe also due to the depletion of succinyl-CoA, which is a less abundant cellular metabolite than acetyl-CoA (23). Another explanation could be succinylation of primary metabolites, such as putrescine and ornithine (see the Results section), that would render them unsuitable for anabolic pathways. However, we did not observe such an effect in the experiment with ampicillin, which speaks in favor of the former hypothesis of succinyl-CoA depletion. (Kanamycin can accept four succinyl moieties, while ampicillin accepts only one.)", "Concentrations of antibiotics in natural, nonpolluted environmental samples, such as soil and water, are presumed to be very low, and the physiology of bacteria dwelling in these environments must differ significantly from that when bacteria are cultivated in the laboratory (24). Considering this, it seems plausible that csbC homologues, while encoding an essential part of the siderophore biosynthesis pathway, may at the same time confer antibiotic resistance in the natural environment. Targeting CsbC-like proteins for inhibition may thus have a dual effect on the viability of bacteria due to both the depletion of essential ions and prevention of the antibiotic resistance phenotype."]
