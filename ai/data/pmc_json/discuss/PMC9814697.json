["Discussion", "The present study elucidated the biochemical roles of selected enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of caprazamycin, particularly two nonheme \u03b1KG-dependent enzymes Cpz10 and Cpz15 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a030). Cpz15 that was previously assigned as a \u03b2-hydroxylase turns out to be the starter enzyme converting uridine mono phosphate (UMP) to uridine 5\u2032 aldehyde (U5\u2032A 9). In contrast, Cpz10 is the actual \u03b2-hydroxylase in a position to hydroxylate synthetic compound 11 to compound 12 in vitro, standing at a pivotal point to lead the biosynthesis toward caprazamycin. The importance of Cpz10 was parallelly examined in vivo using the in-frame gene-deletion mutant \u2206cpz10, by which the major product was determined to be compound 13 agreeing with the in vitro result that compound 13 lacks the \u03b2-OH group. Compound 13 carries two unexpected methyl groups at 6\u2032-amino and 7\u2032-carboxyl in addition to one ADR at 3\u2032-OH. None of compounds 13 and 14 was accepted by Cpz10, suggesting that \u03b2-hydroxylation takes place earlier than methylation, glycosylation and phosphorylation. Compound 11 is likely the physiological substrate for Cpz10; beyond that, Cpz10 oxygenates L-methionine to MSO as a sideline activity. MSO, a nonproteinogenic amino acid exhibits in N-acetylmureidomycin E, may be useful as a building unit concerning combinatorial biosynthesis as an approach to generate unnatural natural products (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01)61,62. In light of \u03b2-OH that bridges a long aliphatic side chain and permits the linear chain to form the seven-membered heterocyclic ring, the Cpz10-mediated \u03b2-hydroxylation appears to be the determining step in the biosynthesis toward the successful production of caprzamycin. Concerning compound 14, Cpz27 is the phosphotransferase to phosphorylate compound 13 at its 3\u2033-OH with a 3\u2033-phosphate group (compound 14). Based on protein blasting, there are 29 BGCs for the class of nucleoside antibiotics reported thus far, while only do caprazamycin, A-90289 and liposidomycins contain two putative kinases4. Cpz27 out of the two putative kinases is the one directing the formation of compound 14, while it conflicts with 3\u2033-phospho-caprazol that was previously reported to be the product. In contrast, Mur23 is determined to decarboxylate compound 11 that also contradicts to the report of Cui, Z. et al., in which they specified that Mur23 can only accept the substrate with 3\u2033-phosphate20,60. Given caprazmycin (2) and muraymycin (6), one can appreciate that compound 11 is a watershed, of which \u03b2-hydroxylation catalyzed by Cpz10 permits the heterocyclic ring formation and subsequent acylation to a fully-active caprazamycin or decarboxylation catalyzed by Mur23 otherwise leads the synthesis to muraymycin (Fig.\u00a07). To this end, we conclude that the \u03b2-hydroxylation of compound 11 takes place prior to 3\u2032-glycosylation, 6\u2032- and 7\u2032-methylation, 3\u2033-phosphorylation and the heterocyclic ring cyclization, and the formation of caprazol 8.Fig. 7Biosynthesis schemes of caprazamycin and muraymycin.A Compound 11 stands at a watershed, of which \u03b2-hydroxylation catalyzed by Cpz10 permits seven-membered diazepanone ring formation and subsequent acylation to a fully-active caprazamycin or decarboxylation catalyzed by Mur23 directs the synthesis otherwise toward muraymycin.

Compound 14* is compound 14 with a OH group at its \u03b2C position.", "X-ray crystal structures revealed that Cpz10 contains two irons (Fe1 and Fe2) in 12\u2009\u00c5 away from each other. Fe1 sits at the active center held by the His115, His160 and Asp117 triad together with \u03b1KG and a water molecule (Wt91; at the sixth coordinate) to form a tetragonal bipyramidal coordination, a typical geometry in the nonheme \u03b1KG-dependent protein family. Compound 11 is placed above the sixth coordinate with its pro-S H atom of \u03b2-carbon pointing toward the sixth coordinate, thus accounting for the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the Cpz10-mediated reactions. Nonheme \u03b1KG-dependent enzymes that contain two irons are not uncommon but often ignored42,63\u201365. The second iron (Fe2) does not appear in random but exists in a deliberately organized conduit ideally for electron/charge transfer. As a matter of fact, Fe2 is not confined in a fixed position but dynamically interacts with a constellation of residues in the tunnel; this observation is line with the NBO calculation. On top of that, EPR spectra reflect signal changes for both Fe2 (2.02 \u2192 1.97\u2009g) and Fe1 (4.75 \u2192 4.25\u2009g) in the absence or presence of substrates in the Cpz10-mediated reaction, echoing dynamic changes in electron/charge flow, oxidation status, coordination geometry, etc42.", "From the viewpoint of crystal field theory (CFT)66,67, the five-degenerate d-orbitals in FeII and FeIII are reorganized by the static electric field arising from the distribution of charges upon association with the coordinate residues, \u03b1KG, and dioxygen/water molecules. In the case of FeIII with octahedral molecular geometry, the crystal filed splits its five d-orbitals into two sets with different energy levels. The lower set, which is a collection of the three lower-energy orbitals of the dxy, dxz, and dyz, is referred to as t2g. The upper set, which consists of the two higher-energy orbitals of the dx2-y2 and dz2, is referred to as eg (refs. 68,69). From the quantum\u2013mechanical point of view70, five d-electrons in 3d orbitals of the FeIII are distributed in three different spin states, including low-spin (LS) state (S\u2009=\u20091/2), intermediate-spin (IS) state (S\u2009=\u20093/2), and high-spin (HS) state (S\u2009=\u20095/2), in these t2g and eg orbitals. The spin states of 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2 are assigned to electron-spin multiplicities, 2\u2009S\u2009+\u20091, of doublet, quartet, and sextet, respectively. The FeII has tetrahedral molecular geometry in which the splitting of 3d orbitals is the opposite of that in octahedral geometry, namely, three higher-energy orbitals of the dxy, dxz, and dyz are located above two lower-energy orbitals of the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\\rm{x}}}}}}^{2}}-{{{{{\\rm{y}}}}}}^{2}}$$\\end{document}dx2\u2212y2 and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{z}}}}}^2}}$$\\end{document}dz2 (refs. 68,69). The occupancies of the six d-electrons of FeII in the eg and t2g orbitals are as three spin states of 0 (LS), 1 (IS), 2 (HS) attributing to multiplicities of singlet, triplet, and quintet, respectively70. Indeed, on the basis of NBO results for Fe1 and Fe2, we conclude that another possible role of two iron cations is playing an essential role in an electron transfer process within the Cpz10. In this study, both complex structures and EPR examination have demonstrated that the second iron plays significant role to replace the succinic acid to new \u03b1KG. This new phenomenon not only controlling the reaction inhibitors but also accelerating the reaction. An important feature of iron that makes it appealing for biological redox processes is the easy one-electron interconversion of FeII and FeIII (ref. 71). This discovery in the caprazamycin biosynthetic pathway has important implications for our comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanisms of nonheme metal iron-dependent enzymes, which is in support of our previous quantum chemistry analysis where key components of caprazamycin contribute significantly to the high binding affinity with MraY5.", "In summary, the biosynthesis of nucleoside antibiotics has been studied to some extent while it is still far from completion8,72,73. The present study concludes that the \u03b2-hydroxylation catalyzed by Cpz10, a nonheme dioxygenase, plays a critical role governing the subsequent heterocyclic ring formation as well as the long aliphatic sidechain acylation toward full-blown bioactivity of caprazamycin. By contrast, the decarboxylation of the 6\u2032-N-alkylamine side chain catalyzed by Mur23, a PLP dependent decarboxylase, diverges the biosynthesis toward the Park\u2019s nucleotide subgroup. In conjunction with biochemical determination of other related enzymes, the in vitro, in vivo and biochemical/biophysical profiling has not only met our scientific interest with respect to the biosynthesis of caprazamycin but also paved a foundation for pathway engineering toward more effective nucleoside antibiotics in a way to help conquer the most formidable adversary multidrug-resistant pathogens that man is facing now."]
