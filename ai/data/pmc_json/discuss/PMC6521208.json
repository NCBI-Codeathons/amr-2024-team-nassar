["3. Discussion", "The original object of this study was to investigate the influence of glucose on cereulide production. It was found that the proliferation statues of strains only began to differentiate when they entered the stationary phase. Therefore, the primary changes generated by additional glucose incorporation were assessed in an expanded duration of this time point, from the late logarithmic stage (8th hour), stationary stage (16th hour), to late stationary stage (24th hour). The result at the first interval was consistent with the expectation; a higher productivity was gained with the addition of glucose. RT-PCR results revealed that this might be the direct consequence of the positive regulation on the genes participating in the non-ribosomal synthesis pathway. Even the mRNA level of cesA and ilvB were barely detected at the latter two sampling times, and the constant productivity in the control without glucose indicated that the early transcription was sufficient for the full activation of cereulide synthesis. Thus, the decreased productivity in a glucose condition at the 16th and 24th hour suggested that the existence of a negative effect was directly or indirectly caused by glucose.", "Interestingly, it observed that the decreased cereulide production corresponded with the obviously higher and lasting transcription of cesH; both a longer culturing time and the addition of glucose could magnify this phenomenon. This most likely indicated a repression role of cesH on cereulide production. Furthermore, the significant difference between the wild type and \u0394cesH strains in cereulide production was provided as phenotypical evidence for verifying the repression function of cesH. The deletion of cesH led to a dramatic increase in the cereulide yield. Meanwhile, an obvious decreased bacterial growth was observed in the mutant (Supplementary Figure S1). This might be triggered by metabolic burden due to the massive generation of cereulide, so that the substrates, which are also essential for plenty of physiological progresses, were exhausted.", "According to the bioinformatics prediction, the protein encoded by cesH was an alpha/beta fold hydrolase, moreover, an amphipathic alpha helix was identified in the secondary structure, which may mediate the membrane association for proteins lacking transmembrane regions [27]. A GFP co-expression assay verified that CesH was bound to the membranes. Together with the cellular location of cereulide, these results reminded us of the possible interaction between them, since cereulide has been found to be mainly reserved in membrane of emetic B. cereus [28]. This natural physical approximate was regarded as the fundamental of substrate-enzyme recognition. Although a domain (GO: 0000287), interpreted as the magnesium-binding site, was hit in the amino acid sequence, it was found that CesH could normally hydrolysis pNPC2, a universal chromogenic substrate for lipase/esterase, without requiring a co-factor. However, our results found that the ester bond of cereulide could not be cleaved by CesH in vitro, which might be attributed to the existence of detergent during incubation, as it could prevent the binding of the enzyme by surrounding the substrate as previously indicated [29].", "Tempelaars et al. showed that cereulide and valinomycin displayed an antimicrobial effect against the tested Gram-positive bacteria in alkaline circumstances, which, however, did not contain emetic B. cereus since it displayed less sensitivity to valinomycin and resistance to cereulide, most likely due to unidentified mechanisms [30]. As orthologs of cesH have been found in non-emetic B. cereus [31], the anti-bacteriostasis role of CesH was analyzed in B. subtilis. Our data showed that the growth of B. subtilis could only be inhibited by commercial valinomycin but not by extracted cereulide. As described by Tempelaars, a possible explanation is that the proton motive forces contributed by the transmembrane electrical potential of Gram-positive bacteria are only produced in alkaline circumstances, which are essential for biological events depending on the active or passive transport. When there was enough potassium in the environment, this inhibition could be relieved as both cereulide and valinomycin act as a K+ ionophore. Notably, the extracted cereulide was found to be rich in potassium via specific fluorescent probes (data not shown), although a desalting step was performed using a silico column. In following studies, valinomycin was treated as an alternative to cereulide since it shares a similar chemical structure, synthetic pathway and toxicology with cereulide and has often been used as an analogue in function analysis. Once the recombinant plasmid pHT315-cesH was transformed, a valinomycin resistance acquisition by B. subtilis 168 was observed in the microtiter plate (data not shown) and in the flask inoculation assays. To examine whether the mechanism of bacteriostasis neutralization effect was mediated by hydrolyzing, rather than by decreasing the affinity for valinomycin, metabolism assays of strains containing an intact cesH fragment were carried out and the concentration of residual toxin was determined by HPLC. It should be noted that the B. subtilis wild type owned an innate capacity of valinomycin consumption, which could also be speculated from the growth results, as both the OD value and the number of colonies started to rise at a certain time post valinomycin exposure. With the action of CesH, this toxin degradation was dramatically accelerated.", "Finally, studies on the possible catalytic mechanism were launched by reviewing the secondary structure of CesH. Despite missing one beta strand in the computer-assisted architecture (i.e., CesH had 7 beta strands whereas the normal alpha/beta hydrolase containing 8 ones), it was able to identify CesH as an alpha/beta fold protein [32]. Since enzymes belonging to this superfamily have evolved in a divergent mode, functional cores are usually individual residues, instead of certain conserved fragments or domains. Only the combinations and locations of amino acids are invariable in the members given their diverse catalytic activities [33]. Generally, these critical residues include an amino acid with the capability of performing nucleophilic attacks on target chemical bonds, which are frequently chosen from serine, cysteine, and aspartic acid. As the active site, it is in between the two glycines located between the third helix and the fifth strand, before this fragment is finally folded into a sharp turn in the tertiary structure, called the \u201cnucleophile elbow\u201d. As part of the catalytic machinery, it was thought to be involved in the formation of low barrier hydrogen bonds with the acidic partner of aspartic acid or glutamate, which was next to the seventh strand [34]. The transferring proton is finally accepted by the histidine preceding the last helix. According to the sequential order of all motifs in CesH, all of the candidates, as well as the penultimate histidine, were picked and converted into alanine via site direct mutation, and identification was accomplished by recording the diversity of cereulide analogue resistance. The consequence of substitution at glutamate 197 was nearly the same as that of H189A, displaying no effect. Furthermore, the negative effect of the mutation of E199A was not obvious as those of S86A and H227A. The possible reason was hypothesized in that the work of glutamate 199 could be partly fulfilled by the adjacent glutamate 197. This is corresponding to the predicted 3D structure of CesH (Supplementary Figure S2), since S86, H199, and E227 are proximal and placed in a pocket, whereas H189 is located at the surface of the protein. However, whether the effects of the deletions are due to improper folding remains unclarified. Furthermore, confirmation of glutamate also pointed out the esterase activity of CesH, which is usually an aspartic acid in other subfamilies [35].", "In summary, cesH could be translated into an esterase, while the activity against toxins was only demonstrated when it was expressed in vivo. Most likely similar to the mode of the antibiotic resistance gene, the role of cesH is to neutralize the adverse effects caused by cereulide on the ionophore-producing host itself. This property might contribute to its self-resistance and be necessary for expelling the competitive bacterium that prefers to occupy the same niches in the ecosystem [36]. From the aspect of physiological significance, this regulation shifted the equilibrium toward the side of branch amino acids. Additionally, it might be initiated once the harsh environment becomes suitable for growth, which was line with the alternation led by glucose addition. Corresponding mechanisms still need to be clarified."]
