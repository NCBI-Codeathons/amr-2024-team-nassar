["Discussion", "On the journey to decode the roles of XP natural products in mediating bacteria\u2013nematode\u2013insect interactions in the ecological niche, we previously carried out a metabolic exploration of 30 XP strains by rapid MS-based network analysis15. This revealed that the wild-type strains produce a plethora of natural products, most of which belong to the compound class of non-ribosomal peptides. However, in general, the MS-based network approach is constrained by (1) BGCs that are transcriptionally or translationally silent under standard laboratory conditions (for example, BGC expressions need to be in an insect-mimicking medium40,71 or under iron-limited conditions60) and (2) compounds that are membrane-bound (for example, aryl-polyene lipids34) and that are difficult to detect by standard LC/MS methods (for example, compounds that are extremely hydrophilic/hydrophobic, too small/large or poorly ionized/fragmented). Here, to overcome the limitations of the metabolic analysis, we take the \u2018BGCs first\u2019 strategy, because BGCs account for the genomic capacity of a strain for producing natural products (see also Extended Discussion in the Supplementary Information).", "All the XP species live in nearly the same ecological niche, but they harbour BGCs that are distinctive in terms of numbers and classes. For example, the number of BGCs in Xenorhabdus indica DSM 17382 is three times that in Xenorhabdus japonica DSM 16552. Photorhabdus temperata subsp. thracensis DSM 15199 features seven BGC classes, whereas X. japonica DSM 16552 only has three classes (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, we assume that such deviations among XP species are possibly indicative of a minimum number of required BGCs\u2014the highly conserved BGCs\u2014for XP to maintain their lifestyle adaptation. The ioc/leu BGC responsible for IOC (1) biosynthesis was present across all XP genomes, but none of the NRPS GCFs universally exist in every XP species, though the NRPSs are the most abundant class. Indeed, the ioc/leu BGC is also widely distributed in other \u03b3-Proteobacteria, such as the free-living pathogens Vibrio cholerae and Y. pestis (Supplementary Table 3). Although this BGC has yet to be studied in other microorganisms and the degree of structural conservation of IOC (1) among \u03b3-Proteobacteria is unknown, it is conceivable that the conservation of structural genes leuA\u2013D for l-leucine biosynthesis and iocS for putative lactonization can serve as an indicator that IOC (1) is highly conserved among \u03b3-Proteobacteria inhibiting eukaryotic proteasomes. The pxb BGC, as the most widespread PKS/NRPS hybrid GCF across XP, produces piscibactins (2 and 3) and photoxenobactins (4\u20138), both of which are structurally related to yersiniabactin but with different chain lengths and C termini. In contrast to the precise target-oriented biosynthesis of the yersiniabactin BGC, it appears that the pxb BGC is more diversity-oriented, although the biosynthetic machinery remains cryptic. Yersiniabactin, with high affinities for ferric iron, contributes to the virulence of human pathogens like Y. pestis and E. coli72. Our study showed that the pxb products are associated with the insecticidal activity of X. szentirmaii, but only piscibactin (3) and photoxenobactin D (7) retain metal-chelating abilities. This suggests that the other pxb products might be non-metal-chelation virulence factors against insects. In particular, photoxenobactin C (6) with a dithioperoxoate moiety is highly reactive and thus might account for the overall insecticidal activity. As GameXPeptides and lipocitides are insect immunosuppressants targeting different transduction pathways, both compound classes could synergistically contribute to a potent overall effect from which producer strains can benefit. The chemical structure identification and functional characterization of the most ubiquitous Xenorhabdus and/or Photorhabdus natural products have made substantial progress towards deconstructing the niche specificity of XP.", "XP adaptation to the harsh environment and competition against other soil microorganisms might be a driving force for selecting valuable BGCs that produce highly efficacious natural products. Combining the pangenomic and sequence similarity network approaches provides deeper insights into the BGCs responsible for natural product formation, and thereby allows more systematic inference of associations as to the underlying roles of widespread or unique natural products in the ecological niche. Such a combined approach can also be applied to microbiomes from other niches to narrow down the list of candidate BGCs that probably encode ecologically important natural products. With the functional characterization of the most conserved XP natural products, future detailed analysis of their targets, as well as potential synergistic/antagonistic interactions among different compound classes (for example, the synergistic immune suppression of GameXPeptides and lipocitides), might lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how XP orchestrate the interplay of natural products to maintain the symbiotic lifestyle."]
