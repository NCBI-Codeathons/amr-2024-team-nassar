["DISCUSSION", "Geobacter and Pseudomonas spp. are electrochemically active bacteria found to cohabit many of the same environments of ecological significance, including contaminated sites and wastewater streams (35, 38). In this study, assessment of their adaptive evolution using serial transfers in vitro enabled observations of real-time interaction dynamics and survival strategies, something not easily acquired through in situ experiments given the complexity of their environments and the presence of other community members.", "For all three Pseudomonas strains, PAO1, PA14, and the phz mutant, tested in cocultures with G. sulfurreducens, the Geobacter sp. population was dominant. Throughout time, Geobacter sp. dominance increased with coculture evolution. The increasing dominance of Geobacter spp. resembles a transition from initial syntrophy to a competitive interaction, where Geobacter spp. may be benefiting at the cost of Pseudomonas spp. Interestingly, isolation of G. sulfurreducens from the cocultures was not possible despite its dominance, suggesting a reliance on Pseudomonas spp. This was the case for both initial s0 and adapted s13 cocultures. Not only was G. sulfurreducens more dominant than was P. aeruginosa, but it also appeared to be more metabolically active, as indicated by FISH. Bacteria enter dormancy as a bet-hedging strategy and in response to various environmental factors, including nutrient limitation (58), competition (59), and antibiotics (60). Alternatively, their growth can be inhibited through contact-dependent inhibition or predation as an extreme response to limited nutrients (61, 62). It is yet unclear whether G. sulfurreducens inhibits P. aeruginosa growth, which would suggest possible predation, or whether P. aeruginosa ushers itself into dormancy in order to protect itself from the limited and competitive conditions (63, 64). This warrants further investigation, especially given the close relation of Geobacter spp. to the prokaryotic predators Bdellovibrio spp. that reside in similar environments and can prey on various Pseudomonas species (65, 66). Given that Geobacter and Pseudomonas spp. coexist in many oligotrophic and contaminated environments where Pseudomonas spp. are often less abundant than Geobacter spp. (33, 35, 37), we believe that their coculture interaction dynamics observed in this study may have ecological relevance.", "This study provides the first account for selection of tetR and fabI mutations in Geobacter spp. as a response to coculture evolution with P. aeruginosa. The consistent selection for tetR and fabI variants observed across all three cocultures and three biological replicates strongly suggests an adaptive evolutionary role of these mutations to the fitness of Geobacter spp. in cocultures with P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the observation that increased genetic frequency of the tetR frameshift variant mirrored the increased expression of downstream genes, GSU0950 and GSU0949, is in agreement with the predicted regulatory role of tetR within the TetR operon (40). The results described here show the propensity of G. sulfurreducens to undergo rapid adaptive evolutionary changes that may play a role in protection against competition with stresses created by P. aeruginosa, as Geobacter spp. become more metabolically versatile during coculture adaptation (39). Strong and rapid selection driven by a limited number of mutations has been observed in other work, where a single-nucleotide mutation of a regulatory gene confers rapid adaptive resilience to stress (23, 67, 68).", "TetR-regulated RND efflux transporters are important for antibiotic or toxic chemical efflux (41). Pseudomonas spp. are known to produce a vast array of antibiotics, including phenazines and quinolones, that have various antimicrobial properties on different bacterial species (31, 32). Recently, it was shown that P. aeruginosa itself uses the RND family efflux protein complex MexGHI-OpmD to secrete the PYO intermediate 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylate (5-Me-PCA) and thus enables self-resistance to this highly reactive compound (56). Besides phenazines, this same efflux pump can also export the toxic Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) precursor anthranilate (69), the antibiotic norfloxacin, and the toxic dye acriflavine (70), which demonstrates the wide range of substrates for this efflux pump. We found that one serial transfer of unadapted Geobacter spp. in PHZ-1-CA resulted in an increased MIC but did not correspond with the selection of tetR and fabI variants. Hence, it is likely that posttranscriptional or posttranslational modifications allowed for adaptation to Pseudomonas sp. PHZ-1-CA. In agreement with this, coculture of Geobacter spp. with a phenazine-deficient Pseudomonas mutant still resulted in the selection of tetR and fabI mutations. In future work, a comprehensive panel of P. aeruginosa antibiotics needs to be screened for their potential to drive selection of the tetR and fabI variants in order to rule out whether these variants arise as an antimicrobial response. In addition to GSU0949 RND efflux pump upregulation, the adenylate cyclase transporter CyaE (GSU0950) is also upregulated in response to adaptation with P. aeruginosa. Adenylate cyclases catalyze the synthesis of the second messenger, cAMP, and are commonly attributed to their toxic effects on eukaryotic hosts, as in the case of Bordetella pertussis and Vibrio cholerae (71). Their role in interactions with P. aeruginosa, however, requires further investigation, especially given the inability to isolate G. sulfurreducens from P. aeruginosa in the cocultures.", "This work demonstrates the complex interplay between syntrophy and competition that can occur between just two microbial species in a defined medium. Microbial communities can adapt mutually beneficial interactions often involving cross-feeding or exchange of electrons (72). Such interactions have commonly been found in methanogenic communities where syntrophy between methanogens, fermentative bacteria, and acetogens takes place (73). Furthermore, DIET allows the exchange of reducing equivalents between syntrophic microbial partners and has been found to occur in various environments and under lab culture conditions (2, 12, 23, 74). Although DIET appears as an initial form of syntrophy between G. sulfurreducens and P. aeruginosa, this interaction transitions to competition as G. sulfurreducens increases its utilization of formate. Our finding corresponds well with previous hypotheses that in a majority of cases, adaptation of two culturable microbial species leads to competitive rather than cooperative interactions, even in a medium designed for syntrophy (75). In this coculture, competition eventually supersedes syntrophy as Geobacter spp. adapt to utilize hydrogen and formate as electron donors. This can be a valuable lesson when evaluating the immense array of interactions that occur at the microbial community level in natural environments."]
