["DISCUSSION", "Members of the multicellular filamentous genus Streptomyces have an innate ability to self-aggregate in liquid-grown cultures. Because the multicellular mycelia are already connected, relatively little is needed for the neighboring hyphae to aggregate and start the formation of dense pellets. This propensity to self-aggregate into pellets contrasts with cells that undergo planktonic growth 436. Streptomycetes are the major producers of antibiotics and also produce a plethora of other medically relevant natural products as well as many industrial enzymes, and there is a strong correlation between the mycelial morphology in liquid-grown cultures and productivity 37. Enzyme production is typically favored by mycelial fragmentation 929, and it was shown that the Tat protein translocation machinery is located near apical sites 38. Conversely, production of erythromycin and actinorhodin requires a minimum mycelial pellet size 910. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that control liquid-culture morphology.", "In this study we investigated two major extracellular polysaccharides that play a crucial role in the ability of Streptomyces lividans to adhere. A polysaccharide produced by the recently discovered MatAB proteins was found to be poly-\u03b2-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG). Extracellular polysaccharides in the matrix of bacteria with a planktonic lifestyle play a major role in biofilm formation. Although many types of exo-polysaccharides are employed by different bacteria 3940, pathogenic bacteria often produce PNAG to adhere to their host 41424344. The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis also produces PNAG, suggesting that this EPS is abundantly present in natural matrices 45.", "The mat gene cluster resembles the PNAG biosynthetic gene cluster icaADBC from S. epidermidis, with the bifunctional MatB likely corresponding functionally to both IcaA and IcaB, forming an intracellular glycosyltransferase domain and an extracellular oligo-deacetylase domain, respectively. SCO2961, which is located directly downstream of matB, is an orthologue of icaC that might also play a role in formation of the mature polymer. The function of MatA is unclear as it lacks known functional domains, but as deletion of the matA gene reduces hyphal aggregation it may assist in efficient polymerization of the EPS, similarly to IcaD 46.", "The observation that deletion of either cslA or matAB results in the disintegration of pellets, suggests a certain degree of interdependence between the two systems, and also that each system is required for pellet formation. Although this cannot be ruled out completely, our data show that pellet formation can be restored to cslA mutants by the overexpression of matAB, strongly suggesting that sufficiently high production of PNAG can compensate for the absence of the cellulase-like EPS produced by CslA. This is supported by the observation that while pellet formation by wild-type mycelia are unaffected by the addition of dispersin B or cellulases, dispersin B is sufficient to disperse pellets of cslA mutants overexpressing matAB. This suggests that although PNAG alone is sufficient, both EPSs contribute to the robustness of the pellet structure. The simultaneous addition of both dispersin B and cellulases, which should degrade both EPSs, was not sufficient to fully degrade the EPSs, as the mycelia still showed the ability to aggregate. A possible explanation may be the different roles that both systems play in maintaining the integrity of the pellet. The adhesion assays described above showed different roles of the two EPS systems. PNAG biosynthesized by MatAB mediates adhesion to a (hydrophilic) glass surface, a fast process that occurs in overnight cultures. This is supported by our earlier work showing that matAB is perhaps more important for the aggregation of germlings than the cellulose-like matrix produced by CslA 30. Adhesion mediated by the CslA-dependent EPS to the hydrophobic polystyrene is slow, requiring a week-long assay. This is likely the result of a more complex system, which likely also involves the developmentally regulated amphipathic chaplin proteins 23. Chaplins also play a role in pellet formation, which is yet poorly understood. The chaplin-based hydrophobic forces might contribute to strengthening of the pellet. Earlier work indicated that the EPS produced by CslA/GlxA plays a role in stabilization of the tip complex 24, which might explain its pleiotropic involvement in multiple systems throughout the life cycle. We hypothesize that aggregation by PNAG may also depend on proper organization of the tip complex and the presence of the cellulose-like EPS. High resolution spatial co-localization studies of CslA/GlxA, the chaplins and MatAB in native pellets, should shed more light on the involvement and interplay of these systems in the control of the mycelial architecture. This is currently being investigated in our laboratory.", "Understanding how hyphal aggregation and pellet formation are controlled also brings us an important step closer to controlling the morphology of streptomycetes in liquid-grown cultures, which is highly relevant for tuning the morphology to product formation during industrial fermentations 3747 Antibiotics such as erythromycin (produced by Saccharopolyspora erythraea) and actinorhodin (by S. coelicolor) are produced solely when a minimum pellet size is achieved, while enzyme production is typically favored by fast growing and fragmenting hyphae 910. Previous genetic approaches were followed to tune mycelial morphology. Over-expression of ssgA, which controls hyphal morphogenesis and activates cell division 1112, effects fragmentation of the hyphae by enhancing cell division, resulting in increased growth and enzyme production rates 9. However, a drawback to this approach is the major effect of SsgA on the cell cycle, with enhanced sensitivity to shear stress as a result. In this respect morphological engineering targeting extracellular glue-like substances such as PNAG and the cellulose-like EPS, offers a very attractive alternative, as the effects on the internal physiology are likely minimal. Thus, besides their high relevance for our ecological understanding of how streptomycetes grow and attach to surfaces in their natural environment, the insights gained by this work may also help to develop novel technologies that improve growth and productivity of streptomycetes."]
