["DISCUSSION", "Poly(ADP)ribose polymerases are DNA nick sensors and have been proposed to play a critical role in the early detection and repair of Top1cc-induced DNA breaks (29\u201335,57\u201359). Top1 is an acceptor of PAR polymers (26,30), we describe here a new role for PAR polymers on Top1 nuclear dynamics, which is independent from Top1\u2013PARP1 interaction but dependent on PARP catalytic activity. We examine the effects of PARP inhibitors and/or in combination with CPT on EGFP-tagged-human Top1 subnuclear dynamics in living cells. Using a combination of live cell microscopy and FRAP kinetic modelling, we establish that orally bioactive PARP inhibitors (Veliparib, ABT-888) efflux Top1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. FRAP data reveals that combination of ABT-888 with CPT markedly increased the bound/immobile fraction of Top1 (Top1cc) across the nuclear genome compared to CPT alone. In an unprecedented finding, we conclusively demonstrate that EGFP\u2013Top1N722S are restricted to the nucleolus due to its deficiency in accumulation of CPT-induced Top1\u2013PARylation and Top1cc formation.", "The regulation of cellular Top1 mobility is only partially understood. Top1 is a dynamic protein in the nucleus and there is continuous efflux between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (23,24,56). The CPT induced nuclear redistribution of Top1 was suggested to be p53-dependent (56) or associated with SUMOs, which may induce translocation of Top1 from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm (25,60). The nucleolus is the subnuclear compartment that requires high rate of replication and transcription for ribosomal RNA synthesis (16). Therefore, Top1 is essential for the maintenance of rDNA supecoiling (61). Hence, we observed EGFP\u2013Top1 was predominantly confined to the nucleolus (Figure 1D and\u00a0E), which is consistent with the previous reports (23,24,56). Other than Top1, a high density of RNA Polymerase I (RNA Pol I) and a large number of chromatin associated proteins like PARP1, XRCC1, BRCA1, RNF8, Werner syndrome helicase, Bloom syndrome helicase and NBS1 are recruited to the nucleolus for the mRNA synthesis and maintenance of the rDNA (18,28,62,63). Consistent with the requirement of Top1 catalytic activity in rRNA synthesis, selective inhibition of RNA polymerase I with actinomycin D or inhibition of transcription with DRB (5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside) results in a rapid redistribution of EGFP\u2013Top1 from nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (18,56).", "The N-terminal region of Top1 (1\u2013215 aa) is highly charged, and harbours the nucleolar targeting regions as it forms complexes with nucleolin (64). Although this domain is dispensable for catalytic activity of Top1 in vitro, however is important for in vivo activity, interactions with cofactors and CPT sensitivity (10,15,53,56). Our live cell imaging with EGFP\u2013Top1 single point mutation (W205G) in the N-terminal region shows resistance to CPT-induced redistribution in the nucleoplasm (Figure 1E and\u00a0F) as well as CPT-mediated inhibition of the plasmid DNA relaxation activity (Figure 2F). Top1W205G mutant shows faster rate of fluorescence recovery compared to EGFP\u2013Top1WT (Figure 4C) indicating a significant increase in the mobile population (compare Figure 3C with Figure 4D) due to its weak association with DNA (10,12,15). Thus our live cell data provide evidence in favour of the conclusion that Trp205 helps in anchoring of Top1 on DNA (14,15). However, CPT was significantly deficient in trapping Top1W205G on DNA compared to Top1WT (Table 1; compare CPT-induced immobile fraction for WT versus W205G) as well as in the in vitro plasmid DNA relaxation assays (Figure 2G), suggesting Trp205 is critical for in vivo molecular interaction of CPT with Top1\u2013DNA cleavage complexes.", "PARP1 is responsible for the majority of cellular PAR formation (29\u201331). PARylation is a key PTM orchestrating a variety of cellular processes including DNA repair, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, mitotic segregation, telomere homeostasis and genome maintenance (29,65). Poly(ADP)ribosylation of ribosomal proteins is essential for nucleolar structure, ribosome biogenesis (66,67), rRNA synthesis (65,68) and epigenetic upkeep of the rDNA (63). PARP1 plays a crucial role in DNA damage response by controlling the nuclear localization and biological activities of DNA repair complexes and the conservation and stability of ribosomal genes (29\u201332,65). PARP1 is a key regulator of the single-strand break repair and base excision repair pathway and are backup pathway for the non-homologous end joining double-strand break repair pathway (29,30,32). Like Top1, PARP1 is also dynamic in the nucleus, unmodified PARP1 protein molecules bind to chromatin and accumulate in the nucleoli, upon automodification with poly(ADP-ribose), PARP1 dissociates from the chromatin template and facilitates the recruitment of other chromatin factors (29,30). Consistent with the role of PARP1 activity in rRNA transcription, inhibition of transcription or RNA polymerase I activity delocalize PARP1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (69). Cells exposed to CPT results in delocalization of both Top1 (Figure 1) and PARP1 (26,28) from the nucleolus to nucleoplasm. Because CPT failed to delocalize the Top1-mutants (W205G, N722S and Y723F) from the nucleolus (Figure 1E and\u00a0F) and ABT-888 markedly accumulates Top1 in the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A and\u00a0B), therefore the phenomenon of Top1 nucleolar delocalization is coupled with PARP catalytic activity (Figure 5A). However, our data suggests that PARP1\u2013Top1 interactions (Figure 5C) do not play a role in the delocalization of Top1 from the nucleolus. This is in keeping with the previous report indicating CPT-induced nucleolar delocalization kinetics of Top1 and PARP1 are not concurrent (26,28). Thus it is plausible that activated PARP1 catalyse Top1\u2013PARylation (27,39) (Figures 5C and\u00a07D), which facilitates Top1 catalytic activity (39,40) and turnover of the rDNA synthesis, as PARP1 and Top1 complexes are readily detectable in cells (Figure 5C). Consistent with this conclusion, our FRAP data indicates that both CPT and ABT-888 failed to show accumulation of Top1N722S-bound fractions (see the FRAP quantitation in Figure 6C and Table 1; N722S) as well as redistribution from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A) due to limited CPT-induced Top1\u2013PARylation (Figure 5C). Thus, we conclude that the PARylation of Top1 not only counteracts CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc but also recruits Top1 to the active site of rDNA and rRNA synthesis.", "Figure 7.Schematic representation of our findings regarding the Top1 dynamics in live cells and response to combination of PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) plus CPT as established by FRAP.

The potential ability of PARP inhibitors for trapping PARP\u2013DNA complexes in addition to their NAD+-competitive catalytic inhibitory mechanism accounts for the cytotoxicity in the proliferative cells (44). PARP trapping is critical when combined with temozolomide (45), while combination with Top1 poisons (CPT) is synergistic in killing cells due to inhibition of PARP catalytic activity (32,41,44,45). The present study provides new mechanistic insights into the action of PARP inhibitors in combination with Top1 inhibitors relevant for cancer chemotherapy. Using live cell microscopy in the presence of ABT-888 [PARP inhibitor with least potential in trapping PARP\u2013DNA complex; (41,44,45)], we show delocalization of Top1 from the nucleolus which results in increased Top1 density in the nucleoplasm. PARylation of Top1 counteracts CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc. Therefore ABT-888 markedly increased CPT-induced trapping of Top1 across the nuclear genome (Figure 7), which is associated with increased cytotoxicity in the proliferating cells exposed to the combination of PARP inhibitor with Top1 inhibitor (31\u201333,41,44\u201346). Indeed, (ADP)ribose polymerase appears to act as a key molecular determinant both for Top1 nuclear dynamics (present study) as well as Top1cc repair by recruitment of PARylated\u2013TDP1\u2013PARP1 complex at Top1cc damage sites (32,35,57\u201359). Thus, this study provides rationale for the combination of PARP inhibitors with Top1 inhibitors in cancer treatment, which is highly relevant for the ongoing clinical trials."]
