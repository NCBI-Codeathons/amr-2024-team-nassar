["Discussion", "Division of labor, where subpopulations perform complementary tasks simultaneously within an assembly, characterizes major evolutionary transitions of cooperation in certain cases (Babak, 2018). Unlike the diverse strategies for preventing obligate cheaters in cooperative systems (\u00d6zkaya et al., 2017; Smith and Schuster, 2019; Travisano and Velicer, 2004), division of labor requires an efficiency benefit and alignment of interests covering different specialized individuals (West and Cooper, 2016). For instance, compared with cells that produce a certain kind of public goods (e.g. ECM or extracellular hydrolases), the subpopulations that don\u2019t perform these tasks (but still share these benefits) become cheater-like individuals, and their proportion needs to be controlled for maintaining community stability and fitness (Martin et al., 2020; West and Cooper, 2016). In the present study, we demonstrated that during biofilm formation, the beneficial rhizobacterium B. velezensis SQR9 engages a policing system that coordinately actives ECM production and autotoxin synthesis/immunity, to punish the cheater-like subpopulation silencing in public goods secretion and restrain their proportion in the community (Figure 6). Importantly, the optimized division of labor not only facilitates ECM accumulation but also contributes to elevated production of other public goods including proteases and siderophore, thereby improving the community fitness under different stressful conditions and in plant rhizosphere (Figure 5), which could be defined as an effective strategy for enhancing cooperation and altruism. The coordination policing system suppresses subpopulation that stays in a fast-growing, motility phase (Spo0A-OFF state), to promote the population to a stationary, resource-mining phase (Spo0A-ON state) when the environment required (Figure 6). Our finding coincides with the phenomenon that Spo0A-dependent toxin killing of Spo0A-OFF cells in B. subtilis enhances biofilm formation and delays sporulation progress, which can be attributed to both eliminating of matrix-nonproducers and releasing of available nutrients (Gonz\u00e1lez-Pastor et al., 2003; L\u00f3pez et al., 2009c; Huang et al., 2021). It should be noted that the coordination system for optimizing the division of labor is relatively temperate than those for excluding obligate cheaters (\u00d6zkaya et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015), as only a subpopulation of the cheater-like individuals were killed (Figure 2); we think this scene is a balance between restraining the cheater-like subpopulation and retaining the advantages of cell differentiation (Babak, 2018; Kaern et al., 2005; L\u00f3pez et al., 2009c).", "Figure 6.A working model and ecological significance of the co-regulation policing system in B. velezensis.In certain conditions (e.g. environmental or self-produced clues, surface attachments, etc.), Bacillus cells can differentiate into Spo0A-ON (~moderate phosphorylated) and Spo0A-OFF (unphosphorylated) subpopulations. The Spo0A-ON subpopulation is cooperators that produce public goods for the community, such as ECM or proteases; simultaneously they express AccDA to produce malonyl-CoA as the precursor for BAs biosynthesis, and the endogenous autotoxin activates immunity-required transporter BnaAB to pump them out. Comparatively, the Spo0A-OFF subpopulation is cheat-like individuals that are silenced in public goods secretion, which are also disabled in malonyl-CoA production and BAs biosynthesis/self-immunity. Consequently, the cooperators-produced BAs can effectively eliminate the cheater-like nonproducers, thereby optimizing the division of labor and enhancing population fitness.", "A working model and ecological significance of the co-regulation policing system in B. velezensis.", "In certain conditions (e.g. environmental or self-produced clues, surface attachments, etc.), Bacillus cells can differentiate into Spo0A-ON (~moderate phosphorylated) and Spo0A-OFF (unphosphorylated) subpopulations.

The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa engages the QS circuit (LasR-LasI and RhlI-RhlR systems) to couple the production of public and private goods for placing a metabolic restraint on cheaters (Dandekar et al., 2012; Whiteley et al., 2017); the P. aeruginosa cooperators can also punish LasR-null social cheaters by producing cyanide, where cooperators acquire immunity from the QS system while cheaters are sensitive to this toxin (Wang et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2019). During biofilm formation and sporulation by B. subtilis, the global regulator Spo0A simultaneously induces the production of matrix and cannibalism toxins (Skf and Sdp); since genes responsible for toxin synthesis and self-immunity are simultaneously expressed, the matrix producers can be resistant to these toxins while the sensitive nonproducers will be selectively penalized (Ellermeier et al., 2006; Gonz\u00e1lez-Pastor et al., 2003; L\u00f3pez et al., 2009c). In the comparison of B. subtilis and B. velezensis SQR9, the similarity is that the global regulator Spo0A controls the synthesis of the ECM and the cannibalism toxin; the difference lies in the type of cannibalism toxin and its synthesis/regulation pathway. Specifically, the Spo0A-governed policing system in B. velezensis SQR9 is extremely unique: (i) The toxic BAs for punishment are novel antimicrobial fatty acids that firstly identified in strain SQR9, which mediate cannibalism and strongly inhibit the growth of closely related Bacillus strains; also its synthesis is encoded by a horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-acquired genomic island (Wang et al., 2019). (ii) Spo0A doesn\u2019t mediate the BAs production/self-immunity in a direct transcriptional regulation way, but activates AccDA for accumulating the precursor for BAs biosynthesis (a post-transcriptional manner; Figure 4). The accumulated BA precursor may induce the expression of BA synthetase genes; additionally, the self-resistance is mainly induced by intracellular BAs through a two-component system (Huang et al., 2021). Therefore, the foreign genomic island and the indigenous Spo0A regulation pathways, constitute an ingenious coordination system for punishing cheater-like nonproducers and enhancing clonemate cooperation.", "Relevant to how such a complex system could evolve, a possible scenario is a gradual evolution through transitional states. Perhaps homogeneous biofilm formation was the ancestral state, where all cells in the community are matrix producers (Khare and Shaulsky, 2006). Thereafter, heterogeneous biofilm raised as cells specialize in motile or matrix-producing subpopulations; it would be favored if the benefit of quickly responding to drop-in nutrients outweighed the cost of having cheater-like nonproducers that reduced the ability to form a biofilm (Hamilton, 1964; Smits et al., 2006; L\u00f3pez et al., 2009c; Joan et al., 2011; West and Cooper, 2016). Furthermore, the heterogeneous biofilm strategy provides the evolutionary context of sanctioning behavior (Acar et al., 2008; L\u00f3pez et al., 2009c; West and Cooper, 2016; Spratt and Lane, 2022). Interestingly, the genomic island responsible for BAs synthesis in B. velezensis SQR9 acquired through HGT, not only acts as a weapon for antagonizing closely related competitors (Wang et al., 2019), but also establishes a policing system for punishing cheater-like individuals within the biofilm community. Considering that bacterial biofilm is a major lifestyle in the natural environment (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004), the dual ecological benefits probably explain why this large cluster was integrated into the genome of strain SQR9; also this case can provide inspiration for discovering novel molecular regulatory mechanisms and understanding microbial evolution events (Strassmann et al., 2000). Alternatively, this sanction system can work in concert with a privatization strategy to collectively enhance cooperation during biofilm formation (Otto et al., 2020).", "In conclusion, the present study highlights the beneficial rhizobacterium B. velezensis SQR9 engages a policing system that coordinately actives ECM production and autotoxin synthesis/immunity, to penalize the cheater-like subpopulation silencing in public goods secretion, thereby enhancing the division of labor and community fitness. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism involved in controlling cell differentiation, as well as the ecological roles of the policing system, which deepens our understanding of the maintenance and evolution of microbial cooperation and altruistic behavior."]
