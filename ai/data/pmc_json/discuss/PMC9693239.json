["4. Discussion", "Albomycin \u03b42 belongs to the group of sideromycins, antibiotics covalently bound to siderophore fragments and penetrating into the cell through siderophore absorption pathways, implementing the so-called \u201cTrojan horse\u201d strategy [42].", "Albomycin, originally reported as grisein, were first isolated from soil from the soil-dwelling Streptomyces griseus in 1947 by S. Waksman and colleagues. It was also identified in Streptomyces subtropicus (previously known as Actinomyces subtropicus) by Gause and Brazhnikova in 1951, and their identity was confirmed later [43]. It is noteworthy that albomycin was also known as alveomycin, antibiotics A 1787, LA 5352 and LA 5937, and Ro 5-2667 in the literature [44].", "Albomycins have attracted significant attention due to their potent antibacterial activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant strains [45]. Moreover, no toxicity was observed during in vivo studies of albomycins, and it was well tolerated and safe up to a maximum dose evaluated in mice [41].", "The structure of albomycin and related compounds (\u03b41, \u03b42, and \u03b5) was fully established more than 30 years after the initial discovery [46]. Albomycins have a thioribosyl nucleoside moiety linked to an iron-chelating ferrichrome-type siderophore through a serine residue. The L-serine-thioheptose dipeptide partial structure, known as SB-217452, has been found to be the active seryl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor [39].", "The iron-chelator portion serves as a vehicle for the active delivery of the albomycin warhead inside both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial cells through the ferrichrome-specific transporter system. The formation of the active inhibitory form of albomycin, SB-217452, occurs intracellularly under the action of PepN peptidase (E. coli), which cleaves off the siderophore part. As a result, the toxic nucleoside part is accumulated in the cytoplasm of E. coli in ~500-fold excess over the concentration of the antibiotic in the medium [42]. This explains the fact that albomycin does not act on translation in a cell-free extract\u2014in such a system, there are no enzymes that cleave off the siderophore (Figure 4). Likewise, added directly to bacterial culture, the nucleoside portion of albomycin does not inhibit cell growth [42] since it cannot get inside the cells without the siderophore part.", "In the crops of Messor structor ants contained in laboratory conditions, we constantly observed mycelial bacteria of a certain phenotype, most closely associated with individuals from the soldier caste. A representative of this phenotype, strain 4-3, was identified using a polyphase approach as Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus.", "The members of Streptomyces are widely known for their ability to produce various antibiotic compounds and often in association with insects: ants, wasps, beetles [7]. According to the literature, Streptomyces globisporus was most often isolated from soils, plants and so on [47] but rarely from insects. There is an example of the Streptomyces globisporus SP6C4, which plays a significant role in the mutualistic relationship between pineapple strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) and bees (Apidae), protecting both the plant and the insect from pathogenic microorganisms, including the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea [48]. In addition, it is reported about Streptomyces globisporus WA5-2-37, isolated from the intestinal tract of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), produced actinomycin X2 and collismycin A, which showed great activity against MRSA ATCC 43300 [49]. This is the first reported naturally occurring strain of S. globisporus subsp. globisporus isolated from Formicidae.", "The genus Messor (Forel, 1890) is a moderately large genus, with more than 126 species worldwide recognized; they are mainly distributed in the Palearctic, Afrotropical and Oriental regions. Messor species are granivorous and play an important role in ecosystem maintenance and plant-seed dispersal. The harvesting ant, Messor structor (Latreille, 1798), is an ecosystem engineer in many dry biocenoses [50].", "The main food resource for harvester ants are grains of cereals and oilseed plants. Such seeds have a solid endosperm and require considerable effort to grind them. Representatives of the soldier caste have a large head\u2014the result of the development of massive occipital muscles responsible for the work of the lower jaw\u2014and powerful mandibles. They initially grind the seeds, and then smaller worker ants process the prepared pieces of seeds, since it requires less effort; turn them into flour; moisten them with saliva and uses them as food for the colony. Their saliva is dominated by amylase enzymes that break down starch [51].", "The greatest abundance of actinobacteria, isolated from soldiers and workers, which represent a conveyor for the production of food for the colony, may indicate a possible symbiotic relationship between ants and streptomycetes. Actinobacteria receive food and shelter, and in return produce a substance with a wide spectrum of action that protects the food resource of ants from spoilage. The ability of associated streptomycetes to synthesize albomycin can be extremely useful for hosts\u2014since harvester ants contact with soils and plants and encounter a large number of microorganisms, Gram-positive and Gram-negative, as well as fungi.", "As is known, albomycin \u03b42 is characterized by surprisingly low inhibitory concentrations for many pathogenic microorganisms: minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 5 ng/mL against Escherichia coli and 10 ng/mL against Streptococcus pneumoniae [52]. In our in vitro experiments, Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus 4-3 very actively suppressed the growth of various entomopathogens: Paenibacillus alvei VKM B-502, Bacillus thuringiensis VKM B-6650, Beauveria bassiana VKM F-1357 and Entomophthora coronata VKM F-1359 (Table S5), which can provide one of the forms of protection of the ant family health.", "A culture-dependent study of the actinobiome of a Messor structor colony, living under laboratory conditions, revealed the strains dominant in adult individuals from soldier and worker casts. All mycelial isolates demonstrated the same genotypic and phenotypic properties and were identified as Streptomyces globisporus subsp. globisporus. They produced protein synthesis inhibitor albomycin \u03b42, which was active against entomopathogens. The distribution of these actinobacteria among individuals from different castes suggests their essential role in maintaining the health of the ant family. The confirmation of this assumption, as well as the hypothesis about the methods of the transmission of strains between individuals, needs more detailed studies on a wider range of colonies of harvester ants living in formicaria."]
