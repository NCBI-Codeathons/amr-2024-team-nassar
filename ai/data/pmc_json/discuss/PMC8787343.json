["Results and Discussion", "Structural Elucidation", "A series of chromatographic methods were used for the isolation of monomeric compounds from the strain fermentation extracts, and diverse spectroscopic analyses were used for their structure elucidation. As a result, seven polyketides were isolated and identified, including one known compound, hymeglusin (1) (Kumagai et al., 1992; Tomoda et al., 1988), four new bis-alkenoic acid derivatives named fusariumesters C\u2212F (2\u20135), and two new alkenoic acid monomers named acetylfusaridioic acid A (6) and fusaridioic acid D (7). The absolute configuration of hymeglusin (1) was previously determined by chemical degradation method and Mosher method (Chiang et al., 1988). The optical rotation of hymeglusin (1) was {[\u03b1]19.4\nD 24.56 (c 0.2, CHCl3)} in our project, which reported in the literature was [\u03b1]22\nD 10.6 (c 0.1, CHCl3) (Kanaida et al., 2021).", "Compound 2 (fusariumester C) was isolated as colorless oil. Its molecular formula was determined to be C36H58O11 by HR-ESI-MS analysis (m/z 665.3909 [M \u2012 H]\u2012, calcd for C36H57O11, 665.3906, Supplementary Figure S9), suggesting eight degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum of 2 displayed characteristic adsorptions for carbonyl groups and carbon-carbon double bonds at 1,712 and 1,620\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. The 13C NMR data (Table 2) of 2 showed 36 carbon resonances, and all signals appeared in pairs. Moreover, each pair of the signals closely resembled those of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018). Additionally, comparing the molecular weight (666 Da) of 2 with twice that of fusaridioic acid A (342 Da) yielded a difference of 18 Da. Accordingly, 2 was speculated to be an esterified dimer of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018). Further detailed analysis of its NMR data (Supplementary Figures S3\u20138) supported this hypothesis. Based on the literature report (Liu et al., 2018), two 13C NMR signals at \u03b4\nC 167.7 and \u03b4\nC 167.8 were obviously assigned as carboxylic acid carbonyls connecting to quaternary olefinic carbons, while signals at \u03b4\nC 173.8 and \u03b4\nC 172.4 were assigned as aliphatic carboxylic acid carbonyl groups or ester carbonyl groups. The methines at \u03b4\nC 68.8 and \u03b4\nC 68.9 were attributed to hydroxy-substituted ones. The two methylenes at \u03b4\nC 62.6 and \u03b4\nC 59.4 were assigned to be oxygen-bearing ones, and the small difference between their chemical shifts may due to the formation of an ester bond for one of these two carbons. The 1H NMR data (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3) of 2 revealed four olefinic proton signals at \u03b4\nH 5.56, 5.63, 5.71, 5.69. Detailed HMBC correlations associated with these four above-mentioned protons established the presence of two pairs of diene moieties conjugating with terminal carboxyls (the fragments from C-1 to C-6, and from C-1\u2032 to C-6\u2032, Figure 2). The 1H NMR data of 2 also showed two overlapped doublets (\u03b4\nH 0.78 and 0.79) of methyls in the high field region (Supplementary Figure S3). Starting with these two above-mentioned methyl signals, two similar aliphatic carbon chains [7-Me(C-6)/C-7/C-8/C-9/C-10/C-11/C-12/C-13/13-CH2O and 7\u2032-Me(C-6\u2032)/C-7\u2032/C-8\u2032/C-9\u2032/C-10\u2032/C-11\u2032/C-12\u2032/C-13\u2032/13\u2032-CH2O, Figure 2] were deduced based on a combined analyses of its HSQC and 1H\u20131H COSY spectra. Lastly, the key HMBC correlations from the proton at \u03b4\nH 4.13 (one proton of 13-CH2OR) to the carbons of C-12, C-13, C-14 and C-14\u2032 demonstrated that two molecules of fusaridioic acid A were dimerized via the ester bond built by 13-CH2OH and the carboxylic acid group at C-14\u2032 (Figure 2). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was elucidated.", "FIGURE 2Key HMBC, 1H\u20131H COSY and ROESY correlations of compounds 2\u20127.", "Key HMBC, 1H\u20131H COSY and ROESY correlations of compounds 2\u20127.", "The configurations of the four double bonds in 2 were revealed by the analysis of its ROESY spectrum (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S8). However, the 1H NMR data of 2 were helpless for the determination of its stereochemistry because of signal overlapping. For the stereochemistry of reported mono-/bis-alkenoic acid derivatives, the configurations of C-7 (7\u2032) and C-13 (13\u2032) were conserved to be 7R (7\u2032R) and 13S (13\u2032S) (Liu et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019), while the configuration of C-12 (12\u2032) turned out to be 12 (12\u2032) R or 12 (12\u2032) S (Liu et al., 2018). Recently, it was reported that the configurations of fungal polyketides were conserved in general with few exceptions (Takino et al., 2021). Therefore, in view of the shared biosynthetic pathway of mono-/bis-alkenoic acid derivatives, as well as previous literature reports (Liu et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019), the configurations of C-7 (7\u2032) and C-13 (13\u2032) in 2 were supposed to be 7R (7\u2032R) and 13S (13\u2032S), respectively. Compared with the 13C NMR and 1H NMR chemical shifts of C-12 (12\u2032) in the dimers reported in the literature (Liu et al., 2018, Supplementary Table S1), the absolute configurations of C-12 (12\u2032) in compound 2 were determined to be 12R (12\u2032R). In this way, the chemical structure of 2 was identified as shown in Figure 1. Since three similar alkenoic acid dimers were given the trivial names of fusariumesters A1, A2, and B (Liu et al., 2018) previously, compound 2 was named as fusariumester C.", "Compound 3 (fusariumester D) was isolated as colorless oil. Its molecular formula was confirmed to be C36H58O10 by HR-ESI-MS data (m/z 649.3952 [M \u2012 H]\u2012, calcd for C36H57O10, 649.3957, Supplementary Figure S16), indicating eight degrees of unsaturation. The molecular weight of compound 3 (650\u00a0Da) was lower than that of compound 2 (666\u00a0Da) with a difference of 16\u00a0Da. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 closely resembled those of 2 (Table 1 and Table 2), and the comparison of their 1H and 13C NMR data (Supplementary Figures S10,11) indicated a methyl (13\u2032-Me) in 3 instead of a hydroxymethyl (13\u2032-CH2OH) in 2. This hypothesis was confirmed by HMBC (Supplementary Figure S13) correlations from protons of 13\u2032-CH2OH to C-12\u2032, C-13\u2032, and C-14\u2019 (Figure 2). Analogously, a group of HMBC correlations from the proton at \u03b4\nH 4.14 (one proton of 13-CH2OR) to C-12, C-13, C-14, and C-14\u2032 proved that 3 shared the same esterified dimerization way as 2.", "Compound 4 (fusariumester E) is a colorless viscous oil. Its molecular formula was determined to be same with that of 3 based on the HR-ESI-MS analysis (m/z 649.3959 [M \u2012 H]\u2012, calcd for C36H57O10, 649.3957, Supplementary Figure S23). The 1H and 13C NMR data of 4 and 3 were highly similar (Table 1 and Table 2). The most striking differences between their 13C NMR data were that chemical shift of 13-CH2OR was upfield shifted from 62.9\u00a0ppm in 3 to 60.4\u00a0ppm in 4, and the chemical shift of C-12 was downfield shifted from 69.0\u00a0ppm in 3 to 71.7\u00a0ppm in 4. In view of the same molecular formula shared by 3 and 4, this phenomenon implied that 4 might possess a different dimerization site. Key HMBC correlations from H-12 to C-10, C-11, C-13, C-14 and C-14\u2032 certified that an ester bond was built in 4 with the carboxylic acid group in one monomer at C-14\u2032 and the hydroxyl at C-12 in another monomer (Figure 2).", "Compound 5 (fusariumester F) was also isolated as colorless oil. Its molecular formula was speculated to be C36H58O10 by HR-ESI-MS analysis (m/z 649.3956 [M \u2012 H]\u2012, cald for C36H57O10, 649.3957, Supplementary Figure S30). Comparing the 1H and 13C NMR data of 5 with those of 2\u20134 (Table 1 and Table 2) predicted 5 also to be a bis-alkenoic acid derivative but decorating with another new esterified dimerization way. A vital HMBC (Supplementary Figure S27) cross peak of H-12/C-1\u2032 defined that the hydroxyl at C-12 in one monomer and the terminal carboxylic acid at C-1\u2032 contributed to the dimerized ester bond in 5.", "Compound 6 (acetylfusaridioic acid A) was isolated as colorless oil. Its elemental composition was determined to be C20H32O7 by HR-ESI-MS analysis (m/z 383.2074 [M \u2012 H]\u2012, calcd for 383.2075 C20H31O7, Supplementary Figure S37), indicating five degrees of unsaturation. Its 1H NMR and HSQC data distinctly showed two olefinic protons (\u03b4\nH 5.59 and 5.71), two oxygenated gem-protons (\u03b4\nH 4.11 and 4.15), and four methyl groups (three singlets at \u03b4\nH 2.14, 1.96, 1.74, and one doublet at \u03b4\nH 0.79). Three down-field shifted carbonyls (\u03b4\nC 173.2, 170.3, 167.7), four olefinic carbons (\u03b4\nC 152.4, 140.7, 129.2, 118.3), one oxygen-bearing methylene (\u03b4\nC 62.5), and four methyl groups (\u03b4\nC 20.7, 19.3, 18.1, 19.1) were observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 6. Examination of its detailed 13C NMR data with those of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018) suggested that 6 was the product of acetylation at 13-CH2OH in fusaridioic acid A. Key HMBC (Supplementary Figure S34) correlations from protons (\u03b4\nH 4.11 and 4.15) of 13-CH2O moiety to the carbonyl (\u03b4\nC 170.3) of the acetyl group supported this deduction (Figure 2). Like compound 2, the configurations of C-7 and C-13 in 6 were supposed to be 7R and 13S based on a thought of conserved biosynthetic logic. And the C-12 (12\u2032) absolute configurations in compounds 3, 4, 5, and 6 were determined to be 12R (12\u2032R), 12S (12\u2032R), 12S (12\u2032R), and 12R, respectively, by comparisons of their proton NMR data of H-12 (12\u2032) with literature reports (Supplementary Table S1).", "Fusaridioic acid D (7) was found to possess the molecular formula C18H30O5 from the HR-ESI-MS data (m/z 325.2023 [M\u2012H]\u2012, calcd for 325.2020 C18H29O5, Supplementary Figure S44), corresponding to an unsaturation index of four. Detailed analyses of its 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1 and Table 2) revealed that 7 is one of the monomers involved in compound 3. That\u2019s to say the chemical structure of 7 is a dehydroxylation product of fusaridioic acid A (Liu et al., 2018). This hypothesis was further proved by key HMBC (Supplementary Figure S41) correlations from a methyl (\u03b4\nH 1.26) to C-14, C-13, and C-12 in 7 (Figure 2). By referring to the 13C NMR and 1H NMR chemical shifts of known compounds with similar structural units, the absolute configuration of C-12 in compound 7 was determined to be 12S (Supplementary Tables S1) (Ying and Hong, 2007; Bisek et al., 2008).", "Evaluation of Antifungal Activity", "The rough antifungal activity of compounds 1\u20137 were measured by the filter paper agar diffusion method (Xu et al., 2015). Compounds 2\u20137 showed no significant inhibitory activity against C. albicans, and only compound 1 could inhibit C. albicans (Supplementary Figure S49). The MIC value (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of 1 against C. albicans was then determined by broth microdilution techniques (Yu et al., 2016), using nystatin (MIC = 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) as the positive control (Supplementary Figure S46). As the previous references reported the antifungal activity of alkenoic acids against plant pathogens (Liu et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019), all the isolates were also submitted to an antifungal assay against three agricultural pathogenic fungi, Exserohilum turcicum, Curvularia lunata, and Fusarium oxysporum. As a result, only compound 1 showed a good inhibitory activity against E. turcicum, with an IC50 value (21.23\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) significantly lower than the positive control, cycloheximide (IC50 = 46.70\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) (Supplementary Figures S47,48). Except for hymeglusin (1), none of the isolated alkenoic acid derivatives could suppress the growth of tested pathogenic fungi. Therefore, it could be concluded that the \u03b2-lactone ring was a key moiety for the antifungal activity. Just as the previous reports, the antifungal activity of alkenoic acid derivatives is always accompanied by the appearance of the \u03b2-lactone ring (Liu et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019). It was reported that the \u03b2-lactone ring played a key role in inhibiting fungal HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) synthase activity (Greenspan et al., 1993; Tomoda et al., 2004; Skaff et al., 2012)."]
