["DISCUSSION", "The global spread of antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent problems of humanity. The production of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes represents the particularly important molecular fingerprint of resistant strains. Hence, the detailed atomistic description of the molecular mechanisms of the operation of antibiotic kinases is essential for targeting antibiotic resistance by specific inhibitors and antibiotic analogs protected against the respective kinases. Here, we found a unique subfamily of AmiN-like kinases with an exceptional affinity for the substrate and provided its detailed phylogenetic, structural, and functional description. The described mechanism of AmiN operation based on substrate-induced closure of the active site was observed for small-molecule kinases (22, 24\u201327). Moreover, our multiscale QM/MM simulations revealed that the homologous enzymes\u2014N-acetylhexosamine, spectinomycin, and choline kinase\u2014display an enhanced phosphotransfer in a closed conformation as a result of a better gamma phosphate positioning toward a phosphoacceptor (Fig. 6). The kinetic restriction of substrate promiscuity stems from the described substrate-driven closure mechanism in the case of small-molecule kinases, while AmiN kinase represents the prime example. The novel AmiN kinase is a member of a previously unknown subfamily that evolved to phosphorylate a distinct substrate representing the first evidence of a specialized phosphotransferase bioscavenger. AmiN was initially annotated, automatically (28) as a homoserine kinase, and we consider that the number of misclassified antibiotic resistance enzymes with unique specificities and enzymes with unusual mechanisms (29) is very extensive. This substantially challenges the precise prediction of resistomes (30). The comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary landscapes and biodiversity of antibiotic resistance enzymes along with the detailed atomistic descriptions of the resistance mechanisms will improve both the prediction of antibiotic resistance threats and the development of targeted strategies to prevent them (31).", "Fig. 6The closed form provides more efficient phosphotransfer both in AmiN and related kinases.The energy profiles of the phosphotransfer chemical stage are presented for the closed (blue, solid line) and open (orange, dashed line) form of kinases.
