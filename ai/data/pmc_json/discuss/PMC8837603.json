["Discussion", "Sequencing of A-domain PCR amplicons from soil metagenomic libraries identified a number of sequences that we predicted arose from BGCs that use PABA monomers instead of alpha amino acids. The cloning and sequencing of one such BGC revealed the lap BGC, which we bioinformatically predicted would encode a N-acylated thiazole and PABA containing decapeptide, lapcin. To circumvent the challenge of decoding the lap BGC using biological processes, we produced lapcin by total chemical synthesis. Lapcin is a dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitor that inhibits the growth of diverse cancer cells. Topoisomerase inhibitors are clinically validated targets for anticancer therapy35. While there are currently no topoisomerase inhibitors in clinical use, topoisomerase poisons are used in the treatment of a number of cancers including, breast, lung, testicular, and prostate, with a number of additional candidates in clinical trials36,37. Lapcin is structurally distinct from any previously identified topoisomerase inhibitor (including poisons and catalytic inhibitors), providing a different structural class to investigate as antineoplastic agents. Between the non-cancerous HEK293 cell line control and most susceptible cell lines we tested, there is over 3 orders of magnitude difference in IC50 (Table\u00a01), suggesting that lapcin has a sufficient therapeutic window to explore its utility as an antineoplastic agent in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, lapcin is the first NPRS derived N-acylated or thiazole containing PABA-based natural product.", "The number of uncharacterized sequenced BGCs, whether derived from cultured bacteria or metagenomes, is rapidly increasing. Unfortunately, the rate at which the instructions contained in these BGCs are converted into chemical entities remains very low. Our discovery of lapcin confirms that a syn-BNP approach represents a viable alternative strategy for generating even complex classes of biomedically relevant molecules from uncharacterized BGCs. Traditional natural product total synthesis efforts have almost exclusively focused on characterized bioactive natural products. Syn-BNP methods provide a alternative paradigm where targets for total synthesis are structures that are bioinformatically predicted from silent BGCs. Lapcin provides a key proof of principle example of a syn-BNP approach being able to generate a previously unknown small molecule whose potency rivals that of natural products produced biologically."]
