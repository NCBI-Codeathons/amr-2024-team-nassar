["Discussion", "Besides P. aeruginosa (67), several other pseudomonad species including P. chlororaphis and P. synxantha make the phenazine PCA (38, 68, 69). However, among these species, P. aeruginosa is unusual in its ability to produce methylated phenazines (35). Out of the variety of P. aeruginosa phenazines, those that are methylated have the most dramatic effects on biofilm matrix production and morphogenesis (34), antibiotic tolerance (31, 70), and\u2014as shown in this study\u2014metabolic activity. In this context, it is interesting that, as indicated by our findings, phenazine methylation is linked to global regulatory pathways that respond to carbon source identity and abundance. Phenazine production itself is a carbon- and nitrogen-consuming process (71), but in addition, methylated phenazines\u2014which have relatively high redox potentials and reactivities\u2014in particular have the effect of oxidizing the cytoplasm and activating cellular defense mechanisms including the expression of efflux pumps (70, 72\u201374). Because nutritional conditions affect the cellular carbon/nitrogen balance and could serve as proxy signals for environments in which these mechanisms contribute to fitness, it could be beneficial for P. aeruginosa to control phenazine methylation so that it occurs when specific types of carbon sources are available (75).", "Fig. 5 A and B depict models of the integrated effects of RpoS and the CCR pathway on metabolic activity and survival in PA14 biofilms. The two-component system CbrAB, which functions as the first step in the pseudomonad CCR pathway, is sensitive to carbon source identity but its precise activating signal has not been described. Several studies have suggested that the CbrA-activating signal is intracellular and representative of the carbon/nitrogen balance (52, 64, 76, 77). Once activated, CbrA transfers a phosphoryl group to CbrB, which binds directly to the crcZ promoter and recruits RpoN-containing RNA polymerase to stimulate transcription (52). The sRNA CrcZ binds and sequesters Crc/Hfq, allowing translation of phzM mRNA and thereby promoting phenazine methylation (47). In WT PA14 biofilms (Fig. 1) metabolic activity is supported by oxygen available at the biofilm-air interface and by methylated phenazine available at depth in the hypoxic/anoxic region. In \u0394rpoS and \u0394crc biofilms (Figs. 1B and 4A) metabolic activity is enhanced throughout the biofilm due to increased production of methylated phenazine. In the \u0394crc and \u0394rpoS backgrounds, this enhanced metabolic activity apparently comes at a cost as evidenced by increased sensitivity to phenazines (Fig. 4B and C). Experiments in liquid cultures have indicated that the methylated phenazine pyocyanin is toxic to producing cells that are starved for carbon (33). Indeed, the fact that we observe maximal metabolic activity at a depth of ~30 to 50 \u00b5m, rather than at the biofilm\u2013air interface, hints at the presence of an electron donor/carbon source gradient emanating from the biofilm base. Crc has also been shown to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the activation of oxidative stress pathways (66). This suggests a tradeoff may exist in biofilms between the self-preservation of oxic cells and the potential metabolic activity of cells in hypoxic/anoxic regions of the biofilm, balanced by the dampening of phenazine methylation by RpoS acting via the CCR system.", "Fig. 5.RpoS affects pyocyanin production via the CCR pathway and is simultaneously beneficial for survival and detrimental for metabolic activity in distinct biofilm subzones. (A) Scheme depicting the regulatory relationship between RpoS activity and phzM translation. High RpoS activity indirectly inhibits production of the sRNA CrcZ, liberating the Crc/Hfq complex, which in turn represses phzM translation. When RpoS activity is low, crcZ is transcribed and the CrcZ sRNA binds to and sequesters the Crc/Hfq complex; this allows phzM translation to proceed. (B) Model depicting the differential effects of methylated phenazines in the oxic and hypoxic/anoxic subzones of a biofilm. We propose that methylated phenazines are toxic in the oxic subzone, due to low nutrient availability and the reactivity of phenazines with oxygen, and that cells in this region benefit from RpoS\u2019 activities, including its role in dampening phenazine methylation. Cells in the hypoxic/anoxic subzone, in contrast, benefit from phenazine methylation because methylated phenazine (specifically PYO) serves as an alternate acceptor of cellular reducing equivalents and support metabolic activity. NADH is shown as a representative carrier of cellular reducing equivalents.

The mechanism of this inhibition is unclear but could arise from the effects of the RpoS regulon on P. aeruginosa metabolism; this regulon includes genes involved in primary metabolic pathways and RpoS activity could stimulate a shift in the P. aeruginosa metabolome that is sensed by CbrAB (18, 24). An alternative explanation could be that RpoS inhibits crcZ expression by competing with RpoN for binding to the RNA polymerase. However, previous analysis of sigma factor deletion strains does not show correlative positive associations between expression of RpoS-dependent genes in rpoN-deletion strains, nor vice versa (24), suggesting that this is not the mechanism of RpoS-dependent crcZ repression. Regardless, we have observed that phenazine methylation is limited by an RpoS-dependent inhibition of crcZ expression at the surface of P. aeruginosa biofilms. Because methylated phenazine contributes to metabolic activity in the hypoxic/anoxic biofilm subzone, RpoS\u2019 effects \u201ctrickle down\u201d to this region. RpoS- and Crc-dependent inhibition of methylated phenazine production in biofilms may therefore represent a physiological tradeoff that limits toxicity at the biofilm-air interface at the expense of metabolic activity at depth."]
