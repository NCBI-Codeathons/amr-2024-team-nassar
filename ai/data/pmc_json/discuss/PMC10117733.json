["Discussion", "A variable DNA content", "We found the quantities of DNA recovered from the various cryosols to be highly variable, from >10\u00a0\u00b5g/g to 0.02\u00a0\u00b5g/g, thus a factor of 500 (Table S1, Supporting Information). Most of the low yielding samples are from ancient (subsurface) permafrost layers, albeit without a strict correlation with age. The Stanchikovsky Yar sample (B) exhibited a particularly high DNA content. However, once purified, the recovered DNA exhibited similar sequencing yields (i.e. number of reads/ng) and assembled into contigs of sizes similar to that of other samples (Table S1, Supporting Information). This suggests that the variation in DNA content is not due to its degradation, but reflects real differences in the global amount of microorganisms per gram of sample. Such a result is significant because it supports the hypothesis that genes encoded by the ancient DNA could be recycled within contemporary microorganisms through transformation.", "An unexpected increase of diversity with sample depth", "The nonpareil diversity (a good correlate of \u03b1-diversity and of the Shannon index) (Rodriguez-R et\u00a0al. 2018) was found to increase with depth for each of the three boreholes. This is in contrast to the trend previously reported for culturable permafrost microorganisms (Gilichinsky et\u00a0al. 1992). As argued by Abramov et al. (2021), microorganisms trapped in permafrost do not multiply and, because of gradual death, their diversity is expected to decrease over time. They claimed that, although growth as subzero temperature remains possible for some microorganisms (for instance, Panikov and Sizova 2007, Mykytczuk et\u00a0al. 2013), the nutrient level and diffusion is too low to sustain growth as seen in the laboratory. The trend exhibited in our data between age and diversity is thus probably due to actual variations in diversity between syngenetically trapped microbiomes.", "Scarcity of eukaryotes", "A striking finding of our taxonomic analyses is the very low representation of eukaryotic organisms, only present in trace amounts in all our samples except for two deep samples (R, N) (Figs S3 and S5, Supporting Information). This result is unexpected given the fact that the warm spring\u2013summer period sees the growth of a dense vegetation cover, accompanied by a variety of mosses and fungi, and a proliferation of insects, which should leave lasting traces in the metagenome of permafrost, once buried. Furthermore, the most abundant bacteria we found belong to the order Rhizobiales, which are often in symbiosis with plants. The Siberian permafrost harbored also members of Burkholderiales (6% in average, up to 27%), Chitinophagales (3% and up to 9%) and Cytophagales (0.7%), all of which are enriched in fungal\u2013bacterial networks (Bonito et\u00a0al. 2019). A previous culture-based study of Siberian, Canadian and Antarctic permafrosts estimated the count of fungal cells around 102 per gram of dry soil, distributed among 49 species (Ivanushkina et al. 2005). As fungi are in form of spores in permafrost (Vorobyova et\u00a0al. 2001), part of their diversity might remain unseen because of difficulties to extract their DNA. The proportion of eukaryotic cells might also be much lower than that of bacteria. In such case, their sequencing coverage might be insufficient to assemble contigs of a least 5 kb\u00a0in size. The larger size of eukaryotic genomes, the presence of introns and their lower coding density due to large intergenic regions also strongly decrease the likelihood of their identification by similarity searches in protein databases. However, k-mer-based read classification (Fig. S3B, Supporting Information) is consistent with an overall low proportion of eukaryotes. The remaining possibility is thus that eukaryotic DNA is rapidly recycled into microbial DNA during the seasonal decomposition process that takes place in the superficial active layer before being perennially frozen in deeper permafrost.", "Variable bacterial community composition", "As expected, bacteria constituted most of the DNA sources (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). Compared with barcoding methods, metagenomics allows an exploration of the sample diversity that is, in principle, only limited by a threshold of minimal abundance for a given species. This threshold results from three main factors: (i) the proportion of cells (or viral particles) of a given species (mostly unicellular) in each sample, (ii) the efficiency with which their DNA can be extracted (e.g. sporulating vs nonsporulating species) and (iii) our capacity to identify them by sequence similarity searches in reference databases. The last factor involves variations in protein-coding density (high in viruses and prokaryotes, much lower in most eukaryotes except for some fungi and protozoans), the fraction of the database corresponding to known members of the various phyla (high for Bacteria, much lower for viruses and Archaea), the level of sequence divergence among homologues within different domains (very high in viruses, lower in eukaryotes). Thus, even for a similar coverage (i.e. number of redundant reads per genome position) in a metagenomics mixture, bacteria are more likely to be identified than archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, viruses being the least likely to be identified (i.e. taxonomically unclassified). The comparisons of organism frequencies across domains are thus much less reliable than within a given domain. Yet, the predominance of the bacterial domain is unlikely to be due to a bioinformatic/annotation bias. To estimate the abundance of a given group we used the sum of coverages of the contigs attributed to the group. In theory, a better estimation would have been the number of attributed reads relative to the genome size (Nayfach and Pollard 2016). In the absence of information on the genome sizes, the sum of coverages thus remains a good approximation.", "Globally, the phyla found to dominate the microbiomes in our cryosol and permafrost samples do not differ from those already reported as most abundant in previous analyses of temperate soils (Janssen 2006) or permafrosts (Tripathi et\u00a0al. 2019, Xue et\u00a0al. 2019). Those are Proteobacteria (40%), Actinobacteria (22%), Bacteroidetes (10%), Firmicutes (9%), Acidobacteria (5%), Planctomycetes (4%) and Chloroflexi (3%) (Fig.\u00a02). However, even the most common phyla do exhibit very different proportions between samples: 76\u20139% for Proteobacteria and 59.7\u20131.4% for Actinobacteria (Fig.\u00a02). We noticed that the same phyla dominate both in the surface cryosols and the permafrost sample except for members of the Firmicutes that are mostly found below the surface (<1.3% at the surface, up to 28.5% in permafrost). In contrast to a previous study (Tripathi et\u00a0al. 2019), we did not detect a significant amount of Crenarchaeota. On the opposite, we detected Bathyarchaeota, absent from this same study (Fig. S4, Supporting Information).", "The high taxonomical variability depicted here confirms that no significant mixing occurred between the distinct microbiomes of the permafrost layers, in particular for the Q, M, O samples extracted from the same borehole (Figs\u00a02 and\u00a04). The weak clustering of samples L, N, R and samples P, K using the Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity might solely reflect the influence of the soil type or environmental conditions shaping bacterial communities.", "Although dead cells would result in altered DNA and thus a lower efficiency of sequencing and assembling large enough contigs, it remains possible that most of the bacteria identified in our study might be dead. A previous metagenomic study of ancient Alaskan permafrost estimated that only 15\u201318% of cells were alive. However, the DNA depletion to remove dead cells did not significantly changed the relative proportion of bacterial groups (from phylum to family) or the phylogenetic diversity (Burkert et\u00a0al. 2019).", "There is a growing concern that taxonomy alone is insufficient to interpret the complexity of soil processes (Baldrian 2019) given the already high diversity of metabolisms and lifestyles encountered in a given bacterial group. A good example of such a difficulty is the presence of Anaerolineales species in all our samples (Fig.\u00a03). Although their anaerobic metabolism is consistent with life in deep permafrost, all known isolates exhibit optimal growth temperature in the 37\u201355\u00b0C range (Sekiguchi et\u00a0al. 2003, Yamada et\u00a0al. 2006) or come from hot environments (Konishi et\u00a0al. 2012). On the other hand, these detected Anaerolineales species appear to cohabit with close relatives to known psychrophilic bacteria such as Devosia psychrophila and Dyadobacter psychrophilus, the presence of which is not unexpected in cryosols.", "Thawing permafrost as a source of ARGs", "Our study indicated the presence of the four main classes of \u03b2-lactamases (Ambler 1980), the evolution of which can rapidly lead to ESBL in the context of strong antibiotic selection in clinical settings. Class A EBSL includes cephalosporinases and six types of dreaded carbapenemases (Sawa et al. 2020). Class B \u03b2-lactamases are metalloenzymes using zinc at their active center compared with a serine residue for other classes. They hydrolyze carbapenems and degrade all \u03b2-lactam agents except monobactams (Sawa et al. 2020). Class C \u03b2-lactamases derives from the ampC gene carried on the genome of many Enterobacteriaceae. Variants of these enzymes are known to reduce sensitivity to carbapenems (Sawa et al. 2020). Finally, class D \u03b2-lactamases, also known as oxacillinases (OXAs) evolved from degrading an extended spectrum of cephalosporins to hydrolyze carbapenems (Sawa et al. 2020). However, from their sequences alone (except for near 100% identical residues) it is impossible to predict the substrate range and the potential clinical risk associated with the diverse \u03b2-lactamases identified in our dataset.", "The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria carrying various types of \u03b2-lactamases has been previously reported in pristine Arctic and Antarctic surface cryosols and ancient permafrost (Allen et\u00a0al. 2009, D'Costa et\u00a0al. 2011, Petrova et\u00a0al. 2014, Perron et\u00a0al. 2015, Kashuba et\u00a0al. 2017, Van Goethem et\u00a0al. 2018, Haan and Drown 2021). However, these previous studies did not evaluate the proportion of bacteria carrying a \u03b2-lactamase gene or exhibiting a \u03b2-lactam resistance in the global population of soil bacteria, most of which are unculturable (or eventually dead).", "The number of identified \u03b2-lactamase genes was divided by the estimated number of distinct bacteria to obtain a normalized gene count. This original approach provides a biologically relevant quantification that can be generalized to target other enzymes and detect specifically enhanced metabolic features in prokaryotic communities. The usual approach normalizes the ORF count by the number of reads, and is less biologically relevant than the ORF count per bacteria.", "We found few previous studies against which comparing our results about the presence of \u03b2-lactamases in a quantitative manner. Almost all investigations of environmental \u2018resistomes\u2019 were performed on populations of culturable bacteria sampled near the surface and selected for their antibiotic resistance (e.g. Haan and Drown 2021). A few others were restricted to a given bacterial species (e.g. Escherichia coli) (Pormohammad et al. 2019). We found one study analyzing the proportion of \u03b2-lactam-resistant bacteria within different agricultural soils, untreated or amended with manure (Udikovic-Kolic et\u00a0al. 2014). This proportion was found to vary from 0.67% to 7.4% in untreated versus manure-amended soils. Most of these resistant bacteria presumably encoded a \u03b2-lactamase, thus in a much lesser proportion than found in our cryosol samples. Another metagenomic analysis of the distribution of ARGs in 17 pristine Antarctic surface soils estimated the relative frequency of ARG to all genes in the [1.3\u20134.4 10\u20135] range, which approximately correspond to 17% of soil bacterial encoding at least one ARG (Van Goethem et\u00a0al. 2018) (assuming an average content of 3850 genes per bacterium; diCenzo and Finan 2017). Moreover, this fraction includes all ARG (e.g. multidrug resistance efflux pump, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase/nucleotidylyltransferase, aminocoumarin resistant alanyl-tRNA synthetase, etc) of which \u03b2-lactamases only constitute a small proportion.", "The high proportion of \u03b2-lactamase-encoding bacteria found in our 12 cryosol samples initially appeared significantly greater than previously reported in the few publications concerning other pristine environments, undisturbed by anthropogenic activities. However, following the analysis of 434 supplementary datasets, the proportion of \u03b2-lactamases in our 12 samples came out near the average of its value for a variety of other soils, and for instance twice less than in some American agricultural lands (Fig.\u00a07). Other permafrost samples turned out to be richer in \u03b2-lactamase than ours, some even overlapping with the level of cultivated soils (Fig.\u00a07). The comparison of \u03b2-lactamase copy numbers between biomes revealed statistically significant differences (Fig.\u00a07). Thus, \u03b2-lactamases are not distributed evenly among diverse environments under the influence of unknown factors that remain to be identified in future studies.", "The function of \u03b2-lactamases in soil microbial communities is not clear, but our results might help building new hypotheses. Several soil microorganisms produce antibiotic \u03b2-lactams, including members of the Actinobacteria (e.g. Streptomyces species) (Ogawara 2016). It turns out that these bacteria are among the most abundant in the cryosol microbiomes (Fig.\u00a02). Among eukaryotes, fungi (also abundant in our samples, Fig. S5, Supporting Information) can also produce many complex \u03b2-lactam-related compounds. They are the original source of two foundational \u03b2-lactam antibiotics: penicillin and cephalosporin (Brakhage et\u00a0al. 2009). The high \u03b2-lactamase abundance might thus result from the selective advantage they confer to their bearers in the middle of a biochemical war between soil microbes.", "Alternatively, \u03b2-lactamase may also play a role in a less violent scenario, outside of the simplistic \u2018war\u2019 paradigm. Below the minimal inhibitory concentration, antibiotics may modulate bacterial gene expression, thus acting as signaling molecules rather than lethal weapons. In such context, \u03b2-lactamases might interfere with quorum sensing (Yim et al. 2007). Another possibility is that some of these genes encode a broader function (such as carboxylesterases or DD-carboxypeptidases active on \u03b2-lactams (Higgins et\u00a0al. 2001, Nan et\u00a0al. 2019, Pandey et\u00a0al. 2020) providing a fitness gain in addition to protecting against soil antibiotics).", "Unexpectedly, this study revealed a new potential danger, due to the abundance of \u03b2-lactamases found encoded in a large phyletic diversity of cryosol bacteria. The DNA from these permafrost bacteria, dead or alive, thus constitutes an immense reservoir of historical ARGs. Their transfer to contemporary pathogenic bacterial in a clinical setting might further contribute to the antibiotic resistance crisis, now considered one of the biggest public health challenges of our time.", "In a context of global warming, ancient permafrost becomes an antibiotic resistance flavored ice cream ready to be consumed without moderation by all passing bacteria."]
