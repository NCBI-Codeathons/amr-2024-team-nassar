["3. Discussion", "The microbiome encodes millions of cryptic small molecules that have evolved to recognize specific cellular targets and mediate health or disease [40,41]. Mining these microbiome-derived molecules will lead to the discovery of unique therapeutics and diagnostic biomarkers [42,43]. Here, we report the discovery of lactomodulin, a new microbiome-derived molecule with dual activity as a potent anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent that exhibits minimal cytotoxicity in contrast to conventional antibiotics. Given this unique functionality, we hypothesize that lactomodulin has an evolutionary role in enhancing the ecological fitness of the producer and enabling host colonization. Suppressing host inflammation is a prerequisite to creating tolerance and maintaining long-term symbiosis, while antibiotic function enhances competitiveness and allows the producer to exert control over the microbial population in the gut and/or to kill invading pathogens. Several examples have been reported that highlight these strategies in microbe\u2013host interactions [44].", "3.1. Lactomodulin Is a Promising Drug Lead for Further Development", "Our investigation of lactomodulin activity shows that it can suppress proinflammatory cytokines regardless of the etiology of inflammation. In our experimental design, we induced inflammation using co-infection with a pathogen or its purified toxin, in addition to TNF-\u03b1, which is known to stimulate a wide inflammatory cascade through activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [45]. The level of TNF-\u03b1 in the body increases in response to various inflammatory triggers, such as autoimmune diseases, trauma, and infection/sepsis [46]. These findings suggest that lactomodulin could have wide application in a variety of inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune conditions, gastritis, pseudomembranous colitis, and other infection-induced inflammation [47]. The antibiotic activity of lactomodulin against resistant strains, such as MRSA and VRE, is interesting, given that the current antibiotic resistance crisis is projected to kill 10 million by 2050, with the depletion of effective antibiotics and an increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria. MRSA and VRE are classified by the World Health Organization as priority pathogens [48]. MRSA is a public health threat; with the recent expansion in infection rates and the increased burden on healthcare, at least 80,000 infections have occurred in the US alone, and mortality rates are escalating [49]. Its dual functionality, combined with its lack of intense cytotoxicity, makes lactomodulin interesting for further development. We plan to further investigate lactomodulin, including studying its mechanism of action, developing a computational design of its shorter fragments, carrying out testing for maintaining/enhancing its activity or its cytotoxicity profile, and studying the probability of developing resistance.", "3.2. Microbiome-Derived Peptides Are Often Multifunctional with a Unique Mode of Action", "The few examples of functional peptides identified from the human microbiota show their unique functionality and their apparent evolved role in the recognition of specific cellular targets or combating host pathogens. For example, lugdunin is produced from commensal Staphylococcus lugdunensis in the nose and kills Staphylococcus aureus with a low probability of developing cross resistance due to the high selectivity of the discovered self-resistance mechanism [50]. In addition to its antibiotic activity, lugdunin increases immune stimulation by upregulating IL-37 and CXCL8/MIP-2 in human keratinocytes and recruiting monocytes and neutrophils in vivo [51]. Lugdunin exerts its antibacterial action without forming pores in the cell membranes, in contrast to the common mode of action of antimicrobial peptides. Specifically, it breaks down the electrical potential of the cell membrane through the translocation of protons across the membrane [52]. However, it is still not known whether lugdunin itself acts as an ion transporter. Another example of microbiome-derived peptides includes the identification of two peptides (HG2 and HG4) with potent anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity against MRSA infection in vitro and in a Galleria mellonella model [53]. HG2 and HG4 exhibited their activity by selectively binding to bacterial lipids, thus affecting membrane permeability and, in parallel, decreasing the concentration of ATP inside the cell [53]. However, this action is selective toward bacterial lipids over human lipids. Another proline-rich antimicrobial peptide derived from insects, named Api137, exerts antimicrobial activity by trapping the ribosomal release factors RF1 or RF2 in E. coli, which prevents ribosomal termination and, consequently, inhibits protein synthesis [54]. Following a computational drug design approach, a group of researchers developed antimicrobial peptides with broad activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Interestingly, these peptides not only disrupted cell membranes, but also modulated microbial gene expression by upregulating genes, such as those related to stress response proteins, virulence, or membrane integrity, while downregulating others, such as genes that encode transporter proteins [55].", "3.3. Microbiome Peptides Are a Promising Approach to Drug Development", "Microbial peptides are a promising avenue for drug discovery and development because of their highly specific cellular targets, complex mode of action, multi-functionality, and pharmacodynamic properties, which decrease the rate of resistance against them [56,57,58,59] compared to conventional antibiotics. Additionally, microbial peptides have the added advantage of exhibiting a synergistic effect when combined with other antibiotics. There is interest in developing microbiome-derived peptides as antibiotics because of their varied and complex mode of action, which decreases their rate of resistance [60,61]. However, the applications of these peptides extend beyond antibiotics to include many functionalities, such as antiviral, antifungal, and anticancer agents [62]. This wave of renewed interest is accompanied by the accelerated development of computational tools to compute the discovery of these peptides from microbial genomes [63,64,65,66], and to further optimize their formulation to decrease toxicity and increase their stability as drug leads [67] through chemical modification, novel designs, and new delivery systems [55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68]. Other studies have developed mathematical models to predict the antimicrobial activity and structure\u2013activity relationships of peptides from their tertiary structures [69]. A study computationally identified 2349 putative peptides and synthesized 216 individual sequences, and reported that 83% of these peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity, including against antibiotic-resistant pathogens [70]. Identifying the secreted chemicals that mediate the diverse functions of the microbiome is an appealing strategy that could impact the development of microbiome-based therapeutics and could be fully evaluated, tested, and optimized."]
