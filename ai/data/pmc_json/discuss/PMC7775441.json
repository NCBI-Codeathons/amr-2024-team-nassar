["Discussion", "Camptothecin biosynthesis in O. pumila hairy roots is dynamic", "Camptothecin is an important anticancer drug produced in a variety of unrelated plants. The market supply of camptothecin is currently provided by extraction from woody plants. O. pumila, a perennial herb, has recently been established as an alternative source of camptothecin. The hairy-root transformation system of O. pumila has been optimized for high camptothecin production and has been proposed as a major source of camptothecin for pharmaceutical markets7. The hairy-root system has a variety of features, such as rapid growth, elicitation ability, and free hormones33,34. To further optimize camptothecin production in O. pumila hairy roots, it is important to better understand the regulatory mechanism associated with camptothecin biosynthesis. However, there has been no research carried out on the dynamic changes in camptothecin biosynthesis over the cultivation period of hairy roots.", "In this study, the biomass of O. pumila hairy roots and the total yield of camptothecin gradually increased and stabilized after 50 days. Therefore, camptothecin accumulation in O. pumila hairy roots reached a peak at 40 days and then began to decline, whereas the levels of secreted camptothecin increased throughout the analyzed time period and represented 40% of the total camptothecin in the culture at 60 days. In accordance with the levels of camptothecin production in hairy roots, the expression levels of camptothecin biosynthetic genes rapidly increased for the first 40 days of cultivation and then decreased to almost no expression until day 60. The most drastic changes in expression among the camptothecin biosynthetic genes were observed for OpTDC and OpSTR, with up to 5.32-fold upregulation of OpTDC at 40 days. OpTDC and OpSTR are central biosynthesis genes involved in the camptothecin pathway. OpTDC is considered a rate-limiting factor in CPT biosynthesis, and suppression of OpTDC activity results in decreased production of camptothecin in O. pumila hairy roots11. Introduction of OpSTR into O. pumila hairy roots led to a significant increase in camptothecin production compared to that in a control line8. In addition, co-overexpression of STR and G10H from C. roseus resulted in CPT biosynthesis in O. pumila hairy roots7. These analyses show that camptothecin biosynthesis in O. pumila hairy roots changes over time. They further highlight that separate measurements of camptothecin concentration in hairy roots and liquid media are important for understanding camptothecin accumulation in O. pumila.", "OpWRKY2 regulates camptothecin biosynthesis by directly activating OpTDC", "By establishing a correlation between camptothecin production and the expression of the associated biosynthesis genes, a platform for the rapid identification of candidate transcription factors was developed. Here, the platform was focused on the WRKY TF family, one of the largest TF families involved in plant growth and development, including seed development, seed dormancy and germination, biotic stress, abiotic stress, development, senescence, and secondary metabolism13,35. In plants, WRKY transcription factors are divided into three groups based on the number of WRKY domains and the structure of the zinc fingers12,13. The WRKY group II proteins are further split into five distinct subgroups (IIa-e) according to their WRKY domains12,13. Recently, a number of WRKY TFs of different groups have been implicated in the regulation of plant secondary metabolites such as terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and alkaloids. In Solanum lycopersicum, SlWRKY73 (IIb) was shown to be involved in the activation of three monoterpene synthase genes36. In A. annua, the glandular trichome-specific WRKY transcription factor AaGSW1 (IIc) was shown to positively regulate AaCYP71AV1 and AaORA expression by directly binding to W-box motifs in their promoters and acting as a positive regulator in artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin production25. Moreover, AaWRKY1 (III) in A. annua was reported to promote the transcription of AaADS, AaCYP71AV1, and AaDBR2 and positively regulate artemisinin biosynthesis17. GaWRKY1 (IIa) in Gossypium arboretum was reported to regulate the production of sesquiterpenoid gossypol by activating the (+)-\u03b4-cadinene synthase (CAD1) gene37. In S. miltiorrhiza, both SmWRKY1 (III) and SmWRKY2 (I) were shown to positively regulate tanshinone biosynthesis by binding to a W-box in the SmDXR promoter and activating the central pathway gene SmCPS, respectively14,15. In Taxus chinensis, TcWRKY1 (IIa) was reported to regulate the biosynthesis of the diterpenoid anticancer drug Taxol38. In W. somnifera, WsWRKY1 (III) was shown to regulate the biosynthesis of triterpenoids by binding to W-box elements in the promoters of WsSQS and WsSQE18. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtWRKY23 (IIc) and AtWRKY44 (I) were reported to regulate the production of flavanols and proanthocyanin39,40. In addition, a positive regulatory role of CrWRKY1 (III) in CrTDC activity and tryptamine accumulation in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots was identified16. In Coptis japonica, CjWRKY1 (IIc) was shown to govern the expression of berberine biosynthesis41. In O. pumila, two WRKY TFs with regulatory roles in camptothecin biosynthesis have been identified. A negative regulatory role in OpCPR expression and camptothecin biosynthesis was reported for OpWRKY1 (III), and a slightly positive effect on camptothecin production was shown for OpWRKY3 (III)5,19. However, a core WRKY TF directly involved in the regulation of camptothecin biosynthesis has not yet been discovered.", "Here, all putative WRKY transcription factor genes of O. pumila were identified, and their pattern of coexpression with the camptothecin pathway genes was analyzed. A single TF gene, OpWRKY2, showed strong transcriptional overlap with the camptothecin pathway. Overexpression of functional OpWRKY2 resulted in increased camptothecin levels, and silencing of OpWRKY2 correlated with decreased camptothecin levels. These results suggested a positive regulatory role of OpWRKY2 in the camptothecin biosynthetic pathway. By detecting the expression of key enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway of camptothecin in transgenic hairy roots, it was shown that the expression of OpTDC was significantly upregulated in OpWRKY2-OE hairy-root lines. Accordingly, the expression of OpTDC was significantly decreased in OpWRKY2-silenced hairy-root lines. In O. pumila, OpTDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of tryptophan to form tryptamine, which is a key enzyme in the upstream pathway of terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis10. EMSA, Y1H, and Dual-LUC assays showed that OpWRKY2 could bind and activate a W-box in the promoter of OpTDC in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the expression level of OpCPR was increased slightly in OpWRKY2-OE hairy-root lines compared to the control. Thus, the levels of loganin and secologanin, which are pathway intermediates in the iridoid branch of camptothecin biosynthesis, also showed a slight increase when OpWRKY2 was overexpressed. Altogether, these results suggested that OpWRKY2 positively regulates camptothecin biosynthesis by binding to the W-box of pOpTDC and activating the expression of OpTDC (Fig. 8). In addition to the level of OpWRKY2, the expression levels of OpWRKY3, OpWRKY4, OpWRKY5, OpWRKY13, OpWRKY15, OpWRKY16, OpWRKY21, OpWRKY28, and OpWRKY34 also showed a gradual increase before day 50. Furthermore, the expression of some OpWRKYs, such as OpWRKY1, OpWRKY6, and OpWRKY9, gradually decreased and might negatively regulate camptothecin biosynthesis. Indeed, OpWRKY1 has been reported to negatively regulate the biosynthesis of camptothecin, while OpWRKY3 positively regulates the biosynthesis of camptothecin5,19. Therefore, it is effective to screen candidate regulatory genes based on their expression levels in different growth stages, and it is necessary to continue to study the regulatory functions and mechanisms of other possible WRKY transcription factors in camptothecin biosynthesis.Fig. 8Regulatory model of camptothecin biosynthesis by OpWRKYs.a OpWRKY2 positively regulates camptothecin biosynthesis by binding a W-box in the OpTDC promoter and activating the expression of OpTDC.

Out of five ERF TF family genes (OpERF1-5) that had been isolated and characterized from O. pumila hairy roots, one TF-encoding gene, OpERF2, has been shown to play a positive role in regulating the iridoid biosynthesis branch of camptothecin biosynthesis20. Moreover, the introduction of OpMYB1 into O. pumila hairy roots reduced camptothecin production and downregulated the expression level of OpTDC, suggesting a repressive function of OpMYB1 in camptothecin biosynthesis21. In addition, two WRKY TFs with regulatory roles in O. pumila camptothecin biosynthesis have been identified. In contrast to the direct positive regulatory role of OpWRKY2 in OpTDC expression shown here, OpWRKY1 had been implicated in the suppression of camptothecin biosynthesis by binding two W-boxes in the OpCPR promoter and repressing the expression of OpCPR, while a slight involvement in camptothecin regulation has been shown for OpWRKY3, which binds via one W-box in the OpCPR promoter (Fig. 8)5,19. In addition, camptothecin accumulation was reported to be significantly increased by plant hormones such as salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in CPT-producing plants and cell cultures42\u201344. For example, camptothecin production increased under jasmonic acid treatment in cell cultures of C. acuminata42. Moreover, exogenous salicylic acid in C. acuminata seedlings promoted camptothecin biosynthesis43. In another CPT-producing plant, Ophiorrhiza mungos, cell suspension culture achieved significantly high camptothecin production with jasmonic acid elicitation44. Therefore, camptothecin accumulation is induced by hormone treatments. However, the effects of phytohormones on camptothecin accumulation in Ophiorrhiza pumila plants have not been reported previously, and we will further explore the effect of different plant hormones on the biosynthesis and accumulation of camptothecin in O. pumila."]
