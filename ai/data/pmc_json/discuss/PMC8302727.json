["Discussion", "Previous isotope feeding studies suggested a convergent biosynthetic pathway fusing two separate polyketides, and our current results built on this work establish a common ART biosynthetic pathway as depicted in Fig.\u00a02. Biosynthesis of the long polyketide chain is initiated by the standalone malonyl-CoA:ACP acyltransferase Art6, which loads a malonyl unit to the trans-AT PKS ACPs including ACPArt10 in the loading module. Subsequently, the O-MT Art28 triggers polyketide chain extension by catalyzing the methyl esterification of malonyl-ACPArt10. Among the 12 PKS modules in Art11-Art15, the ketosynthase (KS) domains of modules 1 (Art11KS1) and 12 (Art14KS4) were proposed to be KS0 domains with transthiolation instead of condensation activity: Art11KS1 lacks approximately 130 residues at its N-terminus, and Art14KS4 contains an Asn in place of the first His residue of the conserved Cys-His-His catalytic triad (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016). Substitutions of this His residue have been observed in several KS0 domains such as OzmH-KS832 and BaeKS38. We therefore propose that the malonyl methyl ester tethered on ACPArt10 is transferred to the ACP of module 1, methylated at C-2, and then elongated ten times by modules 2 to 11 to assemble the long polyketide chain. A final transfer to the ACP of module 12 allows dehydration to form the double bond between C-21 and C-22. We propose that biosynthesis of the short polyketide chain is initiated by Art2-catalyzed loading of a succinyl unit onto the first ACP of Art17. After C-methylation and two elongation steps, the short polyketide chain is condensed with the long chain to generate the ART polyketide skeleton, which then undergoes multiple cyclization and modification steps to furnish the unique 6/7/8/5-fused tetracyclic ring system. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the ART polyketide skeleton originates from a single large polyketide chain generated by Art10-Art17 following the co-linearity rule; this one-polyketide-chain biosynthetic model is shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a017. Further studies on the ART PKSs, especially on the KS domain of Art15 and the dehydratase Art16, will be conducted to determine which pathway is correct. We propose three subsequent tailoring steps to fashion ART A-D: Art24 performs glycosylation at 17-OH; Art4 adds a methyl group at C-30; and Art9 hydrolyzes the terminal methyl ester bond to expose the C1 carboxyl terminus.", "A striking feature of ART biosynthesis is the on-line methyl esterification initiation strategy, which is unusual for polyketide biosynthesis. Polyketide chain extension generally starts immediately after the starter unit is loaded; the initiation process includes preparation of the acyl-CoA starter unit (if it is not available from primary metabolism) and transacylation of the starter unit to the loading ACP12,14,33. However, in some cases the starter unit must be modified after being loaded onto an ACP in order to trigger polyketide chain extension. One classic example is on-line decarboxylation of the malonyl or methylmalonyl starter unit. In cis-AT modular PKSs, it is catalyzed by the N-terminal KSQ domain of PKSs34\u201337 (Fig.\u00a05a), while in trans-AT modular PKSs, it is performed by a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT)-like domain38,39 (Fig.\u00a05b). In addition, an on-line transamidation strategy has been proposed to initiate biosynthesis of glutarimide-containing compounds such as isomigrastatin and cycloheximide, although this mechanism requires further validation by in vitro studies40,41 (Fig.\u00a05b). Here we show that the malonyl-ACP O-MT Art28 represents an alternative polyketide initiation strategy, in which the malonyl starter unit undergoes an on-line methyl esterification prior to chain extension. This initiation logic installs a terminal methyl ester on polyketides, and in the case of the ARTs, the methyl ester is hydrolyzed by Art9 to expose the terminal free carboxylic acid as the last biosynthetic step (Fig.\u00a05b). Discovery of this malonyl-ACP methyl esterification initiation strategy expands the priming repertoire of polyketide biosynthesis and enables the discovery of 12 analogous natural product biosynthetic gene clusters by genome mining. Significantly, 11 of the 12 biosynthetic gene clusters possess an Art9-like esterase, indicating that most compounds generated via this initiation strategy have an unusual carboxyl terminus. We are currently exploring several Art28-Art9-type protection\u2013deprotection systems as synthetic biology tools for expedient elaboration of polyketide carboxyl termini.Fig. 5Selected initiation strategies involving on-line modification of the starter unit for modular PKSs34\u201341. a On-line modification initiation strategy for cis-AT PKSs. b On-line modification initiation strategies for trans-AT PKSs.\u00a0ACP acyl carrier protein, AT acyltransferase, KS ketosynthase, KSQ decarboxylating ketosynthase, KR ketoreductase, DH dehydratase, MT methyltransferase, GNAT GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase, MAT malonyl-CoA: ACP acyltransferase, AMT amidotransferase.", "Fig. 5Selected initiation strategies involving on-line modification of the starter unit for modular PKSs34\u201341. a On-line modification initiation strategy for cis-AT PKSs. b On-line modification initiation strategies for trans-AT PKSs.\u00a0ACP acyl carrier protein, AT acyltransferase, KS ketosynthase, KSQ decarboxylating ketosynthase, KR ketoreductase, DH dehydratase, MT methyltransferase, GNAT GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase, MAT malonyl-CoA: ACP acyltransferase, AMT amidotransferase.", "Selected initiation strategies involving on-line modification of the starter unit for modular PKSs34\u201341. a On-line modification initiation strategy for cis-AT PKSs. b On-line modification initiation strategies for trans-AT PKSs.\u00a0ACP acyl carrier protein, AT acyltransferase, KS ketosynthase, KSQ decarboxylating ketosynthase, KR ketoreductase, DH dehydratase, MT methyltransferase, GNAT GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase, MAT malonyl-CoA: ACP acyltransferase, AMT amidotransferase.", "The esterification status of the carboxyl termini is critical for biological activity: the methyl ester ART 9B exhibits no inhibitory activity, but the free acid analog ART B can inhibit Gram-positive bacteria by disrupting cell membrane and causing leakage of intracellular components18. Introduction of the methyl ester group at the beginning of ART biosynthesis and hydrolyzing it at the end is reminiscent of traditional chemical synthetic protecting group strategies, and may similarly serve to prevent the unusual carboxylic acid from engaging in unwanted side reactions during the biosynthesis. In addition, the methyl ester group may also protect the producing organisms (Bacillus is also Gram-positive bacterium) from toxic ART intermediates. As exemplified by ART 9B, which could not disrupt the cell membrane of S. aureus, methyl esterification of the ART intermediates may influence their interactions with cell membrane by changing their hydrophilicity statuses dramatically. Such a phenomenon was described previously for the ionophore antibiotic zincophorin, which also has a carboxyl terminus. The chemically synthesized zincophorin analog with a terminal methyl ester modification exhibited no antibacterial activity42. Once the ART \u2018pro-drugs\u2019 are activated, they may be pumped out immediately by the efflux proteins, Art3 and Art27. This assumption is supported by the facts that (i) Art9 is a membrane located esterase with a transmembrane region (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018); and (ii) ARTs are almost exclusively distributed in the fermentation broth but not inside cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019). Similar protecting group strategy has been observed during the biosynthesis of a number of natural products and versatile activation strategies have been recruited. For example, the \u2018pro-drug\u2019 of antibiotic xenocoumacin is activated via cleavage of an acylated d-asparagine by a membrane-anchored peptidase XcmG upon secretion43. In addition, zeamines44, colibactin45, and zwittermycin46 are also activated by post-assembly proteolytic processing; while calyculin47, oleandomycin48, and naphthyridinomycin49 are activated by dephosphorylation, deglycosylation, and oxidative processes, respectively.", "Methyl esterification of malonyl-ACP has also been observed in the biosynthesis of biotin. BioCs are isoenzymes of Art28, which hijack the fatty acid synthetic pathway by catalyzing methyl esterification of the malonyl group tethered to fatty acid ACPs50. As depicted in Supplementary Fig.\u00a020, the biosynthesis of biotin also involves a methyl ester hydrolysis step catalyzed by BioH. Although both biotin and ART biosyntheses are initiated by methyl esterification of malonyl-ACP, they differ in two key respects: (i) the malonyl-ACP methyl ester is processed by non-iterative type I PKSs in ART biosynthesis but by iterative fatty acid synthases in biotin biosynthesis; (ii) Art9 catalyzes an off-line hydrolysis to activate ARTs, while BioH catalyzes an on-line reaction to generate an intermediate pimeloyl-ACP. The similarities between fatty acid synthesis and type II PKS systems suggest the possibility of methyl ester initiation logic in the latter, but we have not found Art28-Art9 homologs in type II PKS gene clusters. However, such systems may yet be discovered by genome mining, while in the meantime, the results reported here should inspire synthetic biology efforts to generate novel polyketides incorporating terminal carboxylate groups51,52."]
