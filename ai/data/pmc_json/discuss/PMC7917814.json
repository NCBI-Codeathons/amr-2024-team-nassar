["4. Discussion", "Streptomycetes are a rich source of natural products. Genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolite are joined together in the biosynthetic gene cluster, and usually encode one or a few regulatory proteins. Cluster-situated regulator(s) directly control transcription of biosynthetic genes, acting as activators or repressors. Moreover, expression of the regulatory genes is under control of different higher-level regulatory systems. Such cascade regulation coordinates production of secondary metabolite accordingly to strain\u2019s physiology, developmental state, and environmental conditions.", "Unlike many gene clusters that encode only one single pathway specific regulator, the rsl-gene cluster harbors four regulatory genes. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins revealed three SARPs, RslR1, RslR2, and RslR3, and the MarR family transcriptional factor RslR4. SARP-like regulators usually activate a cognate biosynthetic gene cluster. They positively regulate transcription of biosynthetic genes and/or another SARP in the cluster.", "In this study, we investigated the impact of four cluster-situated regulatory proteins on biosynthesis of rishirilides. Inactivation of each SARP completely abolished production of rishirilides and intermediates of the pathway, whereas deletion of rslR4 revealed no distinct effect. Consistently, overexpression of rslR1, rslR2, or rslR3 in S. bottropensis led to an increase of rishirilides production. These results strongly suggest that these transcriptional factors function as activators, all influencing rishirilide biosynthesis.", "The presence of several SARPs in a gene cluster often goes along with a cascade of pathway-specific regulatory steps. This was shown for biosynthesis of tylosin, pristinamycin, and polymyxin [17,18,19,46,47]. Expression of rslR1, rslR3, and rslR4 remained at the same level in the wild type and mutants lacking one of the regulatory genes, indicating that their transcription is independent from the rsl-regulatory genes. In contrast, expression profile of the rslR2 gene in the wild type and in mutant strains revealed that its transcription is dependent on RslR1 and RslR3. The reduced expression of rslR2 in S. bottropensis \u2206R3 suggests that rslR2 is activated by RslR3. In contrast, RslR1 likely exerts a negative control on rslR2, as rslR2 transcription is increased in S. bottropensis \u2206R1. These findings are additionally confirmed by results of in vivo transcriptional analysis. Moreover, we also revealed RslR2 to be a self-repressor. The self-modulating activity of RslR2 could be explained by analogy to JadR1, a cluster-situated regulator from jadomycin biosynthesis in S. venezuelae. Upon binding of jadomycin, JadR1 activates the biosynthetic gene cluster and represses transcription of its own gene [48]. Analogous, rishirilides, or intermediates of the pathway may serve as ligands for RslR2 in a dose-dependent manner. In general, well-tuned regulation of rslR2 by RslR1 and RslR2 may help to maintain the biosynthesis of compounds at certain level, avoiding inhibition of strain growth. To further evaluate regulatory significance and investigate the exact role of RslR1 and RslR2, the recombinant proteins need to be produced and apply in experiments. Unfortunately, despite all our attempts, we failed to obtain these regulators in a soluble form.", "RslR3 might be the highest-level cluster-situated regulator acting on rishirilides biosynthesis. Based on the protein structure, its activity could be modulated by ATPase domain or phosphorylation governed by particular kinase(s). ATPase activity of the structurally similar regulators PolY and AfsR triggers polymerization of the proteins and enhance their DNA binding activity [19,39,49]. Moreover, in vivo experiments revealed that endogenous ADP/ATP pool affected PolY activity, indicating a possible sensor ability of the ATPase domain and its regulatory function in modulating protein activity in response to current physiological conditions [19]. In addition, an activity of AfsR was shown to be regulated by multiple kinases [50].", "Similar to PolY, RslR3 regulates transcription of another cluster-situated regulatory gene rslR2. The evidence that RslR3 did not bind to other promoter regions of rsl-transcriptional unit concludes that rslR2p is the only direct target of this regulator.", "To avoid self-inhibition by produced compounds, S. bottropensis encodes the regulator RslR4 to control an expression of the cognate exporter gene rslT4. Typical for MarR-like regulators, rslR4 is divergently oriented to its target rslT4 that allows specific binding of RslR4 to intergenic region between the genes to repress transcription of both. Indeed, in vivo transcriptional levels of both genes were upregulated in S. bottropensis \u2206R4 in comparison to the wild type strain. Negative autoregulation may prevent excessive accumulation of the regulator. This allows the keeping of narrow range of the protein concentration and results in more sensitive response to ligands.", "RslR4 modulates the expression of rslT4 in response to rishirilides and compounds from their biosynthetic pathway. The particularly interesting result is that both, the linear tricyclic intermediates (RSH-O5 and RSH-O9) and rishirilide-scaffold compounds interact with RslR4, and act as repression-relieving ligands. The ability to respond to pathway intermediates indicates that S. bottropensis cells initiate mechanism of self-immunity before the amount of synthesized end products reaches a critical level. This also suggests that intermediates are sufficient to trigger export and couple the mechanism of strain immunity to a biosynthetic pathway.", "Based on these findings, we propose the following regulatory scheme (Figure 7). Rishirilides biosynthesis requires expression of three cluster-situated regulators, RslR1, RslR2, and RslR3 since the individual gene deletions completely abolished the rishirilides production or any known pathway intermediate(s). The biosynthesis is likely triggered by RslR3, which is present in the cell pool, upon signal-induced activation of the protein. Regulatory control exerted by RslR3 is mediated through activation of rslR2 by direct binding to its promoter region. Most probably, rsl-genes are mainly regulated by the pathway specific regulator RslR2 together with RslR1. The transcription of rslR2 is negatively regulated by RslR1 and an autorepression mechanism, while the expression of rslR1 is likely activated by other regulatory elements of the cell. RslR4 is a repressor of the MFS transporter gene rslT4 and its own gene transcription. The end products and pathway intermediates release repression by RslR4 that results in production of RslT4, providing cells with resistance to the synthesized compounds."]
