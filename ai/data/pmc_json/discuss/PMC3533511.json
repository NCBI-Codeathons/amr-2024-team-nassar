["Discussion", "The bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of multidrug transporters contains very important resistance proteins that have evolved over a long period. In the present study, we characterized the function of OtrC, a putative ABC transporter, from S. rimosus and report that OtrC has major effects on the overproduction of OTC in S. rimosus.", "The multidrug exporter function of OtrC from S. rimosus", "The results of the amino acid sequence alignment analysis showed that OtrC contains a N-terminal ATPase activity-related conserved motif and a drug resistance activity-related motif at the C-terminal (Figure\n1). As the highly conserved LDEVFL motif of DrrA at the C-terminal was shown to be involved in doxorubicin efflux, this indicated that OtrC might also be associated with antibiotic resistance. The present results (Figure\n8) show that drug susceptibility levels to tetracycline, EB and floxacin were enhanced in strains of E. coli and S. rimosus that overexpressed OtrC compared to corresponding OtrC-nonexpressing strains, which were very similar findings to those published previously regarding DrrA and Msr-ORF1\n[4,17]. Additionally, we hypothesized that the low level of conservation of the amino acid sequence in the LDEADQLA motif of OtrC-ORF1 (Figure\n1) may be responsible for the consistently low sensitivity to erythromycin of OtrC-expressing cells.", "Figure 8The relative fold change of MICs of OtrC-expressing cells with different drugs compared to OtrC-nonexpressing cells. A: The relative change in the MIC of OtrC-expressing E. coli/pETC02 cells (gray) to ampicillin (A), rifampicin (R), oxytetracycline (O), doxorubicin (D), ethidium bromide (E), vancomycin (V), ofloxacin (Of), erythromycin (Er) and streptomycin (S), using the OtrC-nonexpressing E.coli/pET28a cells (light gray) as the controls. The relative change in MIC to the drug that could completely inhibit the cell growth of E.coli/pET28a was set as \u201c0\u201d, while the MIC of drug which could not inhibit the cell growth was set as \u201c1\u201d. Cells were grown in LB liquid medium supplemented with kanamycin, IPTG and different concentrations of test drugs at 37\u00b0C, and spun at 170\u2009rpm for 12\u2009h. Cells were then resuspended in fresh LB and spread immediately on the LB plates with kanamycin, IPTG and different concentration of the test drugs.

The relative change in the MIC to drugs that could completely inhibit the cell growth of M4018/pKC\u0394otrC was set as \u201c0\u201d, while the MIC of drug which could not inhibit the cell growth was set as \u201c1\u201d.

The former might be involved in drug export function, and the latter was identified to be involved in import function\n[19]. To verify the function of OtrC as a drug transporter in cells, the E. coli cells that overexpressed OtrC were given glucose, which resulted in the extrusion of EB rather than its uptake as was expected (Figure\n5). Furthermore, when the ABC transporter inhibitor orthovanadate was added, EB extrusion was not observed in the OtrC-expressing cells supplemented with ATP. This indicated that OtrC is responsible for the EB export activity in OtrC-expressing E. coli transformant. Hence, the drug resistance mechanism of OtrC could be based on ATP hydrolysis coupled with its transport ability.", "The OtrC-expressing E. coli transformant showed significantly enhanced susceptibilities to ampicillin, doxorubicin, OTC, EB, vancomycin and ofloxacin (Figure\n8A). However, the MICs of S. rimosus mutants to ampicillin, OTC, doxorubicin and ofloxacin were markedly amplified compared with controls (Figure\n8B), which suggested that OtrC could play an important role in the self-protection mechanisms of S. rimosus. Interestingly, the MIC of M4018/pSEC to vancomycin was 500\u2009\u03bcg/ml, and the growth of M4018/pKC\u0394otrC and M4018/pSET152 was completely inhibited under these conditions. This implies that OtrC acts as an efficient vancomycin efflux pump. Additionally, the significantly enhanced vancomycin resistance activity in S. rimosus M4018/pSEC might be attributed to the strong constitutive ermE* promoter, which results in the overexpression of OtrC during the early growth phase.", "Effect of OtrC expression on OTC production in S. rimosus", "The M4018 strain showed a stable production of OTC. In contrast, the SR16 mutants showed an obvious drop of OTC production after 3\u2009days, which was probably due to the instability of SR16 (Figure\n7). A red pigment was observed during SR16 fermentation (date not published), which, to our knowledge, has not been previously described in S. rimosus. We speculate that another competitive secondary metabolic pathway was activated in SR16 during the traditional mutation.", "The real-time qRT-PCR analysis showed that OtrC overexpression could lead to a significant OTC production improvement by secreting OTC out of cells in both the M4018\u2009S. rimosus strain and an industrial overproducer, SR16. Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that otrC could be a valuable target for genetic manipulation, such as introducing extra copies of the ABC transporter\n[12,13], overexpressing the pathway genes with the use of transcription regulators\n[20-22] and the replacement of heterologous promoters\n[23,24], in order to yield the overproduction of OTC."]
