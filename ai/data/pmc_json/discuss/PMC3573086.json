["Discussion", "Growth and survival of cancer cells is critically dependent on specific signaling molecules (14). The EGF pathway is considered to be the most prominent signaling pathway in colorectal cancer, as it regulates the differentiation, survival, proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Recently, certain individuals with wild-type Kras gene colorectal cancer have benefited from therapies targeting the EGFR. However, resistance to the EGFR blockade inevitably occurs due to a mutation in the gene encoding EGFR that impairs the binding of cetuximab to EGFR (15\u201317). Therefore, it is necessary to select new targets in this pathway to overcome the resistance acquired due to mutations.", "Recently, Yonesaka et al identified acquired resistance to EGFR target therapy via increased signaling through Her2 (ErbB2; also a member of the ErbB family). Notably, the authors demonstrated that either amplification of ErbB2 or increased levels of the ErbB3/ErbB4 ligand heregulin led to de novo or acquired cetuximab resistance (18), and Ruan et al achieved similar results in a breast cancer study (19). Cytohesins, family members of GTPases, have been researched for their regulation of the reassembly of the cytoskeleton and the activation of integrin or the integrin signaling system, which is critically associated with cell adhesion and migration (11,20,21). A further study identified that cytohesins as EGFR activators may form a layer of positive regulation by facilitating the structural rearrangements required to convert the receptor dimer into its active conformation in lung cancer (10).", "Studies by Kolanus (11) and Ogasawara et al(22) concerning the expression of cytohesins demonstrated that cytohesin-2 (ARNO) and -3 (Grp1) were ubiquitously expressed, whereas cytohesins-1 and -4 were primarily leukocyte-specific. Cytohesin-1 is a key regulator of neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells and to components of the extracellular matrix, which may influence cell emigration through its dual opposing effect on \u03b21 and \u03b22 integrin activation (23). Additionally, ARNO behaves as a bistable switch, as it has an absolute requirement for activation by an Arf protein but, once triggered, it becomes highly active through the positive feedback effect of Arf1-GTP. This property of ARNO may provide an explanation for its function in signaling pathways that, once triggered, must move forward decisively (24). Additionally, in the present study, we detected the presence of cytohesins in the cytoplasm (near the membrane) by immunofluorescence, and ARNO was the most highly expressed cytohesin family member. Therefore, we employed molecular ARNO and the HT-29 cell line as subjects for the other sections of our study. Whether the strong expression of ARNO in colorectal cancer cells, potentially by enhanced EGFR signaling, contributes to tumor differentiation, survival, proliferation and migration, is yet to be determined. However, this has been identified in other types of cancer cells (25,26).", "In the cell proliferation section of the present study, HT-29 cells were stimulated by human EGF in the presence of SecinH3 or treated with ARNO siRNA. As a result, both SecinH3- and ARNO siRNA-treated cells demonstrated a 56.77-68.63% inhibition rate compared with solvent-treated samples. Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibiting cytohesins contributed to the reduction in EGFR signaling. To identify the mechanism of this inhibition in HT-29 cells, i.e. whether the enhancement of EGFR activation by cytohesins was due to the effect of cytohesins on EGFR, we investigated the activation of certain EGFR pathway molecules (p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2). Our results gave support to this mechanism of inhibition.", "In conclusion, ARNO, an important isoform of the cytohesin family, is highly expressed in colorectal cancer cells and enhances EGFR signaling, which contributes to tumor differentiation, survival and proliferation."]
