["3. Discussion", "In this study, we firstly collected samples from B. bifidum under biofilm (cells on the WF surface) and planktonic (cells in the control group) conditions during fermentation and then conducted a combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis to determine the key genes and metabolites involved in B. bifidum biofilm formation. Two hundred thirty-five nonredundant DEGs (including vanY, pstS, degP, groS, infC, groL, yajC, tadB and sigA) and 219 nonredundant differentially expressed metabolites (including L-threonine, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, ascorbic acid, niacinamide, butyric acid and sphinganine) were identified during the biofilm formation. Thirteen pathways were identified during the integration of both transcriptomics and metabolomics data, including ABC transporters; quorum sensing; two-component system; oxidative phosphorylation; ascorbate and aldarate metabolism; cysteine and methionine metabolism; glutathione metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis. These results indicate that quorum sensing, two-component system and amino acid metabolism are essential during B. bifidum biofilm formation.", "Various methods that rely on molecular and microbiological methods or on chemical or physical properties of the biofilm can be used to assess biofilm biomass and viability [19]. Microscopy methods are important tools for assessing biofilm biomass properties in a more direct way, allowing the description of biofilm heterogeneities, spatial organization and links with the community functions [20,21]. In addition, the diameter change of the biofilm in a dynamic fermentation system can reflect the growth rate of the biofilm [22]. Here, we used WF (with an average particle size of around 50 \u00b5m) as a carrier in the fermentation system and evaluated the biofilm formation by the biofilm formation rate, carrier particle size and FESEM. The average biofilm particle size was over 150 \u00b5m with the biofilm rate higher than 85% at 22 h (Figure 1). The number of viable bacteria on the WF indicates that the formation of B. bifidum biofilm includes the adsorption of cells to the carrier at the initial stage, the growth and development of the biofilm (22\u201332 h) and the dispersion of the biofilm. Carriers with porous structures, such as grape seeds, may contribute to biofilm formation on their surfaces by adsorbing cells through their porous structures, and the biofilm formation can be judged by FESEM and the change of particle size [23]. Moreover, choosing a material with a density less than that of culture media as a carrier (such as hollow glass microspheres) in the fermentation system can intuitively reflect the biofilm formation process [24].", "Biofilm formation is a complex dynamic process, and the attachment of cells to a carrier is one of the most important processes, representing a turning point from planktonic to the biofilm life mode [18]. Cell appendages such as flagella, fimbriae and pili are involved in this stage. The second messenger cAMP, generated by adenylate cyclase CyaA, has been shown to regulate tad IV pili [25]. Tad IV pili are important surface appendages that are central to the surface-sensing mechanism in the early stages of biofilm formation [26]. High type IV pili/cAMP levels might result in a greater attachment tendency [26]. The expression levels of cyaA and Bbi37|peg.1398 (cAMP receptor) were high during biofilm formation, and Bbi37|peg.1398 was upregulated during the biofilm growth stage. Bifidobacteria have been shown to encode type IV pili, which are associated with biofilm formation and colonization [27,28,29]. Moreover, sortase-dependent pili identified in B. bifidum PRL2010 were shown to promote self-aggregation and aggregation with other gut bacteria [30,31]. Type IV tad pili and quorum sensing are important for the early stages of biofilm formation [26,32].", "Interestingly, the functions of DEGs were mainly related to abiotic stimulation, stress response, protein and polysaccharide biosynthesis, two-component system, quorum sensing and global regulatory factors. The genes upregulated were a global phenomenon during B. bifidum biofilm formation (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5): in the early stage of the biofilm, genes related to stress response were upregulated; after the adhesion was completed, cells begin to secrete EPSs leading to biofilm growth, and the related genes were upregulated. YidC, which functions as an integral membrane chaperone/insertase associated with the SecYEG translocon, was identified as a target that can inhibit biofilm formation [33]. Elimination of yidC paralogs in Streptococcus disrupts EPS composition and biofilm development [34]. The tad IV pili gene (tadB) and YidC protein gene (yidC) were both upregulated during biofilm formation (Figure 2d). The two-component system, consisting of a histidine kinase and a cognate response regulator [35], plays an important role in monitoring internal or environmental signals and then translating these stimuli into appropriate cellular responses, and it is also associated with bacterial biofilm formation [36]. Notably, four DEGs (Bbi37|peg.1341, degP, pstS, vanY) associated with the two-component system were found during B. bifidum biofilm formation (Figure 3). The \u2206degP probiotic Escherichia coli strain exhibited 20-fold lower biofilm formation than the wild-type strain and lost the ability to inhibit pathogenic biofilm formation via a DegP-mediated interaction [37].", "The function of differentially expressed metabolites indicates that amino acid, short-chain fatty acids and vitamins were the main metabolites and their expression levels were different during biofilm formation (Figure 7). Amino acids serve as precursors for energy generation with gluconeogenesis, and less abundance of amino acids in the biofilm state of B. bifidum reflects less energy production, which indicates the biofilm had already attained maturity [16]. Biofilm formation requires cell adhesion, surface conditioning and EPS production, which are energetically expensive processes; however, it is evolutionary justified given the great benefits for bacteria to live embedded in the EPS matrix under oligotrophic conditions; therefore, nascent biofilms in eutrophic systems have reduced lag phases and higher growth rates than biofilms from oligotrophic systems [3,38,39]. In bacterial biofilms, organic acids, including short-chain fatty acids, are mainly produced by the fermentation of sugars and can reduce the pH value [40]. The rate of biofilm formation by Actinomyces naeslundii cells was upregulated by 6.25\u2009mM butyric acid compared to the rate in the control (no short-chain fatty acids) in 96-well microtiter plates, and this upregulation was mediated by GroEL (the heat shock protein) [41]. Another report indicated that the number of biofilms consisting of A. naeslundii cells generated from initial attachment cells in a flow cell system was increased by treatment with 60\u2009mM butyric acid [42]. These reports suggested that the effects of short-chain fatty acids, including butyric acid, could induce the potentiation of the cell status required for initial cell attachment, colonization and biofilm formation [42,43]. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has previously been reported to enhance oxidative stress tolerance in Pichia caribbica [44]."]
