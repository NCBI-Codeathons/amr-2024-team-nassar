["Discussion", "In this study, we introduced a measure of convergent protein evolution, \u03c9C, designed to account for false signals due to phylogenetic error. We showed, through simulation and analysis of real biological data, that \u03c9C mostly eliminates false positives without reduction in power to detect true signals. We also developed an approach to estimate the rates of highly repetitive convergence (that is, on more than two lineages) fully accounting for phylogenetic combinatorics and demonstrated that the specificity of \u03c9C increases further in the higher-order analysis. Because of its improved accuracy, \u03c9C should further drive macroevolutionary analyses where uncorrected measures have been used to identify responsible genotypes for particular phenotypes in a way similar to genome-wide association studies (GWASs). It is noteworthy that there are more direct extensions of the GWAS approaches to analyse among-species variations. Those methods, including PhyloGWAS63, can be applied to closely related species to detect convergent selection on ancestral variation or through introgression64. Although those methods are powerful, the applicability to distantly related species is limited. In our method, as in alleles identified by GWASs or the above-mentioned comparable approaches (or genes in gene-level association tests65), genes with excess convergence serve as clues to study macroevolutionary traits for which the molecular basis is unknown (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the accuracy of \u03c9C even allows exploratory analysis (Fig. 5), as demonstrated here in vertebrate genomes (Fig. 3). By conducting a genome-wide search of convergent branch combinations, we detected signatures of likely adaptive convergence, which leads to hypothesis generation on responsible phenotypes. This outcome was possible because \u03c9C, unlike P-values from GWASs, does not require phenotypic traits as input. Convergently evolved genes identified by exploratory analysis will, in turn, lead to the discovery of overlooked phenotypes through future experimentation.Fig. 5Analysis of the genotype\u2013phenotype association within and between species.The proposed method improves the accuracy of the hypothesis-driven approach in the macroevolutionary scale and enables exploratory approaches.

We successfully captured multiple known convergence events here, even with only two or three amino acid substitutions involved in small proteins (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 3). However, a convergent amino acid substitution at a single site in only two lineages may not reliably be identified as resulting from adaptation rather than random homoplasy, by \u03c9C or any other measure. Therefore, the number of observed non-synonymous convergence (OCN) should always be considered in addition to the phylogenetic error-corrected convergence rate (\u03c9C), especially in a genome-scale screening with only two or three focal lineages. If many amino acid sites and/or many separate lineages are involved, true convergence is, in general, more easily detected. However, it should be noted that errors due to splicing variants may not be completely eliminated in higher-order branch combinations (Supplementary Text 12). In this study, we used different threshold values of \u03c9C and OCN, depending on the application, and our recommended usage is provided in Supplementary Text 13.", "Although it is well established that phenotypes are associated with genotypes, the genetic basis for particular convergently evolved phenotypes may arise from distinct, non-convergent genetic changes66,67. These specific cases may sometimes occur because of convergent mechanisms, such as the use of similar but not identical amino acids, and the use of similar changes at adjacent residues in the protein structure68. The accumulation of knowledge about which mutations are repeatedly selected and which are not during convergent evolution may provide insight into the evolvability and constraints that govern the diversification of organisms.", "While some evolutionary innovations may be unique, many traits arose convergently69. Fascinating examples not mentioned above include endothermy, hibernation, burrowing, diving, venom injection, electrogenic organs, eusociality, anhydrobiosis, bioluminescence, biomineralization, plant parasitism, mycoheterotrophy and multicellularity. In the past, the observation of similar phenotypes in multiple species led to the theory of evolution by natural selection70. The analysis of protein sequences in multiple species gave rise to the formulation of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution71,72. Likewise, cross-species genotype\u2013phenotype associations illuminated through the analysis of molecular convergence, coupled with experimental evaluation of mutational effects (Supplementary Text 14), may lead to new conceptual frameworks on the constraint and adaptive changes at the molecular level that drive phenotypic change among species."]
