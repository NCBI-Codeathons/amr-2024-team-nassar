["Discussion", "The exact molecular functions of housekeeping ABCFs have been \u2018a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\u2019 of bacterial protein synthesis for a decade. Housekeeping ABCFs are expected to resolve ribosomal stalls\u2014but what kind of stalls? Several recent reports have provided important clues regarding the possible biological functions of both E. coli (43,64\u201366) and B. subtilis (67) factors. Hong and colleagues have reported that dCas9 knock-down of yfmR in \u0394efp B. subtilis results a synthetic growth defect, increased ribosomal stalling on a pentaproline motif as well as accumulation of free 50S subunits (67). Furthermore, the authors showed that E. coli Uup can functionally replace YfmR/Uup in B. subtilis. Based on Tn-Seq results, Hong and colleagues concluded that simultaneous deletion of yfmR and efp could be synthetically lethal. However, by constructing a \u0394efp \u0394yfmR B. subtilis strain, here we show that the double-deletion strain is actually viable, although it does exhibit a serve growth defect. An elegant study by Chadani et\u00a0al. has demonstrated that in a reconstituted PUREflex protein synthesis system (i) E. coli YbiT and EttA can suppress premature termination on negatively charged polyacidic motifs and (ii) E. coli Uup can alleviate ribosome stalling on polyproline stretches and (iii) simultaneous loss of Uup and EF-P results in a growth defect in E. coli (66). Finally, in good agreement with Chadani et\u00a0al., Ousalem et\u00a0al. have revealed the role of E. coli YbiT in alleviation of the ribosomal stalling on\u00a0acidic residues (65). All of these insights are well-aligned with our in vivo results with B. subtilis.", "Despite recent progress, our understanding of bacterial housekeeping ABCFs is still incomplete. The contrast between, on the one hand, the exceedingly strong and specific genetic interaction between efp and yfmR and, on the other hand, the rather modest effects in stalling reporter assays is stark. Even more intriguing is the ability of the EF-P variant lacking the 5-amino-pentanolylated residue K32 to suppress the growth defect of the efp \u0394yfmR strain. While the K32A EF-P variant is inefficient in resolving ribosomal stalling on polyproline, it is clearly competent in assisting YfmR in its biological function. The established function of modified lysine is stabilization of the P-site tRNA CCA end to promote the transpeptidation (4). Importantly, in addition to making contacts with the CCA end, EF-P specifically recognizes the D-arm of tRNAPro (4,68). Therefore, even while the K32A variant is compromised in reaching deep into the PTC, it still can potentially recognize the P-site tRNA identity. As simultaneous ribosomal association of the two E-site-binders is impossible, it is possible that YfmR and EF-P sequentially act on as-yet-unidentified proline-containing stalling motifs, with EF-P first positioning the P-tRNAPro followed by YfmR-mediated resolution of the stall. Furthermore, recent Ribo-Seq experiments have shown that overexpression of EF-P and its paralogue EfpL causes specific ribosomal stalling (9). Therefore, it could be that the function of EF-P is not to promote translation elongation, but to slow it down, thus presenting a relevant ribosomal substrate for YfmR. Finally, it is possible that the strong generic interaction between efp and yfmR is not due to the two factors working together in translation elongation at all. The eukaryotic EF-P orthologue, eIF5A, has been shown to play a key role in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) (69), where the factor catalyses an elongation-like process on the large ribosomal subunit. Therefore, it is possible that there exists a yet-to-be discovered function of EF-P that does not require the modified K32 residue and is carried out in cooperation with YfmR.", "In the absence a \u2018smoking gun\u2019, our highly reductionist reporter approach is incapable of identifying stalling motifs that require the assistance of ABCFs. Therefore, it is essential to apply global approaches such as ribosome profiling (70) or 5PSeq (71) to uncover the physiologically-relevant targets of B. subtilis housekeeping ABCF ATPases. Given the functional overlap between YfmR, YkpA and YfmM, the expression of individual ABCFs in \u03944abcf B. subtilis could be used to detect the subtle effects that would be otherwise masked in strains lacking only one of the ABCF factors. Once the native targets of YfmR and YkpA/YbiT are established, structure-functional studies will reveal the molecular mechanism of stall resolution by the ABCFs. Capitalising on the molecular insights into the mechanism of EF-P-mediated stimulation of PTC activity, modulation of EF-P concentration has been adapted as a strategy for improved efficiency of incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (72,73). It is possible that housekeeping ABCF ATPases could be useful for similar protein engineering applications in the future."]
