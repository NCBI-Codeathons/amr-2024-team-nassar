["Discussion", "The 30-day-long lactating leftover removal treatment significantly changed the environmental microbial structure in different regions of the farrowing barn, suggesting the leftover is an important contributor to the environmental microbiota in the farrowing barn. Our environmental samples were collected in regions away from the lactating sows\u2019 farrowing beds, as well as the sows were fed with wet feed which avoid microbial transmission caused by splashing or dusting of residual feed from cribs. Therefore, the effect of leftover feed on the microbial structure of the farrowing barn environment should be dependent on the microbial transmission medium.", "The association between leftover and environmental microbial structure was evidenced with the results of microbial abundance and difference probability (Fig.\u00a03E and F). Half of the top ten bacteria with differential cumulative probability involving the housefly, environment and sow samples of NFB, both at the genus level and ASV level, were dominant in lactating residual feed (top 10 in relative abundance). Meanwhile, Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis demonstrated the correlation between the differential cumulative probability of these eligible dominant bacteria and their relative abundance in the residual feed increased over time and reached the highest value at the 8-hour time point, suggesting that there should be a sustained and cumulative effect of the residual feed on the environmental microbiota.", "Houseflies are ubiquitous and synanthropic, which allows them to transport and disperse microorganisms in urban or natural environments [24]. The removal treatment of leftover, for one thing, blocks the physical contact between the adult houseflies and leftover microbes during the feeding process. Since houseflies have the habit of laying their eggs within the food [25], the microorganisms in the food can colonize the gut during the larval stage of the housefly [26]. Therefore, the removal of the residues, for another, results in newborn houseflies\u2019 unavailability of microbes in the lactating sow residual feed in the RFB during their lifecycle, which collectively cause microbial difference between houseflies in the NFB and RFB. Paradoxically, the structural differences in microorganisms of houseflies before and after leftover removal treatments were smaller than the structural differences in microorganisms in individual environmental regions in the farrowing barn, as a transmitter of microorganisms. Previous studies have shown that the microbial structure of microbes in the body of houseflies (including in the digestive tract) is more stable than that of their surface microbes [27], while certain microbes can maintain for more than 30 days [28]. Therefore, performing a 30-day removal residue treatment may have altered the microbes mainly on the body surface of houseflies, resulting in differences in microbial transmission, but the effect of internal microbes was relatively low. In this research, we use 16\u00a0S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of housefly-carried bacteria by whole pulverization of houseflies, which means the microbiota on the surface and the internal compartments of houseflies was both evaluated. On the other hand, the expected life span of houseflies is more than 30 days [29], making the houseflies we collected in RFB after residual removal treatment were likely to be exposed to lactating sow residual feed during their life cycle. The above factors may explain why the differences in microbial structure of houseflies were not as expected.", "Previous studies have widely documented the role of houseflies in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus [30] and Streptococcus [31]. In addition, houseflies in farms during summer have been shown to transmit microorganisms within 5\u20137\u00a0km during their life cycle [32]. However, the role of houseflies in the modification of environmental microorganisms under enclosed areas has not been evaluated. With LefSe analysis of houseflies and different environmental regions to find common target microorganisms, the results based on ASV levels showed that houseflies were more adept at spreading 70% dominant bacteria in lactating residual feed (top 10 relative abundance) than traditional pathogenic microorganisms including Staphylococcus saprophyticus (Feature 79) and Streptococcus (Feature 25). Intriguingly, these dominant bacteria are Leuconostoc (Feature 7, 21), Weissella (Feature 1, 3), Pediococcus (Feature 20) and Lactobacillus (Feature 11,12), all belonging to Firmicutes and capable of producing exopolysaccharides [33], suggesting that exopolysaccharides may help certain microorganisms utilize houseflies for environmental transmission. However, after residual removal treatment, these bacteria significantly decreased in the environment as the microbial source was blocked, suggesting the indispensable significance of houseflies in maintaining the relative abundance of these target microorganisms in the farrowing barn.", "The absence of the AIAO system resulted in the mixing feeding of gestating and lactating sows in the farrowing house. In this research, we further explored the effects of environmental microbial changes on gestating sows. 15 kinds of bacterial features were significantly reduced in the fecal bacteria of gestating sows after removal treatment, while 12 of these bacteria were also significantly reduced in the fecal bacteria of BB gestating sows where only gestating sows present, demonstrating that the effect of mixing feeding on the gestating sow fecal microbial composition was attenuated by residual removal treatment. However, only Weissella (Feature 1) showed a synchronized significant decrease in relative abundance among housefly, environment (handrail) and gestating sows feces samples, which may be dependent on the potent digestive tract colonization ability possessed by Weissella [34] and sow self-resistance of digestive tract to environmental microorganisms.", "However, the average relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia-Shigella and Streptococcus were synchronized to increase among houseflies, environment and feces samples of gestating sows with the presence of lactating leftover feed. Escherichia-Shigella has been suggested to be a hallmark of intestinal flora dysbiosis [35], while maternal Streptococcus colonization can negatively impact on the offspring in the gestation period [36]. In contrast, removal of the residual feed significantly restored the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae_R-7_group in gestating sow feces located in RFB, which was closely associated with body health [37]. In conclusion, the leftover removal treatment for lactating sows can alleviate the negative effects due to the absence of the AIAO system in the farrowing barn. Due to current limited experimental conditions, we have not further evaluated the effects of AIAO deficiency on production performance in the farrowing house in this research. We will further explore the effects of changes in the microbial structure of the environment caused by residual feed in the farrowing barn on the health of offspring piglets in the future study and increase the sample capacity."]
