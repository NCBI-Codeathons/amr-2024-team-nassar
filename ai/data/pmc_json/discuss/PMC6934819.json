["Discussion", "Our study combined genetic manipulations of the BGC for bicyclomycin that is encoded by S. cinnamoneus with in vitro enzyme characterization to complement and confirm in vivo the pathway proposed by Meng and coworkers12.", "By creating and characterizing in frame gene deletions for each of the biosynthetic genes, we were able to correlate the metabolic intermediates that accumulated in vivo to the products of in vitro reactions. Our work is unique in that we deleted the full gene cluster, and replaced it with native and modified ectopic copies of it, generating robust in vivo data for each step in bicyclomycin biosynthesis. Moreover, we established the stereochemistry of some of the intermediates (4 and 5). This pathway is the most complex CDPS-dependent DKP biosynthetic pathway characterized to date with six tailoring enzymes involved in the conversion of the cyclodipeptide cIL (2).", "Concerning the reactions catalysed by the tailoring enzymes, hydroxylations (as the one introduced by BcmC, D, E and G) are one of the canonical reactions in the repertoire of both 2OG/Fe dioxygenases and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases; desaturations (like the one catalysed by BcmF) are also well documented20\u201322. The reaction catalysed by BcmB results in hydroxylation and ether bridge formation, and is original but not unheard of. Meng et al.12 proposed that it processed through at least two BcmB-catalyzed reactions, a desaturation and an epoxidation, followed by the nucleophilic attack of the C\u03b1 carbon atom involved in the epoxyde functional group by the oxygen atom of the hydroxylated Ile C\u03b4.", "Meng et al.12 reported that in vitro BcmC was more active on cIL (2) than BcmE, this reaction being the first of a shunt pathway involving also BcmG and BcmB. We did not observed this activity of BcmC on 2 in our in vitro results, as we have seen almost no substrate depletion over one hour incubation of 2 with BcmC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5A) and complete substrate transformation with BcmE (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5B). The difference could be explained by different in vitro reaction conditions, as the buffer type, substrate and enzyme concentrations were substantially different. In particular, the substrate to enzyme ratio was 10 times lower in the conditions used by Meng et al.12. We observed in vivo in the bcmE-deleted mutant a shunt pathway similar to the one observed in vitro by Meng et al.12. This confirms that BcmC, BcmG and BcmB are also promiscuous in vivo. Patteson et al.11 also observed that overincubation of 6 with BcmG leads to the supplementary oxidation reactions performed by this enzyme that are not normally observed in vivo. We made similar observation in vitro but did not characterized the compound obtained in these conditions. Other compounds related to bicyclomycin such as c2 or c4, not structurally characterized in this study, also accumulate in large quantities in some deletion mutant strains. Taken together, these observations made in vitro or in vivo indicate that some of the Bcm enzymes are promiscuous. This opens the possibility to generate novel bicyclomycin derivatives in vivo as well as in vitro by combinatorial biosynthetic approaches.", "Concerning the regulation of bicyclomycin production, no putative regulatory gene is located in the vicinity of the BGC. However, bicyclomycin production is regulated, as indicated by its detection in only one out of ten growth media tested. Moreover, heterologous expression of the pathway with the native promoters (encoded by pJWe14) was not observed in S. coelicolor or S. lividans, consistent with previous attempts12. Only when we introduced pJWe14 into a mutant strain of S. cinnamoneus lacking the cluster, was bicyclomycin production observed. In contrast to attempts to express the gene cluster using the native nucleotide sequence, the addition of the strong constitutive promoter ermE*p upstream of bcmA did afford bicyclomycin production in Streptomyces13. All these observations suggest that a regulatory system, present in S. cinnamoneus and missing in the strains tested for heterologous expression, is required for the expression of the bcm biosynthetic genes from their native promoter(s). BGCs homologous to the bcm cluster are present in Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria11,13 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S22. One of these homologous BGC from P. aeruginosa SCV20265 has been shown to direct the biosynthesis of bicyclomycin13. There are no putative regulators near the bcm cluster of S. cinnamoneus and no regulatory processes are known for this pathway or bicyclomycin production. More generally, a regulatory gene for CDPS-encoding BGCs has only been identified for pulcherriminic acid. This regulator is a member of the MarR family and is encoded by a gene that is adjacent to the biosynthetic genes in Bacillus subtilis while its homologue in Bacillus licheniformis is not encoded in the vicinity of the gene cluster23\u201325.", "The initial assignment of bcmH as a resistance gene is derived from overexpression experiments performed in E. coli11. However, our results indicate that BcmH, a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily, is not required for bicyclomycin export. Specifically, we showed that bcmH is dispensable in a strain producing bicyclomycin, and that it is not always transcribed at the same time as the rest of the bcm genes. Indeed, heterologous expression of the bcm cluster from S. cinnamoneus lacking bcmH in S. coelicolor was recently achieved13. An orthologue of bcmH is not universally conserved within or near BGCs predicted for bicyclomycin in other Actinobacteria. For instance, no bcmH orthologue is present near the orthologues of bcmA-bcmG in Streptomyces ossamyceticus13\u00a0and\u00a0Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S22. Other examples of transporter-encoding gene associated with specialized metabolite biosynthetic genes, but dispensable for export have already been described. For instance, in Streptomyces venezuelae, the jadL gene associated with the jadomycin BGC is dispensable for efficient jadomycin export26. In Streptomyces spp., a number of bcmH homologues exist, including some whose products resemble the MFS exporter isolated from a spontaneous E. coli mutant with resistance to bicyclomycin27. For example, the MFS encoded by the S. cinnamoneus BLA24_RS22250, which is not associated with the bcm BGC, shares 33% amino acid sequence identity with the bicyclomycin resistance protein recovered from E. coli. In contrast, BcmH and the E. coli transporter share only 20% identity. Therefore, the export of bicyclomycin in the producing organism could be due to redundant export mechanisms, one of which might involve BcmH.", "It should be noted that bicyclomycin is not active against Streptomyces and most other actinobacteria28,29 (with the exception of Micrococcus luteus30) even though the ATPase activity of Rho is sensitive in vitro as demonstrated in the case of S. lividans31. Rho from S. cinnamoneus shares 78% protein sequence identity to that of S. lividans and all the positions predicted to be involved in the interaction with bicyclomycin32 are conserved between both proteins (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S23). In addition to this genus-level similarity, the Streptomyces proteins are identical to E. coli wild-type Rho at 18 of the 24 positions whose amino acid substitution confers resistance to bicyclomycin33. The remaining six variable positions include relatively conservative amino acid substitutions. Moreover at these six positions, the residues are identical in S. lividans and S. cinnamoneus. Based on the sequence similarities, we assume that the Rho from S. cinnamoneus is also sensitive to bicyclomycin. The fact that bicyclomycin production is not detrimental to the Streptomyces producing strain can be explained by an efficient export of the antibiotic but also by the fact that Rho might be non-essential in Streptomyces, as for instance in B. subtilis34.", "Additional studies are required to understand the regulation of bicyclomycin biosynthesis, export, and resistance in the producing organisms. The bicyclomycin pathway is the most complex CDPS-dependent DKP biosynthetic pathway characterized so far, with six tailoring enzymes. The characterization of this pathway and the further study of its enzyme promiscuity may provide insight for the biosynthesis of bicyclomycin analogues and also for the use of these enzymes for the modification of other cyclodipeptides in combinatorial biosynthesis."]
