The final de novo draft genome assembly consisted of 111 contigs covering 10.5 Mbp with an N50 of 205\u00a0194. Annotation of the genome and analysis by antiSMASH (Blin et al. 2021) revealed 42 BGCs involved in secondary metabolism (Table S1), 27 of which are similar to known clusters. BiG-FAM analysis (Kautsar et al. 2021) identified 36 gene cluster families representing the wide chemical diversity of the strain. Moreover, this strain contains 10 complete BGCs having a distance greater than 900 in BiG-FAM analysis indicating that they may encode novel molecules (Table S1). Finally, we identified three type II polyketide BGCs encoding genes for biosynthesis of naphthocyclinone (Fig.\u00a02A), a putative fluostatin-type compound and spore pigment from the sequencing data.", "Figure 2.Naphthocyclinone biosynthetic gene cluster and heterologous expression trials.

The biosynthetic logic could be inferred by comparison to related BIQ pathways (Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 et al. 2013). We propose that naphthocyclinone biosynthesis initiates with the assembly of an octaketide polyketide on the NcnC ACP through condensation of eight malonyl-CoA units by the NcnA/NcnB KS\u03b1/KS\u03b2 heterodimer (Scheme\u00a01).

The naphthocyclinone pathway is likely to follow the paradigm established for granaticin biosynthesis, since the pathways harbours the SDR enzyme NcnP that is homologous to the 3-KR Gra-6 (Ichinose et al. 1998). The equivalent step in actinorhodin biosynthesis is catalysed by a protein of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 et al. 2013) for which no homologous enzymes are encoded by the naphthocyclinone BGC. The NcnG CYC is the likely candidate for pyran ring cyclization and formation of (R)-DNPA (4-dihydro-9-hydroxy-1-methyl-10-oxo-3-H-naphtho[2,3-c]pyran-3-acetic acid) (Scheme\u00a01). An interesting deviation from canonical BIQ pathways is that the naphthocyclinone BGC does not contain any gene products of the NAD(P)H dependent medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases that are typically associated with enoyl reduction and therefore the gene for this step is unknown (Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 et al. 2013). However, quinone formation is likely to be catalysed by the two-component mono-oxygenases NcnH/NcnT that are homologous to experimentally characterized proteins from the actinorhodin (Valton et al. 2006; Hashimoto et al. 2020) and alnumycin (Grocholski et al. 2012) systems.", "Insight into naphthocyclinone dimerization", "In order to obtain experimental evidence for genes involved in the dimerization of naphthocyclinone, we cloned the BGC using RecET direct cloning (Wang et al. 2016) to facilitate recombineering efforts (Fig. S1). The main metabolite (Fig.\u00a02B) produced by the generated strain S. albus/pSA-naphtho was found to be \u03b1-naphthocyclinone acid (Zeeck and Mardin 1974). The compound was isolated from the culture broth with acidic ethyl acetate and purified further by silica column and preparative HPLC using a reversed phase column. The structure was verified by NMR (Figs S2\u2013S7, Table S2) and MS analysis (ESI m/z [M-H]\u2212 obs. 651.1353 calc. 651.1355), which correlated to previously published data (Zeeck and Mardin 1974).", "Sequence analysis revealed two candidate gene products for dimerization. NcnM (Table\u00a01, Fig. S8) is a member of the NmrA family of NAD(P)H dependent reductases and homologous to ActVA-4, which is responsible for dimerization in actinorhodin biosynthesis (Taguchi et al. 2012). In addition, we considered that NcnN (Table\u00a01, Fig. S9) could be involved in the reaction, since it shares sequence identity to the co-factor independent oxidase Aln6 from the alnumycin pathway that catalyses C-C bond cleavage (Oja et al. 2008, 2012).", "We proceeded to disrupt ncnN by recombineering in E. coli and conjugated the resulting plasmid pSA-naphtho\u0394ncnN to S. albus. Analysis of culture extracts (Fig.\u00a02B) revealed loss of \u03b1-naphthocyclinone acid production and accumulation of another metabolite, which was identified as the octaketide fogacin based on NMR (Figs S10\u2013S16, Table S3) and MS (ESI m/z [M-H]\u2212 obs. 305.1019, calc. 305.1031) analyses. Fogacin has previously been isolated from S. lividans (Santamar\u00eda et al. 2018), Streptomyces sp. T\u00fc 6319 (Radzom et al. 2006) and S. violaceoruber (Lu et al. 2014). The relative stereochemistry was verified to be trans by NOESY (Figs S15 and S16), where H-3 was coupled with the methyl group H-13, but not with H-1. Complementation of ncnN with an intact copy in strain S. albus/SA-naphtho\u0394ncnN/pEN-SV1-ncnN restored production of \u03b1-naphthocyclinone acid (Fig.\u00a02B). A fogacin fog BGC has recently been identified from Actinoplanes missouriensis (Sato et al. 2019) and comparison to the ncn BGC revealed a homologous gene set for polyketide biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a02C). However, significant differences were also apparent, since the ncn BGC contains additional tailoring genes for dimerization and further modification (see below), while the fog BGC harbors genes for production of the glycosylated fogacin B and the \u03b2-alkylated fogacin C (Sato et al. 2019).", "Next, we used recombineering to inactivate ncnM resulting in strain S. albus/pSA-naphtho\u0394ncnM. Surprisingly, the gene deletion did not have an effect in the production profile of the strain (Fig.\u00a02D) and \u03b1-naphthocyclinone acid (Fig.\u00a02D) was detected as the main secondary metabolite. These results are in contrast to experiments on the actinorhodin pathway, where the homologous actVA-4 has been shown to be essential for dimerization (Taguchi et al. 2012). We surmise that the result may be due to endogenous complementation of the ncnM deletion by the S. albus J1074 host strain, which contains an uncharacterized SDR gene (accession number WP_033240217.1) with 40.0% sequence identity to ncnM.", "Bioinformatic analysis of late-stage tailoring steps in naphthocyclinone biosynthesis", "After dimerization, we propose that the flavoenzyme NcnO would catalyse asymmetrical quinone formation (Scheme\u00a01). Late steps in naphthocyclinone biosynthesis have very recently been investigated in the nap BGC from strain S. eurocidicus CGMCC 4.108, where experimental data indicates that acylation by NcnL may be the next biosynthetic step (Li et al. 2023). The key difference in the two naphthocyclinone BGCs is that the ncn pathway encodes a F420 -dependent oxidoreductase NcnJ, for which there is no equivalent gene on the nap pathway. We suggest that NcnJ is involved in formation of \u03b1-naphthocyclinone, which has not been detected from S. eurocidicus CGMCC 4.108, and is responsible for late-stage pyran ring opening and oxidation. The final biosynthetic step is likely to be conversion of \u03b1-naphthocyclinone acid to \u03b1-naphthocyclinone by the methyltransferase NcnI.", "Mechanism of dimerization in the biosynthesis of benzoisochromanequinone antibiotics", "Next, we turned our attention to actVA-3 from the actinorhodin pathway, which is homologous to ncnN (Fig.\u00a02A), in order to determine if the gene product is required for dimerization along with actVA-4 product. We generated a knock-out mutant in S. coelicolor M145 based on classical homologous recombination. The target gene actVA-3 was replaced by an apramycin- resistance (aprr) cassette resulting in strain S. coelicolor M145\u0394actVA-3 (Fig. S18). Comparative metabolic profiling revealed severely impaired actinorhodin production, since the mutant strain accumulated only approximately 8% of actinorhodin in comparison to the wild type (Fig.\u00a03A and\u00a0B). This result is in agreement with very recent data from the Ichinose laboratory, where the authors demonstrated similar reduction in actinorhodin biosynthesis in the actVA-3 mutant and in vitro dimerization activity with ActVA-3 and ActVA-4 (Hashimoto et al. 2023). LC-MS analysis was carried out to analyse the mass spectrum of the metabolite. The metabolite displayed the m/z value at 629.0 in a negative mode, agreeing to data for authentic \u03b3 actinorhodin (Fig.\u00a03C and\u00a0D; Fig. S18C).", "Figure 3.Functional analysis of actVA-3.

ActVA-3 would then use molecular oxygen to oxidize THK-OH into 8-hydroxy-dihydrokalafungin (DHK-OH) by abstracting two adjacent hydrogen atoms and forming hydrogen peroxide in the process. Then ActVA-4 catalyses the dimerization of DHK-OH through a hydride transfer from the NADPH cofactor to the reactive double bond at position 9 of DHK-OH, which together with protonation of the carbonyl at position 11 leads to the formation of an 10/11 enolic intermediate. The \u03c0-electrons of the enol then function as a Michael donor attacking the 9\u2019/10\u2019 double bond (Michael acceptor) of another molecule of DHK-OH, forming the THK-OH dimer, which is then oxidized into actinorhodin by ActVA-3 by again abstracting two hydrogens and reducing molecular oxygen into hydrogen peroxide.", "Scheme 2.Proposed mechanism for dimerization in actinorhodin and naphthocyclinone pathways.", "Proposed mechanism for dimerization in actinorhodin and naphthocyclinone pathways.", "We propose that naphthocyclinone dimerization proceeds through a similar mechanism (Scheme\u00a02B). In an orthologous manner to ActVA-3, keto/enol tautomerization of prenaphthocyclinone would allow its oxidation into the corresponding quinone (dehydroprenaphthocyclinone, DHPN) by NcnN using molecular oxygen. The differences in the two pathways would occur in the dimerization reaction, although the initial first step might proceed through similar chemistry. A C-C bond would be formed between the carbon atoms at positions 8 and 8\u2019 of two copies of DHPN through Michael addition. The Michael donor is activated by a hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to the carbon at position 7 of DHPN, which would facilitate adjacent \u03c0-electrons to perform a nucleophilic attack on another DHPN molecule (DHPN\u2019), which functions as the Michael acceptor (Scheme\u00a02B). A ketone at position 9 could be involved in resonance stabilization of the formed transient carbanion intermediate, as described for actinorhodin (Scheme\u00a02A). The electrophilicity of the Michael acceptor is increased by a simultaneous protonation of the carbonyl oxygen at position 6\u2019. The unique second step in the naphthocyclinone dimerization would be an aldol reaction between the formed Michael acceptor and the carbonyl carbon at position 6 (Scheme\u00a02B). This reaction would be catalysed by deprotonation of the 6\u2019-enol and protonation of the 6-ketone functional groups. The resulting bicyclic dimer would tautomerize into the corresponding hydroquinone and no additional oxidations by NcnN, in contrast to what has been demonstrated for ActVA-3 in actinorhodin biosynthesis, would be required.", "The S. albus/pSA-naphtho\u0394ncnN strain produced fogacin, which is likely a shunt product. The diketone tautomer of prenaphthocyclinone, which is normally oxidised by NcnN into DHPN, is instead reduced into fogacin in the absence of NcnN in the heterologous host. Possibly the same enzyme that would normally use NAD(P)H to catalyse the dimerization of DHPN, would catalyse this ketoreduction. Fogacin lacks the necessary 7/8 double bond, and is therefore an unsuitable substrate for dimerization."]
