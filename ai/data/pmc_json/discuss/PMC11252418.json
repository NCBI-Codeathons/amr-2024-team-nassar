["Discussion", "In summary, by studying the resistance of ObaO to OB, we found that a key glycine residue (Gly463) of ThrRS plays a dominant role in the molecular dynamics of the protein. Its substitution by small chiral amino acid residues significantly constrains the conformational space of ThrRS; therefore, we propose a general mechanism of ThrRS resistance to conformation-selective inhibitors, including OB and BN.", "Gly463 is a highly conserved residue in the housekeeping ThrRSs. It is possible that the OB-resistant G463S substitution compromises enzyme activity. To our surprise, we found that the ATP hydrolysis activity of the Gly463 mutants was higher than that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). The mutation does not appear to have an adverse effect on the activity of the enzyme catalyzed amino acid activation. On the other hand, we noticed that the recombinant expression of Gly463 mutants produced more inclusion bodies than that of the wild type. Consistent with the discovery that Gly463 is critical to protein conformation, mutations in this residue may also sacrifice some of the cost of protein folding.", "Functional proteins are in constant motion42. Structural flexibility allows proteins to adapt to their individual molecular binding partners and facilitates the binding process43. For example, the dynamics of bacterial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) allow for the whole catalytic cycle, while single mutations that affect global dynamics can reduce the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme44. Moreover, information such as the location and dynamic properties of drug binding pockets on proteins is critical for structure-based drug design and optimization of lead compounds45.", "Considering the dynamics of protein pockets during drug development may increase the accuracy of pocket identification and reveal alternative shapes or even a new transient pocket43. For example, a recent retrospective structure-based virtual screen (SBVS) study showed that the exploration of binding pocket dynamics in SBVS of sirtuin 2 inhibitors could achieve significant improvements in screening performance46; a combination of experimental and computational methods of pocket dynamics successfully discovered an inhibitor that discriminates Plasmodium falciparum heat shock protein 90 from its human homolog47.", "Although not widely studied, MD is also thought to give insight into the reasons for potential resistance development. For example, a combination of bioinformatics analysis and MD simulations showed that the L528W mutation of Bruton\u2019s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) reduces the conformational stability of BTK and decreased its binding affinity to ibrutinib compared to that of the WT, leading to drug resistance and potential disease recurrence48.", "In recent years, the development of drugs targeting aaRSs has received increasing amounts of attention. Our research suggested that molecular dynamics is an important factor in the design of drugs targeting aaRSs. This work not only elucidates the molecular mechanism of the self-resistance of OB-producing P. fluorescens that is equipped with a serine substitution at residue 464 (corresponding to Gly463 in EcThrRS) in the ObaO protein, but also emphasizes the importance of backbone kinetics, which is often hidden in static crystal structures, for aaRS-targeting drug development."]
