["Discussion", "In this paper, we explored the possibility of using SaindC, an indigoidine synthetase gene from S. albidoflavus J1074, to construct an efficient SaindC-based markerless deletion system which has good application prospect in the deletion of BGCs and other large DNA fragments from industrial Streptomyces.", "In the process of genomic fragment deletion through double-crossover HR, the second HR occurred in the non-selective growth step and may generate double-crossover mutants or reverted wild-type. For the classical selection methods without a reporter, the laborious and time-consuming replica plating and PCR verification are required to screen the double-crossover mutants. However, a large part of the colonies on the plates after non-selective growth are single-crossover mutants, which significantly decrease the ratio of the correct double-crossover mutants. With our SaindC-based reporter system, the colonies of single-crossover mutant (blue), double-crossover mutant (original color), and reverted wild-type (original color) can be easily characterized based on the color of colonies (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, by skipping the laborious replica plating step, the total time needed for deletion was averagely reduced with about 25% in our cases (5-7 days were reduced for different strains).", "Using the indigoidine synthetase genes, several groups have previously reported efficient gene-deletion in the model Streptomyces strains including S. coelicolor M145, S. coelicolor M1146, and S. lividans TK24 [10-12]. However, the feasibility of their deletion systems was not evaluated in industrial strains in their works. Here, the indigoidine-based markerless deletion system was tested in three industrial strains, and the results elucidated that our method provide a choice for many industrial strains particularly those lacking the episomal vectors.", "The most notable characteristic of Streptomyces is its ability to produce secondary metabolites. Nevertheless, many BGCs are silent under current culture conditions, thus heterologous expression has become a major strategy to obtain enough such metabolites. In particular, industrial streptomycetes have been proposed as suitable heterologous expression hosts because of adequate precursors as well as sophisticated post modification systems [3]. To improve the yield of heterologous products, the non-essential chromosomal regions like endogenous secondary BGCs, GIs and ISs are usually deleted ahead, there is an urgent requirement for reliable and efficient large DNA fragment deletion systems. Herein, the 10 kb, 37 kb, 74 kb, and 200 kb DNA fragments were deleted efficiently with our system, thus implying that this system is at least not constrained by the size of the target genomic fragment in the range of 10-200 kb. As the indigoidine synthetase could also be used in most actinomycetes as well as in some rare actinomycete genus [10, 11, 25], our work may provide a versatile markerless deletion tool for several industrial actinomycete strains."]
