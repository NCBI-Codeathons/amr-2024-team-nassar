["4. Discussion", "Our previous study demonstrated that live LAB cells (SN13T strain) are significant for improving the intestinal microbiota balance and protecting the host from dysbiosis in mice suffering from fatal alcohol poisoning symptoms [15]. The disturbed cecal microbiota of the model mice were altered to produce TMA potentially. TMAOs, widely known as risk markers for some chronic diseases, are enzymatically converted in the liver from TMA [17,18,19,20], metabolically generated by the gut microbiota from choline, which plays an important role, not only in body structural integrity, but also in brain and nervous system functions [33]. The acceleration of TMA bioconversion from choline by imbalanced gut microbiota may lead to choline deficiency, which may cause liver damage and hepatosteatosis, in addition to serum TMAO increase, resulting in a high risk of hepatic inflammation [33,34,35,36]. Our results indicate that the cecal microbiota with dysbiosis induced by ethanol feeding carry those latent risks.", "The present study has revealed that LY45-fermented stevia extract can repress TMA production with statistical significance during cecal microbiota cultivation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Interestingly, the administration of unfermented stevia extract was moderately effective at improving AST, ALT, and TMA values in animal experiments, whereas an in vitro assay showed that the same unfermented extract considerably enhanced the TMA productivity (Figure 2). This may be due to the fact that, during gastrointestinal processing, the constituents of the unfermented stevia extract will have undergone digestion, degradation, and metabolism reactions, which contribute to the reduction in TMA productivity. The resultant metabolites are partially similar to those of the LY45-fermented extract. This hypothesis presumes that the observed improvement effects were caused, not by the substances produced by the LY45 strain itself, but by the metabolites derived from the components contained in the stevia extract generated by microorganisms during the fermentation process.", "Gut microbiota have been reported to play an important role in the bioconversion of the precursor contained in herbal medicines into bioactive molecules [37,38,39]; thus, the medicinal effect of herbal extracts may depend on the microbiota composition. Recently, it has been reported that the anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), such as the human IgG4 monoclonal antibody Nivolumab, was affected by the composition of the resident gut microbiota [40]. In this case, several bacterial species are predicted to play key roles in the efficacy by increasing tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and the T-helper type 1 cell (Th1)/regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio.", "In the present study, the animal experiment was performed with inbred SPF mice; thus, the gut conditions of all of the mice were rather similar to one another. Although the unfermented stevia extract also showed an improving effect on the ethanol-fed model mice, having no resident gut bacteria that can convert the precursor into an active form may result in worsening the symptoms, rather than an ineffectual result. The preliminary bioconversion of herbal medicinal precursors or natural products by fermentation with safe microorganisms, such as probiotics, including LABs, is expected to be a promising method to avoid problems based on individual differences in response to medicinal compounds needing to undergo the bioconversion process.", "Different from the previous study, in which the live SN13T cells may improve dysbiosis through a probiotic effect [15], the LY45-fermented stevia extract did not contain living cells. This indicates that substances besides live probiotic cells can play a role in improving the gut microbiota. In fact, the present study showed that the administration of the fermented stevia extract restored the abundance of Escherichia and Enterococcus genera in the alcohol-fed model mice. Non-pathogenic Escherichia coli is the predominant species in the genus Escherichia and is recognized as one of the resident gut microbiota contributing to vitamin K production and protection against external pathogens in healthy human adults [41]. The genus Enterococcus is also known to be a normal constituent of the natural microbiota, and some strains of enterococci have been used in the treatment of various diseases as probiotic therapies [42,43,44]. Although further studies to clarify what kinds of substances improve the observed conditions are now in progress, it is hard to predict whether sugars, vitamins, and minerals, which can promote the growth of an indefinite number of bacteria, would remain after fermentation, with LAB strains having multiple auxotrophies [45]. Therefore, specific metabolites produced during fermentation may contribute to the reconstruction of the gut microbiota.", "From the microbiota analysis, the observed increased alterations in genera putative SMB53 (family Clostridiaceae) and Dorea were also restored by the fermented stevia extract. The SMB53 genus has been reported to be a pro-inflammatory group in the intestinal tract and correlates with TMA and TMAO levels, obesity, type II diabetes, and hepatosteatosis [46,47,48,49]. In addition, the SMB53 genus is particularly abundant in hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing epigenetic instability model Trim28hep\u2013/\u2013 mice [50]. Although we have not performed animal experiments to evaluate those disorders, because the fermented stevia extract had an improving effect on TMA production, the extract is expected to be effective on inflammatory disorders related to the genus SMB53. In the Dorea genus, although two species\u2014Dorea longicatena, which has been reported to be a possible marker to predict hepatic steatosis [51,52], and Dorea formicigenerans\u2014may correlate with the poor conditions of patients suffering with cirrhosis and fatty liver disease [53,54], different species of Dorea have been reported to be associated with different conditions in obese non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [55,56]. Those reports suggest that various potent properties associated with gut microbiota depend, not on the genus, but on the species or strain; however, the Dorea species observed here in increased numbers in the ethanol-fed mice may be an undesirable species for health promotion. Thus, further analysis of the determination of those Dorea species will give new insights into the treatment of gut dysbiosis.", "In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that Pediococcus pentosaceus LY45 fermentation of the stevia leaf extract can enhance its ability to improve serum AST and ALT levels and latent TMA productivity of cecal content, which significantly increased in the ethanol-fed mice. Our results suggest that the LY45-fermented stevia extract may be a useful technology to produce substrates that reconstruct the gut microbiota. Unfortunately, it has still not been determined what kinds of substrate were produced after the fermentation of the extract. However, our results have also indicated the significant potential of the fermentation of a medicinal herb with LABs to generate active compounds for preventing and improving in gut dysbiosis."]
