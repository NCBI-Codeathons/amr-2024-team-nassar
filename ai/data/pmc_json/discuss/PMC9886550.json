["Discussion", "Natural product inhibitors of DNA gyrase represent a largely untapped reservoir of molecules that have the potential to be developed into novel classes of highly effective antibiotics57. To achieve this, a structural understanding of their mechanisms of action is very useful. Traditionally, such structural studies have employed a crystallographic approach where truncated, stabilized constructs and carefully optimized DNA oligonucleotides were developed to determine structures of FQs, NBTIs and other small molecules43. Despite many successes, it seems that these systems are not suitable for inhibitors that, similarly to albicidin, target transient conformations of topoisomerases only sampled during the enzyme\u2019s catalytic cycle in quasi-native conditions. At the same time, cryo-EM allowed us to successfully determine the mechanism of action of this natural product, discovered more than three decades ago.", "In this work we have shown that para-aminobenzoic acid antibiotics form a special class of topoisomerase inhibitors. Unlike multiple known gyrase poisons that, similarly to FQs, symmetrically intercalate between the cleaved DNA fragments, preventing religation of both DNA strands, a single molecule of albicidin binds asymmetrically to the gyrase tetramer and intercalates only from one side of the DNA break. At the same time, wedging of the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 interface by the C-terminal fragment of albicidin efficiently prevents the protomer movement required for religation of the opposite DNA strand. Both DNA-binding and protein-binding fragments of the inhibitor are thus essential to stall the enzyme, as evidenced by our data with truncated derivatives.", "According to our proposed mechanism for the inhibition of the catalytic cycle of gyrase (Fig. 5), the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 binding pocket utilized by albicidin forms only transiently during large-scale conformational changes of the enzyme associated with DNA strand passage. This raises the question of how albicidin is able to recognize the transient site so efficiently and remain stably bound. Our structure was obtained with the use of ADPNP, a nucleotide analogue that stabilizes gyrase after T-segment capture. Albicidin binding was strongly stimulated by a long (>150\u2009bp) DNA fragment. We conclude that the albicidin-bound state most probably represents the conformation after strand passage (Fig. 5). Indeed, if the compound were to bind before strand passage (for example, at steps b or c in Fig. 5), it would be pushed away by the captured T-segment and subsequent opening of the DNA gate. It has been proposed by Schmidt et al.48 that in order to preserve its integrity, cleaved DNA is religated before the C-terminal gate opens and releases the T-segment (Fig. 5, step e). We suggest that albicidin binds at this stage. Based on the structure of Albi-1 in the XT state, we believe that albicidin might initially bind as a DNA intercalator using its N-terminal segment (Fig. 5, step f), while its C-terminal arm is able to freely rotate around the central hinge residue. Once the DNA-gate pocket is formed by the enzyme closing and trying to religate, the C-terminal arm swings into place, jamming the enzyme and preventing the \u2018sliding doors movement\u2019 in any direction (Fig. 5, step g). In the absence of the religation event, gyrase cannot proceed to the next catalytic cycle, remaining in a trapped state. Albicidin is most active with ATP present, and therefore nucleotide binding and hydrolysis on its own is not sufficient to dislodge the drug and escape into the productive state. The inhibitory mechanism of albicidin thus could be compared to a spanner thrown between two rotating gears. In this respect it is interesting to consider the pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) AlbG that provides protection against gyrase poisoning by albicidin20,33,34. This protein and other PRPs were suggested to act as T-segment DNA mimics58,59. The AlbG protein transported through the gyrase can lead to the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 interface opening up and dislodging the bound poison\u2014thus interaction with a specialized protein is required to exit the trapped state. The heavily post-translationally modified peptide toxin microcin B17 is another DNA gyrase inhibitor that requires DNA strand passage for activity. Analogously to cystobactamide (CysO)60 and albicidin (AlbG), a PRP McbG providing toxin immunity is located within the microcin B17 biosynthetic gene cluster61. This points to a likely similar mechanism for microcin B17 action wherein it may also trap a temporarily open gyrase complex.Fig. 5Mechanistic model of gyrase inhibition by albicidin.a, Initial state: an apo-gyrase complex. b, G-segment DNA fragment is engaged and bound. c, T-segment DNA fragment is captured by the ATPase domains of GyrB and the DNA is cleaved. d, The T-segment is transported through the enzyme, stimulated by the ATP binding (blue hexagons), causing dimerization of the ATPase domains. e, The T-segment is transported to the bottom chamber of the enzyme and the DNA has to be religated to release the T-segment.

Albicidin derivatives, particularly of the Albi-1 or Albi-3 type, have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in animal infection models26. The \u03b13/\u03b13\u2032 binding pocket is unique and does not overlap with any other known classes of topoisomerase inhibitors. The most potent derivatives Albi-1 and Albi-3 have nanomolar activity in cleavage complex stabilization against Gram-negative E. coli gyrase, and are more potent than NBTIs. Compared to the parent compound, they also stabilize a high proportion of cleaved complexes for all tested gyrase variants apart from the WT which means albicidins can be successfully chemically modified to escape target-mediated resistance. Similarly to FQs, albicidins target both gyrase and Topo IV in bacteria, which makes resistance harder to develop; whilst the activity of current derivatives against Topo IV is lower, it could be arguably improved with future modifications. The emergence of knock-out mutants of the nucleoside transporter Tsx, which is hijacked by albicidins to enter into Gram-negative bacteria, is somewhat alarming. However, we do not assess this as a significant liability because the tsx mutations provide only limited resistance62.", "For successful clinical application of albicidins, their properties such as solubility, plasma stability and plasma-protein binding can be improved while toxicity towards eukaryotic topoisomerase II should be monitored. Our work now enables a rational structure-based design which preserves albicidin\u2019s distinct and potent inhibition mechanism."]
