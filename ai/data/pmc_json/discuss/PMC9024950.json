["4. Discussion", "Algicidal bacteria have gained growing attention since discovery of their advantageous low cost and species-specific features for controlling harmful algal blooms [25,26,27]. However, the interactions between algicidal bacteria and the toxic bloom-causing dinoflagellates have received limited attention, especially for the relationship between A. pacificum and algicidal bacteria. In this study, a high-efficiency algicidal strain Shewanella Y1 (against A. pacificum) was isolated from Jiaozhou Bay, China. Our results demonstrated that the Shewanella Y1 indirectly exerted a strong algicidal effect on A. pacificum by secreting extracellular algicidal substance. The Y1 filtrate caused a series of changes of A. pacificum, including decreased cell density, cellular degradation, impaired physiological activities, and strong oxidative damage. These results will foster our understanding of bacterium\u2013protist interactions in the marine ecosystem, which will be helpful for estimating the ecological role of this algicidal bacterium and its potential use as a microbial control agent for HABs.", "The known algicidal bacteria against A. tamarense or A. pacificum (previously Alexandrium catenella) are mainly Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Flavobacterium, Joostella, Deinococcus, Brevibacterium, and Bacillus (Table 1). Isolate Shewanella IRI-160 was obtained from the inlet of Indian River Bay, Delaware, which was the first reported bacterium of the genus Shewanella to have algicidal effects on phytoplankton. Shewanella IRI-160 exerted strong algae-killing effects on naked dinoflagellates (algicidal rate more than 85%, 48 h), such as Karlodinium veneficum, Karenia brevis and Gyrodinium instriatum, but the effects on thecate dinoflagellates, such as Prorocentrum minimum, Oxyrrhis marina, and A. tamarense were insignificant (algicidal rate less than 35%, 48 h) [43,45]. Shewanella Y1 displayed strong algicidal activity against A. pacificum and A. tamarense in the present study. Although the algicidal effect of IRI-160 filtrate was not evaluated for the thecate dinoflagellate, A. pacificum, it can be reasonably inferred that the algicidal effect of IRI-160 filtrate on A. pacificum is inefficent based on the different algicidal trends of Shewanella IRI-160 between the naked dinoflagellates and armored dinoflagellates. Future studies will test whether this assumption is true. Therefore, Shewanella Y1 is the first record of a Shewanella bacterium being algicidal to the harmful dinoflagellate A. pacificum.", "Y1 strain showed a higher algicidal rate on A. pacificum than other tested algal species in the present study, indicating that A. pacificum was a preferred target. Different strains of algicidal bacteria indicated various degrees of species specificity ranging from highly species-specific [54], to broadly specific [31]. The algicidal activity of Y1 filtrate against thecate dinoflagellate (A. pacificum or A. tamarense) was higher than that of naked dinoflagellate (Karenia mikimotoi), which is in agreement with a previous study [55]. Alteromonas FDHY-03 was proven to lyse Prorocentrum donghaiense (>90% algicidal rate in 24 h) by secreting an algicidal compound, glycosidase [55]. However, for P. donghaiense, Shewanella Y1 only showed 20.36 \u00b1 0.65% algicidal rate in 24 h. Thus, it can be ruled out that the glucosidase played a major role in Shewanella Y1\u2019s exertion of algicidal effects on target algae. Although there appears to be no clear mode of prey specificity for algicidal bacteria based on various studies [26], bacteria-produced algicidal substances could be a candidate for the selective inhibition of HABs.", "Adding only the filtrate or exudate from the bacterial culture was used to distinguish between direct or indirect attack. Our algicidal mode experiment showed that the Y1 filtrate had algicidal activity similar to that of the Y1 cultures, but the washed bacterial pellets cultures showed dramatically lower algicidal activity, suggesting that strain Y1 indirectly attacks A. pacificum by secreting extracellular algicidal substances. Various algicidal strains have been classified based on their algicidal modes; while approximately 70% of the strains exhibited indirect algicidal attacks, the remaining exhibited direct algicidal attacks [27,28]. It is worth noting that individual strains showed both direct and indirect algicidal attacks [45,56]. Current data indicate that Proteobacteria are typically involved in indirect attacks, even though there is no clear link between bacterial class and algicidal mode [26,28]. The evident algicidal activity in the filtrate suggested that these strains could suppress algal cells via an indirect attack by releasing extracellular algicidal substances such as proteins, enzymes, or biological surfactants [57,58,59,60]. However, the number of identified algicidal substances is remarkably lower than that of reported algicidal bacteria, which may be attributed to a limitation in the separation and purification methods and identification technology for algicidal compounds.", "In the filtrate-added cultures, the three key photosynthetic parameters showed a significant decrease compared with that of control cultures over the experimental period, suggesting that the photosynthetic activities were significantly suppressed. Impaired photosynthesis could block the electron transport, which would promote electron spillage and cause a significant increase in ROS production [61,62]. The elevated ROS in algal cells could cause significant dysfunction of physiological and metabolic processes, which could damage the crucial biomacromolecules including DNA, lipids, and proteins [42]. The ROS level in filtrate-added cultures was significantly higher than that of control cultures. The CAT and SOD activities and GSH contents were significantly enhanced at 1 h inoculation, suggesting that CAT, SOD, and GSH were activated to resist oxidative stress. Under the self-resistance of algal cells, the ROS level began to decrease after 2 h, but the effect was not completely alleviated. The MDA contents of A. pacificum after exposure to Y1 filtrate increased significantly in a short time, resulting in oxidative damage of membrane system (including plasma membrane and thylakoid membrane) and death of algal cells. These results suggested that Y1 filtrate could inhibit photosynthetic activities, induce the production of a large amount of ROS, cause oxidative damage to the membrane system, and eventually lead to cell rupture and death."]
