["3. Discussion", "Natural product libraries obtained from bacteria, fungi or plant are central for drug discovery [50]. Considering that secondary metabolites can be tightly regulated, laboratory culture conditions can be challenging to induce the expression of all or almost all metabolites encoded by the genome of bacteria or fungi, in order to obtain a representative library. There are numerous possibilities to be explored in culture conditions to mimic the natural environment, including pH, temperature, time of incubation, media composition and chemical elicitors [17]. The latter were explored in the present study, being systematically investigated by new methods of library preparation and analyses (Figure 1).", "To obtain the EPfB chemical library presented in this work, a preliminary screening on agar plates was first established to select the most suitable chemical elicitor that would induce changes in colony morphology or populational variants, potentially mimicking the natural habitat and competitors of bacteria under laboratory conditions. Results obtained and presented in Figure 2 demonstrated how each strain growth was modulated by a specific elicitor. From this test, the most promising chemical elicitors were selected for large scale cultivation in liquid media aiming to induce the expression and to extract cryptic secondary metabolites. As shown, the chosen elicitors did in fact expand the chemical space of the library and gave access to a reservoir of small molecules that could not have been produced under normal culture conditions (please see also the Supplementary Materials for an analysis of chemical elicitors per bacterial strain). Bacterial cultivation on agar plates is a low-cost and accessible approach for screening multiple chemical elicitors in the process of preparing bacterial natural product libraries and should be used as a guide in selecting chemical elicitors for large-scale growth.", "Bacterial crude extracts were obtained and fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography to construct the library, as enriched fractions are more suitable to perform high throughput biological screenings [51] and LC-MS/MS data collection [23,24]. Indeed, fractionation of the crude extracts evidenced about 90% of the bacterial metabolites (Figure 3c) and the biological activity (Table 1) detected from the samples comprising the EPfB chemical library.", "The NP3 MS workflow was applied to extract the [M + H]+ MS/MS consensus spectra relative to bacterial metabolites, retaining the information of the sample of origin, its biological activity and chromatographic information. Finally, the GNPS and UNPD-ISDB databases were used to identify the [M + H]+ consensus spectra and the NP3 MS workflow selected the top results based on theMS/MS spectra matching scores. Improvements in MS/MS data mining tools are being pursued in the current literature [21,22,23,47]. Although none of them are currently perfect at retrieving the correct [M + H]+ ions or the correct identification of compounds from MS/MS spectra databases, untargeted metabolomics have increasingly proven to be a valuable asset for mining compound collections and comparing of biological groups.", "The [M + H]+ consensus spectra retrieved from the EPfB library by the NP3 MS workflow were counted in each bacterial group, revealing that the elicitation of bacterial cultures had almost doubled (~45%) the number of compounds detected in the data set (Figure 3a). Analysis of the library\u2019s [M + H]+ consensus spectra in comparison with databases revealed that most (63%) of these spectra were new to the MS/MS public collections accessed, half of them (49%) being only observed in the elicited growth conditions. Compound novelty was expected from the deep-sea bacteria collection used for the construction of the EPfB library. However, the use of the chemical elicitors further increased the number and the novelty of the metabolites produced ex situ, further highlighting the importance of chemical elicitation of bacterial cultures when prospecting novel bacterial natural products.", "The SSMN (Figure 4) was constructed using the [M + H]+ MS/MS consensus spectra, giving a global visualization of the compound diversity introduced by chemical elicitation (Figure 4a). Clusters of compounds linked to bacterial metabolites were detected under specific growth conditions (Figure 4b). SSMNs have been extensively used in the last few years by the natural products community [23], and indeed represent a powerful tool to overview the chemical diversity contained, and to dereplicate unpurified natural product chemical samples. Groups of related compounds could be detected under specific growth conditions (Figure 5), highlighting rare bioactive compounds, such as tryptoquivaline K, the polyketide K-3, the macrolactam verticilactam and triterpenoid derivatives. Small clusters of non-identified spectra were also observed, potentially representing new series of compounds introduced by deep-sea bacteria and chemical elicitation, which might drive the discovery of novel natural products for drug development and chemical ecology.", "Finally, the chemical space occupied by compounds identified from the EPfB library were compared to the natural products (UNPD-ISDB) and to the drug (Drug Bank, approved drugs) chemical spaces. The identified compounds cover the chemical space of drugs (Figure 6). Importantly, bacterial metabolites were shown to avoid the Lipinski\u2019s failures region (Q2), which is partially occupied by known natural products. The bacterial collection further concentrated nitrogenated compounds (Q3), which are important molecular features of drugs. Overall, the compounds identified in the EPfB library span the chemical space of approved drugs, bringing chemical diversity in the relevant biological space. What is worth noticing is that the bioactive fractions derived from the biological screenings reported here concentrate compounds at Q3 and Q4, highlighting the importance of these regions of the chemical space also for in vitro bioactivity.", "However, the abovementioned analyses were carried out with less than 40% of the bacterial metabolites identified from the EPfB library as MS/MS spectra database matches, from which chemical descriptors could be extracted. Part of the remaining [M + H]+ consensus spectra in our collection could be linked to at least one identified compound, covering 65% (71/109) of the SSMN clusters, further landmarking the chemical space covered by the EPfB library (Figure 7a). Non-identified analogues were concentrated at Q3 and Q4, most of the series minor compounds being modulated by chemical elicitors (Figure 7b).", "The analyses presented in Figure 6 and Figure 7 complemented well the SSMN evaluation, grouping the identified compounds and their potential analogues by chemical descriptors, independent of their spectra similarities. This assisted the characterization of the chemical space covered by the EPfB library. In particular, Q3\u2014a diverse and relevant chemical space of drugs\u2014shows nitrogen-rich compounds of moderate molecular complexity, derived from spectra matches from fractions of different bacteria, especially in the elicited and control exclusive growth conditions. Since this region concentrates small modified peptides, it is possible that NRPS and mixed NRPS biosynthetic pathways are directly affected by chemical elicitors.", "The additional analyses of the EPfB library per strain, detailed in the Supplementary Materials, further revealed that all the chemical elicitors used modulated the production of metabolites in all bacterial strains. The effect of a given chemical elicitor appeared to be strain dependent, it being the contribution of metabolites induced by the chemical elicitor variable according to the bacterial strain. The bacterial strains further responded differently to the distinct chemical elicitors used, with a particular chemical elicitor being more effective in introducing non-redundant and novel metabolites by a given strain. Therefore, testing and selecting more than one chemical elicitor for a given bacterial strain growth under laboratory conditions is important towards the production of the maximum number of metabolites possible for a particular strain."]
