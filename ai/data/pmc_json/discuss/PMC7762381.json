["4. Discussion", "Bacterial species belonging to the Burkholderia genus include pathogenic and non pathogenic members [27]. Some Burkholderia species cause human or plant diseases, like B. pseudomallei and B. mallei are primary pathogens of animals and humans [51,52]; and B. caryophylli and B. gladioli are known as plant pathogens [51,52,53]. B. gladioli was also reported as a human pathogen [13,33]. On the other hand, good members of the Burkholderia genus can degrade environmental pollutions (pesticide or other contaminants) and secrete important secondary metabolites (antibiotics). B. phenoliruptrix sp. nov. can degrade pesticide [54] and B. xenovorans LB400 can degrade polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), a type of soil pollutants [55]. Burkholderia sp. MSSP and B. gladioli possess antifungal properties, likely by secreting toxoflavin or gladiolin [33]. Therefore, it is not easy to make an immediate conclusion about whether a newly-isolated Burkholderia strain is pathogenic or beneficial.", "In this study, we isolated the B. gladioli strain CGB10 from sugarcane leaves, and sequenced and analyzed its genome to elucidate the mechanism of its antagonistic activity against sugarcane smut fungus S. scitamineum. In comparison to 21 Burkholderia strains with genome sequence available on NCBI, CGB10 has 763 core genes that are common in the 22 analyzed genomes, and 520 specific genes that are only present in the CGB10 genome. Even the closest B. gladioli strain (ATCC 10248) has 489 specific genes that are not shared with CGB10. Therefore, it needs extra caution before we conclude whether CGB10 is a pathogen or not, although some B. gladioli strains were known as a plant or human pathogens.", "Five secondary metabolic gene clusters were predicted in CGB10\u2032s genome but we could not detect them by LC-MS, in this study. It could not be ruled out that the current cultivation condition may not be optimal for the biosynthesis of each of these five predicted metabolites. But under the same cultivation condition that CGB10 could effectively suppress filamentous growth of several fungal pathogens, these five secondary metabolites were not detected, indicating that they are at least not the major contributor to CGB10\u2032s antifungal activity. On the other hand, toxoflavin may be responsible for CGB10\u2032s antifungal activity. In comparison to two toxoflavin-producing Buhrholderia strain, B. glumae BGR1 and B. gladioli BSR3, the arrangement of CGB10\u2019s toxoflavin synthesis gene cluster has some unique characteristics. B. glumae BGR1 possesses one-copy of regulator gene ToxJ, located approximal to the Tox F-I cluster on tig1 (chromosome 1). B. gladioli BSR3\u2032s ToxJ is not located on the same chromosome (chromosome 1) as Tox A-E and Tox F-I cluster, but on another chromosome (chromosome 2) [24,56]. Instead of one, CGB10 genome has two predicted ToxJ gene, both located on a different chromosome from other Tox genes, adding complexity to the regulation of toxoflavin biosynthesis and transport in CGB10. It remains to be functionally validated which (or any) copy of CGB10 ToxJ actually regulates toxoflavin transport by inducing Tox F-I expression.", "It has been reported that quorum sensing (QS) regulates toxoflavin biosynthesis in Burkholderia strain, as the KACC11889 strain has complete toxoflavin synthetic gene clusters but cannot secrete toxoflavin, due to its lack of QS cluster Tof I-M-R [57]. Therefore, we also compared Tof I-M-R clusters in CGB10, B. glumae BGR1 and B. gladioli BSR3. We found that the structure of Tof I-M-R cluster in CGB10 is similar to that of the known pathogen B. gladioli BSR3, only that BSR3 has two sets of such Tof I-M-R, while CGB10 has only one. The extra set of Tof I-M-R leads to a more complex function in rice pathogen BRS3 [58] and may account for its virulence regulation.", "Potential pathogenic genes were screened from the CGB10 genome by various methods. But our pathogenicity assays using different plant materials demonstrated that CGB10 may not be virulent to plants as other established pathogenic bacteria, except that it suppressed rice seeds germination. Toxoflavin has been reported as a phytotoxin on rice seeds [24], and its antifungal or virulent effect is dose-dependent [34]. We infer that toxoflavin is also responsible for CGB10-based suppression of rice seed germination, and this reminds us to be extra cautious when applying CGB10 as a biocontrol agent against plant disease.", "In the field experiment, CGB10 showed an ideal biocontrol effect on sugarcane smut. CGB10 displayed no significant suppression on sugarcane growth, likely due to the fact that it is an endophyte isolated from sugarcane. The concentration of CGB10 fermentation product to the soil is approximately 2 \u00d7 106 cell/cm2, likely to be a concentration that is low or not toxic to a plant, animal, or human. Although B. gladioli strains have been well known as pathogens of plants and/or humans [40,59], recent work has demonstrated that some B. gladioli strains live endophytically within plants without causing any disease symptoms but displaying antifungal activity towards plant fungal pathogens [43]. We infer that such plant-endophytic B. gladioli strains may not be harmful to humans as they reside in the crop plants that are in close contact with agricultural practitioners. CGB10 may fall into the category of beneficial B. gladioli strains, as it was isolated from sugarcane leaves, and exhibits a broad-spectrum antifungal activity. Particularly, it strongly suppresses sugarcane smut caused by S. scitamineum under laboratory and field conditions. In conclusion, our study identified a B. gladioli strain that could potentially be used as a biocontrol agent against sugarcane smut, but specific evaluation for its potential virulence towards animal or human cells is surely required before application of CGB10 and/or its related products in crop protection."]
