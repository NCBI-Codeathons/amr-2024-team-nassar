["4. Discussion", "Oral insulin is the most attractive choice to eliminate the necessity of subcutaneous insulin therapy [30]. As mentioned earlier, the most promising concept for oral insulin delivery is based on attaching the insulin molecule to a \u201ccargo\u201d that carries it through the GI tract. For that, the \u201ccargo\u201d or \u201ccarrier\u201d itself has to pass all the criteria for an oral delivery candidate. Several papers reported polymeric nanoparticle as carriers for insulin [3,4,5,6]. The concept of complexing insulin molecules with inorganic salt particles based on ionic interactions is a relatively new one, having enormous potential [22]. Ba salt particles (BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3) have both positive and negative charged domains conferred, respectively, by cations (Ba2+) and anions (SO42\u2212, SO32\u2212, and CO32\u2212). Due to heterogeneous charge distribution, these particles are capable of binding peptide molecules like insulin through electrostatic interactions. The target protein molecule here is insulin (5.8 kDa) which also has localized surface charges either positive or negative at basic or acidic pH. These surface charges of insulin likely allowed it to electrostatically bind with either cationic or anionic charges of Ba salt particles, depending on the pH of the solution. However, the challenge was whether Ba salt particles could resist a harsh GIT environment and allow insulin molecules to pass through the intestinal wall [31,32]. This is the first study to explore the potential of Ba salt particles as oral delivery carriers for insulin.", "A series of in vitro tests were carried out in GIT-mimicking conditions, before investigating the effect of orally administered insulin-loaded particles on hyperglycemia in diabetic Wister\u2013Kyoto rats (WKY). GIT itself is a large and complex organ system where each different chamber has its own pH and enzymatic environment. Orally administrated protein therapeutics often show poor bioavailability due to the physical as well as physiological barriers imposed by the GIT. One of the biggest challenges is protein degradation by the extreme acidic pH of the stomach. The second prominent barrier is the enzymatic degradation in both the stomach and intestine. Even after successfully bypassing the stomach pH and enzymatic action, the protein-loaded particles or the released proteins are supposed to encounter mucin of the GI lining [33], prior to crossing the epithelium either via transcellular or paracellular route to reach the blood circulation.", "4.1. Characterization and Morphological Screening of Empty Ba Salt Particles", "Three different Ba salt particles were characterized with FTIR to identify the functional groups of the respective particles, and EDX to detect the various elements present in those particles, thus confirming the identity of each particle type.", "4.2. Particle Stability Assessment", "Particle stability study was important to understand how efficiently Ba salt particles could resist harsh pHs, and thus, predict which of the Ba salt particles among BaSO4, BaSO3, and BaCO3 would show the highest potential as an oral carrier. Successful oral delivery can only take place if the formulations are resistant enough in fluctuating stomach pH. Another important factor in oral delivery is stomach and intestinal residence time. Depending on the particle properties, the residence time inside the gut could vary from 20 min to 3 h [34]. An ideal oral delivery carrier must be resistant to both basic and acidic pHs within that time-frame. The stomach has fluctuating pH which can vary from pH 1.7 to 4.7 [35], whereas intestinal pH is around 6\u20138 [35].", "In vitro tests were done to see whether the particles are capable of sustaining in a wide range of pHs over a certain period. As mentioned at the beginning, these particles are new and at the time of the study, properties were mostly unknown. It was important to check their response towards pH and enzymatic activity separately as well as combined. DMEM media composition is suitable for sustaining any biological molecules, like, proteins. At the same time, DMEM can accommodate pH change to a wide range. The particles (free and insulin bound) were exposed to DMEM prepared with a wide range of pH to study their self-resistance as well as resistance to hold a protein molecule against drastic pH change (described in Section 4.3). Turbidity which is measured as absorbance at 320nm increases as particle formation is accelerated and decreases as particle formation is inhibited or particle dissolution takes place. Particles were prepared at pH 7.8 and then exposed to lower pHs. The in vitro tests showed that BaSO4 particles had the highest synthesis rate at pH of 7.8, as well as the best resistance at all pHs throughout the period of 3 h, followed by BaCO3 and BaSO3 particles. All three formulations seemed to be suitable as oral delivery carriers based on their pH resistance.", "4.3. Insulin Loading Efficiency of Ba Salt Particles and Subsequent Release of Insulin from Particles at Lower pHs", "The fluorometric assay was performed with a fixed amount of FITC-insulin added prior to the formation of insulin-loaded particles. The portion of the added FITC-insulin absorbed by the particles were later separated in a pellet form by centrifugation. All 3 Ba salt particles showed very good insulin loading efficiency (80\u2013100%). And insulin-loaded particles were found to be stable while gradually reducing pH to 5.0, with almost no release of insulin from the complex. At pH < 5 different degrees of insulin release were observed. Insulin release from BaSO4 particles was 30% even in very harsh acidic pH, implying that this particular nano-insulin formulation would be stable inside the stomach regardless of fed or fasting state. However, BaSO3 and BaCO3 particles with loaded insulin showed almost 80\u2013100% release in acidic pH of nearly 1.0.", "The capability of the Ba salt particles in protecting protein molecules was further assessed using albumin protein against different pHs and enzymatic effects. The data generated with albumin has been presented in supplementary figures (Supplementary Figures S2\u2013S4) and discussed in detail.", "4.4. Morphological Analysis of Ba Salt Particle by FE-SEM", "FE-SEM image analysis confirmed the formation of Ba salt particles and revealed their morphology with regards to size, shape, and aggregation pattern. The images also showed the morphological changes of particle clusters while being loaded with insulin, confirming successful insulin loading of the particles. Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 are added with higher resolution micrographs, demonstrating in detail the morphological changes of BaSO4 particles owing to insulin binding.", "4.5. Assessment of Mucin Adhesion to Ba Salt Particles", "Mucin of GI lining is considered as the primary barrier for any molecule to cross the intestinal lining and reach the systemic circulation. Indeed, secreted mucin along with the contents of the gut creates an intestinal fluid environment [36]. Therefore, orally delivered insulin-loaded Ba salt particles will be in contact with mucin while crossing the intestinal lining. In vitro tests were done to predict whether the particles would be capable of crossing the intestinal lining. Particle adhesion to mucin was analyzed with FT-IR and Bradford protein assay kit, with FT-IR bands showing characteristic peaks for both Ba salts particle and mucin, and the protein assay reconfirming mucin adhesion to the particles quantitatively. All three Ba salt particles were found to have high mucin adhesion (60\u2013100%).", "4.6. Effect of Orally Administrated Nano-Insulin on Hyperglycemia", "For oral delivery, particle formulations were prepared in 20\u00d7 concentrated form to efficiently load high insulin (100 IU/kg) dose. All three formulations of Ba salt particles with loaded insulin showed a significant reduction in blood glucose levels. The effect generated during oral administration of insulin-loaded particles was surprisingly similar to the effect noticed for subcutaneous delivery of commercial human insulin aspart, only lasting 4\u20135 h with a maximum drop in blood glucose level during 2\u20133 h. The onset of the action on hyperglycemia started at 1 h for the oral nano-insulin formulation, which could be due to the required transport time for insulin-loaded particles to reach the blood stream. The percentage of reduction of blood glucose level in comparison to the baseline level showed the maximum reduction below 50% at any time point for all 3 Ba salt particles. The newly designed Ba salt/Insulin showed a visible significant effect on hyperglycemia at doses of 100 IU/Kg and % reduction in blood glucose is less than 50%.", "In vitro insulin loading and mucin adhesion profile were promising from all three Ba salt particles, however, in vitro stability and protection from pH and enzymatic activity data showed stronger protection from BaSO4 and BaCO3 particles towards protein molecule compared to BaSO3 particle. In vivo activity in diabetic rats also reflected that. Although the BaSO3 particle also successfully reduced blood glucose levels, there were fluctuations and inconsistencies in the reduction pattern between the animals which ultimately affected the significance of the finding. Notably, this inconsistency was also observed for the other two particles in a lower dose of insulin (50 IU/kg, data not shown here). The authors believe BaSO3 loaded insulin might show a significant and consistent reduction of blood glucose at much higher doses. In summary, BaSO3 loaded insulin is less efficient compared to BaSO4 and BaCO3 particle loaded oral insulin. However, there is plenty of room for improvement for these formulations.", "A common problem with potential oral insulin formulations from the literature is the low bioavailability and requirement for very high doses [6,7,37]. This is because of degradation in the GI tract and low percentage of intestinal crossing mainly. The onset, duration of action, and maximum reduction of blood glucose level vary a lot from formulation to formulation due to properties and diversified mechanism of action of the particle or system used as DDS for insulin molecule. Wu et.al. reported, insulin loaded PLGA/RS nanoparticles (50 IU/kg) showed a slow decrease after a lag phase of 4 h with no visible effect. The maximum blood glucose reduction was in 10 h (32%) and the effect lasted for 24 h [6]. Pan et al. (2002) reported the effectiveness of positively charged CS-NP that was bound to insulin at doses 21 IU/kg and hypoglycemia prolonged for 15 h. There was no reporting of % decrease of blood glucose level [7]. Another nanoparticle (NP) loaded insulin system composed of chitosan (CS) and poly(g-glutamic acid) reported an extended period of activity of insulin aspart when loaded in NP. NP loaded insulin aspart was given orally in a similar manner to Ba salt insulin administration reported in this paper. However, the effect was observed as peak-less prolonged reduction of blood glucose. The formulation loaded with insulin aspart, which is originally a short-acting human insulin analog. Interestingly in NP loaded form oral administration of it showed an effect similar to subcutaneous intermediate-acting formulations available in the market. The effect was an observer at doses of 30 IU/kg and reduction of blood glucose level was never more than 30\u201340% [37].", "There could be several factors involved that can influence any nanoparticle-mediated insulin formulation. In general nanoparticle binding towards protein is effected/influenced by surface charge, crystallinity, size of nanoparticle as well as insulin molecule. On the other hand, oral delivery of nanoparticle loaded insulin depends on size, lipophilicity, surface charge, and resistance of the carrier molecule. The reported Ba salt insulin formulations are at an early stage. As new formulations, they are in vivo profile of GI transport and activity in the blood are unknown. Although, quick onset with the same duration of action as native insulin aspart indicates a unique in vivo profile. The formulations are under study for their details on in vivo mechanisms of action and improvement of pharmacokinetic parameters at present."]
