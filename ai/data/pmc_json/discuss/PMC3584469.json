["Discussion", "The overall aim of this work was to expand our\nknowledge of the regulation of antibiotic production\nin Streptomyces (the producer of two thirds of\nall known microbial antibiotics). Genetic engineering\nof the clavulanic acid producing strains could\nbe done afterwards, in order to increase the capacity\nof clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus.\nIt has been reported that cdaR, the regulatory gene\nfor the production of a calcium dependent antibiotic\n(CDA), positively regulates its own transcription.\nAs a result, introducing extra copies of cdaR\ninto different strains of Streptomyces coelicolor\nMT1110, S. coelicolor 2377 and Streptomyces\nlividans has led to overproduction of this antibiotic\n(41). Designing novel antibiotics, on the other\nhand, is greatly dependent on the structural analysis\nof the gene cluster for each antibiotic. Clavulanic\nacid is a multi-billion-dollar per annum product\nuseful for its \u03b2-lactamase inhibitory activity.\nWhile the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid has been\nthe subject of intense investigation in recent years,\nthe details of its production and regulation are still\nnot completely worked out.", "Amplification of the ccaR gene, a regulatory gene\nin the cephamycin gene cluster, resulted in an almost\nthreefold increase in the production of both\ncephamycin and clavulanic acid in S. clavuligerus\n(20). The formation of clavulanic acid is controlled\nby a LysR-type regulatory protein encoded by the\nclaR gene. The claR gene was then chosen because\nthis is a putative regulatory gene in the production\npathway of clavulanic acid (33). The claR gene,\nwhich is located downstream from the gene encoding\nclavaminate synthase in the clavulanic acid\nbiosynthesis gene cluster, is involved in regulation\nof the late steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis\n(32-34).\n. Amplification of the claR gene using\nmulti-copy plasmids and under its own promoter\nin S. clavuligerus results in a three-fold increase in\nclavulanic acid production(31).", "We precisely amplified the coding sequence of claR\naccompanied with its promoter by using a specifically\ndesigned primer and an error proof PCR. In\nthis case, only the promoter sequence of the gene\ncomes with the claR. Since the distance between the vector born promoter and the claR transcription\nstart point is not too great, the expression of\nthe cloned gene could also be started by two individual\npromoters that exist in the vector. Therefore,\nthe usage of three promoters (one native claR\ngene and two vector-born) leads to an elevated\nlevel of claR gene expression. Prior to this study\nand in contrast to other regulatory genes in S. clavuligerus,\n claR has not been isolated by PCR, but\nhas been previously cloned via restriction enzyme\ndigestion (31). For the first time, in the present\nstudy, the claR gene was isolated from an Iranian\nstrain of S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705. The PCR isolated\nclaR was initially compared with the claR sequence\nof S. clavuligerus DSM 738, using nested\nPCR and restriction digestion analysis. The claR\nisolated from the S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705 was\nfinally sequenced. Thus the entire sequence of S.\nclavuligerus claR was determined. The sequencing\ndata was subjected to bioinformatics analysis\nfor further comparison with the claR sequence of\nS. clavuligerus 738 and other species. Complete\nsimilarity was found between the sequence of\nclaR isolated from PTCC 1705 andS. clavuligerus\nDSM 738.", "In our previous work, claR was ligated into a Streptomyces\nspecific vector, pMA::hyg (39). However\nthat vector does not have any inducible promoter.\nOn the other hand, pMA::hyg does not contain any\nother cut sites for other restriction enzymes (39),\nso the subcloning of claR was practically impossible.\nTo overcome these problems, new primers\nwere designed with new incorporated cut sites for\nBamHI and ClaI. The amplified claR was then\ncloned in E.coli by using a newly constructed\nvector called pZSclaR (Fig 4). This unique vector\ncontains a greatly expanded multiple cloning\nsite (MCS), which makes it suitable for different\npurposes of gene cloning. Furthermore, this new\nconstruct is expression and inducible. In the same\nway, increasing the copy number of certain clavulanic\nacid-specific biosynthetic genes, by the introduction\nof multiple copy expression plasmids,\nresulted in positive effects on the production of\nclavulanic acid (42)."]
