["Discussion", "Meristem activity determines the aging of perennials at the whole-plant level, and a key feature of the tree lifestyle is the ability to maintain meristem indeterminacy (1). Frequently, mature woody trees cannot increase their height after a certain age mainly because the shoot apical meristem of old trees is usually damaged by natural stresses (16). The vascular cambium, on the other hand, can ensure both increased tree girth and annual renewal of vascular tissues over a tree\u2019s lifespan, thus most mature trees are increasing in girth and production of branches, but are no longer getting taller (17). Our comparative analysis revealed that the number of cambial cell layers gradually decreased from VC20 to VC600. In parallel, the ring widths decreased dramatically in the first 200 y, and more slowly during the next few hundred years. Although the ring widths decreased in old trees, it is noteworthy that the BAI did not show a declining trend from 10- to 600-y-old G. biloba trees. Since BAI is a reliable indicator of tree growth (18\u201320), it seems that the vascular cambium in G. biloba can retain the capacity for continuous growth for hundreds of years or even millennia.", "Cell division is one of the key processes taking place in the cambial zone, and the number of cell layers in the cambial zone decreased in old G. biloba trees. Several regulatory genes of cambial meristem activity and markers of cell division have been identified (21\u201323). Reduced expression levels of several genes related to cell division, expansion, and differentiation, as well as miR166/165-mediated cleavage of HD-ZIPIII, decreased IAA synthesis, and increased ABA synthesis, all accompanied the lower cambial activity and slowed radial growth in old Ginkgo trees (Fig. 7 A and E).", "Fig. 7.Schematic representation of the balance between aging and growth.

Ally et al. (24) found that the reduction with age in the number of viable pollen grains in Populus tremuloides suggested that old clonal trees would lose sexual function with respect to pollen quantity and quality between \u223c500 and 20,000 y. We found that, 20-, 200-, and 600-y-old trees displayed similar leaf areas, leaf photosynthetic efficiencies, and seed germination rates (Fig. 7B), in contrast to previous reports of decreased growth rates and reproductive capacity during aging (25, 26). Moreover, in old male G. biloba trees, there is no significant decline in male fertility with age, and male trees over 1,000 y old still maintain high pollen productivity and viability (27). Similarly, many 1,000-y-old G. biloba female trees can produce a large number of seeds every year in China (28). We propose that continuous growth of the cambial cells may enable G. biloba to escape senescence at the whole-plant level.", "Senescence, comprising the final stage of development during the aging process, is generally accompanied by massive changes in the transcriptome. Previously, two plant-specific transcription factor families WRKY and NAC were found to be major regulators of senescence in plants and, at the posttranscriptional level, miR164 and miR319 can control leaf senescence through targeting ORE1 and TCP, respectively (10). Here, we found that some senescence-associated genes of the WRKY, NAC, and MYB families were not differentially expressed with age among the different G. biloba trees. Moreover, expression of almost all of the senescence/age-related miRNAs, including miR164, miR319, miR172, and miR156, and their targets did not show changes with age. In particular, the transcript levels of several autophagy-related genes did not decline with age. Based on the fact that there was no consistently higher expression of senescence-related genes in old trees (Fig. 7 C and E), we conclude that the old tree of G. biloba is in a healthy mature state and senescence is not manifested at the whole-plant level.", "Perennial plants need to cope with changing environments and pathogens over their lifespans, and some may die due to biotic and environmental stresses such as bark beetles and intense drought (17, 20). Thus, ability to defend against biotic and abiotic stress is a major contributor to successful long life in perennial trees. There are 62 members of the FLS2 and EF-Tu receptor (EFR) resistance gene families in G. biloba, considerably higher than the number reported in Arabidopsis (29). By RNA sequencing, we found transcripts corresponding to 457 R genes in G. biloba trees of different ages; of these, 220 NBS-LRR genes and 15 FLS2 genes showed no obvious expression difference between young and old trees (Fig. 7 D and E). Thus, this long-lived perennial appears to maintain resistance to external stress via the persistent expression of a large number of R genes.", "Xylem formation usually is characterized by the activation of metabolic pathways which lead to the formation of the phenolic polymer lignin to make the trees dense in support of increasing size. Trees also produce antimicrobial and antioxidant secondary metabolites, such as flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids, in response to stresses (30, 31). For example, pinoresinol is one of the structurally simplest lignans, frequently present in woody plants as a defensive agent due to its antihelminthic and antifungal activity (32), and many stilbenoids and flavonoids have been isolated from heartwood and bark of many trees. The ratio of heartwood/sapwood increased with age in G. biloba, and the expression of monolignol and flavonoid/stilbene pathway genes was not significantly reduced in old trees. Thus, accumulated protective specialized metabolites from continuous growth may enhance the resistance of long-lived old trees to adapt themselves to different environments."]
