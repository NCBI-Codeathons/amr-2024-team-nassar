["Discussion", "Here, we show that TTX-bearing newts have evolved resistance to their own toxicity through multiple parallel changes in their Nav genes and that, similar to snakes that consume TTX-containing prey (McGlothlin et al. 2016; Perry et al. 2018), some of the resistance in this taxon is ancient, first appearing in an early salamander. However, although substitutions conferring moderate TTX resistance are present in some nontoxic salamander genomes, only the TTX-bearing newts have substitutions conferring high resistance across all six of their Nav paralogs, and several of these channels harbor multiple resistant substitutions in more than one domain. Many of the substitutions conferring resistance to toxic newts are also present in Nav paralogs of TTX-resistant pufferfish (Jost et al. 2008) and snakes (McGlothlin et al. 2016). Similar to pufferfish, newts appear to require resistance within all of their brain/nerve channels in addition to their hearts and muscles. This feature apparently distinguishes toxic prey from their predators, whose brain channels lack resistant substitutions (McGlothlin et al. 2014). This molecular parallelism emphasizes the strong structural and functional constraints on this gene family, which appear to limit the evolution of TTX resistance to a small number of predictable pathways, leading to convergent and parallel changes across multiple taxa (Feldman et al. 2012). We show that the evolution of extreme TTX resistance is accompanied by a shift in signatures of selection in four out of six paralogs, with suggestive evidence of positive selection acting directly on TTX-binding sites. Finally, the evolution of physiological resistance appears to have been facilitated by at least two instances of nonallelic gene conversion, which acted to introduce TTX-resistance substitutions from one paralog (or exon duplicate) to another, providing a rare example of the facilitation of adaptive evolution via nonallelic gene conversion.", "Our reconstruction of the history of TTX resistance in salamanders reveals the ancient origins of moderate resistance in nerve channels Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 and high resistance in the heart channel Nav1.5, which arose \u223c160 Ma. Resistant substitutions in the muscle channel Nav1.4 evolved later, becoming fixed in the clade including all newts and S. salamandra between 75 and 130 Ma. This was followed by the accumulation of additional substitutions in DIII, DIVa, and DIVb of Nav1.4 within members of the highly toxic newt clade, providing their muscles with resistance to much higher concentrations of TTX relative to salamanders lacking these mutations (Hanifin and Gilly 2015). Substitutions in DI conferring extreme TTX resistance to the brain/nerve channels Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 also evolved more recently (\u223c30 Ma) and they are limited to the toxic newt clade with only one exception, Nav1.1 of P. cinereus, which may have arisen independently in this lineage. Toxic newts also have unique substitutions in DIV of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2, which may provide additional resistance to their brain channels or may compensate for structural or functional changes resulting from resistant substitutions in DI or in other regions of the protein. The widespread presence of TTX in modern newts suggests that possession of TTX evolved in the common ancestor of this clade (Hanifin 2010). This is supported by our observation of shared TTX-resistance substitutions across all Nav paralogs in highly toxic newts. However, the highly toxic newts included in this study are limited to North American species and do not include Asian or European newts (e.g., Cynops and Triturus spp.) known to have TTX (Hanifin 2010). Sequencing the Nav genes of these species will reveal if extreme resistance in the nerve channels is specific to North American newts or arose earlier in an ancestral newt species.", "Whether the TTX-resistance substitutions observed in newt relatives are adaptive and what selective pressures act to retain them remains to be determined. In ancestral salamandrids, resistance in three or four of the six Nav proteins may have provided tolerance to low levels of TTX, facilitating the evolution of extreme toxicity in the modern newts, although it is unclear whether these substitutions arose in response to TTX exposure or as a side effect of selection for another aspect of channel function. Environmental exposure to TTX could potentially occur from TTX-bearing prey, such as terrestrial Bipalium flatworms (Stokes et al. 2014) or from TTX-producing bacteria (Vaelli et al. 2020). In a feeding study on B. adventitium flatworms, Ducey et al. (1999) demonstrated that although all salamanders rejected the flatworms when they were first presented, some habituated Ambystoma and Plethodon individuals were able to consume them with only minor symptoms of TTX poisoning, including apparent mucus production and numbing of the mouth. Although the amount of TTX present in the worms was not measured, this observation supports the conjecture that these substitutions play a protective role against consuming toxic prey.", "Our power to detect sites undergoing positive selection was low due to the small number of species available for our analyses and the high sequence conservation among orthologs (Yang et al. 2000; Anisimova et al. 2001). However, our analyses provided evidence consistent with positive selection acting on TTX-binding sites, including sites implicated in the extreme TTX resistance of salamander muscle fibers. Our branch models indicate that several Nav paralogs have higher \u03c9 ratios within the tetrodotoxic newt clade relative to other salamanders. This increase in \u03c9 ratio appears to be mainly the result of relaxed purifying selection rather than positive selection, as few sites were estimated to have \u03c9\u2009>\u20091 by branch-site models. Muscle channel Nav1.4 had the highest \u03c9 ratio in toxic newts, coinciding with a relatively high proportion (\u223c0.06) of sites detected as undergoing positive selection in toxic newts and purifying selection in other salamanders, although the likelihood ratio test was nonsignificant (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). This pattern may derive from ongoing positive selection on Nav1.4 resulting from the coevolutionary arms race between newts and snakes. Increased \u03c9 ratios in toxic newts coincide with the appearance of highly TTX-resistant substitutions within the DI P-loops of Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6, DIV of Nav1.1, and the DIII, DIVa, and DIVb P-loops in Nav1.4. Although the pattern of these substitutions suggests that they are adaptive changes that occurred specifically within the tetrodotoxic newt clade, our branch-site models detected positive selection on TTX-binding sites only within the DIV P-loop of Nav1.1 and the DIII and DIVa P-loops of Nav1.4, whereas our site models detected positive selection on site 401 within paralogs Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 of all salamanders. This may be due to the statistically conservative nature of the branch-site model and the tendency of PAML to detect ongoing diversifying selection rather than rare positive selection events (Yang and dos Reis 2011). Furthermore, the site and branch-site models do not distinguish between biochemically conservative and nonconservative amino acid changes. Nevertheless, the detection of relatively high \u03c9 ratios within the toxic newt clade along with site-specific positive selection at known TTX-binding sites provides strong evidence that these substitutions are adaptive.", "In addition to the six Nav paralogs described in amphibians (Zakon 2012), our sequence data revealed the presence of a partial duplication of the Nav1.4 gene in salamanders that includes the entirety of exon 26, encoding the DIV P-loop, which likely occurred in an ancestor of Salamandroidea. The maintained open reading frame and shared expression patterns of transcripts encoding exons 26a and 26b in A. mexicanum tissues suggests that this duplicate region is functional in salamander muscles. In some insects that feed on toxic plants, the appearance of resistance-conferring substitutions is accompanied by one or more duplications of the genes that the toxin targets (Zhen et al. 2012; Petschenka et al. 2017). Petschenka et al. (2017) show that in at least one species, such gene duplication precedes resistance, and they suggest that gene duplication may help to alleviate the potential decrease in fitness incurred by the insects due to the negative pleiotropic effects of toxin-resistant mutations. Similarly, resistance in DIV of salamander Nav1.4 appears after the duplication of this domain, and only the TTX-bearing newts have resistant substitutions in both exon copies, lending support to this hypothesis and raising the possibility that the evolution of physiological resistance in salamanders may have been mediated in part by this genomic novelty.", "We observed a rare case of the generation of adaptive variants via nonallelic gene conversion, which occurred both between the duplicated exons of Nav1.4 and between paralogs Nav1.1 and Nav1.3. Gene conversion is often thought to play a role in constraint, preserving the core functions of gene families (Chapman et al. 2006) and reducing deleterious mutation loads (Ohta 1989; Khakhlova and Bock 2006), and has also been associated with the diversification of major histocompatibility complex genes in mammals (Kuhner et al. 1991; Go et al. 2003) and the introduction of deleterious nonsynonymous mutations into different parts of the genome (Galtier et al. 2009; Casola et al. 2012). However, the potential for gene conversion to facilitate adaptation is less widely appreciated. Theory suggests that gene duplication and subsequent gene conversion may allow for movement between adaptive peaks via the accumulation of beneficial mutations in one gene copy that can be transferred to a favorable genetic background (Hansen et al. 2000). This process has been implicated in the adaptive evolution of hypoxia tolerance in high-altitude Tibetan wolves (Signore et al. 2019) and in heavy metal tolerance in Arabidopsis (Hanikenne et al. 2013). We observed a rare case of the generation of adaptive variants via nonallelic gene conversion, which occurred both between the duplicated exons of Nav1.4 and between paralogs Nav1.1 and Nav1.3. In the brain channel genes Nav1.1 and Nav1.3, this likely occurred between two genes that had previously evolved resistance, homogenizing the substitutions between the two paralogs in Taricha newts. In the muscle channel gene Nav1.4, three identical amino acids were present within both duplicated DIV TTX-binding domains in toxic newts, whereas only one resistant amino acid was present in a single DIV domain in their nontetrodotoxic salamander relatives, suggesting that resistant substitutions accumulated in one exon copy in a toxic newt ancestor and subsequently spread to the other exon copy via gene conversion. Both Hanifin and Gilly (2015) and Du et al. (2009) have shown that the single resistant amino acid observed in less toxic salamanders confers only low levels of TTX resistance, whereas the combination of the three amino acids found in highly toxic newts confers extreme resistance. As splice variants encoding the alternative exons appear to share similar expression patterns in salamanders, both exon copies should require extreme resistance in species exposed to high TTX concentrations. The concerted evolution of TTX resistance among homologous P-loop domains of Nav1.4 may have expedited the evolution of extreme resistance in newt muscles, requiring new resistant mutations to appear in only one of these domains before being transferred to the other copy.", "The degree of parallel molecular evolution among members of the Nav gene family and across lineages provides insight into the constraints on Nav nucleotide sequence as well as the evolvability of the TTX-resistance phenotype. Our results reveal that similar to their coevolutionary partners, Thamnophis garter snakes, Taricha newts evolved extreme TTX resistance through a stepwise process that built upon ancient changes that were in place millions of years before the arms race began. However, the pattern of TTX resistance evolution in newts also displays important differences from that of their predators. First, perhaps because of the constitutive presence of TTX, newts display extreme levels of resistance even in channels that are expressed in the central nervous system, which are protected by the blood-brain barrier in species that encounter TTX in their diet. Second, our analysis indicates that many substitutions may have become fixed relatively close to one another in evolutionary time within the clade of modern newts. This is in contrast to snakes, where key changes were separated by millions of years. Due to our lack of sampling of newt species outside of North America, however, further work is necessary to understand the timing of these changes on a finer scale. We also show that although positive selection appears to be a strong driving force of the evolution of TTX auto-resistance in newts, gene conversion may have sped up the process of adaptive evolution in some Nav paralogs, and constraints have limited the possible locations and types of resistant substitutions to a small subset of realized genetic changes. Taken together, our results emphasize the interplay among selection, constraint, and historical contingency in the evolution of complex adaptations."]
