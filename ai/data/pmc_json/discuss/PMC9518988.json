["DISCUSSION", "Cytochalasins, which were discovered by Rothweiler and Tamm in\u00a01966, are a well\u2010known class of alkaloids characterized by a polyketide backbone and an amino acid (such as leucine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, or phenylalanine). Owing to their complex polycyclic structure and broad spectrum of bioactivity, cytochalasins have attracted the attention of numerous chemists and physicists. Increasing numbers of bioactive cytochalasins and its analogues have been isolated from filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus flavipes (Zhu et al.,\u00a02017), C. globosum (Chen et al.,\u00a02015), Periconia sp. (Zhang et al.,\u00a02016) and Trichoderma gamsii (Chen et al.,\u00a02014), and the current estimates suggest that over 300 cytochalasins have been described (Wei et al.,\u00a02017). Chaetoglobosin A, a member of the cytochalasins family with diverse antibacterial and antitumor activities, was first identified by Seklta et al. in\u00a01973. Owing to its numerous beneficial properties, development of an effective channel to enhance chaetoglobosin A production is particularly important. In the present study, we first identified and predicted the function of an MFS secondary transporter gene in C. globosum W7, which was adjacent to the chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis cluster.", "The vital functions of the cytoplasmic membrane transport systems, which are ubiquitous in bacterial and eukaryotic cells, include uptake of essential nutrients and excretion of toxic compounds to maintain cellular homeostasis. By using the C. globosum genome, the present study analysed the function of a putative MFS efflux pump adjacent to the chaetoglobosin A cluster, which was annotated as CgMfs1. The results of transmembrane and hydropathy profile demonstrated that CgMfs1 comprised 12 TMS, similar to the typical configurations of DHA12 involved in secondary metabolites transport (Paulsen et al.,\u00a01996; Reddy et al.,\u00a02012). Target disruption of pfmfr3, a novel mitochondrial transporter in Plasmodium falciparum has been reported to decrease the sensitivity of the parasite to antimalarial compounds (Rocamora et al.,\u00a02021), and mutants overexpressing an MFS transporter PdMfs1 in Penicillium digitatum have been noted to be more resistant to imazalil (Wang et al.,\u00a02012). Furthermore, interruption of the expression level of the novel MFS transporter gene penM via gene\u2010silencing strategy led to a marked decrease in benzylpenicillin production; by contrast, overexpression of the target gene by the efficiently expressed promoter increased the yield and promoted the biosynthetic of benzylpenicillin (Fernandez\u2010Aguado et al.,\u00a02014). These results are consistent with the findings of the present study, which revealed that inactivation of the efflux pump gene CgMfs1 directly caused a significant decline in chaetoglobosin A output from 58.66 to 19.95\u2009mg/L (MFS1\u20133) and 17.13\u2009mg/L (MFS1\u20134) during the equilibrium period of fermentation. On the contrary, chaetoglobosin A production by CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing strains evidently improved by 4.8\u2010fold (OEX13), when compared with that by the wild\u2010type strain, which proved that the predicted efflux gene CgMfs1 may play a crucial role in chaetoglobosin A transportation. Interestingly, the transcription level of the CgPKS gene dramatically varied in the CgMfs1\u2010silenced and CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing mutants; however, the diameters of the mycelia and spores were not affected by the expression of CgMfs1, suggesting that excessive accumulation of compounds in vivo could result in feedback inhibition. In CgMfs1\u2010silenced mutants, the expression level of CgPKS in the biosynthesis cluster, which is responsible for the synthesis of precursor skeleton of chaetoglobosin A, was significantly reduced. In contrast, in CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing mutants, the timely expulsion of the generated products outside of the cells could effectively reduce antibiotic accumulation and alleviate feedback inhibition, thus significantly increasing the expression level of CgPKS. Qiu et al.\u00a0(2011) used a multi\u2010copy plasmid to improve the expression of avtAB gene, which encoded the multidrug efflux pump AvtAB in Streptomyces avermitilis, and the additional copies of avtAB resulted in increased avermectin production both in wild\u2010type and high\u2010yield producer strains, which could be owing to the reduction in feedback inhibition and improvement in the ability to export avermectin by the overexpression mutants. Zhao et al.\u00a0(2021) identified a novel efflux pump designated as LexABC in Lysobacter antibioticus, which could be sufficiently induced by myxin and potentially regulated by the LysR\u2010type transcriptional regulator LexR. Inactivation of the lexABC or lexR genes resulted in a dramatic increase in the susceptibility of the mutants to myxin and loss of capacity to produce this compound, which could possibly be owing to the important role of the efflux system (LexABC) in exporting the intolerable myxin to preserve L. antibioticus from the attack of continually synthetized product. Rahman et al.\u00a0(2017) speculated that, at the single cell level, the effectively expressed metabolite efflux transporter gene could decrease the intracellular level of antibiotic and maintain the internal concentration of antibiotic at a sufficiently low level, which may be considered as the first line of defence to protect antibiotic\u2010producing microorganisms from autotoxicity.", "In China, about 174.4\u2013248.6 million metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually, and cornstalk is a common and abundant resource (Chen,\u00a02016). Nevertheless, because of the lack of effective application, cornstalk is improperly disposed or directly burned, which not only results in wastage of resources, but also causes serious environmental pollution. Therefore, rational utilization of straw resources is an essential task for alleviating energy and environmental pressure. As an important underutilized and rich biomass energy, straw resources have been widely researched. For instance, Zhao et al.\u00a0(2020) accomplished liquefaction of cornstalk in a high\u2010temperature and high\u2010pressure reactor and obtained water\u2010soluble products that exhibited excellent growth inhibitory effect on the soilborne plant pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum. Furthermore, lignocellulosic materials such as wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse and rice straw have been employed to produce antioxidative phenolic compounds (Zhu & Xu,\u00a02013). Similarly, in the present study, we attempted to use cornstalk as the fermentation substrate for chaetoglobosin A production using C. globosum, considering the requirements of large\u2010scale production and rational application of straw resources. SEM and FT\u2010IR analyses revealed that both C. globosum and OEX13 could degrade the cornstalk substrate and produce chaetoglobosin A. The chaetoglobosin A production by OEX13 was significantly improved by 475.94% (from 40.32 to 191.90\u2009mg/L), and a further enhancement in the chaetoglobosin A yield could possibly be achieved by straw pretreatment and humidity adjustment (Wang et al.,\u00a02020).", "In summary, the present work ascertained a novel unidentified MFS efflux gene, which had a crucial effect on chaetoglobosin A transportation and provided new insights for studying secondary metabolites of the genus of Chaetomium. In future, production of bioactive substances with high economic value from agricultural residues will be an important waste management strategy as well as a novel research direction for reducing fermentation costs and accomplishing commercial production."]
