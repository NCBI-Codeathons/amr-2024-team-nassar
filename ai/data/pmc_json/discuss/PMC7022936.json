["4. Discussion", "Gliotoxins and their derivatives exhibited diverse biological activities, including the suppression of macrophage immune; the inhibition of NOTCH2 transactivation; the regulation of signaling pathway; and the induction of the apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells, cervical cancer cells, chondrosarcoma cells, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells [24,40,41,42,43,44]. Hence, gliotoxin derivatives possess therapeutic potential for the prevention or treatment of cancer as well as other diseases. Gliotoxin derivatives have also been used in the clinical trial for the treatment of lung cell cancer. The combination of Illumina HiSeq and Pacific Biosciences RS sequencing platforms provides sufficient coverage depth for the comprehensive analysis of D. cejpii FS110 genome sequence, thus promoting the exploitation of the new bioactive compounds and their corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters from deep-sea fungi. The elucidation of the regulation mechanism of gliotoxin biosynthesis in D. cejpii FS110 can facilitate the exploration of new gliotoxin derivatives by approaches including transcriptional regulation and gene sequences deletion.", "Transcriptional factor GliZ is encoded inside the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster and primarily serves as a positive regulator for the gliotoxin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus [21]. In this study, a new GliZ transcriptional factor in D. cejpii FS110 was found by gene annotation, and DcGliZ showed a low identity of 44% with that in A. fumigatus by protein alignment and phylogenetic tree construction, suggesting that DcGliZ is an important pathway-specific regulator for the biosyntheis of gliotoxins and their derivatives. The core Zn2Cys6 domain of DcGliZ transcriptional factor is uniquely found in fungi, and this DcGliZ can specifically recognize and bind as homodimers to palindromic sequence motifs for the regulation of gene transcriptional level [23,45,46]. Thus, the 3D structure of Zn2Cys6 was modeled using SWISS-MODEL and PyMol for understanding the binding mechanism. Although the function of GliZ has been identified by the deletion or overexpression of gliZ gene for the mediation of gliotoxin production in vivo [21], the specific binding site in the promoter region of the gli cluster genes remains obscure. Previous studies implied that GliZ can bind to the promoter regions of the genes in the gli cluster, except gliZ and gliA, which encoded an efflux pump. However, the in vitro function and detailed binding affinities of GliZ protein with different promoters have not been assayed until now [22]. To determine the detailed promoters that bind to DcGliZ with strong binding affinity, thereby illustrating the in vitro regulatory mechanism of DcGliZ for gliotoxins biosyntheis, the EMSA and SPR assays were performed to identify the binding affinities of DcGliZ with different promoters for gliotoxin biosynthesis.", "The full-length DcGliZ transcriptional factor was heterologously expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and a feasible refolding method was proposed; the refolding efficiency was also improved based on a previous study [47]. The short promoters for gliotoxins biosynthesis-related genes in the gli cluster gene were cloned, biotin-labeled, and then incubated with a full-length DcGliZ transcriptional factor to perform the EMSA analysis, thus verifying the binding capacity of DcGliZ with different promoters. The retardation of the target band was visualized. The result illustrated that only pG, pM, and pN can combine with a full-length DcGliZ transcriptional factor, suggesting that DcGliZ has a relatively strong capability to bind with pG, pM, and pN promoters and regulates the biosynthesis of gliotoxin in D. cejpii FS110. The important role of the Zn2Cys6 domain in DcGliZ is confirmed by EMSA assays of heterologously expressed DcGliZ core protein with promoters pG, pM, and pN. The retardation band was observed in DcGliZ core protein\u2013pG complex, however, no such retardation band was observed in DcGliZ core protein\u2013pM complex and DcGliZ core protein\u2013pN complex. The results indicated that the core protein of DcGliZ containing Zn2Cys6 can bind to G1-1 and G1-3 sequences of the pG promoter, and we assumed that other regions except the Zn2Cys6 domain probably bind to pM and pN promoters. However, the binding capacity of DcGliZ core protein with the pG promoter was indeed verified by EMSA assay. The pG promoter was obtained using genome walking kit to amplify the upstream sequences of the gliG gene, which encodes glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the function of GST in gliotoxin biosynthesis has been proven in our previous study [27]. The transcriptional activity of pG promoter was also confirmed by assaying fluorescence intensity [48]. The above results indicated that pG promoter plays an important role in the biosynthesis of gliotoxins and their derivatives. Further, the EMSA results demonstrated the important role of the Zn2Cys6 domain in DcGliZ protein and the function of DcGliZ in the regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis in D. cejpii, and the EMSA assay of full-length DcGliZ and DcGliZ core protein also implied the possible special regulatory mechanism for gliotoxins biosynthesis in D. cejpii FS110 compared with those of other known GliZ transcriptional factors, which may be because of the extreme deep-sea environment in which D. cejpii FS110 lives. More importantly, the deficiency of post-translational protein processing and specific modification mechanism in E. coli, such as glycosylation, methylation, and acetylation, may also result in the alternation of DcGliZ core protein configuration and low binding ability of DcGliZ core protein to pM and pN promoters.", "The affinity and kinetics screening between full-length DcGliZ and pG, pM, pN, and pCP were assayed by Biacore T200 biosensor. SPR assay has become an important analytical technology for the investigation on the interaction of biomolecules. Ligand can be immobilized on the SPR chip, and the targets can be specifically recognized and captured by interaction. Thus, real-time and target-mass dependent signal can be detected by monitoring changes in the refractive index (RI) [49]. This SPR technology can rapidly achieve stable analysis for the interaction of chemicals, proteins, and nucleotides with high specificity and minimal matrix effect [50]. The SPR analysis results showed that almost no binding affinity was observed between the negative control pCP and full-length DcGliZ (Figure 5). On the contrary, pG, pM, and pN showed relatively strong affinity with the full-length DcGliZ, and the kinetics curves of pG, pM, and pN steadily reached saturation points and then gradually decreased to their original levels. The dissociation constant (KD) calculated by the Biacore-T200 biosensor illustrated that the binding affinities of pN, pG, and pM with full-length DcGliZ were gradually decreased, whereas the KD values of pN, pG, and pM were very close. This result is consistent with the results of EMSA.", "This study was the first report on the interaction of the novel transcriptional factor DcGliZ with the promoters for the gliotoxins biosynthetic genes within the gli cluster in vitro through EMSA and SPR assays, thereby laying the theoretical foundation for the investigation of other transcriptional factors in vitro."]
