["Discussion", "Raman Insights Into Yeast Responses to AmB Exposure", "Increased membrane permeability, which results from the formation of multimeric pores upon AmB to ergosterol binding, has been reported to be the main mechanism of action against Candida species (Brajtburg et al., 1990). However, data from a number of different research groups suggested that the effectiveness of AmB also depends on metabolic mechanisms, thus implying that an increased membrane permeability might not be the only mechanism responsible for the anticandidacidal action of the molecule (Phillips et al., 2003; Mousavi and Robson, 2004; Blum et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2010). Perhaps, the most straightforward experimental proof in support of AmB possessing toxic mechanisms other than membrane pore formation was provided by Palacios et al. (2007). Those researchers made chemical modifications of the AmB molecule in order to fully compromise its ability to form membrane pores and yet recorded substantial fungicidal activity, thus providing strong evidence that pore formation is not essential or, at least, is not the only effective AmB mechanism of action. Other researchers pointed at oxidative stress as a powerful mechanism of action for AmB (Sokol-Anderson et al., 1986; Haido and Barreto-Bergter, 1989; Sangalli-Leite et al., 2011). Direct production of free radicals upon treatment with AmB has been visualized using fluorescence probes (Phillips et al., 2003; Sangalli-Leite et al., 2011). Lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and apoptotic-like phenotypes have also been used as indirect indicators for the oxidative stress generated by AmB in fungal cells (Brajtburg et al., 1990; Siau and Kerridge, 1999; Palacios et al., 2007; Wheeler et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2017). However, the molecular-scale mechanism by which AmB induces oxidative burst in Candida cells remains so far unknown. In particular, it is not clear whether the toxic radicals are generated by AmB autoxidation (Lamy-Freund et al., 1985; Sokol-Anderson et al., 1986), or if AmB simply induces the cells themselves to produce and accumulate reactive oxygen species through their mitochondrial activity (Mesa-Arango et al., 2014). Under physiological conditions, free radicals are produced in the mitochondria as natural by-products of the respiratory chain, but under conditions for which their endogenous concentration increases above a certain threshold, they produce structural alterations eventually leading to cell damage and death.", "The present in situ Raman data gives us a chance to discuss in details the reaction of C. auris clades to AmB, including the actual origin and the effects of oxidative damage. Upon AmB treatment, we observed a clear split of the low-frequency ergosterol band at 594 cm\u22121 into two sub-bands at 585~588 and 603 cm\u22121, and a clear reduction of the 713 cm\u22121 band. These characteristics were consistent for both clades (cf. Figure 9A). Even assigning the entire intensity reduction of the 713 cm\u22121 band to ergosterol, this cannot necessarily represent an inhibition of ergosterol synthesis but is rather be the spectroscopic consequence of ring constraint. Structural constraints might arise from ergosterol binding with the mycosamine group of the AmB molecule and its subsequent alignment along the side of the AmB lactone ring with multiple conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds (cf. Figure 10A) (Gray et al., 2012). The invariance in the intensities of other bands related to ergosterol supports this interpretation. On the other hand, splitting of the 594 cm\u22121 ring-related band should be interpreted as a modification of the ergosterol structure and a signature of the detoxifying action developed by yeast cells to scavenge oxygen radicals (Moradas-Ferreira and Costa, 2000). The observed split indeed points at the presence of ergosteryl ester with its related fatty acid tails (cf. Figure 10A) (Krafft et al., 2005). Sterol ester metabolism in Candida species is known to enable yeasts to modulate the level of free sterol at different stages of growth (Mullner and Daum, 2004). The present study newly suggests that such modulation also takes place in both C. auris clades when yeast needs to build a biofilm in defense against AmB. In strong support of this interpretation are: (i) the observed intensification of the ester band at 2,980 cm\u22121 and of the unsaturated =CH stretching band at 3,010 cm\u22121 (cf. Figures 7A\u2013D); and, (ii) the enhanced intensity of C=O stretching and O-C=O stretching at 1,730 and 1,750 cm\u22121, respectively, (cf. Figures 4B, 5B). Note that both these spectral features fit with the hypothesized increase in ergosteryl ester (cf. Figure 10B). Candida yeasts have also been reported to increase the amount of unsaturated lipids as a strategy to minimize the effect of interdigitated phases (Vanegas et al., 2012). Moreover, the observation of strong lipid signals outside the yeast cells (cf. Raman maps in Figures 8C,D) suggests an intensification in the production lipid droplets composed of triacylglycerides and steryl esters (Leber et al., 1994). Steryl ester in yeast contains a high content of fatty acids (i.e., accounting for ~75% of the total sterol content) (Madyastha and Parks, 1969; Hunter and Rose, 1972). Chang et al. (2015) have reported that trapping of endogenous toxins (i.e., self-secreted proteins and glycoproteins) by lipid droplets represents a self-resistance mechanism and acts to quench the production of reactive oxygen species. Those researchers clearly showed that, in Candida yeasts, neutral lipids and lipophilic agents of the droplets trap toxins and quench the formation of reactive oxygen species. Based on the above interpretation and the present results, one could argue that oxygen radicals were produced by the clades in response to the formation of toxins produced upon AmB treatment. Yeast cells then attempted to escape oxidative damage by compartmentalizing toxins into lipid droplets with the consequent sequestration of oxygen radical formation. In sum, the diffuse signals of ergosterol detected by Raman molecular imaging suggest the following events in reaction to AmB interdigitation stress: (a) stimulating the formation of lipid droplets, and (b) supporting the generation of ergosteryl ester and, possibly, of other neutral lipids. Regarding the unsolved dualism between occurrence of AmB autoxidation or cell-produced toxic radicals in response to AmB, note that the present Raman results could not support the thesis of AmB autoxidation, since no difference could be found between AmB Raman signals before and after interactions with C. auris clades (cf. AmB spectrum in Figure 6D with the strong and sharp AmB signals in Figures 4B, 5B). The extensive formation of lipid droplets and the Raman signatures for ergosteryl ester and elongated fatty acid tails point instead at a detoxifying action developed by yeast cells to scavenge self-produced oxygen radicals.", "Figure 10Summary of the main spectroscopic findings, including the mechanisms of action and the metabolic behaviors of Clades II and III in response to (A) AmB and (B) 5-FC 24 h treatments.", "Summary of the main spectroscopic findings, including the mechanisms of action and the metabolic behaviors of Clades II and III in response to (A) AmB and (B) 5-FC 24 h treatments.", "Also, the trend observed for the Raman signals of chitin, which represent structural variations in the chitin structure, cannot be simply explained by molecular binding between AmB and ergosterol molecules. The clear increase in chitin content found for both clades exposed to AmB is likely related to a metabolic reaction of the yeast cells to counteract the effect of the drug. However, the trend observed for the chitin spectroscopic markers clearly differed between Clades II and III. In particular, the split of the 1,112 cm\u22121 band into two sub-bands at 1,100 and 1,107 cm\u22121 in Clade III could be interpreted as a fingerprint for the formation of allomorphs with symmetric stretching vibrations from glycosidic C-O-C groups (Schenzel and Fischer, 2001). Another possible explanation for the chitin band split is glycosidic bond breakage, which can only occur in the presence of radical species (cf. Figure 10A) (Cumpstey, 2013). Note that also the clear intensity decrease of the 2,995 cm\u22121 band in Clade III (cf. Figure 7E), which is quite pronounced only in highly crystalline chitin (Ando et al., 2021), gives support to the hypothesis of crystalline chitin structure. This spectral feature, which is only peculiar to Clade III, is likely related to the formation of an extra-cellular matrix in the so-called \u201cfluffy structured\u201d colony, which protects the yeast community in an early stage of biofilm development (cf. Figure 10A) (Palkova and Vachova, 2006). Constructed with both polysaccharides and proteins, this extra-cellular matrix contains empty chambers, enabling the fluffy colony to quickly occupy a relatively large territory with a relatively small number of cells. This interpretation appears supported by microscopic observations on Clade III morphology after AmB exposure and related Raman maps (cf. Figures 1f, 9D). It is thus suggested that Clade III attempts a survival strategy different from Clade II under AmB environmental stress.", "Additional metabolic reactions related to the structure of polysaccharides could be found in the increased glucan content and the relative enrichment in \u03b2-1, 3\u2013glucans. Such major changes in cell-wall structure point at regulatory mechanisms aimed at compensating for drug-induced damages of cell walls and/or extracellular matrix structures. The present Raman study substantiated for the first time a difference in the population of inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between different clades treated with AmB. While the degree of acetylation was similarly enhanced upon AmB treatment in both clades (cf. Amide I bands), only Clade III showed a 30% decrease in intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio as compared to the as-cultured clade. These spectroscopic differences are substantiated by optical micrographs, as well as by chitin and Amide I Raman maps in Figures 8C,D (cf. labels in inset). Consistent with the ergosterol map, the chitin distribution showed the formation of a biofilm structure more continuous and denser in Clade II than in Clade III. Note that this interpretation matches the view of fluffy colony proposed above for Clade III. Biofilm formation has been reported as a strain-dependent trait in C. auris and strongly associated with type and phenotypic behavior of specific isolates (Singh et al., 2019). The isolates from both clades examined in this study showed a high degree of association (cf. micrographs in Figure 1). Aggregative phenotypes were indeed classified as stronger biofilm producers among colonizing isolates of C. auris (Singh et al., 2019). Aggregation and biofilm formation appeared stronger (or faster) in Clade II, which thus possesses a higher degree of ecological fitness and survivorship. As usual in aggregative-colonizing isolates, however, the examined isolates from both clades commonly showed a comparatively strong susceptibility to AmB (Singh et al., 2019).", "Raman Insights Into Yeast Responses to 5-FC Exposure", "Although the exact mechanism of action of 5-FC is yet the object of investigation (Gsaller et al., 2018), it is believed that 5-FC induces in yeast cells a direct mechanism of competitive inhibition of purine and pyrimidine uptake and an indirect mechanism of intracellular metabolism to 5-FU (Polak and Scholer, 1975). After penetrating the cells via cytosine permease, 5-FC is promptly metabolized to 5-FU. 5-FU is then converted into 5-fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) either through direct or indirect phosphorylase reactions. In successive steps, FUMP undergoes further phosphorylation into fluorouridine diphosphate (FUTP) and further converted into either active metabolite fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FUTP) upon ribonucleotide reductase (Longey et al., 2003). These active metabolites become misincorporated into both RNA and replicating DNA as a consequence of their strong similarity with uridine-5'-triphosphate/2'-deoxythymidine-5'-triphosphate. This process, which is schematically shown in Figure 10B, leads to genome instability and inhibits the synthesis of both DNA and RNA leading to unbalanced cell growth and death. Machon et al. (2021) described a method based on liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry suitable for the simultaneous determination of the ten anabolic metabolites (nucleoside, nucleotide and sugar nucleoside) of 5-FU. This composite analytical method successfully measured the proportion of different anabolic metabolites of 5-FU in cellular structures, thus confirming their incorporation in DNA and RNA in agreement with the draft in Figure 10B.", "The present Raman data taken at 24 h exposure basically confirmed this action scenario with revealing the main 5-FU (and not 5-FC) bands inside the yeast cells (cf. average spectra in Figures 4C, 5C, and 5-FU Raman images in Figures 9E,F) and the almost complete disappearance of Raman markers of deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine ring bands (cf. maps in Figures 9E,F). Unlike the case of AmB treatment, 5-FC treatment did not induce biofilm formation, but an extensive morphological transition into pseudohyphae and hyphae could be observed in Clades II and III, respectively (cf. Figures 1c,d). Filamentous growth transition in C. auris has been observed upon growth in NaCl-rich yeast extracted-peptone-dextrose medium (Wang et al., 2018), upon deletion of heat shock molecular chaperone protein (Kim et al., 2019), or upon passaging through a mammalian host (Yue et al., 2018). The present study showed that treatment with 5-FC induced hyphal-like phenotype transition in both Clades II and III, which from the one hand helps explain their success as highly virulent pathogens and, on the other hand, gives hints on their emergent resistance to this drug.", "In addition to confirming the 5-FC mechanism of action, Raman spectroscopy revealed important details as well as differences in the metabolic reactions of different clades to the drug. While both clades reacted to 5-FC exposure with a similar overproduction of ergosterol (likely in an attempt to reduce membrane permeability) and chitin (with a clear increase in the intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio), only Clade III produced its enhanced fraction of chitin structure with a high degree of acetylation (cf. Figure 10B). This effect represents a remarkable \u201cchemical\u201d trick for reducing permeability while further increasing membrane stiffness beyond the mere effect of a fractional increase (Motta de Moura et al., 2011). Another remarkable \u201cchemical\u201d ability of Clade III over Clade II was represented by its capacity to increase by nearly a factor 2 the chain length of the produced fatty acids (i.e., the intensity ratio of C-H(CH2) to C-H(CH3) stretching bands, I2850/I2935) in response to 5-FC treatment. Longer fatty acids are indeed more rigid and can greatly reduce membrane fluidity and permeability (Cavalheiro and Teixeira, 2018; Tyler et al., 2019). Because of its \u201cchemical skills\u201d, Clade III could be extremely efficient in developing resistance to 5-FC treatments.", "Implications of Hyphal Morphogenesis Upon 5-FC Treatment", "Wilson et al. (2016) documented the role of hyphal morphogenesis on host cell damage in C. albicans and showed that both yeast and hyphal cells are required for reaching high virulence. In systemic infections, neither yeast-locked strains nor hyperfilamentous mutants are fully virulent, but it is their combination and morphogenic switching capacity that leads to the highest virulence with the two forms fulfilling specific functions during infection: dissemination via blood stream by yeast, adhesion and invasion of host cells by filamentous hyphae. Several independent studies have proposed a direct correlation between the formation of C. albicans hyphae and an enhanced capacity for tissue invasion, damage, and virulence, while the capacity of pseudohyphal forms is yet unclear (Lo et al., 1997; Saville et al., 2003; Gow et al., 2011). In a study on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Mukaremera et al., 2017), yeast cells were found to induce the generation of more inflammatory cytokines than hyphae, while pseudohyphae induced intermediate cytokine levels. This indicates that immune recognition targets more severely yeast cells, while filamentous hyphal cells induce an altered immune response (Gantner et al., 2005; Van Der Graaf et al., 2005; Gow et al., 2011; Moyes et al., 2011). C. auris has also been reported to exhibit cellular polymorphism to produce pseudohyphal cell growth in the presence of genotoxic stress induced by hydroxyurea (Bravo et al., 2020); growth in high salt concentrations also induced cell elongation (Kim et al., 2019). Filamentous or elongated morphologies were also observed in C. auris populations retrieved from murine infection (Yue et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2021). However, hyphal morphogenesis did not occur in a number of circumstances that induce hyphal growth in C. albicans (Wang et al., 2018). The effect of drugs causing genotoxic stress, such as hydroxyurea or methyl methanesulfonate, can trigger an arrest of genetic replication via a cell cycle checkpoint (Pardo et al., 2017). Our present data are in agreement with those reported in Bravo et al. (2020), showing that 5-FC (converted into fluorouracil in the Candida yeast cells) perturbed RNA and DNA biosynthesis causing the growth of pseudohyphal cells in Clade II. By showing morphological differences between Clade II and Clade III treated under the same conditions, we also confirmed that C. auris filamentation is strain dependent (Bravo et al., 2020). However, a new result here is that LSEM 3673 (South African) Clade III was converted into a fully developed hyphal morphology upon 5-FC treatment. This result confirms the capacity of hyphal switching for C. auris so far only observed for yeast passaging through a mammalian body (Yue et al., 2018) or in genetically manipulated morphogenic mutants (Santana and O'Meara, 2021). This latter study revealed a dysregulated chitinase expression, attenuated virulence, and altered antifungal susceptibility in morphogenic mutants. Parallel to genomic analyses, the present study adds molecular structure insight into an enhanced fraction of chitin with high intermolecular-to-intramolecular hydrogen bond ratio and a high degree of acetylation (cf. Figure 10B) for LSEM 3673 Clade III."]
