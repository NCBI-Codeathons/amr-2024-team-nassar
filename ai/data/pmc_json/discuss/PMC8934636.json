["DISCUSSION", "In this study, HTH_42 superfamily proteins TxnU2/U4 and LldU1/U5 were discovered to provide cellular resistance to TXNA and LLD toxicity, respectively, providing an explanation for the evolutionary function of these proteins within the BGC of each antibiotic. Sequence (BLASTP) and structural (AlphaFold) analyses show that TxnU and LldU share homology with AlkZ and YcaQ (Supplementary Figure S6), and the in vitro enzymatic activity confirms that like AlkZ/YcaQ, both TxnU and LldU are monofunctional DNA glycosylases acting on N7-alkylguanine adducts (27\u201329). However, the TxnU/LldU enzymes differ from their HTH_42 homologs\u2014and other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases\u2014with respect to substrate specificity, catalytic machinery, and genomic context.", "In terms of specificity, most alkylpurine DNA glycosylases hydrolyze 7mG in addition to their major substrates (23,28,29,40,54\u201356). Interestingly, despite the lower stability of the 7mG N-glycosidic bond, TxnU4 and LldU1 did not exhibit 7mG activity, indicating that TxnU/LldU specifically recognize TXNA-G and LLD-G as opposed to the instability in the N-glycosidic bond generated by substitution of guanine at N7 (1). Similarly, the TXNs-DNA lesions did not appear to be substrates for the other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases, including AlkZ/YcaQ and YtkR2/AlkD, which also act on bulky lesions (26,27,29,57,58). The lack of activity of TxnU/LldU for less stable N7-alkylguanine adducts and the inability of other glycosylases to hydrolyze TXNA-G indicate that TxnU and LldU are highly specific for their own natural products. The most significant differences between LLD/TXN-G and other known N7-alkylpurine glycosylase substrates are their ability to intercalate into the DNA base stack and their sugar substituents (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S7). Based on the TXNA-DNA crystal structure, TXNA intercalates the d(GT/AC) base step and forms hydrogen bonds with the duplex DNA through the two sugar moieties, leading to the 4-sugar in the minor groove and the 13-sugar residing in the major groove (36). In addition, TXNA extrudes the base near the 3\u2032 end of the alkylating site out of the helix, leading to an increased helical twist (36).", "To our knowledge, TxnU and LldU are the only DNA glycosylases identified with activity toward intercalated DNA substrates. An AlkZ-derived homology model of TxnU4 docked against the TXNA-DNA crystal structure provides a rationale for this specificity (Supplementary Figure S7). Our previous work predicted that AlkZ employs two important secondary structural elements to engage the DNA substrate from opposite faces of the DNA\u2014the \u03b211/12-hairpin is posited to contact the lesion in the minor groove, and helix \u03b1I is predicted to make direct contact to the AZB compound from the major groove side (28,29) (Supplementary Figures S6,S7). Because the TXN compounds intercalate both strands of DNA, they protrude from both major and minor groove sides. Consequently, helix \u03b1I and the \u03b211/12-hairpin likely contact TXNs from both grooves, with helix \u03b1I recognizing the C13- or C16-modified sugars on one end and the \u03b211/12-hairpin recognizing C-4 modified sugar on the other end. Interestingly, the sequences and predicted structures of these two recognition elements are not conserved between AlkZ and TxnU/LldU (Supplementary Figures S6 and\u00a0S7), consistent with their predicted roles in recognition of two different classes of natural products.", "Regarding catalysis, the AlkZ/YcaQ/TxnU/LldU family of HTH_42 enzymes act on crosslinked or intercalated substates that are not likely to be extruded from the DNA, as observed for base-flipping glycosylases including human AAG and bacterial AlkA (19,23). Consistently, the HTH_42 enzymes, like their non-base-flipping counterparts YtkR2/AlkD, do not contain residues that would intercalate the DNA helix to stabilize an extruded nucleobase in the active site, nor do they contain a nucleobase binding pocket within the active site (57,59). Instead, the catalytic residues are pre-organized to contact the target N-glycosidic bond within an intact DNA duplex (28) (Supplementary Figures S6, S7). We previously showed that the catalytic motifs of the HTH_42 superfamily are divided into Q\u03a6Q and Q\u03a6D types (29). Sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis showed that the five proteins\u2014AlkZ, LldU1/U5 and TxnU2/U4\u2014are located in three different clades, in which TxnU2 and LldU5 are clustered into one clade, TxnU4 and LldU1 are clustered into another, and AlkZ clustered in a third (Figure 1D). The catalytic motif of TxnU2 and LldU5 is the same as AlkZ and belongs to the Q\u03a6Q type. However, the catalytic motifs of TxnU4 and LldU1 belong to neither Q\u03a6Q nor Q\u03a6D, but instead contain an H\u03a6Q motif (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S6). Our structural models predict the H\u03a6Q side chains to be in the same locations as those in AlkZ Q\u03a6Q, and thus either could reside close enough to the target TXNA-G or LLD-G nucleotide to catalyze hydrolysis (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7) (28). Interestingly, however, our mutational analysis revealed that H\u03a6Q behaves differently than Q\u03a6Q and Q\u03a6D in two respects. First, mutation of only one residue affected base excision, in contrast to Q\u03a6Q (AlkZ) and YcaQ (Q\u03a6D), in which mutation of either residue within the motif affects base excision activity (28,29). Second, the two H\u03a6Q motifs in TxnU4 and LldU1 have different effects for TXNA- and LLD-G adducts, respectively; the histidine in TxnU4 had the greater effect on excision of gutingimycin and the glutamine in LldU1 had the greater effect on LLD-G excision. The cross-reactivity of TxnU4 and LldU1 against TXNs and their high sequence similarity suggests that the two glycosylases have similar substrate recognition pockets, and thus the different effects of their His and Gln mutants most likely stem from the manner in which TXNA-G and LLD-G lesions are positioned within the active site (Supplementary Figure S7). These compounds are distinguished by the sugar substituents at position 13 (TXNA) and 16 (LLD) (Figure 1A), which reside in the major groove and thus likely are contacted by helix \u03b1I as described above (Supplementary Figure S7). Interestingly, TxnU4 and LldU1 contain a 10\u201315-amino acid insertion in helix \u03b1I that the AlphaFold model predicts forms a \u03b2-hairpin (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7). Steric interaction from this helix \u03b1I insertion with the unique 13- and 16-sugar substituents in the major groove would displace the TXNA- and LLD-DNAs differently, placing the target deoxyriboses of TXNA-G and LLD-G in proximity to His43 and Gln45, respectively (Supplementary Figure S7D). Thus, although TxnU4 and LldU1 share the same catalytic motif, the insertion in the predicted drug-binding \u03b1I-helix and the differences in sugar moieties in TXNs may alter how the two proteins engage their substrates. Consistent with this rationale, neither LldU5, AlkZ, nor YcaQ contain the \u03b1I helix insertion, and none of these show a preferential catalytic residue within Q\u03a6Q or Q\u03a6D motifs (28,29).", "A growing number of specialized DNA glycosylases produced from the BGCs of genotoxic secondary metabolites have been determined, including those involved in self-resistance to AZB and yatakemycin/CC-1065 (26,27,60). Our cellular resistance/sensitivity assays demonstrate txnU2/4 and lldU1/5 are key determinants in self-resistance to TXNA/LLD. The presence of multiple copies of these DNA glycosylases is unique to the txn and lld BGCs, and may provide redundancy to ensure repair of the highly genotoxic TXN metabolites, in contrast to the lethality of AlkZ knockouts in azinomycin B-producing S. sahachiroi (27). Based on our finding that TxnU4 and LldU1 play the major roles in toxin resistance, it is interesting to speculate that TxnU2 and LldU5 play more secondary roles, such as removing lesions formed by TXN derivatives generated from catabolism of TXNA/LLD.", "The subsequent BER steps necessary for repair of DNA lesions generated from secondary metabolites, and the roles of other pathways (e.g., NER) are remaining questions. Regarding BER, our finding that E. coli EndoIV processed TXNs AP-sites less efficiently than 7mG-derived AP-sites suggests that specialized nucleases act on the AP-DNA/TXN-Gua product, as predicted for the putative ytkR4 and ytkR5 nucleases located within yatakemycin BGC (26,58,61). Although there do not appear to be any nucleases within the txn/lld clusters, genomic analysis reveals both ExoIII and EndoIV orthologs in TXNA/LLD producing strains (and two ExoIII paralogs in the case of S. bottropensis). Given the bulky, helix-distorting nature of these compounds, it is also likely that NER or other pathways play a role in their repair, as previously shown for yatakemycin-family and NM-ICL-DNA lesions (29,58,62\u201364). Indeed, S. vinaceusdrappus and S. bottropensis contain one and three UvrA paralogs, respectively. It is also possible that TXN-DNA lesions are recognized by other enzymes outside of BER or NER, as reported for the structure-specific AziN nuclease within the AZB BGC (65). More work is needed to elucidate the full landscape of cellular mechanisms of repair of these unique DNA damaging agents. Taken together, this work characterizes a unique family of DNA glycosylases from the HTH_42 superfamily that act on heavily functionalized, intercalated DNA adducts, and provides further evidence for that DNA glycosylases residing in BGCs have evolved an exquisite specificity for aberrant nucleotides formed by their cognate genotoxic natural products."]
