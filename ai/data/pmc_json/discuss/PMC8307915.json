["4. Discussion", "As novel myxobacteria continue to be isolated and explored for natural product discovery, efficient approaches for approximate taxonomic placement will assist the prioritization of lesser studied genera. Utilizing long-read genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses, we determine preliminary taxonomic placement for four myxobacteria isolated from North American soils and two myxobacteria deposited at the ATCC. This approach indicated that previously classified A. primigenium ATCC 29037 is instead a novel member of the genus Melittangium, and that three of our four environmental isolates included potentially novel members of the genera Corallococcus, Myxococcus, and Pyxidicoccus. Previously classified Chondorococcus macrosporus ATCC 29039 was also determined to be a potentially novel member of the genus Corallococcus, with high similarity to C. exercitus DSM 108849T and phylogenetically distinct from M. macrosporus DSM 14697T previously assigned to the genus Corallococcus. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis of biosynthetic pathways included in the newly sequenced genomes corroborated our preliminary taxonomic placements for each sample. Ultimately, this process identified A. primigenium to be a member of the lesser studied genus Melittangium and indicated that it should be prioritized for continued natural product discovery efforts. Of the environmental isolates, BGCs from SCPEA002 were determined to include the least amount of overlap with BGCs from other Myxococcus/Pyxidicoccus species. While environmental isolates SCHIC002 and NCSPR001 were also identified as novel members of the genera Myxococcus and Corallococcus, respectively, the apparent overlap in BGCs from thoroughly explored myxobacteria determined from sequence similarity network analysis suggests a limited potential for discovery of novel specialized metabolites. Overall, comparative genomic techniques including the assessment of biosynthetic potential enabled a phylogenetic approximation and suggested prioritization of A. primigenium for natural product discovery efforts from a sample set of six newly sequenced myxobacteria."]
