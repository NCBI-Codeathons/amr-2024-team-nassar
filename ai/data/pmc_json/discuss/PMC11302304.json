["DISCUSSION", "Dysbiosis of the microbiome is closely related to semen quality. However, there was a paucity of research on its relationship with sperm DFI. Previous studies, such as the one conducted by Sergio et al., have leveraged full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to delineate the microbial characteristics of semen from infertile idiopathic patients. However, these investigations predominantly focused on idiopathic infertility, leaving the specific impact of seminal microbiota on DFI largely unexplored (13). Addressing this gap, our study expanded the patient cohort and integrated non-targeted metabolomics with 16S rRNA gene sequencing to elucidate the influence of seminal microbiota on sperm DFI, thereby revealing the detrimental impact of microbiota-derived metabolites on sperm DNA integrity.", "Our comparative analysis identified distinct microbial compositions between HDFI and LDFI groups, with the HDFI group showing a prevalence of Actinomycetaceae and Acinetobacter spp., aligning with prior findings (13). Notably, our redundancy analysis pinpointed a correlation between Lactobacillus species levels and DFI, particularly highlighting variations in Lactobacillus species distribution between groups. The predominance of L. iners in the HDFI group, a species traditionally associated with the vaginal microbiome and indicative of dysbiosis due to its link with pro-inflammatory factors (24) and its ability to directly induce DNA damage in cancer cells (25), suggests a novel microbial marker for semen quality and DFI. DNA damage leads to an increase in intracellular phosphorylation of serine (26). Lactobacillus iners was negatively correlated with 1-(2-methoxy-6Z-heptadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, a compound that may be a product of DNA damage. Additionally, Lactobacillus spp. were negatively associated with Corynebacterium spp., and L. iners, a species of Lactobacillus that lacks genes for the metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates (27), may stimulate the growth of Corynebacterium spp. by producing unsaturated fatty acids (28\u201330), leading to a reduction in metabolites conducive to spermatogenesis.", "With further clustering of the differentially distributed microbiota into KEGG Orthology prediction results in the HDFI group, we found a significantly higher activation level of the acetyl-CoA fermentation to butanoate II pathway compared with the LDFI group. The acetyl-CoA fermentation to butanoate II pathway involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert acetyl-CoA to butanoate (31). Butanoate salts are a class of compounds known as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues, resulting in condensed and transcriptionally silenced chromatin. HDIs block this action, potentially leading to hyperacetylation of histones (32), which may affect the conversion of sperm DNA histones to protamines, resulting in increased sperm DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, we observed an elevated level of purine nucleobase degradation I pathway in the HDFI group. The activity of the purine metabolic pathway correlates with DNA damage. Disruption in purine metabolism can lead to erroneous encoding of DNA (33), which may also be a potential cause of increased sperm DFI.", "Our correlation analyses underscored Acinetobacter spp.\u2019s close association with DFI levels, and we identified its correlation with antioxidant metabolites through correlation analysis. Acinetobacter sp. is an opportunistic pathogen, and it can produce DNA-damaging metabolites, such as angucyclines, anthracyclines, bleomycins, enediynes, mitomycins, and quinoxalines. These molecules are combined with DNA and cause either DNA distortion, alkylation, crosslinking, and/or oxidative damage (34). Acinetobacter spp. and other bacteria, including Serratia spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Stenotrophomonas spp., were identified in the genitourinary system and were related to reduction in sperm motility, lack in DNA integrity, destruction of mitochondrial functions and shape abnormalities of the sperms (35). El-Gendy and his colleagues performed subcutaneous injection of extracts obtained from Acinetobacter spp. to albino rats and found that sperm deformities percentage was statistically significantly increased (36). Therefore, we speculate that, in human semen, Acinetobacter spp. may deplete antioxidant metabolites and restrain the antioxidant capacity of sperm.", "We recognize certain limitations in our study. For instance, our conclusions were based on 16S rRNA sequencing, which can only detect microbial communities statistically significant and not other organisms, such as fungi and viruses, and we did not conduct further experimental validation. Traditional microbial culture methods serve as the gold standard for clinical detection of microbiota and can also provide further analysis of drug resistance. However, some microbiota may not grow in common culture media or may have low abundance, making it difficult to validate the microbiota identified by next-generation sequencing using traditional microbial culture methods (37). Overall, our findings uncover a microbial perspective underlying sperm DNA integrity.", "Conclusions", "This study not only provides a comprehensive overview of the metabolic interplay between microbiota and host in HDFI patient semen but also prompts further investigation into the microbiome\u2019s role in semen quality. By combining non-targeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we offer insights into seminal microbiota\u2019s potential adverse effects on sperm DNA, whether through antioxidant depletion or DNA-damage metabolite production. Future research is warranted to validate these findings and explore therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating the seminal microbiome to improve sperm quality and fertility outcomes."]
