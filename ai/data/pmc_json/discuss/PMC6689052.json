["Discussion", "Using targeted metabolomics, we identified a family of pyridine containing polyketide natural products that we have named the formicapyridines. Remarkably, these compounds are derived from the fasamycin/formicamycin biosynthetic machinery meaning that the for BGC is responsible for the production of three structurally differentiated pentacyclic scaffolds. Inspired by evolutionary considerations we introduced a gene deletion into the BGC, which significantly altered the relative levels of these metabolites: the titre of formicapyridines was significantly increased (\u223c25-fold) in contrast to the fasamycin/formicamycins, which were decreased to approximately one-third of the WT titre. These results raise a series of questions about the cyclization events associated with the fasamycin/formicamycin biosynthetic pathway, and with the maintenance of pathway fidelity.", "Our data suggest that formation of ring-B of the fasamycin scaffold is the final biosynthetic step, followed by thioester hydrolysis to liberate the ACP and subsequent decarboxylation to remove the carboxyl group attached to C24 (Fig.\u00a05). Consistent with this, deletion of forS led to the isolation of shunt metabolite 13 with a C24-carboxyl group that was not observed from the WT. However, while ForS is implicated in ring-B cyclization it is not required for this role, nor, apparently, for the biosynthesis of any congeners. Rather, ForS seems to decrease the production of aberrant congeners from the pathway, e.g. formicapyridines, while increasing overall productivity. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that another of the for BGC gene products is the actual catalyst for ring-B formation, and that ForS acts as a chaperone, which modulates or stabilises the assembly, or arrangement, of a multienzyme complex to optimise production of the fasamycins, and therefore ultimately the formicamycins. This has the consequence of minimising the production of shunt metabolites (formicapyridines). Thus, while deletion of forS leads to the phenotype desired from our thought experiment, the mechanism by which this occurs is not what was anticipated. Interpretation of the for BGC bioinformatic analysis suggests the most likely candidate for a ring-B (final) cyclase is ForL due to its close relationship with TcmI, which catalyses a similar final cyclization step during tetracenomycin biosynthesis19\u201321. The apparent lack of any intermediates or shunt metabolites being accumulated by the remaining mutants is somewhat surprising and suggests an absolute requirement for the formation of a PKS-cyclase complex before biosynthesis can be initiated.", "These observations are reminiscent of studies regarding the biosynthesis of pradimicin32. Pradimicins are pentangular polyketides similar to the benastatins26,27, and the BGC for their production contains three PKS cyclases equivalent to ForD (PdmD), ForL (PdmK) and ForR (PdmL)32,33. It also contains two ABM domain proteins (PdmH and PdmI; c.f. ForS and ForU) which were assigned monooxygenase roles. Through heterologous expression of PKS gene cassettes it was deduced that for the biosynthetic pathway to function correctly, and yield a pentangular backbone, all three cyclase genes (PdmDKL) plus the ABM domain monooxygenase PdmH must be co-expressed. In this pathway one oxidation reaction to form the quinone structure is required. These results led the authors to propose a model in which the two cyclases PdmKL and the monooxygenase PdmH form a multienzyme complex that engulfs the entire polyketide molecule during its assembly and work synergistically to ensure the correct reaction pathway occurs thereby minimising the production of shunt metabolites32. Similarly, formation of the unusual discoid metabolite resistomycin involves an extremely rare S-shaped folding pattern and requires the coordinated function, likely as a multienzyme complex, of core PKS proteins in addition to three distinct cyclase enzymes23. Moreover, heterologous reconstruction of the resistomycin pathway gave no products when the minimal PKS plus first cyclase were assembled23, a rare observation that is in keeping with our data showing the requirement of all the putative cyclases ForDLRU to produce any pathway derived metabolites, including shunts.", "Biosynthesis of the for BGC polyketide backbones does not require a monooxygenase. Consistent with this, deletion of forS does not abolish polyketide production, but instead affects pathway productivity and fidelity. Thus, based on our mutational data and the observations discussed above, we hypothesise that ABM family enzymes can act as monooxygenases and/or as ancillary proteins to tune, in some way, the PKS enzyme complex function, and therefore the biosynthetic pathway, during aromatic polyketide biosynthesis. Genes encoding these proteins occur commonly in PKS BGCs, and multiple paralogues are often present even when monooxygenase reactions are not required. It is noteworthy that several PKS cyclases occur as fusion proteins with an ABM domain, which can be located at either terminus. We speculate that these may represent examples of mature pathways where the chaperone-like function of the ABM family protein has become essential, leading to selective pressure for the encoding gene to become transcriptionally fused with other cyclase encoding genes."]
