["Discussion", "Composting is an effective way to remove ARGs. Some ARGs were significantly reduced during the thermophilic phase. This demonstrated that thermophilic phase of aerobic composting plays important roles in the removal of ARGs, which is consistent with the previous studies (Cui et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016, 2020). But some ARGs proliferated significantly in the late period of composting. Our results show that three tetracycline ARGs, three macrolide ARGs, and two sulfonamide ARGs and intI1 proliferated during the late composting period. It has been found that intI1 is closely related to macrolide ARGs and sulfonamide ARGs (Cheng et al., 2013; Su et al., 2015). So the proliferation of ARGs may be involved in the intI1-mediated HGT (Horizontal gene transfer) process.", "This study found that the addition of compound microbial inoculants could remove more ARGs and MGEs than natural composting. It could be that the compound microbial inoculants may kill the host bacteria carrying ARGs or high temperature inhibited HGT and eliminated some ARG hosts. However, composting process had a greater impact on ARGs than compound microbial inoculants. In this study, the composting process removes most of ARGs and MGEs by 22.8\u201399.7%, but compound microbial inoculants only increased the removal rate of part of ARGs by 3.7\u201323.8% in compost. This is consistent with the research results of Duan et al. (2019). And composting could not remove the ARGs completely. Some ARGs showed more proliferation in the AB group than in the CK group at the end of composting. This may be related to the change of the community structure of compost with the addition of compound microbial inoculants. Microorganisms carrying ARGs proliferate in large numbers in the maturation phase of composting. Some thermophilic bacteria may be the hosts of ARGs (Qian et al., 2016).", "Similar to Awasthi et al. (2019) and Wu et al. (2020), microbial community composition was the most direct factor affecting ARGs during composting. The richness and diversity of microbial communities in the composting process showed a downward trend in the maturation phase of composting, which also explained why most ARGs were reduced. First, the decrease of microbial density constrains the horizontal transfer process of ARGs (Ma et al., 2016). Second, due to the decrease of bacterial diversity, the host bacteria of ARGs were also reduced (Wang et al., 2017). At the same time, our research also indicated that the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased, but Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were increased in the maturation phase of compost. Duan et al. (2019) pointed out that Firmicutes are the main cause of ARGs changes during cattle manure composting. It has been reported that a decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes might explain the removal of most ARGs in compost (Huerta et al., 2013; Stegmann et al., 2015). Luo et al. (2017) showed that more than 50% of potential hosts of ARGs and MGEs belonged to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Zhang et al. (2020) indicated that Actinobacteria were the primary potential host of ARGs during commercial livestock manure composting. It follows that the proliferation of some ARGs may be related to the increase of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in maturation phase. The analysis at the genus level verifies the above conclusions. The abundance of Bacillus has decreased significantly, and it has been replaced by Sphingobacterium, Ochrobactrum, Cellvibrio, etc., in maturation phase, which are closely related to the proliferation of part ARGs. These bacteria belong to Bacteroidetes or Proteobacteria.", "The addition of compound microbial inoculants altered the microbial community in the compost. The Bacillus abundance was higher in the thermophilic phase than that of the control group. Bacillus is the most important component in the compound microbial inoculants. This also directly proves the effect and experimental reliability of adding compound microbial inoculants. At the same time, our research also indicated that the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria decreased, but Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were increased in the maturation phase of compost by adding compound microbial inoculants. Among them, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes change greatly. The succession of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes during the composting may be the potential driver for ARGs alteration. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in group AB was significantly lower than that in group CK. This also explains that the removal of ARGs in the AB group was higher than that in the CK group.", "Most environmental factors were significantly correlated with microbial community. Zhang et al. (2019) pointed out that environmental factors may not directly affect ARGs, but may indirectly affect the changes of ARGs by influencing microbial community. Duan et al. (2019) found B. subtilis at 0.5% could cause a change in compost\u2019s pH, thereby reducing ARGs during cattle manure composting. However, there was no significant difference in pH between the two groups in this study, which had little impact on the microbial community. We also found that there were large numbers of pathogens in the compost material by analyzed the changes of microbial communities at the genus level. Previous study has also shown that most of the host bacteria of ARGs are pathogens (Li et al., 2015). Our results showed that compost removes most of the pathogens and the addition of compound microbial inoculants helped with the removal of pathogens. Fan et al. (2020) also found the relative abundance of potential HPB decreased by 74.6 and 91.4% at the end of vacuum-type composting and positive-pressure composting, respectively. But a recent study shows that the total relative abundance of pathogens did not obviously decline with the composting progressing during commercial livestock manure composting (Zhang et al., 2020). This result is inconsistent with ours."]
