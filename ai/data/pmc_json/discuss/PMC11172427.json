["3. Discussion", "The research on rice resistance has been ongoing for a long time, and the research on rice resistance to insects has been a research hotspot recently [19,20]. The mechanism of rice resistance to insects is mostly explained at the molecular level, and a number of insect resistance genes have been obtained from rice, but the chemical basis of insect resistance in rice has still not been clearly explained, resulting in the functions of many resistance genes not being verified [21,22,23].", "In this paper, the metabolomics analysis of the T1 and T2 groups showed that the metabolic pathways with significantly up-regulated metabolites (p-value < 0.1) were linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. Studies have shown that the accumulation of plant fatty acids and their derivatives can effectively improve plant insect resistance, and especially the content of fatty acids with C18 chains can affect the signaling pathway mediated by salicylic acid and improve plant resistance to insect pests [24,25]. Fifteen fatty acids with C18 chains were enriched in the linoleic acid metabolic pathway and were all up-regulated, suggesting that there might be similar mechanisms of insect resistance in rice. The \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolic pathway was enriched with nine metabolites: jasmonic acid, 13S-hydroxy-9Z,11E,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-12-oxo-15(Z)-octadecenoic acid, 13(s)-hydroperoxy-(9z,11e,15z)-octadecatrienoic acid, methyl jasmonate, 9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, 2R-hydroxy-9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid, 17-hydroxylinolenic acid, 9-hydroxy-12-oxo-10(E), and 15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. The contents of these metabolites were significantly increased in group T1. The increased contents of jasmonic acid and its derivative methyl jasmonate indicated that the signal transduction pathway of JA synthesis was activated [26], and JA was the main defense hormone to activate plant resistance to herbivorous insects, suggesting that JA is also involved in regulating rice resistance to insects. Studies [27] have shown that the pathway of tryptophan metabolism can affect the defense response of rice against brown planthoppers. In this pathway, the OsTrp1 gene negatively regulates the salicylic acid (SA) pathway of rice. Deletion of the OsTrp1 gene reduces the survival rate of nymphs and improves insect resistance.", "The contents of alkaloids in rice induced by insect infestation were significantly up-regulated. Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing organic compounds that do not play a major role in plant growth and development, but many are toxic to herbivores. Alkaloids can produce deterring, toxic, and anti-feeding effects on herbivorous insects; change the physiological and biochemical processes in insects; and inhibit or disturb their metabolism, growth, and development [28,29]. Alkaloids can inhibit the synthetic repair of DNA as well as transcription and translation processes; can inhibit the biosynthesis of resistant proteins in insects, causing toxicity to them; and can also affect insects\u2019 nervous systems from the receptors to the neurotransmitters [28]. Phenolamine compounds 1\u20134, belonging to alkaloids, had significant anti-insect activity, which indicates that phenolamines have antifeedant or gastrotoxic activity against the insect. The anti-insect activity decreased from compounds 1 to 4 at the same concentration. Regarding their structures, the double bond in compounds 1\u20133 is trans, while in compound 4, it is cis, which suggests that the anti-insect activity of trans double bonds is better. Previous studies have shown that exogenous stress and insect harm can induce the synthesis of phenolamines. The exogenous application of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid can induce a chemical defense to protect rice plants from white-backed planthoppers. Meanwhile, 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid increases the levels of phenolamines and flavonoids [30]. The contents of phenolamines and phenolic acids in rice increased when the rice was damaged by brown planthoppers [31]. The content of phenolamines in compound 1 increased by eight times when the rice was infested by pests.", "The results of the detoxification enzyme activity related to insect metabolic resistance show that compound 1 had no significant effect on CarE and UGT activities but significantly inhibited GST activity, which was 0.59 times higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Studies have shown that GST is mainly involved in the second stage of pesticide metabolism, which can transport and dissolve the hydrolyzed products after a series of biochemical reactions in the first stage and catalyze the combination of reduced glutathione (GSH) with electrophilic toxic substances, increasing its water solubility, which is conducive to excretion. Because it also has peroxidase activity, it can play an important role in preventing oxidative stress caused by the ingestion of toxic substances [32]. By genome and transcriptome sequencing, 23 CsGSTs genes were identified in abamectin-treated Chilo suppressalis, and when the GSTs were inhibited, the susceptibility of the larvae to abamectin was increased, and the survival rate of the larvae was decreased [33]. Compound 1 may reduce the detoxification ability and inhibit larval weight gain by negatively regulating GSTs in a similar manner."]
