["Discussion", "Large-scale whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomic analysis is increasingly used for identifying targets for genome and metabolic engineering, studies of metabolic capabilities, pathogen phylogenomics and evolutionary studies. These studies are often complicated by the large number of sequences in the databases, database redundancy and the poor quality of some genome sequence data. The development of the high-quality, curated ActDES, reported here, enables phylum-wide taxonomic representation of the \nActinobacteria\n coupled with quality-filtered genome data and equivalent annotation for each CDS.", "The intended primary use of ActDES will be in the study of primary metabolism, but it is not limited. It can also inform the development and evolution of metabolism in strains that produce bioactive metabolites, given the high representation of genera renowned for their ability to produce natural products such as \nStreptomyces\n and \nMicromonospora\n. Due to a greater understanding of BGC evolution and genome organization in \nActinobacteria\n, it is becoming increasingly clear that genes whose functions are in primary metabolism may actually contribute directly to the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites and, hence, the identification of duplicates may indicate the presence of cryptic BGCs [6, 11] or, when associated with precursor biosynthetic genes, provide the raw material for the enzymes across multiple BGCs [32\u201334].", "ActDES may also find utility in evolutionary studies of expanded gene families across the actinobacterial phylum that contribute to virulence, such as the mce locus, which is known to facilitate host survival in mycobacteria [35], but also facilitates xenobiotic substrate uptake in \nRhodococcus\n [36], and enables root colonization and survival in \nStreptomyces\n [37]. With phylum-wide taxonomic representation of established actinobacterial animal and plant pathogens, the scope for evolutionary studies using these data is enormous.", "Usage notes", "The CVS files of each genome contain the rast annotation details in addition to the DNA and protein sequences for each annotated CDS (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167880). The genome list contains the rast ID (which is equivalent to the name of the .cvs file) along with the NCBI ID (sequence ID; Table S1) plus the species name, which are included in the dataset. Further details of annotating batches of genomes in rast can be found at https://github.com/nselem/myrast.", "The primary metabolism expansion tables (Table S2) are organized by metabolic pathway along the top row with the Enzyme Commission (EC) number and functional annotation, with the first column being the taxonomic assignment. The genus table shows the mean number of genes of the annotated function. Highlighted cells reflect gene expansion events, i.e. those genes that are present in a higher number than the overall mean across the database plus the standard deviation.", "It is suggested that the gene expansion table (Table S2) is searched in the first instance (either by species or genus of interest or by a specific enzymatic function). This can be carried out by a simple text search. This will then allow the identification of a query sequence from a species or gene of interest (either nucleotide or amino acid sequence), which can then be searched against the curated blast database allowing a detailed phylogenetic analysis of a gene/protein of interest by using standard alignment and tree building software tools. These data can also be used in detailed evolutionary analysis of selection, mutation rates, etc. We have set up a Jupyter Notebook through the MyBinder project (https://mybinder.org/) to enable ease of use of the code (https://github.com/nselem/ActDES) with a tutorial to enable use of the database (https://github.com/nselem/ActDES)."]
